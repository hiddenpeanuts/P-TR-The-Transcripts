1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,120
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,200
a podcast that is always recorded

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,540
with the three of us holding hands.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,020
I'm Scott Gardner, I'll give a little squeeze

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,060
next to me to Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,340
Yeah, we rotate who's in the middle

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,420
getting the most sweaty hand action.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,540
Well then sometimes it's triangles

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,940
so that we're all accounted for.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,780
Yes.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,160
But right now Mike's way down on the end from me.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,500
I can barely see him actually.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,980
Oh hey Mike, here I'll lean out.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,860
I'll squeeze Jason's hand hard

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,600
and it'll make him squeeze your hand hard

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,020
so you'll get like my vibrations, you'll get my energy.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,740
I'm still getting Mike's hand hard.

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,580
Yeah here, oh.

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,420
I appreciate that.

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,460
Oh I broke Jason's hand.

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,300
Oh, ah.

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,980
I think he broke mine.

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,280
I made of porcelain.

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,460
Jason is like, what Sam Jackson in Unbreakable?

26
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,500
Yes, that would be Sam, Mr. Glass.

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,780
Mr. Glass, yeah, there you go.

28
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,620
Oh he is unbreakable, that's what unbreakable is.

29
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,100
Well no, Bruce Willis is unbreakable.

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,940
Oh.

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,700
Sam Jackson is very, very breakable.

32
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,540
Oh I see.

33
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,380
Yeah, so.

34
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,260
Bruce Willis is unbreakable unless water comes into play.

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,460
Yes.

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,460
I just saw unbreakable like in the last couple years

37
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,300
for the first time.

38
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,120
Really?

39
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,960
Yeah.

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,800
Clearly I haven't.

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,180
Yeah, I know, I haven't seen the Glass,

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,620
is Glass the sequel, what's the sequel?

43
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,300
Glass is the sequel that brings together.

44
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,980
The McEvoy thing.

45
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,420
Them and what is the McEvoy thing?

46
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,460
I don't remember.

47
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,300
Yeah.

48
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,260
It was a secret, oh it's in the same universe.

49
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,980
It's as if like one of the Yellowstone characters

50
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,180
showed up on the end of Tulsa King.

51
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,100
That's what it was like for this, the Knight universe.

52
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,900
Have you now determined that Tulsa,

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,340
it doesn't seem like Tulsa King's in.

54
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,140
Well, I don't think it is.

55
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,580
But you're saying that if suddenly there was an episode

56
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,180
where Jack Yellowstone showed up,

57
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,800
which is what I assume Kevin Costner's character's name is,

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,220
it's not about the place, it's about the Yellowstone family.

59
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
Exactly, so because there's a prequel with Harrison Ford

60
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,980
that is in Yellowstone universe, I know that for a fact,

61
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,300
but it's not clear, they haven't said yes,

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,100
haven't said no, that Tulsa King exists in the same world.

63
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,260
Okay, now is there a dial of destiny anywhere in this?

64
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,140
A dial, I'm trying to think.

65
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,540
Let's just don't have a gold phone.

66
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,260
We don't want to date when this is recorded too much,

67
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,660
but we're all biting our tongues

68
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,580
from talking about cocaine bears and dials of destinies

69
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,420
and any other lackluster trailers

70
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,340
that have come out in the last 10 days.

71
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,900
No, it's not because when people are hearing this,

72
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,060
I believe if I'm not mistaken,

73
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,740
when people are hearing this is as the first podcast,

74
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,980
the ride of 2023, I think.

75
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,020
I think so. Unless we change it

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,060
and I take all this out.

77
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,860
Unless Bob J. Bick comes back

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,980
and then we have to bump this.

79
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,500
And do another, oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

80
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,380
that created a landslide for us, a little,

81
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,060
yeah, all the episodes slid, but so far,

82
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,300
currently this is slotted to at least be very early

83
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,780
in 2023 and I can't think of a better way

84
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,820
to kick off the year than by talking about

85
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,900
a heartwarming Disney art installation

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,220
featuring two entertainment icons.

87
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,180
And I'm referring of course to America's favorite

88
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,780
leading man and America's favorite sweetheart,

89
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,140
the posters at California Adventure.

90
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,420
And we will also talk about the partner statue,

91
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,900
which is the statue of Walt and Mickey holding hands

92
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,460
that's in Disneyland and many of the parks.

93
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,580
But I think this talk about the backside,

94
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,620
we've had so much stuff on our desk with Chay Pack

95
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,660
and Eiger and mostly Frank Marshall,

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,300
mainly it's been Frank Marshall material.

97
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,180
It's piling up all the Frank Marshall work.

98
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,420
But this, we haven't, I was like,

99
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,660
I need to take a second and digest this.

100
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,100
Do you know why I'm bringing this up?

101
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,740
I do, yes. I do.

102
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,940
The reveal. The solution.

103
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,580
Yeah, the problem has been solved.

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,380
It was figured out, this happened on Twitter

105
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,300
and people may have seen it on Twitter,

106
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,180
but if you didn't, let's explain this whole thing.

107
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,660
So a couple months ago, we did an episode

108
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,300
about these two posters outside of these bathrooms

109
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,700
at California Adventure that are oddly generic.

110
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,460
America's favorite leading man

111
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,500
is Hollywood's biggest star.

112
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,540
Similar statement about America's favorite sweetheart.

113
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,140
And it's a generic like 30s actor

114
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,260
and a generic 30s actress.

115
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,340
What is this?

116
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,700
We got nowhere closer, I would say,

117
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,820
in the episode to figuring it out.

118
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,500
And it's left us frustrated.

119
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,260
I know it's been keeping me up at night.

120
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,940
I assume that's what's keeping you up at night, Mike.

121
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,460
And not other things in your life.

122
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,580
Baby sleep in 14 hours while I'm awake.

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,820
Trying to crack the code, trying to figure it out.

124
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,060
You got absurdly lucky with the baby and yet.

125
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,860
Baby sleeps 14 hours right out of the womb.

126
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,180
No problems.

127
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,380
Unbroken.

128
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,020
But you can't, you're tossing and turning.

129
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,620
And this was clearly happening

130
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,100
to some listeners of the show as well

131
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,380
because it was clearly bugging a Twitter user,

132
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,260
traveling salesman at Open Mother's Mail.

133
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,180
And he clearly thinking about it.

134
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,700
And so the question is posed to two Imagineers

135
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,180
who are active on Twitter.

136
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,260
Lively Land, Kevin Lively, I believe,

137
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,660
and Tom Morris, one of my favorite Imagineers.

138
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,500
I love Tom Morris.

139
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,700
Yeah, the guy is, worked on,

140
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,500
designed the Disney Paris Castle.

141
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I mean, a true great.

142
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,940
And now he is having to put some thought

143
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,620
into what the hell are these posters.

144
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,020
The replies both were very funny.

145
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,860
Yes, yeah, yeah.

146
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,100
I don't know if I have all of them,

147
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,340
but I know one was like,

148
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,180
let's get it.

149
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,820
So the prompt was to the two of them,

150
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,060
I know both of you had nothing to do with these posters,

151
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,140
but what the hell is any of this weirdness

152
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,900
supposed to convey or communicate exactly?

153
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,900
So yeah, I don't have everyone's response.

154
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,060
Oh, I might not have their responses at all,

155
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,700
but both of them just like baffled.

156
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,060
Both of them like, I have no idea what that is.

157
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,620
Yes, yeah, and some notes.

158
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,580
We got a window into like Tom Morris' process,

159
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,140
like what he would say about it

160
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,020
if these posters came across his desk.

161
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,540
And then, so still confusion, nobody helped,

162
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,780
but then Twitter user Haston,

163
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,900
Haston, Haston, at Haston,

164
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,420
says this wasn't exactly an opening day thing.

165
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,860
There's a clue, first of all,

166
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,980
I think we said, we assume this has been there

167
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,260
since opening day, but apparently not.

168
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,380
These posters were put up in 2005,

169
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,780
but they were different.

170
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,180
They were part of, basically,

171
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,460
I don't know in what order to say this.

172
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
There, I'll just jump to the interesting part.

173
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,340
They're toilet paper ads.

174
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,180
Oh yeah.

175
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,780
It was a 10-year promotional deal with Quilted Northern.

176
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,020
Yes, and the bigger,

177
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,460
as we like to know our full partnerships and clunky names,

178
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,180
this was a partnership with Georgia Pacific,

179
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,100
the corporation that makes many fine paper products

180
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,140
and bath products, and this deal struck in 2005

181
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,260
made it so that for the next 10 years,

182
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,500
the Disney parks would be using brawny paper towels

183
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,180
and sponsoring the Lights, Motors, Action, Extreme Stunt Show

184
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,340
and that Dixie tableware would be

185
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,380
at Mickey's Backyard Barbecue Pavilion

186
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,140
and Chip and Dale's Campfire Singalong at Fort Wilderness.

187
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,500
I was, I needed to, I didn't realize how many proper names

188
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,860
I'd be saying all in one run.

189
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,780
Okay, but also none of that matters.

190
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,780
General napkins, cups, plates, and bowls

191
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,380
will all be coming from the fine people at Georgia Pacific

192
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,500
and especially the excellent toilet paper

193
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,420
produced by Quilted Northern.

194
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,180
So these posters were a little different

195
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,580
and as soon as I saw the original ones,

196
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,780
it was like something, like a Manchurian candidate prompt

197
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,900
was unlocked in my head where it's like, I have seen that.

198
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,740
Yeah.

199
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,860
That looks familiar now.

200
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,020
I understand.

201
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,700
It's all coming back now.

202
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,780
I had it on my laptop.

203
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,940
I was explaining all this to Aaron

204
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,980
and demonstrating how like, it probably just like,

205
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,780
they passed by me peripherally, blurry in my head,

206
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,140
just like, foop, like that's as much as,

207
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,980
I like, I maybe saw it in the corner of my eye

208
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,900
10 years ago or 15 years ago

209
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,580
and then I did it again seven years ago

210
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,620
until the fateful day that we talked about it for an hour

211
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,620
and made no particular progress.

212
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,100
But yes, I know what you mean.

213
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,580
It does feel familiar.

214
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,860
So now let's all look at what it actually was

215
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,020
in the beginning.

216
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,660
It's the same boring guy, the same 30s actor guy

217
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,260
who looks like he'd be in like a jet fighter movies.

218
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,100
That's right.

219
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,780
World War I ace.

220
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,900
That's right.

221
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,300
And now the poster says,

222
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,660
America's favorite leading man is,

223
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,180
not Hollywood's biggest star.

224
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,140
He is strong yet gentle.

225
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,980
And then below that more text, which was cut,

226
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,420
quilted Northern bath tissue.

227
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,940
It's Hollywood's leading role.

228
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
So that's a clever thing.

229
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,820
That is something. That's an advertisement.

230
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,620
Yes. Yes.

231
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,580
It serves a function, which the others did not.

232
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,060
It was like absolutely impenetrable.

233
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,140
Why would they go out of their way to make the statement

234
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,380
that America's favorite leading man

235
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,660
is Hollywood's biggest star?

236
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,180
That means nothing.

237
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,020
Yeah, no, I know what it means.

238
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,180
As much as this is solving a problem,

239
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,980
I honestly have a couple more questions

240
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,340
that I don't think we still.

241
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,180
Absolutely.

242
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,580
Well, here, let me read the other one

243
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,860
and then for sure there are more questions.

244
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,220
Oh, and also both are still,

245
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,180
it's still a fictional magazine called Movie News.

246
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,580
And then you go to the other one,

247
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,780
America's Favorite Sweetheart.

248
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,900
And in both cases, they look mostly the same,

249
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,300
but a little different.

250
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,500
They're a little bigger.

251
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,340
Yeah.

252
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,540
Like facial features, inexplicably like 5% different.

253
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,380
So that's an unsettling thing about it right there.

254
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,540
Because they had to re-photoshop the whole thing.

255
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,340
It's not like they just placed something over the words.

256
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,180
No, certainly not.

257
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,220
No, a new image was printed.

258
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,060
But it does feel like they copied the same file

259
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,220
and just rearranged the elements.

260
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,620
And Movie News stayed the same.

261
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,020
America's Favorite Sweetheart is stayed the same.

262
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,500
Then it becomes clean and fresh.

263
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,180
Quilted Northern America's or Hollywood's leading role.

264
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,060
So these two, in theory, massive fictional movie stars,

265
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,420
their qualities just so happen to be like the toilet paper

266
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,940
you use on your bottom.

267
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,780
Yeah, so.

268
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,900
This woman is like something you rub your butt with.

269
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,460
Yes. Yes.

270
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,180
They're explaining that nice sentiment.

271
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,220
That Clark Gable man is strong.

272
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,620
And what's it strong in?

273
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,500
He is something yet, strong yet gentle.

274
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,780
Strong and gentle.

275
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,420
She is clean and fresh.

276
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,420
Clean and fresh.

277
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,020
Okay, good, you want that if you're wiping urine

278
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,740
on your urethra, you know, and your asshole.

279
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,540
Wait, you want to do what?

280
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,860
Your wife is wiping urine after,

281
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,860
if you are a lady using the bathroom.

282
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,340
You want the, yeah.

283
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,260
Are you wiping your urethra when you go to the bathroom?

284
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,820
Women, when they use the bathroom,

285
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,460
will use it both ways.

286
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,140
I was trying to say this in the most clinical way possible.

287
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,300
You mean peeing and pooping?

288
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,140
Yes.

289
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,780
As opposed to us, typically.

290
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,340
You mean in one position, we have two positions.

291
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,180
Is that what you're saying?

292
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,020
Yeah.

293
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,420
If we, and if even if we,

294
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,500
even if we sit and go to the bathroom,

295
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,260
we don't wipe our urethra.

296
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,220
Right. Yeah.

297
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,420
But we wipe the, well the end of it, right?

298
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,260
The end of it?

299
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,060
The urethra's?

300
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,380
I don't know.

301
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,100
You don't think around in there?

302
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,940
What?

303
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,340
In your pee?

304
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,180
No, what are we discovering right now?

305
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,020
This is taking a turn.

306
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,860
No, no.

307
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,900
This is TMI alert.

308
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,700
No, I'm just saying like,

309
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,860
you're saying cause it's more exposed,

310
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,020
so you're getting in there.

311
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,980
That's what you're saying.

312
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,100
The urethra.

313
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,340
The women wipe everything down there with toilet paper.

314
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,140
Yeah, they're wiping no matter what they're doing down there.

315
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,300
I see. Okay.

316
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,140
I think I see what you're saying now.

317
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm wiping my penis.

318
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,820
Sorry listener.

319
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,660
Okay.

320
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,100
Do you differ here?

321
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,260
I'm a little confused.

322
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm confused again.

323
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,420
I got confused somewhere

324
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,460
and I don't know where I got confused.

325
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,220
I don't want to rehash this cause I'm-

326
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,340
Welcome to 2023 everyone.

327
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,620
I feel so confused right now.

328
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,700
I know what the, I know the basics of it.

329
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,300
Do you wipe your penis with toilet paper?

330
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,420
Sometimes.

331
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,380
Really?

332
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,220
Well, yeah, sometimes.

333
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,220
Well, if it's a little messy,

334
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,500
like if it's a little-

335
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,820
I'm saying yes, the shake.

336
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,020
Okay, now we're on the same page again.

337
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,860
If we're shaking,

338
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,220
or if it's a little drippy on the thing,

339
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,340
I'm just trying to be considerate.

340
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,180
If you're in a urinal,

341
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,580
of course there's no toilet paper there.

342
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,420
You gotta shake.

343
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,380
You're not gonna go grab,

344
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,980
you're not gonna go into a booth.

345
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,820
You gotta shake.

346
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,020
Toilet paper.

347
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,700
Rarely, yes, are you using that,

348
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,820
but once in a while, I suppose,

349
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,500
you go, well, I gotta, maybe there's something.

350
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,780
I don't, I don't.

351
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,620
I truly don't.

352
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,580
Am I in the extreme minority here?

353
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,100
This is maybe in the 1% time,

354
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,500
but I think there's maybe been a time or two.

355
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,340
Okay.

356
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,460
So I see, okay, I understand what we're talking about now.

357
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,540
Yeah, okay, okay.

358
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,700
Well, that adds to confusion if sometimes, all right.

359
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,420
Yeah, I think you rethrew us all for a loop.

360
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,980
I think you rethrew it really confused me.

361
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,020
Okay.

362
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,060
It's not your fault.

363
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,380
I am not mad.

364
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,020
Now I know all of your peeing habits,

365
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,820
which is nice to know that you all keep it clean and fresh,

366
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,380
being that we're all holding each other's hands

367
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,860
while recording this episode.

368
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,300
Yes.

369
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,780
Look, whether pissing or shitting,

370
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,700
Quilted Northern is there.

371
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,780
It's there for you.

372
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,620
It's there for you.

373
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,700
It's a Hollywood classic.

374
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,540
From now on, and I don't want to.

375
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,500
If you have to spit your gum out,

376
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,180
so that's another use case.

377
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,860
See now, okay, now I'm realizing now,

378
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,700
if you're listening to me, the whole chunk we just did,

379
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,060
you're thinking that maybe I have like little squares

380
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,860
of toilet paper that I carry with me everywhere I go,

381
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,980
and I use that.

382
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,820
I don't think there's a go.

383
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,860
I don't know that anyone, yeah, was thinking that.

384
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,180
Maybe some, or maybe the 1%, 1% of people thought that.

385
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,100
Okay, well.

386
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,780
I'm no freak.

387
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,820
I'm no pee freak.

388
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,660
Okay, I'm not a pee freak.

389
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
And Mike does not.

390
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
I just want to lay it out there.

391
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,060
I want to be clear about my friend.

392
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,100
He does not take squares of toilet paper,

393
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,580
clean pee off with them,

394
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,380
but then keep the pee squares

395
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,700
and use them for anything else later.

396
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,780
No, I don't do it.

397
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,540
I'm not that guy.

398
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,900
I don't think I'm that guy.

399
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,820
Yes, okay.

400
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,260
I think the thing is,

401
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,540
whether you're pissing and shitting,

402
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,100
and however you identify biologically or.

403
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,940
Everything's great.

404
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,780
Everything's great.

405
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,580
Whatever you want to do, they're great.

406
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,380
Quilted Northern is there for you.

407
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,860
And the toilet paper is not going to rip when you're wiping.

408
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,700
It's not going to rip.

409
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,140
It's strong enough to get all the pieces.

410
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,300
Like America's favorite leading man would be.

411
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,580
We talked about what that character requires,

412
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,300
and it requires some dashing and machismo, you think,

413
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,260
but also soft.

414
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,860
It actually kind of breaks down a lot of what we got into

415
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,940
in that episode of what are the,

416
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,540
like kind of the duality that a leading man needs to have.

417
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,340
But sort of the bigger question,

418
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,140
the answers we got, I feel like,

419
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,820
raised more questions than answers.

420
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,020
Because then it led to, okay,

421
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,820
so this is generation two of these posters.

422
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,300
And yeah, they copied the file.

423
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,900
They removed some layers in a Photoshop file

424
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,140
and shrunk some proportions.

425
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,960
And they're like,

426
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,120
we got to take the branding out,

427
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
but we got to have these folks back.

428
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,640
They got to go back in the case.

429
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,200
It can't be a blank wall.

430
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,440
People are going to, at this point,

431
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,240
expect to see posters after they leave the bathroom.

432
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,120
So upset, yeah.

433
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,640
And they couldn't just be posters for the rides

434
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,200
or something, or like Disney movies.

435
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,880
Yeah, for like, yeah, Disney movies from the 30s,

436
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,880
the era you're generally trying to convey.

437
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,840
They absolutely not.

438
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,920
It's got to be these two.

439
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,560
Has to be these two.

440
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,280
People, it's like, there's stuff you can't get rid of.

441
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,120
You can't get rid of a pirate.

442
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,960
You can't get rid of a haunted mansion.

443
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,280
You can't get rid of the toilet paper posters.

444
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,680
At this point, people are in love

445
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,560
with the toilet paper people.

446
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,400
Yes.

447
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,480
They got to be there.

448
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,080
And we need to like give someone a new task to do.

449
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,000
They have to go open up an old Photoshop file,

450
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,840
make something that's technically new, but mostly not.

451
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,520
We need to reprint that and then put it in the parks

452
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,640
in one of the most biggest attended theme parks

453
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,720
in the world.

454
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,680
These have to be seen by people.

455
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,400
And no jokes, no fun jokes about it.

456
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Because it's not a reference anymore to the toilet.

457
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,120
Like it's not.

458
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
You wouldn't read that.

459
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,480
We're no longer playing with the joke

460
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,480
of comparing an iconic actor to an iconic toilet paper.

461
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,320
Right.

462
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,240
Now we're just comparing an actor to a different way

463
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,160
you would explain what an actor.

464
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,560
Right.

465
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,120
Now it's just, there used to be kind of like a little,

466
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,320
an A to B and now it's like A to B kind of.

467
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,160
Right.

468
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
No, it's not B.

469
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,640
It's A to A-ish.

470
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,760
That's what I'm trying to say.

471
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,960
Like what didn't, like, did anyone try it?

472
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,520
Like America's favorite leading man,

473
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,640
he makes all the ladies flush with color.

474
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,680
Like there's gotta be a toilet joke.

475
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,960
To make it still bathroom.

476
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,800
It's still bathroom.

477
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,160
Cause they're both there when you come out of the bathroom.

478
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
Cleans up at the box office.

479
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
Cleans up, perfect.

480
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,800
Yeah.

481
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,760
Jason, you got one?

482
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
His new movie.

483
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,400
He wipes the competition, wipes away the competition.

484
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
That's a good idea.

485
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,760
His new movie, they dumped it on home video.

486
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,880
Like anything.

487
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,920
Home video would be a blessing nowadays.

488
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,960
Sure.

489
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah, you're lucky if it comes out at all.

490
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
He wipes his urethra when he's done

491
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,680
to make sure he's extra clean.

492
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,440
So your preference would have been that it stays bathroom

493
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,280
affiliated.

494
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,080
Well, I just don't know, it's nothing.

495
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,200
So why wouldn't someone take a stab at

496
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,400
making it related to the area?

497
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,480
Just put like a Snow White poster

498
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,520
and a Steambot Willie or Mickey's trailer.

499
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,160
Like a cartoon poster and a movie poster, you know?

500
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,200
Yeah, you could do that.

501
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,320
And then you could take those posters

502
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,280
and make them toilet themed.

503
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,040
You're still, you got caught on,

504
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,480
isn't there the possibility though

505
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,320
that you kind of forget why it's there

506
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,040
and that you're looking at a thing

507
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,280
and like, why is it about toilets?

508
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,240
Even if you just went to the bathroom,

509
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,600
because you've left the bathroom.

510
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,000
That's the confusing thing about these.

511
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,320
They aren't in the bathroom.

512
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,000
If it's in the bathroom, for sure make it bathroom related,

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,360
but it's not.

514
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,640
So you maybe, you're done.

515
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,800
You're not thinking about the bathroom anymore.

516
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
You have to crane your neck to look at them

517
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,480
if you're going in, if you're seeing them when you go in.

518
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,000
When you're coming out, you're looking right at them.

519
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,120
And maybe by that point,

520
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,640
you're ready to be done with bathroom business.

521
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,320
I don't want to think about the bathroom anymore.

522
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,720
Just spent a while in there

523
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,120
cleaning up my urethra with squares.

524
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,960
As if I had like, as if I cut myself shaving.

525
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,760
I am dab dab dab.

526
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,920
Cleaning my urine with little squares.

527
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
But here, here's what I would argue

528
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,720
is that since that whole area is a little bit blocked off,

529
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,760
obviously that the famous wall is on the other side.

530
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,000
So- Frank Lloyd Wright wall.

531
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Frank Lloyd Wright wall, who cares?

532
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,080
Toilet wall.

533
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Toilet wall is on the other side, is what we like.

534
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,000
So toilet wall is there and it's all blocked off.

535
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,280
So that's, in my mind, that's sort of the New Orleans square

536
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,360
of the pirate's ride, is that little hallway.

537
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,480
That's the, this is the bathroom area.

538
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,000
So this whole area should be themed

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,480
within the bathroom universe.

540
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,800
It needs to be supporting the big attraction,

541
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,280
which is the bathroom.

542
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,520
Right, these two most need to support the big attraction,

543
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,600
which is the toilet.

544
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm glad we're examining this

545
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,320
on the Partners statue episode.

546
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
This might be its own episode, right?

547
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,800
A topic reading about, I was like,

548
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,200
well, there's a lot more here than I thought there would be.

549
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,800
So we still have to do a long episode.

550
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,760
Okay, well, let's look, we, there's maybe not

551
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,640
much more to say, but- There are multiple generations

552
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,440
with the phrase partners involved

553
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,800
that I'm sure we'll get into in terms of lithographs

554
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,760
and statues. We gotta get to all the partners then.

555
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,560
But for now,

556
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,320
what's the conclusion?

557
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,480
I mean, we are, it is, it's like it closed one chapter,

558
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,560
but the answer's more confusing than this.

559
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,240
Which is kind of what, that was where the listeners

560
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,880
were left, which was like, well, somebody said,

561
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,080
I know nothing about these toilet paper ads.

562
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,040
Were they in Hollywood Pictures' backlot?

563
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,440
Long time Imagineer, Tom Morris, apparently.

564
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,280
And then later, then there's, then Kevin Lively jumps in

565
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,600
and says, he grew a mustache.

566
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,440
Tom Morris says, and ditched the lipstick.

567
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,800
And that's accurate.

568
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,160
In the original one, he, the actor does not have

569
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,720
a little thin mustache.

570
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
He has bright red lips, but no mustache.

571
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,800
So in addition to taking the toilet paper branding out,

572
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,040
they also kind of changed the physical appearance

573
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,880
of the guy, maybe darkened the hair.

574
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,720
What is this?

575
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,400
What was this assignment?

576
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,040
Make sure you put on a mustache.

577
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,880
And wait, okay, actually Quilted Northern technically

578
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,120
owns the guy if he's got big swollen lips.

579
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,360
Oh, maybe that is what it is.

580
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,000
But if you take the lips down a notch

581
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,880
and give him a mustache, then he's ours.

582
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,720
Then Disney owns it.

583
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,120
It's Quilted Northern IP.

584
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,880
I guess the question is, how far back

585
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,880
do Disney Imagineering Outlook email archives go?

586
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,160
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,880
And if you, well, maybe we gotta,

588
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,560
because there's one person who knows.

589
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,520
One person did this assignment.

590
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,360
Yeah.

591
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,920
They can answer what the assignment was

592
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,800
and how long it took them

593
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,640
and how long they were asked for it to,

594
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,760
like, because probably it was like,

595
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,040
you got 45 minutes, go.

596
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,400
Yeah, yeah, I mean, probably.

597
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,960
What would be the other, yeah.

598
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,400
Because you would, anybody in Imagineer,

599
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,040
you think it's a dream factory.

600
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,400
We're here to be creative.

601
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
You would think they would be like,

602
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,760
we'd love to spend a day trying to figure out

603
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,720
some fun new ways to present these characters.

604
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,560
You would think. We would.

605
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,280
Look how much time we've willingly devoted.

606
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,120
We've done a lot.

607
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,600
We've devoted barely paid to talking about them.

608
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,440
Right.

609
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,680
If we could kind of like take this franchise on

610
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,400
as our own, the care that we would put into it.

611
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,560
This is the stuff they could farm out in Imagineering.

612
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,400
Yeah.

613
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Poster work, punch up, taking the branding off

614
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,120
of certain advertisements and making them now

615
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,680
not specific to the company that started there.

616
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,800
Let's start on the poster.

617
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Make somebody do it who doesn't understand the history here

618
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,520
or you can have us do it.

619
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,160
We'll be nerding out as if we're getting to work on

620
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,680
the dial of destiny.

621
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,520
Right.

622
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,440
We'd be on that set, who cares?

623
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,760
What's this hat?

624
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm gonna put my coffee on it.

625
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,560
We have no care for that mythology.

626
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,160
But these guys and this mustache and this toilet paper,

627
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
we're steeped in this.

628
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,120
The Toilet E ticket needs support

629
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,640
and needs theming around it.

630
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,480
And we're also the only people who understand that.

631
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,760
Yeah.

632
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,240
If anyone is left who listens and works

633
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,120
for the Walt Disney Company or subsidiaries,

634
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm telling you, you could go in the D23 offices

635
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,600
and they're like, we need some Easter egg merch.

636
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,320
We need some real deep pulls.

637
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,640
We've given you, we've unearthed Leonardo Columbus.

638
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,120
We've unworthed the toilet duo.

639
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,960
That's right.

640
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,760
We are like, we are voluntary scrapers

641
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,360
of the bottom of their barrel.

642
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,200
That's right.

643
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
That's what we do.

644
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,320
We scrape it.

645
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,960
We're in there and no one asked us to get in there.

646
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,120
But we're finding IP and this is what we want

647
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,960
is to find every, they all, everybody wants

648
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,040
to find every scrap of IP.

649
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,440
We're doing it left and right.

650
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,280
Yeah.

651
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,120
And we deserve a little thanks.

652
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,200
The recent architects of the recent time, you know?

653
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,920
This isn't even, this is,

654
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,200
their big promotion this year

655
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
is that the 100th anniversary of the company.

656
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
God knows what's in there, those files.

657
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,560
Going back to 20s and 30s, the 1920s and 30s.

658
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,400
Yeah.

659
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,280
And we, so we get into the archives and we're like,

660
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,000
skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, where's oh five?

661
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,080
Great.

662
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,880
Wow.

663
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,880
The original, the toilet paper branded actor and actress.

664
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,280
In the first draft of Bolt, he took a big shit

665
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,800
and they eventually used that big shit in Pinocchio.

666
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,080
It's the same shit?

667
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,200
It's the same shit.

668
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,720
They save like, you know, Robert,

669
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,720
we already have a huge library of digital shit assets.

670
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,360
We have, we're gonna have to render it.

671
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,520
We're gonna have to run the Unreal Engine on it a few times.

672
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,800
It's very rudimentary.

673
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,520
It was much more simple in Bolt's era,

674
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,480
but if you want the shape and consistency of that shit,

675
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,200
we're happy to give that to you.

676
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,720
We have the license for a freeware program

677
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,920
that hasn't been supported since 2007.

678
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,680
So as long as this one computer can do it,

679
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,400
it can get us to a point,

680
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,280
then then we can import it into modern premiere.

681
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,840
And if you wanna do a scene, just the spitballing,

682
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,280
if you wanna do a scene where they go up

683
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,000
Monstro's urethra,

684
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,880
maybe that's something we could do this time.

685
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
We could love.

686
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,040
And then they block the hole

687
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,000
to make sure nobody else can get in there

688
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,440
with a huge toilet paper square.

689
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,160
And you, and there needs to be two toothbrushes

690
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,080
in the morning, one for his teeth

691
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,040
and one for his urethra to clean it.

692
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,440
Well, that's what I, yeah, I don't use toilet paper

693
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,320
because I brush my urethra every morning.

694
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,160
Don't you guys?

695
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, no, I brush my urethra too.

696
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,640
I of course do that as well.

697
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,000
Swirls, don't just up and down.

698
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,320
You count one, two, three on each side,

699
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,560
on each side, each corner.

700
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,800
I use one of those children's toothbrushes

701
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,520
that plays a song.

702
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,240
So it tells you how long.

703
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,080
Oh yeah, that's smart.

704
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,920
Happy birthday.

705
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,640
I hear happy birthday every morning.

706
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,800
You feel like it's your birthday

707
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
having a sparkling clean urethra.

708
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,440
Give ourselves a catheter every morning.

709
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,440
Well, the partner statue.

710
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,280
The partner statue.

711
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,840
The statue of Walt and Mickey standing next to you.

712
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,080
This is how you thought this one would go, right?

713
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,480
Yeah, hey, you know, when you go into Disneyland especially

714
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,360
or the Magic Kingdom or other places we'll get into it,

715
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,520
the right in the hub, in the centerpiece of it all

716
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,440
is a beautiful statue of Walt and Mickey holding hands

717
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,160
and Walt looking upon his creation.

718
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,800
And we've talked now, nobody's thinking about urethras now.

719
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,800
We've talked our way into a classic, classy element

720
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,400
of the parks that's been there in Disneyland since 1993.

721
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Yeah, how about it?

722
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
And then that's the evidence

723
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
and that's all we have to say about it.

724
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,160
We're all dying to get,

725
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,800
well what do we have to say about the partner statue?

726
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,440
It's one of those things where I knew it was newer

727
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,080
but I really was like, oh yeah, it's like new.

728
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,200
That's weird, right?

729
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,400
Yeah, I for sure remember Disneyland before it and after.

730
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,120
That's like right when I was,

731
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
that's like middle of childhood

732
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,160
and me being like a Walt nerd,

733
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,160
me being a kid who did a voluntary Walt speech

734
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,760
at an assembly for no reason,

735
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
I was like, wow, this is great.

736
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,760
They are finally giving Walt the tribute.

737
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,000
Wow, so you remember being there when it happened

738
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,440
and you were like, finally.

739
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,200
Wow, interesting.

740
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,120
I thought it was great.

741
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,600
I thought Walt was cool.

742
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,440
Sure.

743
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,720
It was great to honor the legacy

744
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,680
and to give us an exact height referential

745
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,680
of how tall they think Mickey is as opposed to Walt.

746
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,520
Yes.

747
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,360
It ends up being confusing because if you're a child,

748
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,640
perhaps you have met Mickey Mouse mere feet away

749
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,960
earlier in the street that you're walking up

750
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,120
and Mickey was as tall as your mom.

751
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,800
Now you're all the way down the street

752
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,800
and here is somebody taller than your dad

753
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,240
and Mickey is down at his knees.

754
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Right, it is a very good point.

755
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,560
And it is something, you think there was ever

756
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,760
a consideration that they would have Walt

757
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,920
like arm in arm with a full-sized

758
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Mickey mascot performer sized thing.

759
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,400
I bet, I bet they talked about it.

760
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,240
Yeah. Yeah.

761
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,040
I guess it's like, where did they leave this with Walt?

762
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,200
I guess, are there things where,

763
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,160
yeah, wait, there is.

764
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,320
You know what there is?

765
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,400
There's that photo that's like a silhouette

766
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,280
where it was taken in Walt's home.

767
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,480
I want to say in less please, where there's,

768
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,080
he is like, he's either shaking hands with Mickey

769
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,360
or Mickey's like in the hallway.

770
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,240
You know that picture I'm talking about?

771
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,080
Vaguely.

772
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,040
It's like used on a lot of book covers.

773
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,560
Sure, exactly.

774
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,320
And it's like the suit Mickey, it's a, it's big Mickey.

775
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,000
No, no, it's a, it is a shadow Mickey who is smaller.

776
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,760
So I think the mythology, I think the mythology

777
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,160
when Walt was alive was Mickey's a little guy

778
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,520
or Mickey's a little guy in that thing

779
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,320
where Michael Eisner meets Mickey

780
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,560
and they have the watches of each other.

781
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,400
Oh, right. Yes.

782
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,320
Yeah. I mean, that makes sense.

783
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,280
Like he was like, the original Mickey was tiny.

784
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
It was a cartoon.

785
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,800
I understand why they would do it, but the only reason,

786
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,040
yes, is what you're saying is like,

787
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,560
Mickey then doesn't scale correctly in Disneyland

788
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,880
and he doesn't look like the other versions of Mickey.

789
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,680
The reference point that I saw that they used

790
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,840
was the one time an animated Mickey

791
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,840
shook a real person's hand, which is the moment in Fantasia.

792
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,840
Yes.

793
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,240
Oh yeah, they use it as a, as a like a, yeah.

794
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,160
As a template for how it would look

795
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,520
and the scale of which I think they would play

796
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,360
off each other.

797
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,600
Yeah. They also, it was apparently Walt's wishes

798
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,680
to not make a statue of him anywhere.

799
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,880
When he was alive, he's like, do not make a statue of me.

800
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,880
And eventually they had to ask for permission

801
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,760
to do the statue.

802
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,800
They waited decades for Walt's ghost

803
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,600
to really go elsewhere before angering him essentially.

804
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,360
Cause he'd been dead for so many years before this,

805
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,600
they started putting these around.

806
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,440
Yeah. Make sure he's fully dissipated

807
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,080
or at least if the ghost is still around

808
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,080
that he's, there's a number of places he wants to be.

809
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,360
Cause they've, they've opened Disney World by now

810
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,760
and maybe Tokyo, Disney, let's say,

811
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,760
and, and, and, and, and Euro and Paris.

812
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,920
So Walt does, Walt's ghost is like split.

813
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,520
His attention is split.

814
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,680
So they can get away from him for a minute

815
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,000
and make a statue of him.

816
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,440
Okay. Cause he would have started like haunting

817
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,880
the different, the builders.

818
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,720
Yes.

819
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,320
Of the statue at home and stuff.

820
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,400
You went against my wishes.

821
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,600
Cutting brake lines on cars and stuff.

822
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,360
It would have been a real disaster.

823
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,040
He could have gotten inside the statue

824
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,880
and then did like it shakes off.

825
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,320
He could still do that.

826
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,840
Yeah. That's still possible.

827
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,040
That would be the day.

828
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,360
Statue comes to life.

829
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,200
Oh man.

830
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,960
People gathered around it, taking pictures

831
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,720
and all of a sudden crack, crack, crunch.

832
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,320
And then he takes the Mickey that is not alive

833
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,600
cause Mickey's not dead.

834
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,560
So Mickey can't haunt the statue.

835
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,400
Right.

836
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,000
So that's just a big hunk of bronze.

837
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,840
Oh man.

838
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,640
So he just takes that and like whips it into a crowd.

839
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,240
Everybody goes running, streaming.

840
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,080
Oh my God.

841
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,160
You know what the first thing he does is he goes

842
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,760
to galaxy's edge and gets rid of that alcohol

843
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,080
in the cantina.

844
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,920
What?

845
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,000
I assume he sounds deeper because he's.

846
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
Yeah. Yeah.

847
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,680
He sounds like a monster.

848
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,520
He sounds like a holo.

849
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Oh don't fly patients.

850
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,200
No.

851
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,040
And then he's strong.

852
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,880
He's made of bronze.

853
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,120
He cracks all those big jugs.

854
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,960
Right.

855
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,640
Like socks that space frog right in the face.

856
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,000
Well he gets rid of it by drinking it all.

857
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,560
Only for me.

858
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,000
So now you have a super drunk.

859
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,840
Paul bronze ghost.

860
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,760
So do I.

861
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,720
I need to sleep in the firehouse.

862
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
You left a light on right.

863
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,360
The light gives me power.

864
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,000
I guess my, the thing that I didn't know about this

865
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and a lot of this is coming from a piece on all ears.net

866
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,160
from Disney historian, Jim Corcus.

867
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,200
Did you guys read this?

868
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,040
I did.

869
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,680
I think so.

870
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,280
Okay. So Michael Eisner takes over

871
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,080
and he starts doing a lot of short run events

872
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,480
to try to juice attendance.

873
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,720
A lot of which involves putting big stuff in the hub.

874
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,040
In front of the castle.

875
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,880
Yes.

876
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,520
Cause it's a pretty big open area saying worse.

877
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,080
You know, if you're doing something temporary

878
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,920
it grabs your attention.

879
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,160
So there was a Ferris wheel, I believe

880
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,520
when they did a state fair.

881
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,200
Yeah. We had a episode about that.

882
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,040
What else?

883
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,000
There was like maybe like circus stuff.

884
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,840
Circus.

885
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
Yeah.

886
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
Episode bank that episode.

887
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Yeah.

888
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,160
So yeah, big splashy things.

889
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,440
But then it became that,

890
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,080
was it that there are factions who can't agree on,

891
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,360
do we, I don't want stuff in front of the castle.

892
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,080
That diminishes it.

893
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,040
Or is that, oh, does there also just kind of a rise of

894
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,840
we want to make sure people remember Walt Disney.

895
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,000
But even that is like a business decision.

896
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Even that's them going.

897
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,560
Yeah, it's a character we own.

898
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Yeah. Yeah.

899
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,480
And we need to get him out there.

900
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,520
That costs us no money.

901
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,360
Right.

902
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,040
Specifically he pointed to Marty Sklar and John Hench

903
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,120
going like, well, we don't want all this stuff in the hub.

904
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,640
But also we think it's been, it's been two years

905
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,320
or two decades plus since Walt's death.

906
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,600
Two decades.

907
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,680
And we think we've, the people have forgotten his impact.

908
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,880
And it is mentioned, this guy, Corcus mentions how they like,

909
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,000
you know, for example,

910
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,080
many might enjoy eating a Hershey chocolate bar,

911
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,120
but had no idea there was a man named Milton Hershey

912
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,160
to thank for their enjoyment.

913
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,840
All of us just glutton's chowing down Hershey bars.

914
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,520
And we don't say thank you to anyone.

915
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,800
We should all say thank you, Milton.

916
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,640
Thank you, Milton.

917
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,480
Thank you, Milton.

918
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
Jason says thank you, Milton.

919
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,560
I assure you in Hershey, Pennsylvania and Hershey Park,

920
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,640
they do not let you forget about Milton Hershey.

921
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,760
There is no worry about that.

922
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,000
But is he, is there any, I don't,

923
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,800
I can't imagine there's a statue of him.

924
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,440
But on one of these rides or exhibits,

925
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,400
is there ever a thing like,

926
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,240
there's Milton, is he ever like dressed up

927
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,680
or like made into a cartoon or given goofy eyes,

928
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,160
like on that bread tour, or like,

929
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,120
here's the family that made the bread.

930
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,280
Chocolate, blah.

931
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,200
I think in various versions of the Chocolate World ride.

932
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,040
Which is some-

933
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,960
There's some Milton Hershey

934
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,760
and there's definitely some exhibit space.

935
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,280
Do you get to like, did he have an apartment in Hershey Park

936
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,760
that you get to go in that's secret

937
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
and has a little lamp that he used to light?

938
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,800
This little chocolate light.

939
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
I don't know, I mean-

940
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,680
The brown light stays on.

941
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,200
And then hits him in hand in hand

942
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,280
with a chocolate bar and the statue.

943
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,480
Hershey Park was really,

944
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,960
they really lean into the like origins of the park of like,

945
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,920
then this was for the factory workers to enjoy leisure.

946
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,240
So that meant there was a lot of outdoor greenery space

947
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,960
and a couple of attractions that grew over the years.

948
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,800
You know?

949
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
See, we built you this, now shut up.

950
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,040
Now shut the fuck up.

951
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,120
Keep working.

952
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,960
You can see-

953
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
Thank you, Milton.

954
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,620
Thank you, Milton.

955
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,460
Thank you, Milton.

956
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,480
Don't hit me again, thank you, Milton.

957
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,840
You can see a non-union actor play him

958
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
in like the Food That Built America

959
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,400
or like those various history channel shows

960
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,640
that I really obsessed with.

961
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,800
I do love, so I think it was like

962
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,160
the first few months of lockdown.

963
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,120
I just watched hours of these shows

964
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,440
and they just make all of these guys.

965
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,600
The Campbell Soup Guy, Colonel Sander.

966
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,800
They all just look like lunatics.

967
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,640
Yeah.

968
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,460
Oh yeah.

969
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,660
They all are like, I am taking this Hershey's bar

970
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,140
with almonds and I'm gonna ruin you with it.

971
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,500
Like the Kellogg's brothers, I think.

972
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,540
It's all like the founder type stuff.

973
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,380
Yeah, yeah.

974
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,260
Can we get away with an episode about Colonel Sanders?

975
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,780
Is that in our purview?

976
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,700
Yeah, I think so.

977
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,220
Cause I like, yeah, any special about him

978
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,340
is the insane as shit-

979
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,180
He's a mad man.

980
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,020
You've ever heard.

981
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,700
Yeah, because that TV show,

982
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,540
it followed the phrase like,

983
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,500
well, Colonel Sanders shot him, but he didn't kill him.

984
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,900
Uh.

985
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,020
What I'm, here, I don't know if I wanna give it away,

986
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,460
but what I remember is that there's some story

987
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,540
where he's in like an old car that crashes

988
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,420
and his brain spills out.

989
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,260
Well, I've never heard this.

990
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,100
And then he just collects it and puts it back in.

991
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,940
No.

992
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,500
And like mats it with mud.

993
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,340
There we go.

994
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,180
What?

995
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,020
All good.

996
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,500
He's definitely a guy.

997
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,740
Yeah, oh for sure.

998
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,580
Yes.

999
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,420
And like, I think sexually crazy a little too.

1000
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,060
And like, or if not sexually,

1001
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
that sounds like, I just know he like immediately

1002
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
like cheated on his wife at the first,

1003
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,740
like they hired-

1004
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,560
When he got famous?

1005
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,740
The company was only him and his wife.

1006
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,300
And as soon as they hired a third employee,

1007
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,540
they fry cook, he was cheating with the fry cook.

1008
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,140
Like I met another woman.

1009
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,780
I am cheating instantly.

1010
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,660
Wow.

1011
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,500
I didn't know.

1012
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,180
I don't know a lot, I guess about Colonel Sanders.

1013
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,140
There we go.

1014
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
I mean, what?

1015
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,820
I think it's in there.

1016
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,640
I think it's in there.

1017
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,340
Just the sheer amount that he was sanded down

1018
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,500
to like a squeaky clean Mickey Mouse S mascot,

1019
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,500
both in America and in Japan and other parts of Asia.

1020
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,940
Oh, where they were.

1021
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,380
KFC very popular.

1022
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,420
And I believe it's either Christmas or Thanksgiving.

1023
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,940
There was like one year,

1024
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,700
there was an aggressive push on that holiday

1025
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,620
of like have KFC for Christmas.

1026
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,020
And then it just stuck around.

1027
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,860
It's a tradition now.

1028
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,780
It's a tradition now.

1029
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,060
Well, it's in Colonel Sanders put it on the list.

1030
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,220
2023, we need a lot of ideas on the list.

1031
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,780
Very productive at the end of 2022.

1032
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,220
We're collecting a lot.

1033
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,020
So I think maybe, all right, so they wanna do sit.

1034
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,620
They wanna like honor Walt, make sure people remember Walt

1035
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,340
and put something in the hub that is permanent.

1036
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,420
So there's no more gaudy Ferris wheels.

1037
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,080
Yeah, cause if they had waited too long,

1038
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,460
the X games would have been there.

1039
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,660
Oh, for sure.

1040
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,220
Like I was like the only reason

1041
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,860
it's just shy of the X games squeezing in there.

1042
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,500
The premiere of Mission to Mars

1043
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,100
projected in front of the castle.

1044
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,340
So maybe at this point is a good point

1045
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,860
to bring in the sculptor, Blaine Gibson.

1046
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,300
Like one of the greats in Disney history

1047
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,740
and Imagineering history, like the sculptor for sure,

1048
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,420
who started as an assistant animator

1049
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,980
but was taking sculpting classes at night

1050
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,220
at Pasadena City College.

1051
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,780
So hired to do one thing very well

1052
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,620
in this classic Imagineer way.

1053
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,620
And then they turn out to be like the ultimate genius

1054
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,540
in another category that wasn't even

1055
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,020
what they were hired to do.

1056
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,620
I've always liked this guy whenever I,

1057
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,780
like as a kid, when the statue went up

1058
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,500
or just looking into, so who does all this stuff

1059
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,300
and who molds the presidents and Lincoln?

1060
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,540
You see this name and God, he's great.

1061
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,740
Everything he touches is great.

1062
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,260
When it was debuted, did you know that,

1063
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,460
oh, this is Blaine Gibson?

1064
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
Or did you know shortly?

1065
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,940
Think I was dorky enough to possibly be.

1066
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,980
I mean, I was pretty young then.

1067
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
That's like pretty dorky.

1068
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,580
At least within the, yeah, yeah.

1069
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,060
But that's one of those names that's accessible.

1070
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,020
You get a book and there's a photo of a guy, you know,

1071
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,700
putting the last touches on the pirate

1072
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,420
and often that's gonna be the name that you.

1073
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,260
Oh yeah.

1074
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,620
Or not on the, well, you know, on the busts

1075
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,460
because he made the busts that then the animatronics are.

1076
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,380
He is batting a thousand in terms of theme park stuff.

1077
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:46,020
Tiki Room, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion,

1078
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,460
sculpted all the Hall of Presidents except Obama,

1079
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,060
which he came out of retirement to consult on.

1080
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,780
He also came out of retirement to do this statue.

1081
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,460
He did, oh yeah, he retired in 83.

1082
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,100
So everything after that, which was a lot,

1083
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,140
they would specially contract him

1084
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,020
and he would do it all in Sedona, Arizona,

1085
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,540
where he retired to.

1086
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,460
And in some cases, I think this sculpture,

1087
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,660
he had an assistant who like did all of the hard work

1088
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,580
because he's an old man by this point,

1089
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,260
but he like did the initial design and supervised it.

1090
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,380
The Presidents thing is crazy.

1091
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,660
Like, cause imagine when Hall of Presidents opens

1092
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,180
and there's how many presidents by then,

1093
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,820
at least like 35, I don't remember what,

1094
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,740
I don't know what the number Nixon is.

1095
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,860
That's what it went up to.

1096
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,300
But that's so many.

1097
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,500
It's a lot.

1098
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,340
And people who we have photos of,

1099
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,940
a pirate of the Caribbean,

1100
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,460
you can make look like whatever goofball you want,

1101
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,580
but these are all people we have photographs of.

1102
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,060
And Lincoln did not, you can't shake a stick at that.

1103
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,900
That's a big one.

1104
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,740
Yeah, it's huge.

1105
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,580
It's great.

1106
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,700
So he, yeah, he's like,

1107
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,180
cause he died a couple of years ago at 95, I believe.

1108
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,180
So what, 30 years ago, he was six in his sixties.

1109
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,660
He was very old and still making every president,

1110
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,820
every time he's a new president,

1111
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,740
which the pressure on that to like,

1112
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,900
if you don't, people don't really know

1113
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,740
what James K. Polk looks like,

1114
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,580
you can get away with it,

1115
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,900
but like you need to do Reagan or Reagan's everywhere.

1116
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,140
We know what, or even less, especially later,

1117
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,060
like, you know, like Clinton's the hugest celebrity

1118
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,620
with before he's even in office.

1119
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,460
Right, right.

1120
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,580
And they gotta make him.

1121
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,360
Would he have made the Trump robot look better?

1122
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,420
This is a very good question.

1123
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,620
It is, if you think about that timeline,

1124
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,740
he didn't do Obama,

1125
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,780
but he had a couple like thoughts on Obama.

1126
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,540
Trump is the first one with absolutely no input

1127
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,900
from Blaine Gibson.

1128
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,700
And a lot of people like the fan fiction or real fiction,

1129
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,780
a real life, like a speculation that like,

1130
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,060
oh, they're getting back at Trump

1131
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,900
with this weird looking robot.

1132
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,220
But what if it's just because Blaine Gibson was not there.

1133
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,060
He would have unlocked the most handsome.

1134
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,060
Beautiful of Donald John Trump.

1135
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,140
That would have made us all go, actually,

1136
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,500
he's really maybe the ultimate example of man.

1137
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,340
That's right.

1138
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,860
So there wouldn't have been booing during that show.

1139
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,420
I love the other rumor that it was just,

1140
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,660
they had already started on the Hillary statue

1141
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,760
and then they just fucked it up a little

1142
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,580
and put it on Trump's face.

1143
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,420
Stretch him.

1144
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,980
Just stretch, just, he's a wide boy.

1145
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,200
He's a wide man.

1146
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,860
Yeah, I don't know.

1147
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,460
It is interesting.

1148
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,020
How could it, it might've changed public perception.

1149
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,060
I still, you know,

1150
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,700
yeah, it would've, it would've told the whole thing.

1151
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,780
He'd still be president now.

1152
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,340
He, Trump himself would have seen the robot

1153
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,460
and been inspired to turn over a new leaf.

1154
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,420
To be a better man.

1155
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,260
That's right.

1156
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,080
I need to be hit.

1157
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,020
This is how the world sees me.

1158
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,900
I need to be this.

1159
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,740
I think it's funny how no one talks about Biden robot.

1160
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,740
Joseph. I don't really know

1161
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,580
what it looks like.

1162
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,420
I don't. Yeah.

1163
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,700
I mean, I saw it once when they debuted it.

1164
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,420
Joseph Robinette Biden looks pretty good.

1165
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,660
It looks pretty, pretty close to him.

1166
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,340
And they got it in there fast.

1167
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,020
Yes. The Trump went to forever.

1168
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,100
So I always took that as like, yeah, this kind of sucks.

1169
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,340
We're going to drag our heels on this asshole.

1170
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,580
If he, if Biden is still the president somehow in 2028,

1171
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,340
I don't know if that robot is going to look.

1172
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,660
The math adds up.

1173
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,180
I think they maybe don't have to get whoever today's Blaine

1174
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,620
is to come in and do what all the, or like,

1175
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,260
what if it did, maybe a Disney sculptor is the person

1176
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,780
making Biden look as good as he looks now.

1177
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,700
Oh, good point.

1178
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,540
Good question.

1179
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,940
Maybe he is part bust.

1180
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,140
There's a lot.

1181
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,620
There are a lot of imagineers working

1182
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,900
on the Biden actual man.

1183
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,780
People who joke is they don't need animatronics anymore,

1184
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,740
but we do need an animatronic to be the president.

1185
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,580
Right.

1186
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,860
There's a lot of actuators,

1187
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,820
a lot of Disney magic happening in the white house.

1188
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,420
When a part fuses on the shaman of song, they throw it out.

1189
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,340
And then somebody grabs it from a dumpster

1190
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,580
and puts it into bite.

1191
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,540
It just needs a new battery.

1192
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,380
We're all good.

1193
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,420
And then he goes, yeah, back to normal.

1194
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,980
Feeling great. Seamless.

1195
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,980
So this guy, oh, and also like, think about this one.

1196
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,220
Great movie ride.

1197
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,060
I don't know if they're all him on great movie ride,

1198
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,180
but he did some of them.

1199
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,540
These are current icon or like classic icon.

1200
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:41,540
I mean, just so many of the Disney historical,

1201
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,420
real person now presented in this artificial form

1202
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,780
was Blaine Gibson, clearly a master.

1203
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,980
Amazing.

1204
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,700
So if you're gonna entrust somebody

1205
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,140
to make the icon of the company, this is the guy to do it.

1206
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,140
Jason, as you said, they did give this a go in 62.

1207
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,820
Blaine Gibson makes a bust of him at the command of.

1208
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,740
This story is very funny.

1209
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,780
At the urging of Dick Irvine, a Imagineer guy at the time.

1210
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,860
He makes Walt Disney.

1211
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,100
He makes a Walt Disney bust.

1212
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,260
They give it to Walt.

1213
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,900
When he, Blaine claims, I don't think it was that good.

1214
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,260
I was tired, working late at night.

1215
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,940
The foundry work was no good.

1216
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,220
So he puts the blame on himself.

1217
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,260
I'm not sure that that's,

1218
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,660
I think Walt would have said this to anything

1219
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,500
because his quote becomes, when it's given to him,

1220
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,100
he does not say thank you.

1221
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,620
He says, what am I going to do with this?

1222
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,860
Statues are for dead people.

1223
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,220
He's not wrong.

1224
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1225
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,020
That's also like in terms of 20th century myth making,

1226
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,660
I feel like powerful people and it's like, oh yeah.

1227
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,220
And they would, they could kind of be really rude sometimes.

1228
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,580
And that was just sort of not mine.

1229
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,420
Back then, not anymore.

1230
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,420
Now they're, now powerful people.

1231
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,380
Not anymore.

1232
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,220
Now they're just liars.

1233
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,060
Now they just love to lie.

1234
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,660
They didn't lie before, but they were mean.

1235
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:15,740
And now, they're not mean, but they lie.

1236
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,700
It's like a lateral move.

1237
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,540
Evolution of that.

1238
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,700
That's what happens.

1239
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,540
Billionaire.

1240
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,380
Pretty simple.

1241
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,860
So now, Blaine Gibson is insecure.

1242
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,700
He thinks this has been a fool's errand.

1243
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,980
This makes the story much more dramatic.

1244
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,820
Right.

1245
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,380
Because the statue goes up in 93 and you think,

1246
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,860
well, of course they want to tribute Walt,

1247
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,860
but you don't realize that there's been a 30 year,

1248
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,620
it's been built up in Blaine's head.

1249
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,980
He's thinking, he's remembering this moment.

1250
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,500
The man himself said, I don't like this.

1251
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,900
Why did you do this?

1252
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,900
Yes.

1253
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,940
And then he, and then he kept it.

1254
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,140
He put it in his garage.

1255
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,940
The original clay bust is in his garage.

1256
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,020
And he could, he said, I couldn't bring myself

1257
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,580
to put a hammer to it.

1258
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,140
Even though he might've been tempted,

1259
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,980
it might've been a good way to get your aggression out

1260
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,140
on the boss who was so mean when you presented it.

1261
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,180
Yeah, why would he say that unless every night

1262
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,940
that hammer was like talking to him on the tool bench

1263
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,660
while he came in every night.

1264
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,820
The hammer was there, excuse me.

1265
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,580
No, no, I can't.

1266
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,580
He's like fighting his own arm.

1267
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,100
It's really sturdy, low humidity in Sedona

1268
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,460
in Southern California.

1269
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,860
So you're going to have to smash it with me.

1270
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,180
Take his nose off slowly with the two prongs

1271
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,780
on the other side of the hammer that I don't know

1272
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,020
the name of what they're called.

1273
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,100
Chip, Chip and Dale.

1274
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,060
This is the hammer's quote where he doesn't know

1275
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,620
what the back of him is called.

1276
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,460
This is a hammer that doesn't know the names

1277
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,780
of the pieces of a hammer.

1278
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,060
Whatever, what's my part called?

1279
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,180
I think it's a urethra.

1280
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,820
Take my urethra.

1281
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,980
Yeah, take it to your boss's head.

1282
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,860
Oh wait, no, I thought that was the handle.

1283
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,900
Grab my urethra.

1284
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,020
Grab my urethra.

1285
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,740
He made a sketch of himself sculpting the bust

1286
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,860
and with Walt next to him saying,

1287
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,340
that dummy thinks it looks like me.

1288
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,740
They're haunted, this man.

1289
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,940
Yeah, yeah.

1290
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,860
This is like, he thought it was his biggest failure

1291
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,860
in a history of major successes, robots we all see every day

1292
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,420
but then he finally, well first good news, Walt dies.

1293
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,260
Yeah.

1294
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,180
So he doesn't have Blaine to kick around anymore.

1295
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:34,180
Then years later, Cal Arts, which Walt contributed to

1296
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,260
wants a medal and they want on the medal

1297
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,900
to be a headshot of Walt.

1298
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,100
So he's called upon to put this together

1299
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,700
and I don't know if this happened or not actually

1300
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,020
but Walt's widow, Lillian, still alive,

1301
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,940
tells Blaine, I don't ever want a bust or a portrait

1302
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,100
or a statue of Walt to be done.

1303
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,820
So he gets his ass handed to him again.

1304
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,660
By the wife.

1305
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,100
We're trying to honor.

1306
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,060
He's like, obviously like, I want to honor this man.

1307
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,340
And then we're like, don't you fucking do it.

1308
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,380
This is my purpose on this earth to use my hands.

1309
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,260
Blaine, I'll kill you if you make a statue of my husband.

1310
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,780
And he's like, oh my God.

1311
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,340
I don't want him back in 3D in my life.

1312
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,980
He's gone, I'm happy.

1313
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,460
He could, if you make a statue, there's a good chance

1314
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,100
he haunts the statue and he comes back to life.

1315
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,060
If he haunts a medal.

1316
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,220
He can haunt a medal.

1317
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,460
Immediately that thing starts swinging around

1318
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,100
on the recipient's neck and then maybe like tries to burrow,

1319
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,340
bite into his chest.

1320
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,700
Don't you know that souls can enter sort of facsimiles

1321
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,660
of themselves once they're dead, if they're created.

1322
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,260
They're after light pipelines, they're wormholes.

1323
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,380
That's how it works.

1324
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,540
Well, that's why the statue has the sinister looking

1325
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,220
smoke tree ranch insignia on the tie and the Irish,

1326
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,300
I don't know how to say this, cladagh ring.

1327
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,100
Oh, he's got two, he's got the two rings.

1328
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,700
I didn't look it up before either.

1329
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,500
He's got the two wedding rings.

1330
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,580
Yeah, it's the symbol where it's-

1331
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,580
Maybe a hard C, like cladagh.

1332
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,340
It's two hands and a heart and a crown.

1333
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,460
And it's a traditional like design,

1334
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,460
a traditional ring design that I believe he went to Ireland

1335
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,900
and brought them back for him and Lillian.

1336
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,460
Cladagh is what I just heard.

1337
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,140
I still will not remember that and say,

1338
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,580
well, we don't have to keep saying it.

1339
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,260
It's his Irish wedding ring.

1340
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,100
That's the point.

1341
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,940
Right.

1342
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,220
It is a design that I'm like, as soon as I saw it,

1343
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,180
similar to the toilet posters, I was like,

1344
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,100
oh yeah, I know lots of people who have one of those.

1345
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,260
Wait, as it's similar in that you know-

1346
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,380
As soon as I saw it, I was like, oh yeah,

1347
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,220
I know what that is.

1348
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,060
I didn't know the name of it.

1349
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:47,900
There was familiarity.

1350
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,820
I'm very familiar with it.

1351
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

1352
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,460
So anyways, look, the company has made it clear

1353
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,100
they don't want, or not the company, I guess.

1354
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,940
The family.

1355
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,060
The family, Walt doesn't want it.

1356
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,900
Lillian doesn't want it.

1357
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,740
Then Lillian's gone.

1358
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,460
Now they can do whatever they want.

1359
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,260
The idea that this happens, that like,

1360
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,180
I know the man really did not want a statue of himself,

1361
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,540
but it's in our best interest to deify him,

1362
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,700
so we need this statue.

1363
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,780
In a succession-esque play,

1364
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,180
between veteran Imagineers as a stopgap

1365
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,780
from like Michael Eisner putting

1366
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,300
like a Goodyear blimp in the hub.

1367
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,140
Yeah.

1368
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,980
Yeah.

1369
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,700
Yeah, he just puts up, yeah, carnival games.

1370
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,660
Or yeah, like has people,

1371
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,180
the craft fair is set up in Main Street.

1372
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,540
The Wiener, Wiener-mobile that's parked

1373
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,100
in front of the castle.

1374
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,620
He's gonna put up like just one hotel room,

1375
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,180
one hotel suite, just one adorned, like a bungalow.

1376
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,340
But they start, okay,

1377
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,380
they start coming around on this stuff.

1378
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,260
There is a lithograph,

1379
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,540
is this what you're talking about, Jason?

1380
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,220
Yeah, I gotta talk.

1381
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,380
The lithograph was made to commemorate the two,

1382
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,340
is it the 200th million Disneyland guest?

1383
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,620
100th million Disneyland guest in 1981.

1384
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,740
And there's also Partners in Excellence is a pin

1385
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,060
given to, they say 2% of cast members

1386
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,060
for like exemplary service.

1387
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,060
But yeah, so the lithograph was made

1388
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,780
and only sold to cast members.

1389
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,620
And I have the picture here,

1390
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:33,620
and I don't wanna push you guys to an opinion,

1391
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,940
but there's a sinister energy coming off this picture.

1392
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,100
And I don't know what it is.

1393
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,780
If it's just the sheer amount of brown,

1394
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,620
if it's just the design.

1395
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,460
Hold on, let me take a look at this.

1396
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,300
This piece. His sassy arm.

1397
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,060
So what you're showing us, this is a drawing

1398
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,860
that is like the Partners statue,

1399
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,100
but it's in color and Waltz is in a very tan suit

1400
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,540
and he's got an arm out

1401
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,660
and he's holding kind of a drawn Mickey's hand.

1402
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,500
I like it. I like it.

1403
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,340
I like the statue.

1404
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,460
I don't know that I think it's sinister.

1405
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,660
You like it.

1406
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,260
I think he's got, Waltz kind of got like a,

1407
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,140
I'm a little teapot arm going with the like,

1408
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,420
that's his, like he's making the handle, not the spout.

1409
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,140
Well, how do you, what's your sinister,

1410
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,260
what is the, it's something about the suit?

1411
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,100
I don't know.

1412
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,220
I think it's just the color scheme.

1413
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,580
It feels like it's not colorful enough

1414
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,060
for something this whimsical.

1415
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,980
Do you feel like maybe it's like faded?

1416
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,300
Like you're kind of finding it creepy

1417
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,860
because it's, it feels old to you

1418
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,340
and like it's like a relic of the past.

1419
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,460
I think the paper it's on and the suit are like,

1420
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,260
have faded to too similar.

1421
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,060
It feels like the suit is your thing.

1422
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,300
You don't like a tan suit.

1423
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,260
No, well, I was furious when Obama came out

1424
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,140
in that tan suit.

1425
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,260
We all know that.

1426
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,500
Destroyed the presidency.

1427
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,140
Do you have a tan suit, Jason?

1428
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,820
I did in high school.

1429
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,660
Really?

1430
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,700
And it was one of the most uncomfortable fabrics

1431
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,540
I've ever touched.

1432
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,740
Now we're getting somewhere.

1433
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,980
Oh, you think it's psycho-psychological?

1434
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,660
Bad memories about tan suits.

1435
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,860
I think it's the way, I don't know.

1436
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,180
It might be the way they're clasping.

1437
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,900
Like Mickey feels too little.

1438
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,740
What do you, do you think there's something?

1439
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,900
I think there's.

1440
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,740
I don't know.

1441
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,580
I find it fine.

1442
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,980
Yeah, I don't know that I can attribute any.

1443
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,340
Sinister is a strong word for sure.

1444
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,660
It's probably too strong of a word.

1445
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,940
I just think it's, it's odd.

1446
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,020
Yeah, it's just off.

1447
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,860
It's strange.

1448
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,500
The lack of the background maybe.

1449
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,140
If you're, so you're saying that if you worked

1450
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,940
for the Disney company in 1981,

1451
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,180
and you've been there for years,

1452
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,340
and that the perk that you get is the opportunity

1453
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,740
to buy this picture with your money.

1454
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,580
You don't think that's gonna make you feel good.

1455
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,820
I don't know if I'm spending my, what's the exchange?

1456
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,420
Probably like $20.

1457
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,820
20 whole 1981 dollars.

1458
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,260
I'm not made of lithographs.

1459
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,780
Look, I gotta buy, look,

1460
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,500
I gotta buy a lot of cigarettes, okay?

1461
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,580
Get through this job.

1462
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,460
Yeah, even.

1463
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,700
I'm not gonna fit in at work, unless I.

1464
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,900
I gotta buy cigarettes and Tab and Quaaludes.

1465
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,740
Okay.

1466
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,300
Would Walt, was there just like,

1467
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,820
I mean, I know the answer to this,

1468
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,980
but like wouldn't it have been nice in the old days

1469
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,820
at one of these companies,

1470
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,300
because you hear like, oh, working at Google,

1471
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,300
they have a cereal bar, Pixar as well.

1472
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,980
Like, oh, go to a cafeteria.

1473
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,020
They have so much different food.

1474
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,300
You go to these different places.

1475
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,540
Like if Walt just had a big basket of free cigarettes

1476
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,180
at the Disney company,

1477
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,900
where you could go in and just take

1478
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,780
whatever brand you wanted.

1479
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,740
Different like.

1480
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,300
That is like a, I feel like set decorators

1481
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,100
do that a lot in movies and TV,

1482
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,380
where there is like just a box on a coffee table

1483
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,660
or a desk that you open it up

1484
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,700
and there's just cigarettes inside.

1485
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,140
And then a decorative lighter next to it.

1486
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,740
So, I would think maybe.

1487
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,180
I like the way you said TV.

1488
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,020
I also know that.

1489
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,580
There's a story about cigarettes,

1490
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,340
and then it's also, and you see it on the TV.

1491
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,260
Oh, the TV, the television.

1492
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,380
I also noted, oh, that's a good way to say TV.

1493
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,740
That ended up being the headline of the story to me.

1494
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,940
We ignored everything else you said.

1495
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,540
Cigarette bowls on the TV.

1496
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,380
Well.

1497
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,980
No, they're like, I think there was a very

1498
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:58,980
related, you know, TV, I think, sparks a,

1499
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,060
the era where cigarettes were around more often.

1500
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,900
That's right.

1501
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,740
Yeah.

1502
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,260
That's what, Wal would have wanted that

1503
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,460
instead of the statue.

1504
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,260
He would have wanted a giant bowl of cigarettes

1505
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,580
in the center of Disneyland.

1506
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,180
Go in and reach.

1507
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,620
Obviously you'd pay for it.

1508
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,460
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1509
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,020
Somebody gotta give somebody a dollar, five dollars.

1510
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,460
It would have been an A ticket.

1511
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,420
That like, when it was still the ticket system.

1512
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,820
Like, A, horse-drawn carriages, omnibus.

1513
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,500
Cigarette.

1514
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Now it would have been an E, E cigarette ticket.

1515
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,340
E cigarette.

1516
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,020
Now you've got an E cigarette ticket.

1517
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,820
That's where the Chapec arrow would have hit it.

1518
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,300
He would have started.

1519
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,260
Well, they were exploring gambling.

1520
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,100
Yeah, that's right.

1521
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:37,940
Were they?

1522
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,460
To save ESPN.

1523
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,300
Yeah, yeah.

1524
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,620
Yeah, I mean, it's whatever.

1525
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,540
ESPN's been the biggest drag on the comedy for a long time.

1526
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,460
And so like, if you can, if the incentive

1527
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,980
while you're watching ESPN is to also gamble on an app.

1528
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,940
Well, Fox was doing that a lot during the World Series.

1529
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,780
Oh, okay.

1530
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,620
That's DraftKings.

1531
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,460
What is it?

1532
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,300
It's rare.

1533
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,140
There's a lot of different places, yeah.

1534
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,340
So, it wasn't there yet where they were gonna

1535
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,300
put slot machines in like, the Beauty and the Beast

1536
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,380
restaurant, but I wasn't weighing.

1537
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,980
It might have been the end.

1538
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,820
Yeah.

1539
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,580
They did spend a lot of lobbying money

1540
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,500
stopping casinos from springing up in Florida.

1541
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,540
Yes, but that's just because they didn't make the casinos.

1542
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,300
Yeah, because they weren't making money.

1543
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,980
But, Jim and Len mentioned that big cruise ship they bought,

1544
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,100
like the partially built cruise ship,

1545
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,620
the centerpiece of that cruise ship

1546
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,620
was gonna be a casino.

1547
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,580
So now it's like, ah, what to do, what to do.

1548
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,500
Wait, they were really,

1549
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,380
oh, that would have been the beginning?

1550
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,860
Or wait, was it already a casino?

1551
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,060
Like when they bought it?

1552
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,980
Well, yeah, they bought it and they're like,

1553
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,940
hey, you know, I don't know the sequence of events,

1554
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,820
but like that cruise ship was designed

1555
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,500
to have a casino in it.

1556
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,900
That's the major centerpiece of it.

1557
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,740
So now what does Disney do?

1558
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,660
That could have been the point where it started.

1559
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,700
This is the Disney cruise where you gamble.

1560
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,540
The precedent.

1561
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,700
And then it's, well, then we'll get it on the other cruises.

1562
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,700
And now it's in the parks.

1563
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:04,100
And now it's in the, you get like the ultimate VIP

1564
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,700
risk suite in the top of the castle.

1565
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,140
As long as you just keep, it's free,

1566
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:08,980
as long as you keep playing.

1567
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,380
And now there's a video poker on the thing

1568
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,740
in front of you on pirates, on the chair in front of you,

1569
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,980
the video poker machine.

1570
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,380
For dad, if he's bored, he'll have like fun.

1571
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,220
Well, they're watching all those people,

1572
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,020
like the game that you put up to your forehead,

1573
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,620
the cell phone game, they're looking like,

1574
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,460
how do we monetize that?

1575
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,500
How do we make it?

1576
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,860
Well, they tried and they came up with some

1577
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,020
of the most boring games I've ever played.

1578
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,860
One of the most mind numbing app games.

1579
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,180
What an era it's been.

1580
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,460
But that is, if you look up most cruise lines

1581
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,180
under amenities, it does say casino.

1582
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,740
And that is like an oddity with the Disney cruise ships

1583
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,260
where it's like, oh, there's no casinos on these cruise ships.

1584
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1585
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,740
I wonder if they'll, yeah, that'll be,

1586
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,180
they'll be curious, well, what Iger does with the ship

1587
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,220
and then what does he, yeah, does gambling happen?

1588
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,380
I think it does.

1589
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,220
Yeah, yeah, why not?

1590
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,060
I guess it does.

1591
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,340
Everything's getting crazier and sleazier.

1592
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,100
It all depends on the avatar box office,

1593
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,780
which by now we will know.

1594
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,620
Right.

1595
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,780
As listeners will know.

1596
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,740
Right, but we don't know, we're still in the dark on that.

1597
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,740
We're still in the dark.

1598
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,180
Yeah, yeah, I don't wanna, I will seem a fool

1599
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,620
if I make any predictions.

1600
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,660
Let's make some predictions.

1601
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,500
I know.

1602
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,380
Well, I'm just hoping at this point,

1603
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,620
I have seen an avatar slot machine in Atlantic City

1604
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:28,020
cause I feel like the Dune slot machines

1605
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,260
were so fast coming out.

1606
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,540
Well, some of them are video, so you can do it fat.

1607
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,940
Like you don't have to, it's not like you have to install

1608
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,860
a physical Navi.

1609
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,860
Some of them are sort of just video screens,

1610
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,660
so you can, they can just like download it, I think,

1611
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,180
like one night and put it up.

1612
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,140
Well, there are, there have been avatar slot machines,

1613
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,660
for sure, it's just a matter of.

1614
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,860
Widespreadness.

1615
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,220
And do they update with way of water?

1616
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,740
Are we gonna be, people are gonna be on the slot machines

1617
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,220
and going, but where's Spider?

1618
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,180
Will we love Spider?

1619
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,140
That's what I'd like to, do you think you'll love Spider?

1620
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,540
Or Spider might be bad, I don't know.

1621
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,620
I will love Spider.

1622
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,500
Are you gonna love, even if he's bad?

1623
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,220
Well, I love the Joker, but the Joker's bad.

1624
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,060
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1625
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,940
He's a character, not necessarily one of the,

1626
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,020
I think I love Spider.

1627
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,260
Yeah. We'll see.

1628
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,100
We'll see.

1629
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,940
Okay, so where does that leave us?

1630
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:26,100
Oh, they've, we're wearing down,

1631
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,380
and now everyone who requested it is dead,

1632
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,900
so now we can make this statue.

1633
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,780
And in fact, before the partner statue is built,

1634
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,780
there is a physical bust of Walt done in public.

1635
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,700
Anybody know where it is?

1636
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,660
Do you know offhand?

1637
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,020
I do know where it is, and I've been there and seen it.

1638
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,860
Yes, okay, then we're thinking the same thing.

1639
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:53,660
That is the Academy Museum, the Academy headquarters,

1640
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:57,100
the TV Academy headquarters in North Hollywood,

1641
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,460
not very far from here.

1642
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,860
I went there at lunchtime.

1643
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,300
No, you did.

1644
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,860
There's me and the man.

1645
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,700
Wow.

1646
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:10,700
And unlike the partner's statue, which is in a planter,

1647
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:14,700
and it's elevated, this one you can walk right up to.

1648
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,980
And in fact, you can go nose to nose with Walt

1649
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,940
as I am doing in a photo, which you will see.

1650
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,420
I'll put this on Twitter.

1651
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,900
And have you ever been to this, Mike?

1652
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,740
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1653
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,300
I know where it is, and I don't,

1654
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,340
but I've never, I either didn't notice Walt was there

1655
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,060
or I didn't, whatever.

1656
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,300
I have been there though.

1657
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,540
If you're around, oh, go ahead.

1658
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:40,220
It's behind the Jimmy, it's behind the Jimmy Johns

1659
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,620
and sort of around the corner

1660
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,420
from the ice cream sandwich place.

1661
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,580
Oh yes, yeah, I've been to the ice cream sandwich place.

1662
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,340
I've been to the ice cream sandwich place.

1663
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:51,260
This is Chipotle, Lemley Theater.

1664
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,700
But if you're walking around there,

1665
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,420
God knows if you're at the Jimmy Johns

1666
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,660
because that's far from the only attraction.

1667
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,660
You can see there's a Chuck Lorre that you can glare at.

1668
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,940
I think I've said before on the show,

1669
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,500
somehow this has come up before,

1670
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,180
that everybody's got kind of like,

1671
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,860
it's just plaques saying their name

1672
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,780
and maybe who designed the plaque.

1673
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,140
Or if like, oh, this is a television executive.

1674
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,380
Chuck Lorre puts one of those fucking vanity cards,

1675
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,980
you know how all his shows end with some big screed?

1676
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:25,620
So there is just this massive paragraph that he wrote,

1677
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:30,380
the last words of which are playing with my titanium penis.

1678
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,340
So that is in this courtyard,

1679
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,860
thankfully far away from Waltz.

1680
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,860
He doesn't have to hear this filth.

1681
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,300
But the main thing, here's why,

1682
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,220
especially, I mean, both of you guys gotta get over there,

1683
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:46,780
is you can get some nice quality time with Bill Frawley.

1684
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,780
Here I am resting my head on Bill Frawley's shoulder.

1685
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,260
Man, this is crazy that I walked over there,

1686
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,100
but I guess I didn't,

1687
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,060
I don't know why I didn't see Bill Frawley.

1688
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,460
This is free entertainment.

1689
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,300
Right.

1690
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,180
If like, they used to live much closer to that

1691
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,380
and it's really nice if you just like,

1692
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,620
I wanna take a walk somewhere,

1693
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,140
or this is Starbucks, just grab Starbucks,

1694
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,620
and then you can walk around.

1695
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,780
Dave's Hot Chicken's over there.

1696
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,620
What's that?

1697
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,440
Dave's Hot Chicken.

1698
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,280
Oh, that's right.

1699
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,120
Yeah. Right over there.

1700
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,460
Oh yeah, well if you're going there,

1701
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,620
then go, well just go eat it under,

1702
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,940
you know, there's like steps and on this,

1703
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,940
most of them are just on like little platforms,

1704
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:22,220
but like Lucy and Desi are doing a little dance

1705
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,660
on the steps, so you can like lay,

1706
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,060
you can like be under their hands

1707
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,020
and eat your lunch under them.

1708
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,540
You can eat my lunch under Lucy and Desi.

1709
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,620
Or like one person just put their Chipotle cup

1710
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,340
on Bob Newhart.

1711
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,900
So if you wanna litter next to the TV greats,

1712
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:45,580
go to the Emmy headquarters on Lancashim and Magnolia.

1713
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,900
That's a pretty good gag.

1714
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,260
Like that's pretty on point.

1715
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,100
For Bob Newhart.

1716
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,940
Yeah, disrespecting.

1717
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:55,460
If you like, he would have a good joke about that.

1718
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,960
This sculpture garden, whatever you wanna call it,

1719
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,440
was duplicated too for MGM studios.

1720
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,720
Yes, that's right, yes.

1721
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,640
And it's all the, yeah, it's like the same,

1722
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,840
whatever company or entity that did it

1723
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
and a lot of the same bus.

1724
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,640
So there's a Walt there too, right?

1725
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,040
And at both locations, there was a Bill Cosby

1726
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,080
who has been removed and hopefully destroyed.

1727
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,560
So that when he becomes a ghost, he cannot happen.

1728
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,560
Ghost dad.

1729
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,840
Then, oh no, ghost dad for real.

1730
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,760
I hate that.

1731
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,200
The Cosby one for some reason is the memory I have

1732
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,400
of seeing a bust at Lancashim.

1733
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Wow, yeah.

1734
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,860
I remember seeing, there might be a picture of child me

1735
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,920
with bust Bill Cosby in MGM.

1736
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,880
In Florida, yeah.

1737
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,360
Because at the time when he, that's another here,

1738
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,360
back to dorky me, I know, I think there's a photo of me

1739
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,960
on a beach vacation at 10 years old

1740
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,720
and I'm reading Bill Cosby's fatherhood.

1741
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,640
What?

1742
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,240
Yeah, like reading it on the beach.

1743
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,080
Yes, yeah.

1744
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:55,920
Wow.

1745
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,120
Because I like the humor section.

1746
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,040
I like sign language, Jerry Seinfeld's book.

1747
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:00,880
Wow.

1748
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,480
So you were reading all the comedians' books.

1749
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1750
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,320
Wow.

1751
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,120
I don't remember if I read,

1752
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,000
what's the Tim Allen book called?

1753
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,480
He had like a real best seller

1754
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,320
because when he was dominating media.

1755
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,960
Is there a naked man in the title?

1756
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1757
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,120
Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man?

1758
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:14,960
Is that the name of Tim Allen's book?

1759
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,560
Don't Stand Close to, yeah.

1760
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,560
That sounds familiar, but I can't remember.

1761
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,520
Let me see, Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man.

1762
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,600
Very good, wow.

1763
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,440
Yeah.

1764
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,760
Did you do the Dave Barry books too?

1765
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,560
I think I may have,

1766
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,040
because if you're looking at the humor section as a kid,

1767
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,640
it's dominated by Dave Barry.

1768
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,440
And I think I tried one and was like,

1769
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,440
nope, not even me.

1770
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,720
Not even I can handle this.

1771
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,840
Back to Tim Allen.

1772
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,040
Reading all the comedians' books as a kid,

1773
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,640
that feels running parallel to the kids at like 11 or 12

1774
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,120
who are like blitzing through Stephen King books.

1775
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,920
And I never understood that.

1776
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,000
I wasn't there yet.

1777
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,680
I read a few Stephen King books in adulthood,

1778
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,760
but at 12, I was like,

1779
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,360
I wouldn't have known what to make of The Shining.

1780
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,280
Oh God, no, yeah.

1781
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,840
I made an annoyingly big deal out of like,

1782
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,120
I liked Jurassic Park the movie so much

1783
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,120
that I also read the book.

1784
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,880
And I am pretending because that book is largely code.

1785
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,720
Like big stretches of it are like,

1786
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,880
here's this genetic.

1787
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,680
And I read it.

1788
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,080
Enough to like know that, oh,

1789
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,240
the scene with the compies in Lost World,

1790
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,920
that's from the original book.

1791
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,640
And the lawyer is actually not a coward.

1792
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,960
He's strong in the book.

1793
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:36,800
Is that so?

1794
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,640
I don't know.

1795
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,520
And all I remember really is that

1796
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,480
and that there were pterodactyls in the book,

1797
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,640
but not the movie.

1798
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,000
And I was so, I was like, yes.

1799
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,800
I started the book a few years ago.

1800
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,800
It didn't get very far.

1801
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,520
My dad's read a lot of Michael Crichton.

1802
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,800
And he, like when we were older,

1803
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,280
and we were like, well, what's the book?

1804
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,600
He's like, it's a lot more brutal.

1805
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,440
It's a lot meaner.

1806
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,600
And Hammond's an asshole.

1807
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,040
Yeah, there's a lot of assholes.

1808
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,960
Hammond's not a kindly old man or anything.

1809
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,440
He's like a dick.

1810
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,120
But that's like one of the five books I've read.

1811
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,480
Mostly with 10 years old,

1812
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,800
I was reading like Garfield mega collection.

1813
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,520
Yeah, I was blitzing through goosebumps, you know?

1814
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,360
Yeah.

1815
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,400
I like Calvin Hobbes for me.

1816
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,360
Anyway, point is, and that bust is by Blaine Gibson.

1817
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,560
So same designer.

1818
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,760
So if you wanna go see one,

1819
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,680
if you wanna go get right up close to it,

1820
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,600
if you wanna touch it, lick it.

1821
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,400
Do whatever you want.

1822
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,720
And that was made in 1991.

1823
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,200
So look, we're coming around.

1824
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,800
We can have the waltz that are physicalized

1825
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,040
that we want so badly.

1826
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,040
But what are we gonna do with it?

1827
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,520
What's Walt gonna be doing?

1828
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,360
Right.

1829
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,420
And so they tried a couple of ideas.

1830
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,880
I mean, it's not that interesting to list them.

1831
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,280
The one that I like is that they were really

1832
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,120
at some point pushing that it's Walt holding Mickey's hand,

1833
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,760
but then Mickey has an ice cream cone.

1834
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,360
And they decided that was far too juvenile.

1835
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,120
What is it?

1836
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,080
Silly, too silly.

1837
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,920
Yeah, what does that mean?

1838
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,920
They thought people think Mickey's a child

1839
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,160
and not an adult?

1840
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,840
That's what I did see a couple sources saying that like,

1841
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,360
it's not that it's childish,

1842
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,360
it's that it would make the character appear too childlike.

1843
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,360
So you want- Like it's his son.

1844
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,200
It's his adult son, it's not his child son.

1845
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,360
But the statues, it's called partners,

1846
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,320
you wanna make them seem equal.

1847
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,160
Yeah.

1848
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,960
So if it was one, first of all, Mickey already is shorter,

1849
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,240
so just optic wise, you think,

1850
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,960
oh, this is the child of this man.

1851
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,480
So I guess the ice cream really makes it seem like a child.

1852
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,800
Well, you might be stopped from thinking

1853
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,360
it's the child of this man because he's a mouse.

1854
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,200
He's a big mouse.

1855
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,360
Well, but if you're far away

1856
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,720
and you're like kind of squinting

1857
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,800
and you're like, oh, it's a dad and his son, I guess.

1858
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,080
Oh, there's the ice cream cone, that's his son.

1859
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,600
Why is there a father and son up high?

1860
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,440
Why are they dark brown from head to toe?

1861
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,760
Anyway, I'm gonna turn left and not think about it anymore.

1862
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,040
It's the most people experience.

1863
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,400
Yeah, so I guess I could see that to some degree,

1864
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,040
but also I feel like the ice cream cone would have been fun.

1865
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,880
Yeah.

1866
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,600
Especially if it was like one of the big, the 10 scoops.

1867
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,360
Did they indicate, I saw the same thing.

1868
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,520
One scoop.

1869
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,360
Do you think that's what-

1870
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,880
That's what I'm reading,

1871
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,520
but maybe there was a crazy concept.

1872
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,160
Tyra didn't say scoop wise what it was.

1873
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,000
You're near, you know what?

1874
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,160
Yeah, clearly better now.

1875
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,200
One scoop, I don't know if I care about.

1876
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,560
Scoops that go all the way up to the top of Walt's head.

1877
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,400
Yes.

1878
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,160
Match his height and kind of have a little curve.

1879
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,400
Like maybe they're about to fall out.

1880
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,200
It's like 30 scoops.

1881
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,160
That's a good statue.

1882
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,600
That's a good statue, yes.

1883
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,640
Subliminal too.

1884
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,920
People see it and they're like,

1885
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,760
I wanna get a big ice cream cone.

1886
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,360
I wanna get a big scoop of bronze ice cream.

1887
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,920
I wanna find-

1888
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,880
What color is closest to bronze?

1889
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,320
I want a few scoops of that Edie slash Dreyer's ice cream.

1890
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,560
That's smart.

1891
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,400
Well, that's the plus up clearly.

1892
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,240
Yeah.

1893
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,200
A giant drain of ice creams.

1894
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,860
Some more trivia about this statue.

1895
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,680
So it exists at Disneyland Disney World,

1896
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:15,280
the Disney lot in Burbank, Tokyo Disney,

1897
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,760
and then that Bayard Park at Disneyland Paris

1898
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,680
that we always complain about.

1899
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,360
It's the castle parks.

1900
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,040
It's their own lights, the place where Walt worked

1901
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,760
and then it's the worst park they ever built.

1902
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,760
And that went because it's the same position

1903
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,040
in the castle parks in front of the castle.

1904
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,320
And then in the studios park,

1905
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,940
it's just kind of like tower terrors there,

1906
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,200
some purple buildings over there.

1907
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,840
It's as if they're trying to go,

1908
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,480
well, you wanna say this place is cheap and not class.

1909
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,600
Look who's here.

1910
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,000
Look who's watching over it.

1911
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,440
The cheapest man in America that are David.

1912
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,480
Different labor.

1913
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,320
Yeah.

1914
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,400
Labor-wise cheap, yes.

1915
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,200
In different, slightly different material in each park,

1916
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,040
slightly different coloring to sort of blend in

1917
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,320
with the surroundings a little better.

1918
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,840
Do you have the names of the different materials?

1919
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,680
I don't.

1920
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,080
I don't have that.

1921
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,000
I think they were just considering the aging

1922
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,140
and the finishings of like,

1923
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,000
well, the Southern California skylines

1924
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,400
are different than the Orlando skyline

1925
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,480
instead of the Paris.

1926
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,320
One of them's not made out of candy or something.

1927
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,840
Not yet.

1928
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,360
That would be a good food.

1929
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,200
Ice cream.

1930
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,980
Yeah, a treat to, yeah, yeah.

1931
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,440
There's also a version of it in the Epic Mickey video game.

1932
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,480
Yes, I guess.

1933
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,540
Where Mickey is replaced with Oswald the lucky rabbit.

1934
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,040
And that's the most melancholy.

1935
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,640
It's the sign that it's an alternate universe

1936
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,880
is that it's Oswald.

1937
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,400
There's a version of that that's good.

1938
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,920
And that's, I was just talking about this

1939
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,300
on the Kingdom Hearts where like,

1940
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,160
some of the art even was like darker and more dystopian,

1941
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,640
which generally I don't like,

1942
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,560
but I liked it at the time when I saw it.

1943
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1944
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,520
But then there was some art for the second one,

1945
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,360
and I don't think they actually used it

1946
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,720
where the partner statue is three.

1947
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,560
Oh.

1948
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,300
It's Walt in the middle,

1949
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,080
like we were talking about at the top of the episode,

1950
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,880
Walt and then Mickey and Oswald.

1951
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,800
Oswald on his left, Mickey on his right.

1952
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,640
Wow.

1953
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,440
Because they work together in the second game.

1954
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,280
Exactly.

1955
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,320
So I don't know if that actually made it in the game.

1956
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,160
It's a striking image.

1957
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,400
It's a very striking image.

1958
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,240
Yeah, it's very.

1959
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,760
It's a, you know, it makes it,

1960
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,120
it makes so much sense in that game

1961
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,840
that like that's their clock tower.

1962
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,840
Like that's the sign that things are changing, I guess.

1963
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,720
That you know you're in a different world

1964
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,560
because something's up with this area.

1965
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,000
It's in the, in Wasteland.

1966
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,520
The Wasteland. That's a part of the game.

1967
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,920
So. Wow.

1968
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,560
Which was really that game,

1969
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,160
we just by sheer coincidence

1970
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,760
put out the Kingdom Hearts episode,

1971
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,640
10 years to the day that Epic Mickey was coming out.

1972
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,480
Wow. I believe.

1973
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,320
Somebody said 12.

1974
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,920
I saw, I sent a tweet that said 10,

1975
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,000
but then I saw somebody say 12.

1976
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,840
So I thought. Okay.

1977
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,560
Well, what a nice tribute to something

1978
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,640
that isn't what we.

1979
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,480
What we talked about.

1980
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,600
Oh, a video game that was unpleasant in different ways.

1981
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,640
Was it?

1982
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,240
But better, a better game.

1983
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:14,040
It was better, but it was also like no one talked.

1984
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,280
It was just text.

1985
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,320
We all go, my we isn't working.

1986
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,400
So I have to figure out how to get it working

1987
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,600
so I can revisit Epic Mickey.

1988
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,440
Yeah.

1989
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,760
Well, maybe something to talk about is what is happening?

1990
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,640
What the scene that it depicts.

1991
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,000
We've talked about that they're holding hands,

1992
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,120
but it's kind of, I mean, it's, it's sort of, okay.

1993
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,120
Mickey is looking up adoringly fondly at his, his mentor.

1994
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,640
And.

1995
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,480
His partner.

1996
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,320
His partner.

1997
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,160
It is his partner.

1998
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,000
Yes.

1999
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,480
And while Walt's, and this was a choice that they had to make

2000
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,320
is what is Walt's doing and what they landed on

2001
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:58,320
is big friendly smile and kind of gesturing to the horizon.

2002
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,280
And I mean, I know the intent of, of Blaine Gibson,

2003
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,400
what he was trying to say,

2004
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:07,200
but do you guys put any meaning into this?

2005
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,840
Like when you see that statue,

2006
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,680
what do you think Walt's thinking about?

2007
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,960
What is he?

2008
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,040
What's, what's his frame of mind?

2009
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,200
What do you put onto this, this work?

2010
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,680
Well, I was reading that a lot of people, yeah,

2011
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,040
have their own feeling of what it means,

2012
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,120
what this gesture means.

2013
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:28,120
And I think if I, my, if my first reaction is sort of Walt,

2014
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,320
basically like in a Willy Wonka type way telling Mickey,

2015
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,640
all of this is yours.

2016
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,720
This is all yours.

2017
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,960
I will die soon.

2018
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,800
Right.

2019
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,000
Keeping my cancer quiet.

2020
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:39,880
Right.

2021
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,360
And he's saying, this is going to be yours.

2022
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,640
And since we're partners, equal partners in Disney,

2023
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,640
it's all up to you now.

2024
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,520
Cause I'm going to die.

2025
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,120
So it's a grim monument.

2026
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,360
Yeah. It's depressing.

2027
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,200
To you.

2028
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,020
Yes.

2029
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,840
I think he's, cause he's pointing kind of like past,

2030
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,600
there's no California adventure at that point.

2031
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,080
So he's just kind of pointing out into Anaheim.

2032
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,480
So I think he's going like, well,

2033
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,120
down there are the strawberry fields

2034
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,600
and I don't own those right now,

2035
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,160
but why don't I own those?

2036
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,000
He's upset.

2037
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,840
Those will be mine.

2038
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,280
I'm going.

2039
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,240
I'm working on it.

2040
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,040
I'm going to, I'm going to go after the farmers there.

2041
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,560
Or he's going to raise those orchards to the ground.

2042
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,160
Or he's saying like,

2043
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,960
and there'll be something called the uva bar

2044
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,000
and it'll be over here.

2045
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,240
And they'll kind of the way that in the,

2046
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,280
the direction I'm pointing.

2047
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,920
The prices will be expensive by most measures,

2048
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,440
but okay by park measures.

2049
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,680
And it will be okay to drink there,

2050
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,200
but the gate there is what separates

2051
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,240
and it is a sin to drink on this side of the game.

2052
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,760
But on that side of the drink,

2053
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,720
that side of the gate,

2054
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,720
drink as much as you want and come into this other side

2055
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,520
of the gate as drunk as you want.

2056
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,520
But the, it's all about, it's all about gates, Mickey.

2057
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,360
That's right.

2058
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,840
Well, it'd be interesting to see where exactly

2059
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,680
his index finger is pointing at.

2060
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,520
Oh, good point.

2061
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,880
It's just like that used to be the wrong shot.

2062
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,960
That used to be the tobaccoist.

2063
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,400
And that's where everyone, you can't buy gum.

2064
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,560
Well, you can buy Chesterfield.

2065
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,560
So that's an interesting question.

2066
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,280
So in the reality, he is,

2067
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,200
the statue isn't like we train gets transported back to.

2068
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,680
You're in your version of it.

2069
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,480
He is kind of alive looking at what Disneyland is now.

2070
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,400
Cause what I was saying was like,

2071
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,120
oh, in the future, he's telling Mickey about uva bar

2072
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,120
and the future he's saying this will be yours.

2073
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,280
So your version of it is he's sort of like

2074
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,080
kind of alive right now.

2075
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,920
And he's commenting on what's happening in Disneyland.

2076
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,280
He's being an annoying trivia guy.

2077
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,200
He's bothering his friend telling you what used to be.

2078
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,520
He's one of us.

2079
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,160
He's one of us.

2080
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:48,160
So I was put here in 1983, Blaine Gibson retired in 73.

2081
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,200
I got put here in 83.

2082
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,000
So in the future, I can see the beginning of time

2083
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,880
and I can see the end of time.

2084
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,920
And from, from whence we became just nothing

2085
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,680
to nothing again.

2086
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,080
He's like, he's just at the center of time and space.

2087
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,920
He is.

2088
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,880
An eternal being.

2089
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,120
He's an eternal being.

2090
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,400
And then in Florida, he's like pointing,

2091
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,560
cause you in Florida, you can get a picture

2092
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,720
where that statue and the Roy statue

2093
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,080
are in the frame at the same time.

2094
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:18,920
Right.

2095
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,480
And the Roy statue, which Blaine Gibson also made

2096
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:29,120
is about where Roy was in the dedication opening day.

2097
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,680
Okay.

2098
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,120
And then that one, he's on a bench

2099
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,880
and he is kind of holding Minnie's hand.

2100
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,720
Yeah, that one's a bit so, it's odd, right?

2101
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,560
It is odd.

2102
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,380
Yeah.

2103
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:41,220
It's flirtatious.

2104
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,880
A lot of clarifiers.

2105
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,800
When I read about that, where it's like,

2106
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,240
okay, he's supporting Minnie's hand

2107
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,040
and he's comfy on the bench.

2108
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,320
So she's bothering him.

2109
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,800
He's not bothering her.

2110
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,480
She approached him.

2111
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,520
You understand?

2112
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,440
There should be, there should be,

2113
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,560
there should be statues for every executive

2114
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,800
that ever worked, like a high level.

2115
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,520
So like, Eisen should have got one.

2116
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,040
Of course he'd card Walker,

2117
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,080
all with different Disney characters

2118
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,640
in just random places all over the parks.

2119
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,120
Oh, well, we like the kind of,

2120
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,720
there's the Easter eggs in Tokyo

2121
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:21,080
and what Griffin liked, the ghosts in Paris.

2122
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,440
Yeah, bronze executives.

2123
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,080
Well, here's the question.

2124
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,520
Here's the big question that we face,

2125
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,960
mere months after the thing happened.

2126
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2127
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,400
And they've, I'm talking about Shapek.

2128
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,240
I know what you're talking about.

2129
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,680
And Shapek, I don't think we've talked about this,

2130
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:40,000
but they took a sign away on Castaway Key.

2131
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,120
It's a ship destination, is that correct?

2132
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:43,960
Or where is that?

2133
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,800
I believe so.

2134
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,640
Is that in Disney World?

2135
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,480
What is that?

2136
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,440
That's a cruise ship destination.

2137
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,480
That's one of the islands they own part of.

2138
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,680
There used to be a sign.

2139
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,040
It's not Mushikey.

2140
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:53,880
No, no, no.

2141
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,960
It's Castaway Key.

2142
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,480
He might go there now with it.

2143
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,520
He's got more time.

2144
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,080
But there was a sign that said,

2145
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,640
Bob Shapek, master ship builder, I believe.

2146
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,480
Master ship builder.

2147
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,320
Yeah.

2148
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,160
And they took it away.

2149
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,480
They took it down immediately.

2150
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,120
Did they do this for Paul Pressler

2151
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,800
when they showed him the door?

2152
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,920
I don't know if there was anything of Paul Pressler.

2153
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,840
Oh, okay.

2154
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,520
I just was made aware that this existed

2155
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,840
like a couple of weeks ago before even he got fired.

2156
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,880
So like, no idea.

2157
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,400
It was like two weeks before they're like,

2158
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,320
oh, take a look at this.

2159
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,120
Like some people were making jokes about

2160
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,520
what kind of a ship builder Shapek would be

2161
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,920
because he was still CEO at the time.

2162
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,320
And then he got fired.

2163
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,640
And like a day or two later, the sign is gone.

2164
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,480
Wow.

2165
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,440
So like, yeah, somebody, that was a priority at that time.

2166
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,120
No one was like a year later.

2167
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,960
Oh yeah, by the way, remember we have that,

2168
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,560
maybe we take that down or do something else with it.

2169
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,920
No way.

2170
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,760
Gone.

2171
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,720
That got overnighted to those antique malls

2172
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,360
in the Orlando area.

2173
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,720
Mr. Morrow's probably in a video like,

2174
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,560
oh, look at this.

2175
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,400
You just turn a corner and it's like.

2176
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,120
Look at this Bob Shapek sign.

2177
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:58,040
Well, there's every prop from the Shrek lobby for sale.

2178
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,880
Wow.

2179
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,160
Well, so it puts them in an awkward position

2180
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,080
if we're gonna attribute all these executives.

2181
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,520
You know, look, we don't like the guy,

2182
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,080
but he was there for a long time.

2183
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,560
And in the CEO chair, it's that awkward.

2184
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,680
It's what they have to like, does Conan get a little booth

2185
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,240
at the race through New York thing.

2186
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,840
And I think you have to.

2187
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,360
So at least that's the choice I make.

2188
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,680
So where does, and here,

2189
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:26,560
I'll just say what I think of where Shapek goes.

2190
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,760
Because how do you summarize his legacy?

2191
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,160
And you know, you put Walt with Mickey,

2192
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,760
you put Roy with Minnie,

2193
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,360
they're in these like nice sentimental moments

2194
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,640
with the characters.

2195
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,960
So I think you get Shapek and you put him,

2196
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,360
like you maybe miss him at first.

2197
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:46,040
He's like hunched down, wrapping or like peering

2198
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,520
around the side of one of the ATM machines.

2199
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,600
And kind of just like licking his lips.

2200
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,880
Nom nom nom nom nom.

2201
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,640
And who's he with?

2202
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,000
I think that's the character he's with.

2203
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,840
Oh, is he ATM?

2204
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,240
But if you, that's what I thought.

2205
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,360
But now that you've said that,

2206
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,200
maybe it's a little Scrooge McDuck.

2207
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,560
Scrooge McDuck, like they're both like,

2208
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,600
they're both just like waiting for anybody

2209
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,480
to spill some of the, accidentally drop some of those bills.

2210
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,120
That's good, but isn't Scrooge like hyper competent?

2211
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,280
How good of a, yeah, who's better at their,

2212
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,160
well, I mean, Scrooge having the big tank of money implies

2213
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,680
that there's a surplus.

2214
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,120
Not that a businessman has to be hyper competent.

2215
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,240
But also, but who knows,

2216
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:30,040
I don't know how much his expeditions cost.

2217
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,360
I've been looking, I've been watching some

2218
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,160
of the James Cameron deep dive stuff

2219
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:38,520
with Avatar mania happening in my brain only maybe.

2220
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,000
But he goes on these deep sea diving expeditions.

2221
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,480
But they caught, you start to catch

2222
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,240
like the cost on these things.

2223
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,840
So Scrooge McDuck, it might be the same way.

2224
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,360
Maybe he's opening credits when he's like underwater

2225
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,920
with the thing on and like the,

2226
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,440
he's trying to go for like the dollar bill.

2227
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,880
The sharks are in it, yeah, yeah.

2228
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,400
Yeah, he might find a treasure

2229
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,520
or he might find a dollar bill like that.

2230
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,320
But if every one of those expeditions costs him

2231
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,600
10 million dollars out of pocket,

2232
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,520
the Scrooge enterprise might like,

2233
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,800
it might be days away from plummeting always.

2234
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,560
What's the main character from Treasure Planet's name?

2235
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,520
I don't know that.

2236
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,520
Someone's definitely screaming this.

2237
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,560
My, okay, this is my thing.

2238
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,800
Relax, there's no need to scream.

2239
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,080
Shepek is my.

2240
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,320
There's Milo's from Atlantis.

2241
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,160
Yes.

2242
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,880
Milo I believe is the leader of Atlantis.

2243
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,640
Well, Treasure Planet is Jim Hawkins, like the book.

2244
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,680
Jim Hawkins and it's.

2245
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,800
So that's, that's.

2246
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,640
That's a solid epitome.

2247
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,480
People are screaming.

2248
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,840
And that's why it's Jim's song by John Resnick

2249
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,800
of the Goo Goo Dolls is the song from Treasure Planet.

2250
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,840
Jim's song.

2251
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,240
I believe it's the song is Jim's song, I think.

2252
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,520
I think I recently had another anniversary.

2253
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,800
People are posting. Jim did?

2254
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,360
No, the Treasure Planet.

2255
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,200
I think that's like, this came out X number of years ago.

2256
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,040
I'm sure it did.

2257
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,920
Every movie. It's 2023 now.

2258
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,760
That's the old.

2259
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,600
Every movie has an anniversary.

2260
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,200
But it was interesting, right?

2261
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,480
It was one of those like,

2262
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,120
oh, I should look that up on Disney Plus

2263
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:05,960
cause these screengrads look pretty cool.

2264
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,280
I would watch it.

2265
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,800
Yeah. I know the song.

2266
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,600
So I gotta see the movie.

2267
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,920
I see Dr. Doppler and turned.

2268
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,600
Okay, so Dr. Doppler and Shepek are their partner's statue.

2269
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,640
And I want them.

2270
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,920
Wait, why is Dr. Doppler with Shepek?

2271
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,640
I don't.

2272
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,640
I just like.

2273
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,360
You remember the chain of events.

2274
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,320
Is he greedy?

2275
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,520
I don't know if he's greedy.

2276
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,440
No, I don't know anything about Dr. Doppler.

2277
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,280
I just like the idea that he's.

2278
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,080
He's an alien dog is what he is.

2279
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,120
Perfect. Dr. Delbert Doppler.

2280
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,640
He's voiced by David Ide Pierce.

2281
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,280
I still think he should be with Shepek

2282
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,880
and the bronze partner statue.

2283
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,600
And the dog is peeing.

2284
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,280
Can the dog pee on him or something?

2285
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,240
Like can we get going with blue here?

2286
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,080
Can we work blue?

2287
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,960
Well, look, Dr. Doppler is more human than dog.

2288
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,760
He is a proper gentleman in kind of a long coat.

2289
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,880
So I don't think he's just gonna pee on a fire hydrant

2290
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,160
like a regular dog.

2291
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:08,080
But that said, I think,

2292
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,840
what I'm saying is I think he's the kind of man dog

2293
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,440
that would go use a proper bathroom and clean up,

2294
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:20,080
dop himself with a little urethra cleaner.

2295
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,360
But I think he'll make an exception for Shepek.

2296
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,720
And yes, Dr. Doppler can be peeing on Shepek's head.

2297
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,120
This is just my suggestion.

2298
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,600
It doesn't have to be yours can be Scrooge.

2299
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,440
Mine is Dr. Doppler.

2300
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,120
And he's gonna pee like an adult.

2301
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,400
He's like McGruff almost.

2302
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,240
He's like a McGruff.

2303
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,920
So like standing up, like he unzipped his pants.

2304
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,760
There are things.

2305
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,880
He's just gently peeing on to Bob Shepek.

2306
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,880
Or they're at the urine.

2307
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,600
Like it's the statues in the bathroom

2308
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,240
and they're both at urinals.

2309
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,040
They have to make separate urinals that guests can't use.

2310
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,360
Who was, for a statue, I'd like to see,

2311
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,160
what was the son-in-law's name?

2312
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:55,880
In what?

2313
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,700
The son of?

2314
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,540
Walt's son-in-law.

2315
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,360
Ron Miller.

2316
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:02,200
Ron Miller, the one who everyone was an asshole too.

2317
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,040
So I-

2318
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,720
Why were people an asshole then?

2319
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,120
I think people were just like,

2320
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,680
you are in so far over your head football boy.

2321
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,920
Like he, like-

2322
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,000
Yeah, he did a bad job for sure.

2323
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,320
I mean, he came in already,

2324
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:20,320
he was in a tough spot being Walt's son-in-law.

2325
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,600
And because people immediately,

2326
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,320
I think looked at him as a successor.

2327
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,640
And I don't think he ever had a desire for that role.

2328
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,760
He leads straight into the Eisner era.

2329
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,120
So you want to see a Ron Miller?

2330
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,120
I want to see a Ron Miller in there.

2331
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,960
In what?

2332
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,480
Maybe like Card Walker slapping him in the head.

2333
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,760
But who was he with character wise?

2334
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,920
Is it Dr. Doppler?

2335
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,640
Or is it a different character?

2336
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,480
What character is he with?

2337
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,360
Is he with the dirtier, scratchier,

2338
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,120
first generation rescuers?

2339
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:51,960
Yes.

2340
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,760
More fucked up Bianca and Bernard?

2341
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,240
He's an executive producer on rescuers.

2342
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,720
Okay, that makes sense.

2343
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,840
So he's being, maybe they're biting him.

2344
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,880
He's getting rabies from the rescuers.

2345
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:02,720
Yeah.

2346
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,560
And Card Walker's like,

2347
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,200
what are you doing son?

2348
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,240
What are you doing boy?

2349
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,280
Smacking him on the back of the head.

2350
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,720
There's a few more that I'm sure,

2351
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,260
there's some more things to actually talk about

2352
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,100
that are real.

2353
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,860
But you brought up the escape from New York.

2354
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:16,700
I also, as a thought exercise,

2355
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,060
maybe at the very end,

2356
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,300
thinking about a partner statues

2357
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,860
for other figureheads of things,

2358
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,660
like a Lorne Michaels.

2359
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:24,500
Oh yeah.

2360
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,940
What would be a Lorne Michaels partner statue

2361
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:28,460
in 30 Rock?

2362
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:29,300
There's a little,

2363
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,140
there's not a full bust of him

2364
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,100
at that North Hollywood place,

2365
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,380
but there's a, it's kind of 3D.

2366
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,860
He's kind of like peering out of like a-

2367
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:36,700
The Haunted Mansion?

2368
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,860
Just like a, I don't know what you even call it,

2369
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:39,700
but there's-

2370
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2371
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,360
It feels like an-

2372
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,680
Michael's eyes are following you.

2373
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,520
Right.

2374
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,760
Like you're a first season featured player.

2375
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,800
Right, and your job is in jeopardy.

2376
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2377
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,640
And a Don Pardo as well.

2378
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,640
Oh wow, okay.

2379
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,200
Go walk around this place, it's fun.

2380
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,360
I got it.

2381
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,680
But anyways, well is there real stuff left?

2382
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,520
I don't know.

2383
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,480
I don't know, there's nothing like,

2384
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,360
look there's nothing that interesting.

2385
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,640
Yeah, I don't think so.

2386
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,940
You can buy replicas of the partner statue

2387
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:06,780
pretty much at any price point.

2388
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:07,620
Okay, so price point,

2389
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:08,960
this is what I was looking up,

2390
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,080
is that there are so many versions

2391
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,080
of the partner statue you can buy.

2392
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,120
Yes, Disney and Etsy.

2393
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:16,960
Like you can-

2394
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:17,800
Yes, everywhere.

2395
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,080
Any level, any material.

2396
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:19,920
Yes, yes, everywhere.

2397
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,760
EBay, versions, like there's so many,

2398
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,800
like Tokyo and then it's different materials

2399
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,760
and some are high end, some are not.

2400
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,480
Even just looking at Shop Disney right now

2401
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,600
or whatever the hell it's called.

2402
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,440
It's Shop Disney, right?

2403
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,360
Yes.

2404
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,480
There's four, you can buy,

2405
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,440
you can't buy a version of it now

2406
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,220
because there are ornaments and there are statues.

2407
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,380
You can buy a puzzle of the partner statue.

2408
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,700
You can buy a throw blanket.

2409
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:47,300
You can buy a sketchbook with the partners on the front

2410
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:51,260
and you can buy a watch with the partners on the face of it.

2411
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,700
So that's just currently on Shop Disney.

2412
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:54,980
Blanket is weird.

2413
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:55,820
The blanket is weird.

2414
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,860
I go to bed with the partners on me.

2415
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:01,540
This one was, I don't know,

2416
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:05,940
this was just like the Google shopping preview.

2417
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:07,380
I don't know it's still in stock

2418
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,980
but it was showing on Shop Disney.

2419
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:13,980
The laser cube, like engraved laser image of it.

2420
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,260
Yeah, there are, and there are some,

2421
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:18,460
we should post these.

2422
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,540
There are some like facsimiles of this

2423
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:25,980
that are funny in the sense, like this looks like shit.

2424
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:26,820
Like, uh-huh.

2425
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:27,660
Uh-huh.

2426
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,820
I'll show you.

2427
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,020
Okay.

2428
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:32,940
Let's see.

2429
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:34,900
They both look a little sickly.

2430
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,300
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2431
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,940
I know, it looks like somebody pinched Walt's neck.

2432
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:39,900
Yeah.

2433
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,020
So there are like, I feel like this is one

2434
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:47,260
of the biggest successes in their last couple decades,

2435
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:49,140
just in the sense of marketing.

2436
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,180
Because I think it is what I said

2437
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,780
where I think most people would go,

2438
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,740
oh, that's been here since it opened

2439
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,020
or this has been since Walt died.

2440
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:56,220
Yes, really feels that way.

2441
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:57,060
Yeah, yeah.

2442
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:58,780
Like it feels seamlessly integrated into the park.

2443
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:03,780
It's probably one of the top 10 most iconic things you see.

2444
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,980
Like if you were somebody who went for the first time,

2445
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:08,420
I feel like that would be in their top five or 10 things

2446
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,860
if you showed them pictures.

2447
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:11,820
Oh yeah, I remember that, I remember that, I remember that.

2448
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:12,860
Sure, yeah.

2449
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,220
So like, and then the merch,

2450
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:17,220
I feel like the merch is an example of its success

2451
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,180
or its popularity basically.

2452
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:23,660
This feels like a Saving Mr. Banks, second unit crew,

2453
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:26,460
someone going, hey, make sure to get a shot of that thing

2454
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:29,540
for the montage at the end.

2455
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:31,660
It's a, I think they did what they set out to do.

2456
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:35,620
I think like let's mythologize our founder

2457
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:37,900
and see, and like, and I don't think I realized

2458
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:41,180
the extent to which it was, it was merchandise along with that.

2459
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,420
Yes, it really, there's a lot of Tokyo versions of it,

2460
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:46,380
like a Tokyo Disney, like little statues

2461
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,580
and things I found on eBay.

2462
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:52,580
There is a $406 version on the website Mercari,

2463
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,860
but then there's also a $60 version on Poshmark.

2464
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:58,860
So, you know, set your price and then shop.

2465
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,740
Yeah, it's hard to tell which ones are which

2466
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,740
because it feels like some of them look exactly the same

2467
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:06,020
and one's $400 and one's $25.

2468
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:08,140
So I don't know, maybe somebody is like an expert

2469
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:12,820
on the partner statue toys or stat, they could like really,

2470
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:14,500
if you go to Antique Roadshow,

2471
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:17,580
somebody has a jeweler's loop and they can examine these

2472
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,380
and tell you what's exactly, what's valuable.

2473
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:23,420
The other thing is that in 2020,

2474
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:27,940
they cleaned the Disneyland statue in November, 2020.

2475
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:28,780
I forget.

2476
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:30,620
Oh, that's a great, like what else do we do

2477
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:31,580
while it's closed?

2478
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:34,020
We can finally clean the, it's interesting.

2479
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:36,220
They made the bronze shinier.

2480
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:38,620
And there's a whole explanation on Disney Parks blog,

2481
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:40,380
Wednesday, November 18th,

2482
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:42,620
to commemorate Mickey Mouse's birthday,

2483
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,940
we were excited to reveal a special surprise

2484
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,900
at the Disneyland Resort.

2485
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,900
Following a refurbishment, the iconic partner statue

2486
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:51,900
in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland

2487
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,420
has been restored to its original grandeur.

2488
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,820
From 20 years ago.

2489
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:57,660
From 20 years ago.

2490
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,780
20 years ago.

2491
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:02,500
For Mickey's birthday, we cleaned him.

2492
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,900
So he was cleaned.

2493
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,220
Wait, they cleaned Mickey,

2494
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,660
but they never got around to that new entry

2495
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:11,380
in signage and planter for Tomorrowland, I feel like.

2496
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,340
What was that?

2497
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,180
Wasn't there supposed to be something like,

2498
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,540
and this is coming to Tomorrowland.

2499
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:20,220
Yeah, there was some picture, I feel like,

2500
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,100
that maybe they did, maybe they didn't,

2501
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,380
but I can't remember what it was

2502
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:26,660
because that's another traffic stopper

2503
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,740
but it's mostly because of the ride.

2504
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:29,900
Yeah.

2505
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,300
But yeah, no, there's an explanation

2506
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:36,580
if you wanna know about oxidization of bronze.

2507
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,620
Well, you're the one looking at the information.

2508
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:40,660
How much do you wanna say it?

2509
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,420
Honestly, not that much.

2510
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:46,100
I mean, it's not, I don't know.

2511
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,020
Oh, I wanna read this.

2512
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:50,100
After cleaning, various chemicals were applied

2513
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,700
and heated with a blowtorch

2514
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:55,100
to create a reaction infused with the bronze.

2515
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:59,780
So they had to reapply things and then blowtorch it.

2516
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:01,340
Blowtorch Walt and Mickey.

2517
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,180
Well, that's great.

2518
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,100
I wouldn't have that.

2519
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,700
I would buy all the merchandise stuff.

2520
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:08,780
Is there video of a guy with a blowtorch?

2521
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:10,620
Just blasting Walt.

2522
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,100
Blasting Walt's crotch

2523
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,940
to get the shinier bronze on his pants.

2524
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,660
Maybe there probably is

2525
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,380
because they have to make those little featurettes like,

2526
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,820
oh, we're cleaning the park and this is what we do.

2527
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,380
So there has to be some documentation of it, I would think,

2528
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,100
but maybe it's in the Disney vault and we won't see it.

2529
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:29,980
It doesn't have the oxidization

2530
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:32,780
that some statues that you can feel

2531
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,780
like a lot of college campuses have.

2532
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:37,100
Oh, and then there's a statue of the Nittany Lion

2533
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,100
on Penn State's campus.

2534
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,860
Everyone rubs it for good luck.

2535
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:42,580
So there's a portion of it that's really shiny

2536
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,380
because it's worn away over the years

2537
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:45,220
because everyone's touching it.

2538
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,420
So it's not like Walt's butt is like everyone hits it

2539
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:49,420
on the way down Main Street.

2540
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,580
I don't think there's a tradition

2541
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:52,780
of people grabbing Walt's ass, no.

2542
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,900
Oh, the only one you can touch other than the bust

2543
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,780
is the one at the lot in Burbank.

2544
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,340
Oh, that one is just on the ground.

2545
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,180
That was just on the ground.

2546
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:04,100
So you could rub its belly for good luck,

2547
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,940
Mickey or Walt's belly for good luck.

2548
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,220
You gotta be on the lot.

2549
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,980
There's no tours of the lot really.

2550
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:10,580
Yeah, you gotta get invited.

2551
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:12,020
I've only been a few times.

2552
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:13,060
I didn't touch his butt.

2553
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,860
And I didn't touch his butt either.

2554
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,180
Have you ever been on the lot?

2555
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,020
A few times, yeah.

2556
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:19,300
Okay, did you touch it?

2557
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,220
I don't think I touched his butt.

2558
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,980
Is it by the Legends Garden?

2559
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,100
Is it by the Disney Legend Facts?

2560
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,700
Yeah, it's in front of the Dwarfs building.

2561
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,700
Oh, and I just saw a photo that they put

2562
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:34,420
a Santa hat on Walt and give him a scarf too.

2563
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,700
Oh, are you there now?

2564
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,340
It's December as we're recording this.

2565
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:38,180
That's fun.

2566
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:39,420
Yeah, yeah.

2567
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:42,660
I think they put Santa hats on the Dwarfs too.

2568
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,500
Oh really?

2569
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,820
I saw one on Dopey and it looked weird

2570
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,820
because Dopey's in a weird spot

2571
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:49,340
and it kind of looked a little horrific.

2572
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:50,180
He's already got the,

2573
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,740
because they all have hats that are kind of Santa hats.

2574
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,620
Double hats?

2575
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,660
Oh yeah, the Dwarfs already have Santa hats.

2576
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,060
Well Dopey does, right?

2577
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:58,380
Do they all have hats like that?

2578
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:59,540
Yeah, they got those, yeah.

2579
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:02,220
I believe every Dwarf has a hat.

2580
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,300
But is it the same hat?

2581
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,020
Because many are bald underneath, I'm not sure.

2582
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,100
Let me see, okay, they all have, yes,

2583
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,180
they all have the same type of hat.

2584
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,020
Yeah.

2585
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:11,860
Yeah, all kind of Santa hats,

2586
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,500
they just don't have the ball at the end.

2587
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,580
So they save some money, Disney just add the ball.

2588
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:17,420
Just add the ball.

2589
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:19,940
I just save you some fabric costs.

2590
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,060
If we're coming to the end,

2591
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:24,700
Mike, I've been stewing on it since you mentioned it,

2592
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,220
attributing other non-Disney executives.

2593
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,100
Not too far from here, a magical place

2594
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:34,180
with a Walt statue and a Walt bust

2595
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:36,660
within easy driving distance.

2596
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:40,740
We're also near a place, a very important place,

2597
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:43,620
which is the now former NBC Studios,

2598
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:47,020
which is where the Johnny Carson Tonight Show took place

2599
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,660
and also, more importantly,

2600
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:50,500
the Jay Leno Tonight Show.

2601
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,900
And there is nothing acknowledging,

2602
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,380
there's a nice park acknowledging Johnny Carson,

2603
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,940
but there is nothing acknowledging Mr. Leno

2604
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,620
and his time and how meaningful he is

2605
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:01,060
to the Burbank community.

2606
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:06,940
Or the executives who made so many of the great decisions

2607
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:09,820
that created TV magic in that time.

2608
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:14,540
So I have an idea of a partner statue for the former NBC.

2609
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,380
I don't know who's gonna foot the bill

2610
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,500
because they don't own it anymore.

2611
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,580
It's me, y'all have to do it.

2612
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:22,900
So I will pay for a statue that is

2613
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:26,820
all time great executive Jeff Zucker.

2614
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:31,820
And there are two squares, kind of like hopscotch squares

2615
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:37,340
on the ground and one says 10 and one says 1130.

2616
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:39,540
And he's like kind of ushered,

2617
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:42,980
he's holding Jay's hand and ushering him over,

2618
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:45,140
wait, I guess it would have to be, wait, wait, no,

2619
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,740
maybe it's just like, or it's just like a box,

2620
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:53,660
it's like a little Olympic riser that says Tonight Show Host.

2621
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,820
And he's helping Jay up the stairs

2622
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:59,500
to let him back up to his post.

2623
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:02,420
And then there's also a bronze Conan

2624
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:04,580
who he's shoving to the ground.

2625
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,900
He's putting his foot on his head.

2626
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:09,900
He's forcibly kicking him off of the riser.

2627
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,060
So we need three figures here

2628
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,940
and it's gonna have to be active and violent.

2629
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:17,500
But I think we gotta acknowledge the spot

2630
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,540
where that wonderful decision.

2631
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:22,220
How much do you think you can get,

2632
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:24,780
how much could you get that sculpted for?

2633
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,340
10 grand, 20, 50?

2634
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:29,420
I don't know much about it.

2635
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:32,980
I'll talk to the people who put that Batman sculpture.

2636
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:35,940
That's a cool, that's my favorite statue ever.

2637
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,540
It's really good, it's pretty awesome.

2638
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:39,880
That's a good, for no reason suddenly

2639
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,860
there's a statue of Batman,

2640
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:43,780
inexplicably tenor Batman.

2641
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:46,300
I saw it at a movie theater in Burbank, California

2642
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,460
by the yard house.

2643
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:48,980
Yeah, it gets in your way

2644
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:50,900
if you're trying to walk up to the yard house.

2645
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:55,740
There's like an eight foot, just Jim Lee artist

2646
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:59,620
drawn Batman statue that is so cool.

2647
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:02,060
And people, I saw this myself.

2648
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,180
I saw pictures going around

2649
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:05,460
and then I happened to be down there.

2650
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,500
People left flowers at that statue

2651
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,220
when Kevin Conroy passed away.

2652
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:10,060
Oh yeah, I did see that.

2653
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:11,940
Long time voice of Batman.

2654
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:12,780
It's become a spot to do your work.

2655
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:13,620
It's a memorial, yeah.

2656
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:15,500
It's a spot to do your Batman related grieving.

2657
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,420
Yes. Yeah.

2658
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,500
Like Batman would do at his parents grave,

2659
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,900
which depicted in every movie you've ever seen.

2660
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,700
So if you're sad about something that happens

2661
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,620
in the Batman universe,

2662
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:28,300
go throw a pearl necklace on the ground.

2663
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,540
Yeah, and finish your yard at the yard house

2664
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:32,980
and then go do whatever that is.

2665
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:34,900
Yeah, whatever memorializing.

2666
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,780
My statue, I, you know,

2667
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:40,060
Warner Brothers a few years ago

2668
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:44,500
moved the DC Comics offices to the Burbank,

2669
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:47,660
Warner Brothers properties.

2670
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,500
And they were assholes about it.

2671
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,340
They didn't handle it well.

2672
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:56,340
But, you know, I think in the vein of the Batman statue,

2673
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:02,500
I want a bronze statue of Batman co-creator Bob Kane,

2674
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:05,500
who was also a notorious asshole.

2675
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:09,900
So I would like a statue featuring another insane man

2676
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,740
comic book artist Jim Steranko,

2677
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:15,580
who's now a right wing crank on Twitter.

2678
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:19,980
But he has a story of slapping Bob Kane across the face

2679
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:23,980
at a comic convention after Bob Kane did a little like,

2680
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,020
how you doing kid?

2681
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,500
Yeah, he gave him like one of these,

2682
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,500
like a condescending thing to Jim Steranko

2683
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:32,220
at a Comic-Con in like 1970 something or eight.

2684
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:35,060
And Jim Steranko stewed on it for a day.

2685
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:38,620
And then when he saw Bob Kane again, he bitch slapped him.

2686
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:39,460
Wow.

2687
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,140
And so if there's a way for them both

2688
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:44,420
to be slapping each other.

2689
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:45,260
Yeah.

2690
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:46,980
I think you can capture all that at once.

2691
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,620
Everyone hated Bob Kane.

2692
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,460
Yeah.

2693
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,540
And he stole a lot of the,

2694
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,260
like he was a guy who took sole credit

2695
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,860
for a lot of things when this guy Bill Finger.

2696
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:55,660
Bill Finger kind of shafted, yeah.

2697
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:58,380
Yeah, the Bob Kane bitch slap.

2698
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,940
Mike, is there an executive that you would like to honor?

2699
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:04,260
Yeah, I mean, I guess I kept getting stuck on Lorne,

2700
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:06,540
just being like, but who would it be

2701
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,900
with Lorne and the partner?

2702
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,060
I mean, would it be Chivvy?

2703
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:11,940
Would it be Billy or Danny?

2704
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:13,820
I don't think it can't be them.

2705
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:14,660
It has to be something.

2706
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:15,860
I think it's the bees.

2707
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:20,220
And you make the Mickey decision

2708
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,260
that the bees are small.

2709
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,080
Oh, interesting.

2710
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,740
He's holding hands with a bunch of small bees.

2711
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:28,700
Like real, like right to scale normal bees?

2712
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:29,620
I'm not sure.

2713
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:31,940
Or there's a handful of bees.

2714
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:34,100
It's Lorne with a handful of bees.

2715
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:36,580
Oh and it's, who were the bees on the show?

2716
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,420
Was it a cut of cut of cut of cut of cut of cut of cut of cut of?

2717
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,620
It was.

2718
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:39,500
Yeah.

2719
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:42,740
Could you just have all of them in little bee costumes?

2720
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,580
Okay, how about this?

2721
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:46,140
They're small enough you could put every cast member ever

2722
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:49,900
in his hands sculpted as tiny little bees.

2723
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:54,180
Because really what is that show other than like a beehive

2724
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:57,900
that he's curated to help nourish the bees.

2725
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:58,740
Okay.

2726
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,580
And they made him honey

2727
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:03,060
but then they were able to fly and start their own lives.

2728
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,860
This is perfect.

2729
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:07,300
So now here's what we're gonna plus it up even more.

2730
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,380
Take that scene from the Winnie the Pooh ride

2731
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:11,060
where he's like stuck in the big hive

2732
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:13,020
and he's covered in honey.

2733
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,820
And Lorne is popping out of that same thing

2734
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,380
and he's got honey all over his face.

2735
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:19,220
And he's holding-

2736
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,060
Lorne dripping with honey.

2737
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:21,940
Lorne Michaels is dripping with honey.

2738
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:23,840
Well, wait, if he's dripping with honey

2739
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,220
then there should be some bee,

2740
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:29,700
all the non-cast member who like Steve Martin

2741
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:33,700
should be a bee on his face and Buck Henry and-

2742
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:34,540
George Carlin.

2743
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:35,980
George Carlin.

2744
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,540
All the first year hosts.

2745
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:41,180
People just hang, yeah, weird old Desi Arnaz.

2746
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:43,020
Desi Arnaz.

2747
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:43,860
And then, yeah, so he's-

2748
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:47,580
Gerald Ford's speech writer, Ron Nesson, I think.

2749
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:49,180
I think that's right.

2750
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:50,020
Sybil Shepherd.

2751
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:51,100
More names to learn.

2752
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:54,260
Whoever was hanging out, Candice Bergen, Sybil Shepherd,

2753
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:56,740
they're just kind of smoking cigarettes on his shoulder.

2754
01:40:56,740 --> 01:41:00,100
Yeah, so yeah, they're all tiny bees.

2755
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:02,820
And then you could do as many as you want.

2756
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:05,140
It's gonna be a little bit tough to, you know,

2757
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:07,540
sculpt that tiny at that tiny scale.

2758
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,040
But the technology allows it, I bet.

2759
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,860
And I think it's very clear.

2760
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,540
I think people will know exactly

2761
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:15,020
what, people will follow the logic.

2762
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,260
Oh, got it, because he's nurturing like a beekeeper.

2763
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:18,100
Yeah.

2764
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,860
Lorne is winning the poo in a-

2765
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,180
Lorne is a poo.

2766
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,860
And it's bees because of the bees sketch

2767
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,860
from 50 years ago, yes.

2768
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:26,500
And then in his shirt pocket,

2769
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,860
there's a little Paul McCartney, a little John Lennon

2770
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,260
going like, should we go down there?

2771
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:32,100
There's talking.

2772
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:33,060
They're talking.

2773
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,900
They're talking.

2774
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:36,220
Jason, you're adding a little too much to this.

2775
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:37,060
Oh, excuse me.

2776
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:38,380
It's gonna be a little expensive.

2777
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:39,620
That was what it put in.

2778
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:41,300
I'm thinking more of cost.

2779
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:46,060
I don't mean to overstep my boundaries.

2780
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,020
I didn't say this was blue sky, did I?

2781
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,300
Maybe I did actually say it.

2782
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,540
I may have said blue sky.

2783
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:54,100
All right, so the Beatles are out.

2784
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:55,140
Yeah, you're cut.

2785
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:57,100
But everyone who's ever been on the show,

2786
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,700
including hosts, as bees.

2787
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:00,500
Yeah, Scott's idea, good.

2788
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:01,500
Jason's bad.

2789
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:02,340
Yeah, yeah, yes, not.

2790
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:03,180
My logic, great.

2791
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:05,140
Steve Forbes up there.

2792
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:08,140
We gotta get Giuliani and Trump.

2793
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:08,980
Yeah.

2794
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:09,900
It's a call.

2795
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:10,740
We did it.

2796
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:11,580
I think we did it.

2797
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:14,380
We had great ideas for statues

2798
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:17,620
that should be installed all over the globe.

2799
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:18,660
More statues.

2800
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:19,500
More statues.

2801
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,660
More statues with slightly different quotes

2802
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,180
on the plaque every time.

2803
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:24,980
Yes, those are not exactly something he said.

2804
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:25,820
Just like real life.

2805
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:27,300
He forgot to mention that they're slightly different.

2806
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:30,180
Yeah, they're all different, a little.

2807
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:32,340
And one of them, just the Disneyland one even,

2808
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:35,260
it strings together two things he said.

2809
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:37,460
Yeah, it's a mush up, yeah.

2810
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,460
Yeah, we just didn't have time.

2811
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:44,540
We had to talk about urethras and cast bees.

01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,220
