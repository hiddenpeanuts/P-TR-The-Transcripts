1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Warning, the following podcast features live invasions by actual wildlife, an evil botanicus

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,880
addicted to sky murder and fawning tributes to universal wetness.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,800
For the first time in a long time, it's an actual recent ride, the secret life of pets

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
off the leash on Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,200
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the podcast about theme parks where we misread today's ride's

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,960
title long ago and are very disappointed it is not the secret life of pests and that John

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,880
Leguizamo is not involved in any way.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Scott Gardner, clearly agreement from Mike Carlson.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I agree.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
I heard you mumble to yourself, this is a long dog walk too, and I was like, oh, is

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
that part of the joke?

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,240
Because today the topic would have something to do with dog and walking.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
I could have saved that.

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
That could have been a good little addendum.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
At the end there, right.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,880
Thanks for putting it in.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,840
Yeah, so no, I'm glad we got some Leguizamo in there.

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,400
I was just talking about Leguizamo the other day.

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,320
I think in regards to his spawn character, the clown, is it Jason?

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,600
Jason shared in here as well.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Is the clown the name of the spawn villain or is it clown?

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
I think just, yeah, I think just clown.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,120
I did read the first collection of spawn comics and watched the spawn movie during quarantine

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
times.

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Okay, so it's clown.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
And I think, I believe it is clown.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,760
We haven't had enough clown discourse on the show.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,200
I mean, we have had a lot of clown discourse, but we haven't had a lot of clown discourse.

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
If you know what I'm saying.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,560
Okay, thank you for clarifying because I think plenty of lowercase c clown.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
It's been a little too much.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Not clown, it's clown.

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Okay.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,480
That is with a C, capital C, not capital K, not evil K clown?

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
Yeah, go back and listen to the way I'm saying it and you'll hear it.

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
You know what I'm saying?

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
You can tell the difference.

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Clown, yeah, you put a little thing on it.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,440
Clown, not clown.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,960
If we're calling out John Loquizamo's characters in my, I don't really know about the pest,

44
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,960
but now I've looked it up to see that the character's name is Pestario Vargas, which

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,200
I like.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,080
And that this is a, it was a remake of a Stan Laurel project.

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Really?

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,880
Or wait, maybe inspired by a short story.

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,720
I can't, there's also a Stan Laurel called the Pest from 22 and then there's a 24 short

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
story.

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Maybe not, maybe not actually.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You might be conflating those things.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,880
Immediate error, immediately rescinded.

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,720
But I like that idea that it's a Stan Laurel remake by John Loquizamo.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,280
So we're actually half right.

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,720
John Loquizamo's character is named Clown.

57
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,000
He is also referred to as Violator.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Really?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Violator?

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm not a big spawn guy, but interesting.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,200
That's what happens when you are one of the most powerful people in comics with complete

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,080
control over your product and you are 22 years old.

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,880
You're like, the bad guy is named Clown and also Violator.

65
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,640
You're saying, you're saying no non-powerful comic book artist writer at 22 would have

66
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,520
been able to have a character with two names.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
It would be no way.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
I just mean it's very extreme.

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,520
It's very like, you know.

70
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,680
Image Comics, Todd McFarlane on the top of the world.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm going to give that character two names.

72
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm mad with power.

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,280
I'm drunk on power.

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
The indulgence.

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Oh, disgusting.

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm going to ask for a nicer chair to draw my comics in.

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,400
Do you think there's a chance if the pest has, I've actually never seen the pest, if

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,880
it had a theme park in it, at this point we would be calling our listeners pests.

80
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,080
Is there a chance of that?

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
I think there is.

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,120
I might call some listeners pests.

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
Not very many.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,680
So maybe there is a chance.

85
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,120
Maybe we watch this movie, then we will start applying.

86
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
I have seen this movie.

87
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,080
I watched it at like a summer camp thing, I think.

88
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,480
And I think they would just get whatever new releases were out.

89
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,040
Because I remember watching The Rock, I remember watching Pest.

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,320
The Stupids.

91
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,680
And National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation.

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Wow, that's...

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,600
This is a killer time, honestly.

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,520
I've seen Vegas Vacation 20 plus times.

95
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,240
I recently heard an argument made that Vegas Vacation better than Christmas Vacation.

97
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Agree, disagree.

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,480
I know, it's like Christmas Vacation is sort of like set in stone due to the holiday perennial

99
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
nature.

100
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,440
But I've seen Vegas Vacation more.

101
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,280
It's what I did to avoid election results on the fateful night in 2020 when we didn't

102
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
end up knowing anything.

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Oh, right, right.

104
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I instead...

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Yeah.

106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,800
Actually I ended up, because as a new parent you kind of split movies in two, and because

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,920
the election results weren't done, I got a little extra.

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,960
All right, we'll continue avoiding on night two and we'll continue with the second half

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
of Vegas Vacation.

110
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
It was a great time.

111
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Vegas Vacation, maybe it's the best one.

112
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,480
Maybe it's the best of the vacations.

113
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
I'll keep...

114
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,760
Yeah, I'll keep nudging it up the shirts.

115
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Yeah, maybe.

116
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,080
Being that I associate it with Donald Trump not definitively winning immediately, I don't

117
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,840
associate him with Donald Trump losing because we didn't know yet.

118
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,160
But I do associate it with going to bed two nights in a row and Donald Trump did not win.

119
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,080
So just for that...

120
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,960
So it's risen a little bit in the ranks.

121
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,720
Yeah, even though one of his top supporters, one of his top recent supporters is in the

122
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,040
film Randy Quaid.

123
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Yeah, right.

124
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, we'll go back and do...

125
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,640
There's obviously a theme...

126
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,240
There's themed experiences in Vegas Vacation so I think there's probably some sort of episode

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
we can do.

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
It's prime mirage.

129
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,360
It is mirage in pristine condition.

130
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,880
So maybe just for that you got to...

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,960
Wayne Six-Frey and Roy also in prime condition.

132
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,360
Wayne Newton in prime condition.

133
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,000
Although he's as he has been for many decades.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,400
Yeah, he's been...

135
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,960
He is like, what would you say, like frozen in time?

136
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Frozen in...

137
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Living wax figure.

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
Living wax figure.

139
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,800
But not in like a scary horror movie way where he's like somebody made him that way to be

140
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
mean.

141
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,480
He's got to be a Trump guy too, right?

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Most likely.

143
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
There's no way.

144
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,480
There'd be no reason we would have to hear about it.

145
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,880
There's zero current relevance to Wayne Newton so he would never shove this in front of our

146
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
faces.

147
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
That's true.

148
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
I'll just double check that before.

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Oh yeah, yeah.

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
That's worth a Google.

151
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,360
Let's throw it in when you say...

152
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,840
So all of this talk aside, all of this 1997 movie talk aside, it's all distracting from

153
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,600
that we are at last talking about a new ride.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's been a very long time since we talked about something within the four month radius

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
of it coming out.

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,960
So this is fresh out the gate for 2021, unless you count that it was supposed to open in

157
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,040
2020 and did not, obviously.

158
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,880
Real quick, 2016, I was correct at least.

159
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,960
As far as 2016 is concerned, yes, their support was there.

160
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I don't know if it lasted though.

161
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,120
Well, it's how many people drew the line after the events of January.

162
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm sure Trump lost him there.

163
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Yeah, of course.

164
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
There's no way.

165
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
All his supporters.

166
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
No possible way.

167
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,400
Yes, a new ride, new exciting experience.

168
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,840
Back to the...

169
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,960
I like to say my famous catchphrase that I stole from Tom Cruise, back to the movies.

170
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,560
But today I like to say back to ride the movies.

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Pretty good.

172
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
I kind of stole that from Jason the other day too, although if he kind of took it from

173
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,000
you starting to do it, it's part of the shared lexicon, I feel.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I think he stole it from me.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Well, it's a homage to you.

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Yeah.

177
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,200
Because I was trying to do the physicality.

178
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,400
I was watching your video and I was watching the Tom Cruise video and then I tried to replicate

179
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
it.

180
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Yes, right.

181
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Yes.

182
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,320
You're all tributing Tom Cruise's second most famous clip from the last year.

183
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,360
The distant second from the one where he yelled a bunch.

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,960
Yes, he screamed at people for standing not six feet apart, I guess, not following COVID

185
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
protocols.

186
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I couldn't even tell you what it was.

187
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
That's the danger.

188
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,240
We don't know the image that he's looking at.

189
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,680
I think a lot of people were like, oh, that's good that he's taking this very seriously.

190
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,320
We really have no idea what actually happened or what he was losing his mind about.

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,280
We don't know if it was somebody like their elbow verged on five and a half feet and he

192
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,760
lost his mind and you're like, oh, something's wrong.

193
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,960
Or if he miscalculated because they're in England, so he's converting it to meters and

194
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,960
the standard is different between meters and feet.

195
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Possible.

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,720
Yes, I think a lot of people were like, well, good, he's taking this seriously, which is

197
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
important.

198
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,400
But then you cut to the other side and there's a 10-year-old boy so scared.

199
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Kwoots.

200
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,680
Yeah, we don't know for sure.

201
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,440
And I think some other people after the fact were like, oh, that's good he's taking it

202
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
seriously.

203
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,360
I might not have screamed at everyone like they were children, which is also a bad way

204
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
to deal with children.

205
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,920
But that also is kind of one of the few speeds on a film set, screaming at people like they're

206
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
children.

207
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,680
That sure was in the days of Scott Rudin.

208
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,280
Yeah, the classic era of Hollywood, yes, is more of a screaming time.

209
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,360
But this new era where we all were polite, everyone's polite now.

210
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh, yeah, for sure.

211
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Yeah.

212
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,480
Film sets aren't filled with the most gifted people you've ever met and also the dumbest

213
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
motherfuckers you've ever met.

214
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm just curious who you're...

215
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,360
I'm curious to see a shoot and see captions over who you're talking about.

216
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,800
Yeah, it'd be interesting.

217
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,280
You know, it's very complicated.

218
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,160
Oftentimes if you slap on associate blank or associate blank, they're either the hardest

219
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,520
working person in Hollywood or the worst fail son you've ever met.

220
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,320
And there's really very little common ground.

221
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,920
I hope you're talking about your specific experience of being a PA on American Gladiators

222
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,160
and that there's some producer in there that you're really...

223
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,880
I met some terrible people working on that.

224
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,440
There's some maniacs who work in reality TV.

225
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
But not the gladiators.

226
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,680
No, the gladiators by all accounts, very polite.

227
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,720
But not the associate gladiators.

228
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
They are dipshits.

229
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,600
Do you still stay in touch with some of the gladiators?

230
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,560
I don't stay in touch with any of the gladiators.

231
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,720
I do not stay in touch with Gina Carano.

232
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Thank you very much.

233
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Oh, was she one of the gladiators?

234
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
What?

235
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Yes.

236
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
When you did that, she was one of them?

237
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Yes, she was one of them.

238
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Wow.

239
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
What was her name?

240
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Yeah, I think she was.

241
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Pastario?

242
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,520
I will look this up.

243
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Oh my gosh.

244
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
That's a big revel...

245
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
How is that not come up before?

246
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
That's crazy.

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I've never said that.

248
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
Gina and Hulk in one place?

249
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
There's so many shared interests there.

250
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Whoa.

251
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Canceled the episode.

252
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Yes.

253
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,120
Offering Hulk Hogan some Nature Valley granola bars.

254
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Gina Carano was Crush.

255
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Crush?

256
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Wow.

257
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Wow.

258
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,360
Not as perennially lovable as the turtle.

259
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,280
No, no.

260
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,000
Not as good as that.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,720
Not as beloved as the soda.

262
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Orange Crush.

263
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Yes.

264
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Yeah, there's expiration.

266
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Wow.

267
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Interesting.

268
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
I mean, the nicest people were Leila Ali, the co-host, Muhammad Ali's daughter.

269
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Sure.

270
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
And the guy Wolf.

271
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,520
Wolf was a real sweetheart.

272
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Wow.

273
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,880
People don't know what we're talking about.

274
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,320
Jason, like over a decade ago, was a PA on the rebooted American Gladiators at Universal

275
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,760
Studios on the Universal Lot?

276
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,000
No, on the Sony Lot.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,840
On the biggest sound stage on the Sony Lot.

278
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Oh, wow.

279
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Which may be where...

280
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,080
I don't know if it's the same stage, but possibly if it's that big.

281
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,040
It might be where Captain EO shot.

282
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
I believe that was a Sony Lot.

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
That's very possible.

284
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,120
Audience holding sound stage, also gigantic, was where a lot of the Wizard of Oz was shot.

285
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Whoa, whoa.

286
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,640
Also where that hanging...

287
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Possibly.

288
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,360
...the definitely real hanging happened.

289
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Oh my gosh.

290
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,280
That's where you and Wolf met.

291
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Yeah.

292
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,720
I'm gonna stop for a second and deal with this scary...

293
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Oh my god, yeah.

294
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
I think it was a dragonfly, right?

295
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
It was.

296
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
I don't know.

297
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Is it?

298
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Is it a beetle?

299
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
It looks like a scarab beetle.

300
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
I'm not gonna cut this.

301
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,560
I think one of the scarabs from the Mummy Ride at Universal is in Scott's yard.

302
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
He had escaped.

303
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
We aren't that far from it.

304
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
I mean, Mike, you were there earlier.

305
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
I was just like...

306
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,280
Did a scarab beetle hitch a ride with you?

307
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,880
Can I get a picture that will actually convey this?

308
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,120
That is a really scary bug.

309
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,840
It's so big and black and thick.

310
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,400
If you hear really embarrassing screams midway through this episode, it is because it is

311
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,280
on one of us.

312
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,080
And perhaps if you're the most scared screams followed by silence, it's that a thousand

313
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,040
of him showed up and consumed one of us whole.

314
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
It's got golden wings.

315
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,440
It's kind of beautiful, honestly.

316
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
It is beautiful.

317
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,580
It is beautiful.

318
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,600
It's luring us, distracting us.

319
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,920
Is it having a problem flying?

320
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm not sure.

321
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
I hope so.

322
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,680
Maybe, but what if it just comes over to our feet and asks for help?

323
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Help me.

324
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Oh my gosh.

325
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
This is really wild.

326
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
It's me, Pestario.

327
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
The pest.

328
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Oh my god.

329
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,360
Pestario, you've transformed into a scarab beetle.

330
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,840
A real little pest.

331
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Wow.

332
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
You know what?

333
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,520
Not the only wildlife, not wildlife, not the only animal in the yard, because this is an

334
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,040
episode about the pet's ride.

335
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,840
And we are joined by, who just jumped into Jason's lap on top of your laptop.

337
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,640
This is fantastic.

338
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,960
A pet that has, I'm sure, been on the show, but not with all of us together.

339
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
That's right.

340
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,880
Introduce our friend just for this episode.

341
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,640
Yeah, Garfield the dog is here.

342
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm watching him for the afternoon.

343
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,440
James, your girlfriend's dog has started your keel dog.

344
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,080
Yes, my girlfriend's dog, technically partly by Garfield too.

345
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,840
Wearing a sweater, climbing all over you.

346
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
And he is-

347
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
You're like dressed the same.

348
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
We're dressed the same.

349
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,840
And he is, yeah.

350
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,720
You know, you mentioned that scarab beetle and he slowly, you were both watching the

351
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
beetle and I was watching him, he slowly backed up when he saw it.

352
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,000
He's on the other side of the yard and is wandering around now a little.

353
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He is on the leash.

354
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He is not on the leash.

355
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Wow.

356
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,760
He is literally on a leash, yes, appreciate it.

357
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,680
So he doesn't go eat the lemon goo that landed under the tree in this yard.

358
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,600
We have real hazards in getting this done at this point.

359
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
There's a lot at play right now.

360
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Now a bird is calling.

362
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,080
Boy, hope you listeners are enjoying the outdoor era.

363
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
So better than Zoom, right?

364
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,200
Because you get to hear us stop and talk about all the distractions.

365
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:10,200
I mean, I love that there is a little dog, probably similar to the size of the main character

366
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,240
in the ride, voice by Patton Oswalt, whose name Jason knows because you made a list,

367
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
you said.

368
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
That's right.

369
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,400
Downgraded from a chart to a list once you considered it.

370
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
It's Max, yes.

371
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,000
Max, yes, Max, the star of Secret Life of Pets.

372
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,960
Wow, just like Max.

373
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,880
Not the same type as Max, but a similar size.

374
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Garfield is a shih tzu, a little street dog shih tzu.

375
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,800
Do we know what Max is offhand?

376
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,840
I think Max is like a beagle or a terrier.

377
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,360
Garfield just hit his head on the microphone.

378
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
You know what?

379
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
This is pure chaos.

380
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,960
This is pure pet chaos right now.

381
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,160
I had a feeling there because when this was, I was all for it, but when it was discussed,

382
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,120
being here and you said he'll probably just sleep under the chair, I did think there's

383
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
no way that's happening.

384
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
For sure it's going to get crazy.

385
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
He wants kisses from Jason.

386
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,680
He sleeps so much of the day and now he is sitting on my lap and he'll probably be asleep

387
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
on my lap soon enough.

388
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,080
I told you guys beforehand, we put the hoodie on him so he would go to sleep and he's collapsing.

389
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,400
He's falling over right now.

390
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,840
I wish, oh my gosh, he should have a little cap on like you do as well.

391
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,320
I wish that he had a baseball hat on like you have.

392
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Oh yeah.

393
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,840
That's the only other plus up I could have to this scene.

394
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,600
Maybe if you put little pants on him, but that would be hard.

395
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,160
He's a real sweetheart.

396
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,960
We had a nice long walk earlier.

397
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Wonderful.

398
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,520
Well let's get Edwin over here to your dog.

399
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:44,360
Let's get my baby out and then we'll just like, it'll be a 15% content, 85% fumbling

400
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
episode.

401
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,760
A lot of directing traffic.

403
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,160
Let's just real quick talk about what it was like to be back to ride the movies.

404
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah, oh boy.

405
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
Because you're fresh from it.

406
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
You just did it.

407
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
I was just there, yeah.

408
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,640
We've all trickled in.

409
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,280
I did it a couple weeks ago.

410
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,600
Jason, I think you did this ride as part of the Taste of Universal or whatever they were

411
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
calling that.

412
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Yes.

413
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
The food festival.

414
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,440
Yeah, I was there like almost a week before Universal officially reopened.

415
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,360
It was Friday, April 16th, 2021.

416
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:26,400
I was there the previous Thursday and I had seen the day before on Twitter a number of

417
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,560
people posting.

418
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,320
I think I saw first Todd Martins from the LA Times was there and was getting on the

419
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,200
ride and I messaged him and he's like, yeah, I was at Taste of Universal and they're doing

420
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
soft openings.

421
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,540
Oh, they're phrasing, they call it technical rehearsals, which is, okay, the ride's open.

422
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,040
You can come on and ride it.

423
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,200
If it falls apart, you can't complain.

424
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,480
We do not guarantee this ride will work.

425
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,160
Buster Keaton style.

426
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Yeah.

427
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
The building could fall all four sides.

428
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,080
Hopefully, where the space left for you in the middle.

429
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,680
The crowds were, I mean, they're still pretty low out here in California, but especially

430
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,720
for these food fests, they were very low.

431
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
We got to do it a few times that day.

432
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Nice, nice.

433
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,760
Yeah, I was just going to an outdoor food eating.

434
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,080
I was not expecting to do any rides.

435
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,240
The surprise of getting a ride.

436
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Getting a ride.

437
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
That's tremendous.

438
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,880
We rode this and the spinner ride in super silly fun land.

439
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Oh, boy.

440
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,480
That's a good line after this long ride drought.

441
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,120
That sounds really fantastic.

442
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
I mean, you're the freshest from it, Mike.

443
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
How did it feel?

444
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,120
This is your return to theme parks.

445
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Not all of us have been to one yet.

446
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,680
Jason's done Disneyland chronologically now.

447
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm heading there.

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
What's the return?

449
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, like a lot of things at this point in life, it's like it was like you went in and

450
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,520
it wasn't like a big, oh, my gosh, I'm back.

451
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,400
It was like walking through, like, oh, yeah, this is normal.

452
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,120
And then like parts you go, oh, good.

453
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,440
Like once you'd be on a ride, you go, oh, yeah, good.

454
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
Thank goodness.

455
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
It's a trickle in.

456
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,520
It's not a big celebration of, you know, like, oh, I'm back.

457
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,440
There's like it's not going to be it's not going to be like some neat coordination.

458
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,800
Like, like big celebrate.

459
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
It's just going to be like, oh, good.

460
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,200
I've had that with moments of getting back to regular life where it just it lasted so

461
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,680
long and it's all been so annoying and just like an overlap with so much other annoying

462
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,320
this in the world that some some things have been pure bliss, heavenly, and other things

463
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,760
have been like, yeah, good.

464
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Damn it.

465
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Yeah, right.

466
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
It's about time.

467
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,800
I did feel the most I felt sort of like a wistful was definitely the end of the pets

468
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,080
ride.

469
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,400
And that's partly because of of not going to these places for so long and partly because

470
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,640
I am a sucker for pets and the dog and boy too emotionally wrapped up probably too much

471
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,080
in pets and my and Edwin and the dog.

472
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,440
So yeah, there's something a nice thing happens and then there's a big party for you at the

473
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
end.

474
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
That is the yes.

475
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
It is right.

476
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Yes.

477
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,640
And I woke up too late today and I was also like it was like I felt like I wanted to get

478
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,880
there earlier.

479
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,240
So I like I stressfully walked into Universal Studios for the first time in like a year

480
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
and a half and then like oh then you relax a little bit.

481
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
It wasn't immediate.

482
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,700
Yeah, it wasn't immediate for me either because I was like, well, we're in the gate.

483
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
We're actually in it.

484
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Excuse me.

485
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Would you be available to do a quick survey?

486
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Oh, yeah.

487
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Look, hey, normally.

488
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Yes.

489
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
I love to help with that.

490
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,120
I know that the feedback actually matters.

491
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
I'll do the thing online.

492
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
But oh my God.

493
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Right.

494
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Look, I haven't done this in so long.

495
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,520
I have nothing to talk about.

496
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,600
I literally have no theme park experience from the last year and change.

497
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
Yeah, I saw them.

498
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,240
I thought they were going to ask me because there were two people standing with the with

499
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,440
the whatever iPads and I was like, are they going to ask me?

500
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,920
And then the trick is and I don't know if we've probably talked about this before is

501
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,280
supposedly is you make eye contact with them and then they won't ask you usually.

502
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,800
They're not supposed to ask you if it looks like you want to talk to them.

503
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,720
Oh, supposedly again, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but supposedly the idea is that

504
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:08,240
they're supposed to just sample the audience or sample the park goers by finding people

505
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,440
who would not want to talk to them.

506
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,400
So that's more of a random for whatever reason.

507
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,160
So if you look at them like eagerly, they're not going to pick you.

508
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,040
Now what if you make a beeline right for them and you say, can I take a survey?

509
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,000
I think it's not if you do that with that voice.

510
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah.

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,500
If you say, can I take a survey?

512
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Jason with no mask.

513
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:39,220
Rip your mask off and have a little like a Grinch like smile curling and go, can I take a survey?

514
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,540
If you do that, then they will for sure say yes.

515
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,100
And then they'll let you.

516
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,660
The dog is now trying to like hug Jason.

517
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Oh, boy.

518
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,660
It makes so much sense for this episode.

519
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,780
Stepping on Jason's phone.

520
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,740
He loves to do this when I am trying to sleep.

521
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,300
Jason, close your legs so we can have a lap to sit on.

522
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
OK.

523
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Wait, no, now he's jumping.

524
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Now he's jumping.

525
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
And it's wrapping up in the mic.

526
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
He's going to pull this mic over.

527
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Oh, boy.

528
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
This is why I wish we were filming the whole thing.

529
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Let's sire videographers quickly.

530
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
And now he's smiling because he's proud of himself.

531
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Great smile on this guy.

532
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:22,300
The park was I think partly because, you know, they're only still not loading full ride vehicles on a lot of these things.

533
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,300
I went to that lower lot and I was like, these wait times are really long.

534
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Yeah.

535
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Unless you go early, they're still pretty long.

536
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,300
So I really got a chance to do Jurassic World and this.

537
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
And that was about it.

538
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Oh, yeah.

539
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
I hate to say it, but early is part of it.

540
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
I should have gone early.

541
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
You know, easier for me.

542
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Parent hours are up at 6 a.m. all the time.

543
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
So we were like, yes, sure, let's get to it.

544
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,300
But I have a gold pass, so I'll be back.

545
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
You can immediately.

546
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Yeah.

547
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Yeah.

548
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Good rule of thumb.

549
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:02,300
If you're going to Universal Studios Hollywood, whether it's now time or normal times, go right to the lower lot because everyone else waits till later in the morning or midday to go down there.

550
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
And it just crunches.

551
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
Yeah.

552
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
And single single riders not back yet.

553
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Single riders not back.

554
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Oh, yeah.

555
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Another thing because I forgot all about that.

556
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,300
And then that that because like I was like, well, single right and get right on a couple of these.

557
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:21,300
And it's like they don't do that right now, at least because of the protocols, which I don't know if that really matters that much.

558
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
I'm not.

559
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
I get the idea.

560
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,300
You know, what's great, though, with it is that you get a lot of ride vehicles to yourself.

561
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Well, yes, I was front row.

562
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
We'll talk about this on a different episode.

563
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
I was front row in Jurassic World.

564
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Oh, hello.

565
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
No one else in the entire.

566
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
No, there were people behind me.

567
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
But like many rows, but they don't.

568
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
Those are not very populated.

569
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Exactly.

570
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:53,300
I think the idea listener is that we're going to talk a little more about extra universal stuff and maybe say maybe that that in Dominus Rex over on the second gate at Patreon.com slash podcast.

571
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,300
The rights of further universal thoughts because you need you need a mall.

572
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
You need to collect them all.

573
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,300
So so we'll you know, we'll do the broader scope there.

574
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
I'm trying to think just quick hits.

575
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I mean, yeah, getting to do rides where it's almost only you in the vehicle.

576
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Another reason to go straight for that lower lot.

577
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Honestly, one of the best parts for me being back there was the Starway.

578
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,300
There was a real victorious nature to that star.

579
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:25,300
What I don't and I don't think it's not like I had an inherent love of it before.

580
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Some some attractions we talk about it and then I love it more.

581
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I wasn't sure how I felt.

582
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,300
I had so much fun talking about the Starway and the evil Starway also on the second gate.

583
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
I was there for a while.

584
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,300
That suddenly now I thought for some reason I was raring to be back there.

585
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Also, just like, you know, I've kind of like like I've lived now several places and lived and worked several places like in the view that you get at the top of the Starway.

586
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:59,300
And it's such a like triumphant like, you know, we've also we were all stuck in in in our rooms for so long.

587
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,300
And we'd pined for the view, the Lion King, esk view of the kingdom.

588
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,300
And then the North Hollywood general area up above.

589
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,300
I feel like we like we finally rose above it.

590
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,300
And I'm looking down on all these great places where I've had great memories and that are starting to open up again.

591
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,300
There's something about that top of the Starway that there was just like a grand vista nature.

592
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,300
Oh, yeah, I really liked a beautiful view of the San Fernando Valley.

593
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:33,300
Yeah, it's there's that golf course there that I think we're all hoping is finally bought by Universal be turned into another theme park.

594
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Put your you know, get the condos over there so we don't have to worry about muscle in in because there's been a lot of talk about what do you do with that lot?

595
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,300
And the most boring play, obviously, the most boring plans for anything always are expensive condos.

596
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Yes. So let's keep that off the lot and put that over in the boring, you know, in the residential zone.

597
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,300
I agree. I agree. Yeah.

598
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Yeah. And the other the other quick note I'll have of being on top of the Starway is, of course, the Nintendo land view.

599
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,300
My favorite thing is to look at construction in progress.

600
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,300
And boy, they cannot hide it. There's impossible to hide it.

601
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Like sometimes Galaxy's edge, you could see things from, oh, if you go to this part of the top of this and but like this, there's no way to hide it.

602
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
It's just you're going to be going down the escalators.

603
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,300
You can see the whole thing. You go to you go to the queue of Jurassic World and it's just like open.

604
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,300
You just can see inside. They don't really block it.

605
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:33,300
And you're it is just moved in the recent past from just being like a lot of construction and clearly there's a lot and it's an impressive space.

606
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
But there's nothing like colorful to look at.

607
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:50,300
And now we have the green Mario Hills and you get a sense of how awesome that is going to look, especially from the Starway, which, you know, some dollards out there might say that having to take all these escalators is boring and perfunctory.

608
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:59,300
But now you're going to have this epic view of like like up above like you don't get to descend into Galaxy's edge.

609
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:06,300
You're going to get to see this, the scope of this bright, vibrant land as you land from above.

610
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,300
It's going to be great. Yeah, it's like sort of the level select screen in a lot of ways as you go down.

611
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:19,300
You know, when you see like when you're playing a video game, you can see sort of the level and there's a smaller version of it before you select it.

612
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:26,300
So you can select Jurassic World. You can select the Brendan Fraser mummy and then you can see the Mushroom Kingdom there and you can select that as well.

613
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,300
And that all is accessible from your good friend, the Starway. That's right. Yeah.

614
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Thanks to the Starway. Yeah. No way of getting we'd have to jump.

615
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,300
We'd have to jump from the parking garage. I in this.

616
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,300
You know what? I also really shouldn't. We could talk about this all day.

617
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,300
But like we were on the Starway and I was just like, the music is pumping like I'm loving this vibe.

618
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Like I'm I don't I guess it's just being outside and having there's a beat, a loud beat.

619
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,300
And, you know, they they turn that music up a little louder than they do at Disney.

620
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,300
You know, I like a douchey Vegas pool party. I'm like maybe that's where I'm just like, yeah, hell yeah.

621
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,300
They play gasoline. But I would have lost my mind if they play gasoline.

622
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Were they playing It's Gonna Be a Lovely Day by Lunch Money Lewis featuring Amine?

623
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Can you give me a give me a give me a couple of 10 like 10 seconds of it to know what that song is?

624
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,300
No, it's just a song that plays at the end of Pats. It's from the Secret Lies Pats soundtrack.

625
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Oh, OK. Oh, they know they were playing to the Bartman.

626
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,300
I was loving it. They were playing to the apartment as I was going down.

627
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Really? Yeah, they play it twice. They played it as I was going down an escalator.

628
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
Not in this. No, no, no. Right.

629
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Right. Like as I was walking to the escalator. Sorry.

630
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,300
I knew they played to the Bartman, though, in general.

631
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,300
I didn't know for a little while, but I think a couple of years ago when I was and I said, I think I said it on the Harry Potter three broomsticks episode.

632
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:49,300
I think like they play it. I was like eating outside and I was like, do the Bartman's playing while I'm in Hogwarts.

633
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:57,300
It's that's so great because as a Simpsons fan, I think every Simpsons fan can agree that one of the best things the show ever did was do the Bartman.

634
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,300
And you are not a true Simpsons fan. Am I a Simpsons fan?

635
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,300
Everybody, if you can do the Bartman, everybody has a can and a man can.

636
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
I mean, you know, it's our favorite happening, dude.

637
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,300
I'm a boy that's something to being rude or whatever.

638
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:18,300
I mean, I had a cassette of it, so I can't act like I it's not burned in my brain in a lot of ways.

639
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,300
But it's fun. It's fun to hear it because I don't hear it a lot.

640
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,300
So like that's they know other it's not exactly a radio song.

641
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,300
No. Or in the supermarket.

642
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:37,300
And the other rest of it is all like Alf Clausen, you know, or just orchestral Simpsons stuff.

643
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,300
Sure. But then, you know, you rock a little to do the Bartman.

644
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,300
Like that's a little bit more of a rock and the rock and it's rock and song.

645
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,300
So I was vibing on the music today.

646
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Like there was some some pop hits and Bartmans and I was enjoying that.

647
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Geez. They didn't play any of the Beatles.

648
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,300
But you get a different type of Beatles if you go into the mummy ride.

649
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,300
That's a good point. And you know, which, by the way, I think the bug died.

650
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
Just dead. It's right over there.

651
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,300
It hasn't moved either that or it's pregnant with the tiny scare.

652
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,300
No, it's kind of like a bunch of burst out right now.

653
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,300
I don't know. I mean, it's a little labor.

654
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,300
The beetle might have died. I mean, I feel bad. I don't I is my older age.

655
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I really don't even like to kill bugs anymore.

656
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Oh, my God. It's just sitting there and it's like about eight feet from me or so.

657
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Ten feet. And it's just I can see. Right. That's it. Right.

658
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,300
It's got I got. Yeah, maybe I think could be.

659
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,300
Oh, boy. Well, a scary endeavor.

660
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,300
And I can't help but think it would have been a little better if I'd gotten my coffee.

661
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
Nice. Right. We get that. Everybody gets it right.

662
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,300
That's that he gets. Is that a scarab moment or not?

663
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Oh, is that like just like a ghost gets him?

664
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,300
That's how the mummy ride ends in Florida. It's a ghost gets him.

665
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,300
But it also like that outburst is very similar to what Tom Cruise had on the set of Mission Impossible as well.

666
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
So that's both both a reference to scarabs and to Tom Cruise's outburst.

667
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,300
Both of the members of the mummy franchise. Oh, right. Very good point.

668
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Of different I guess different mummy franchise.

669
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:13,300
They should just yeah, they should flip out the Fraser thing with Tom Cruise rants at the end of that, too.

670
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,300
Yeah, sure. Get them together into the mummy verse.

671
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
Why not? Let's roll.

672
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,300
As I always say about all this IP stuff, let's roll in the slop.

673
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Let's roll in the slop like pigs and enjoy it as it could be. Team everyone up.

674
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,300
Let's do it. All right. Let's let's get into this ride a little bit.

675
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
The Secret Life of Pets. This is one.

676
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:45,300
I may have said this on the show before. One very strong memory I have of the pandemic hitting was that I have like a spreadsheet that says what episodes are maybe in there that we put out and what are coming up.

677
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,300
And I remember specifically like, oh, March, we got Secret Life of Pets.

678
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,300
That'll be fun to go see that and then talk about it as soon as it's open.

679
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,300
And then at some point around March or April, just deleting that square permanently.

680
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,300
Yeah, not permanently, but removing it.

681
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I'm like, I think we could safely say this won't be on the 2020 podcast, the ride schedule.

682
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Yes. But not the worst thing that happened.

683
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,300
No, no, no, no.

684
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:23,300
The worst thing would be the cancellation of Peacock Fest, the celebration of the new Peacock streaming service that was also going to have a big marquee, you know, ride.

685
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Come see your favorite stars, your favorite NBC Universal stars and ride the new Secret Lives of Pets ride.

686
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Secret Lives of Pets, of course, not available on Peacock. Neither of them.

687
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,300
The first one is available for you to rent from your favorite rental service.

688
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,300
The second one is streaming on Netflix, and that just goes to show the quality of Peacock curation.

689
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:55,300
There's all those crazy like that, you know, I mean, this one's like I guess people know the ownership of this show, but you do go, oh, an NBC streaming service, huh?

690
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Oh, finally, a place where I can watch Friends.

691
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
Well, no, that's not. No, it's on Warner. Why? It was on NBC.

692
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Well, no, because the ownership is a Warner Produce show.

693
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,300
And then vice versa. There's NBC things on Peacock.

694
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Like you have to know what companies made things to be able to chart all of this, which unfortunately I do.

695
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:22,300
I do know what companies made shows that I've never seen one minute of so I can navigate some of these things sometimes, but it's still sure.

696
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Yeah, there's a lot of like pre work to do to go watch anything.

697
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Yeah, and that's most of a lot of a film degree is them telling you like, OK, this is the difference between a distributor, a producer, a network and a production company.

698
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Regular people don't know this. Yeah, or care. OK, that took 20 minutes.

699
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Now what are you going to teach? Something more interesting, please.

700
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Something. Yeah, they don't even have you think like, well, their biggest franchise, maybe one of the biggest in the world, Fast and Furious.

701
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:01,300
OK, we have four. No, we have five. We have six. We maybe have seven.

702
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,300
We don't have the rest. What? But OK, TNT.

703
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,300
If you get the TNT app, you can watch one. And then if you get the TBS app, you can watch the other.

704
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,300
So it's scattered through the wind. But you wouldn't.

705
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,300
And Fast and Furious 9 is about to come out. You wouldn't think you would.

706
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,300
You would want your biggest movies like get them all. Get them there. Yeah.

707
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Yeah, there was going to be a Fast and Furious presence at Peacock Live, which I went and looked up our email about, which was sometimes we get emails that are like, you want to come check this thing out for free.

708
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,300
Sometimes there's free things that we get, not very often, but once in a while.

709
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,300
And we're very excited. And that's cool. This email seemed to be so for just ninety nine dollars.

710
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:49,300
You can go. You could see Elizabeth Berkley and Bill Krebs, the executive producer of Good Girls.

711
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,300
But I might have paid that on a preview of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

712
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:02,300
This email is bizarre to look at now. But then like, oh, a little late with Lily Singh, the panel of the show that will be on forever.

713
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:13,300
And then but you were maybe going to get to see Jay Leno talk to Dennis McCarthy, the picture car coordinator for the Fast and Furious franchise.

714
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,300
That I actually would pay to see. That I would consider.

715
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,300
You're going to hear anybody. I think that my friend Tommy pointed out about Jay Leno's garage.

716
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:29,300
You're like, oh, a comedian doing a car show. That must be funny. No. He asks very dry car questions.

717
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,300
This is not funny. Monica Lewinsky, that's to joke about cars. This is serious business.

718
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,300
They do like one bit an episode, though. Yeah. He allows one. But it's very. Yeah, you're right.

719
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,300
It's like an island outside of the info. Yeah. It should not be tamper.

720
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Unlike us, who weave it all in. You never know.

721
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:53,300
What a tapestry, folks. Facts and jokes and stories. Dogs and beetles. You never know what's going to hit you.

722
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,300
My goodness. What a podcast this is. Yeah. So where was I?

723
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:04,300
We missed Peacock Live is the point. And so we didn't get to get that preview of this, but it eventually came.

724
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:13,300
Yeah. So this is one of the big things I did think about throughout the pandemic is that this ride was ready to maybe the most new, ready to open.

725
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,300
It was so close to turning the keys and starting the thing. And then it all went down.

726
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:25,300
So yeah. And crazy when you think of the scope of it, because the big headline with this attraction is animatronics.

727
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:31,300
So many animatronics. I think a press release said 64 all told in this attraction.

728
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,300
And that's a lot to be just. Yes. Sitting around, not not doing anything, not turned on.

729
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Yeah. This and Avengers campus were starting media previews.

730
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,300
And I think about to start annual pass holder previews in Universal's case, at least.

731
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,300
I mean, last year. Yeah. Last year. Oh, Avengers. I don't think was done. Huh?

732
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:55,300
Avengers like finished a couple of months ago, I think they had a little more. Oh, yeah. Sorry. It wasn't.

733
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,300
But there were media tours like Carly. Oh, they were doing like hard hat stuff. Yeah.

734
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:06,300
Taste the food. That's been by end of year. I don't remember the Avengers most open in the summer last year.

735
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:13,300
Last summer. Like June or July in the summer. But I'm just saying, like, I think pets was truly sitting like finished was ready to go.

736
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Yeah. Versus Avengers, which I think they ended up being delayed a little bit and they finished a couple months ago.

737
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:25,300
So they have created with this attraction kind of a little I don't think it's called this by anyone other than us, but maybe.

738
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Well, let's just call it Illumination Alley. Yes. There's a section that is a little narrow in stretches.

739
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Yeah. It is pretty very like New York cramped. This is a New York themed attraction and a butts pretty close right up to the Despicable Me Minion Mayhem ride.

740
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,300
And these are to talk about production companies as in your film school.

741
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,300
These all made by the same studio illumination Despicable Me.

742
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,300
They're they're crown jewel. But Secret Life of Pets, a big franchise, too.

743
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Yeah, I loved I actually didn't even realize this until today when I did it that it was right there, which I thought was very cool that it was right there.

744
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:04,300
Because universally, you know, we all know it's a kind of a universal Hollywood is a weird layout hodgepodge.

745
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,300
And this did make that area there feel like, oh, it's its own little thing here.

746
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Actually cohesive. Yeah, absolutely. And it does start to disrupt this odd.

747
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,300
We've never really talked about it is weird.

748
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,300
That whole zone up there on the upper lot that's just like streets of the world.

749
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Oh, is it like Epcot World Showcase where you experience different cultures and foods?

750
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
No, it's like crappy pizza. Yeah.

751
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Okay. They're like different attractions representing like a boat ride of old London.

752
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
No, it is nothing. Truly. There's not a thing.

753
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,300
There's like a Moulin Rouge windmill.

754
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
That's about all you got.

755
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:48,300
There's an Irish bar, but not the full size Irish bar and restaurant like in Orlando.

756
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:56,300
This is more like a railroad apartment that you can walk through and get a plastic shot glass of Jameson.

757
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,300
It's so small. It's so small.

758
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Very sadly small. Is a full bar. Am I right on that?

759
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,300
I think yeah. And I think that is like yeah, that is like a hard liquor place,

760
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
which does not really sound good to me.

761
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,300
And it's like let me grab shots quick.

762
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,300
Usually at least universally associate with heat very often.

763
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,300
Yeah. So I don't really want.

764
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Yeah. Like the and it gets so odd in the summer.

765
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,300
So 110 degree. I don't want that Jameson shot necessarily.

766
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,300
I put some people do.

767
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,300
Universal is the funniest because the space is so odd.

768
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:34,300
And the four o'clock crunch where people who've come to the park halfway through the day arrive,

769
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,300
people have been there all day arrived.

770
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,300
Everything has a long wait. And some people are just hammered.

771
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Like Universal Hollywood is you don't get it.

772
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,300
I think people get crankier at Disneyland, but Universal Hollywood.

773
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,300
People sometimes just show up to have a good time.

774
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
We've got to do that. I've never actually done anything in.

775
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
I've never had anything in there. They have a lot of golden.

776
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,300
They have the mango cart.

777
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
Well, that's my fruit juice.

778
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,300
The beer that tastes like baby alcohol.

779
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,300
Yeah. No, I love mango cart. Sure.

780
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,300
And they and they also had tall boys of white claw.

781
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,300
Sure. A lot of the rest. More baby juice for Michael.

782
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,300
More go go juice for Michael.

783
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,300
Sweets. Yeah, that'd be a good before horror nights or something.

784
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:28,300
That's a good. Well, I think that's more of a I think because our nights attracts a much younger crowd as well.

785
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,300
They and locals and stuff.

786
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,300
You know, it's more of a locals park. Universal Hollywood, I think of.

787
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,300
I feel like horror nights in Orlando.

788
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,300
They're like, yeah, come do the haunted houses and come get hammered.

789
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,300
But horror nights out here, I feel like they kind of are really strict about it.

790
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,300
Yeah, they're a little more. It's a less of a free for all boozy free for all out here.

791
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,300
I'm realizing now and we'll talk about this on the Jurassic World.

792
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,300
There's not enough time. I notice the kids and like adults both alike are wearing a lot of big pants lately.

793
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,300
Just I'm seeing that big pants are back in a bag.

794
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Your stuff like like Hardy like 1999 wrestling tag team, the Hardy Boys, giant like Jinko pants.

795
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,300
I was like, well, I guess this is back throughout the day.

796
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,300
Yeah. Yeah. I was like, huh, the style is back, I guess.

797
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,300
I think someone bought Jinko a few years ago.

798
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,300
I think someone bought with startup money. I don't know.

799
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,300
And Gecko is back. I'm always getting ads. Yeah.

800
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,300
Gecko Hawaii on Instagram. This will be it.

801
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,300
We'll talk about big pants on Patreon, though. We don't have time. Yeah.

802
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
So big pants. Yeah.

803
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:37,300
So so there's a little corner here that is is all in the same illumination verse, which is really nice in the both both show buildings or not show.

804
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,300
Well, like, you know, the exteriors both look in the same universe.

805
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Yeah, yeah, because they aren't like it's not like a house style at that company, but they're certainly like adjoining.

806
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,300
They definitely fit well together. So, yeah, I love that.

807
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:56,300
I love that those that all ties together. It did have to be this did cause the demise of the Globe Theatre.

808
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Yes. Universal's event space personal significance for me because it's where I did the first of three steps of auditioning to be a tour guide.

809
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,300
The big like open call was there.

810
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:20,300
There was also that was also the site of a tour guide or maybe just employee wide film festival that happened that they made Ron Meyer, the real universal executive.

811
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,300
There's a lot to do.

812
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Who was like several years later was like trying to be a peace broker in the Leno Conan.

813
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Like he was like legitimately a player and all that.

814
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,300
He had to sit and watch a bunch of like little movies where people dressed up like cowboys or whatever.

815
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,300
I won. I won an award at the slide that in really fast.

816
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
Whoa, I don't even know if you've talked about that.

817
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,300
I did. And I don't you know, I've never won it there.

818
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:51,300
I was nominated for a Writers Guild once and you get like a certificate.

819
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,300
That was the only like trophy I think I've ever.

820
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,300
Do you have it with you?

821
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,300
No, it broke at some point in time in a move or something.

822
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,300
So the one was a nice looking award, but it did.

823
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,300
It did break.

824
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:11,300
But it felt it was a they put on a good fake fancy air and there was a real important executive who was probably not paying attention.

825
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,300
But I got to feel like it was a mini Oscars.

826
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Wow. Nice.

827
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:21,300
That was nice. So, you know, I'm obviously was upset to see this removed.

828
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
How many more important events could have happened?

829
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,300
How many more proms and retirements could have occurred?

830
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
People would have problems at that place, right?

831
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
My school did. I think there may have been.

832
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,300
We're just talking about this. It hasn't come out yet.

833
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
We're talking about problems and not going to.

834
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,300
I think there was a problem I didn't go to at this venue.

835
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300
Oh, interesting.

836
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:55,300
I even want I discovered the Disney meetings and events YouTube page where they have little commercial setup for like rent this space at the Yacht Club Hotel for your event.

837
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:01,300
And there was literally just videos that was called like have your prom at the Grand Floridian.

838
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:09,300
And if you're a high school can afford to rent space at the Grand Floridian, congrats.

839
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,300
Everything's going to be real easy for you from here on out, I guess.

840
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,300
You go to Mar-a-Lago High.

841
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,300
Yeah.

842
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:23,300
Wow. I am jealous of the kids that went to the Grand Floridian and you got to go to prom at Universal Studios.

843
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,300
Yeah.

844
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,300
Man, I was deprived.

845
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
What was your prom? Where was it at?

846
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,300
Portillo's.

847
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,300
Yeah, Portillo's.

848
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,300
Then we went to Lumel Nadis afterward.

849
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,300
We had hot dogs and then deep dish and then that was it.

850
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,300
We slow danced in a deep dish pizzeria.

851
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Sausage link corsage for your date.

852
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,300
Yeah, that's right. Yes.

853
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,300
You removed the sausage from around the girl's leg during the dance.

854
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,300
That's right. Yes.

855
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
The great prom show.

856
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
Yeah.

857
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
Man, that's so...

858
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,300
That would have been nice to go to Universal.

859
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Near theme park, but no more of this.

860
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,300
They're going to have to figure out a new event space.

861
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,300
So my experience with this got to the park.

862
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,300
This was the first thing I went to.

863
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,300
I didn't go straight to the lower lot because this is new.

864
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:20,300
I want to make sure I hit this immediately not open, like 915, not being run yet.

865
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,300
I've heard there's been that going throughout.

866
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,300
We decided to wait it out because we had so much luck with that.

867
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
When there was like...

868
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,300
I think the Ratatouille ride when we were in Disney Studios Paris had been out for so long.

869
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,300
We were like, if we just put in five more minutes, I think we might get it.

870
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,300
We got it and walked right on.

871
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,300
So with that as a guide, we always have to at least try.

872
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,300
Try to wait it out.

873
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,300
We did and jumped on it, which was great.

874
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,300
And really invigorating after all this time.

875
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,300
Just like, oh my God, we're in a line. This is nuts.

876
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,300
This is great. This is a robot.

877
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,300
However, a couple things hurt the experience.

878
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,300
One, maybe not a ride that you want to move through too fast.

879
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,300
I guess in COVID, Eric, is you want to be inside for too long.

880
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,300
But this is such a detailed line and we'll get into that.

881
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:12,300
The other thing, unfortunately for me, there are animatronics in the line.

882
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
Great. Good thing.

883
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,300
Whatever fix they did to get the ride open by 915 did not include the line animatronics.

884
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,300
So those were not running. Everything was still...

885
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,300
No.

886
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,300
Yeah, yeah, bummer.

887
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,300
Because they seem good.

888
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,300
You didn't see Buddy.

889
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,300
Oh man. There were some great...

890
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,300
Maybe him because he's a little more limited.

891
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,300
I mean, you get the effect.

892
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,300
The wiener dog who is in a kitchen kind of getting his butt rubbed by what?

893
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,300
Like a blender?

894
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Kitchen aid mixer.

895
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,300
Okay, yes. Yeah, yeah.

896
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,300
That's Buddy, voiced by Hannibal Buress.

897
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,300
That character.

898
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,300
Oh, okay. Gotcha.

899
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,300
But yeah, there are larger animatronics.

900
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,300
A lot of movement.

901
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

902
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,300
And they were still playing the audio.

903
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,300
So you got the idea and everybody was just walking through.

904
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,300
Ah, darn.

905
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,300
I watched a video of it. It seemed pretty great.

906
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,300
Did you guys know any of what was coming or did you go spoiler free?

907
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,300
I saw some pictures of things, but I was spoiler free.

908
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,300
I saw the big... I guess spoiler alert anyway about this whole thing.

909
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,300
But when you kind of first start, the first big room of the city,

910
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,300
I saw a picture of what that looked like.

911
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,300
But I didn't know anything about the queue.

912
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,300
I didn't know anything about any of the further rooms or anything.

913
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,300
So I was pretty fresh going into this.

914
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,300
So yeah, so I guess, yeah, a little bit of the queue stuff.

915
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,300
And I was thinking about this in general.

916
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,300
The queue is basically like you're in a nice apartment.

917
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,300
You're in a nice condo, New York.

918
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
Clean, hip.

919
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Yeah.

920
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,300
All the characters, most of the characters live in a building to get different apartments in a building.

921
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:50,300
And I was thinking about this basically like there's a couple others.

922
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,300
Like we've talked a lot about Mickey's house recently.

923
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
I think that was recently. It could have been nine months.

924
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,300
It could have been two months. I don't know.

925
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,300
It feels recent, but we talked about Mickey's house.

926
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,300
And I think on the Horror Nights, whenever we talked about that a year and a half ago,

927
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,300
I talked about the Us House.

928
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,300
Yeah.

929
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
Based on Jordan Peele's movie, Us.

930
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,300
And that has a part where it's just a living room.

931
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
Uh huh.

932
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,300
There's, I'm sure I said something along the lines.

933
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:22,300
I love like approximations of real life in themed experiences,

934
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,300
because then when something fantastical or weird happens,

935
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,300
it makes my brain believe it more.

936
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,300
Like it feels interesting.

937
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,300
Like I've tried to think about like if something like, look, we're in a backyard.

938
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,300
We're in your backyard here.

939
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,300
Like if it was, it just looked like this and you walked into it

940
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
and then something fantastical happened,

941
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,300
it would actually like do a kind of a different thing than like

942
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,300
you're walking through the Indiana Jones queue.

943
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,300
And that's prepping you for being in a different magical place.

944
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,300
If you're in Hogwarts or whatever.

945
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,300
Yeah, which is great. That's a whole different great experience.

946
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,300
But there is something about being in something that looks like real life

947
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:01,300
and then seeing something cool or weird that does something different that I really appreciate.

948
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,300
And I was like walking through and I go, oh, this is that like us feeling

949
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,300
where we were standing in a living room and then got attacked.

950
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,300
And I was like, because it just feels like you're in somebody's house

951
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,300
and then something awful is about to happen to me.

952
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,300
But in this, obviously something very fun and whimsical and cool happened.

953
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:22,300
But yeah, it does feel like lived in, but like in just accurately,

954
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,300
like it's not a cartoon version of a house.

955
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,300
You do feel like you're in some of it, which it seems like on the one hand,

956
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,300
you might say, isn't that one of the easiest things to do is to build it,

957
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,300
but to actually make it feel real and lived in.

958
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,300
I don't even know what qualities I would be curious to hear, you know,

959
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,300
not imagine universally or talk about what like what are the odds and ends

960
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,300
to make it feel like a real apartments that are important.

961
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,300
Sure. I'm sure. Yeah, there's a philosophy.

962
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,300
They I mean, they would have to have some, yeah, some sort of philosophy about how to like make it real,

963
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,300
but a little surreal.

964
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,300
I would wonder what the actual like scale of everything is,

965
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,300
because it's not quite the same scale as like a normal couch or chair.

966
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,300
It's a little bigger.

967
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:10,300
So I think they probably have all these different interesting rules that we don't know that that help make it like just a little off from your real life,

968
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,300
but enough to make you kind of go like, oh, I would live in here.

969
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,300
It's probably cost six thousand dollars a month to rent it in New York.

970
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,300
Yes, I like that.

971
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,300
I would like more of that.

972
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:28,300
And I think I would even like more of that with a scarier, weirder ride that is like just a normal place.

973
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,300
And then something fucked up happens or something crazy,

974
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:38,300
like whether it's like you're in an apartment and like a transformer rips the side of a wall off or something like something like that.

975
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
Yeah, would be really cool.

976
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,300
Yeah, so shocking.

977
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,300
And you feel like comfortable for a minute and then that's ripped away from you.

978
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,300
I think that's what it is.

979
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:58,300
The word comfortable is what I'm responding to because you feel very comfortable in some of these experiences and then you get hit with whether it's whimsy or magic or terror.

980
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,300
Yeah, this, of course, leans towards the whimsy.

981
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,300
You're seeing the whimsical world of what pets do when their owners are not at home.

982
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,300
Of course.

983
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,300
Yes.

984
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,300
You talk about comfort.

985
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,300
Also, I think Jason got to go on this first and I think everybody kind of breezed through the line.

986
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:20,300
However, you did Jason's headline, I think right away was there's chairs, but you could sit if you're waiting in the line.

987
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,300
There is chair.

988
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:28,300
It's like it's it is truly like someone could write a like a paper on this.

989
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,300
It's like they're the simulation of they are chairs.

990
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,300
They function as chairs.

991
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,300
They appear to be chairs, but they're not fabric.

992
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,300
They're like fiberglass and well, it's like Mickey's house.

993
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,300
It's like Mickey's house sits in hard chairs is what we figured out.

994
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,300
Mickey likes hard couches and chairs and the same should be soft.

995
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,300
Right.

996
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,300
There's a disconnect there.

997
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,300
There's there's mail slots.

998
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:56,300
There's practical mail slots that you can fiddle a little, but you look in and you see the simulation of an interior.

999
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,300
You see a screen.

1000
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Yes, there are some screens and projections on this ride.

1001
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,300
It's but I think they're used very thoughtfully.

1002
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,300
Oh, yeah.

1003
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
Very neat little trick detail.

1004
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:16,300
And this is this is one of those like there's no way we'll ever be able to say all the cool little things because I'm sure we missed half of them tons of little reference that little little jokes.

1005
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,300
There's a lot of little minions gags.

1006
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:24,300
That is if you're if you're going to say illumination as a signature, the minions are their biggest hit.

1007
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,300
So there's a little dog at the end dressed in a minion costume, which I believe happens in the second movie.

1008
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,300
Sure.

1009
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,300
Oh, I missed that. Oh, wow.

1010
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Hidden minions.

1011
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,300
Hidden minions.

1012
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,300
They have a new thing.

1013
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,300
That's good.

1014
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:44,300
There's like, yeah, there's like how many I'm trying to think there's there's like two rooms with very impressive animatronics talking to you.

1015
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,300
And the one right before you get on the ride is it's the rabbit, right?

1016
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,300
It's snowball.

1017
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,300
Thank you.

1018
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,300
And that felt very Rocket Raccoon to me.

1019
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,300
Yeah, that felt like a similar vibe of like he's kind of telling us what to do.

1020
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,300
But then before that, you get a room with and again, the two characters.

1021
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,300
Max and Duke.

1022
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,300
Max and Duke.

1023
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,300
Max and Duke.

1024
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,300
Currently voiced by Patton Oswalt and Eric Stone.

1025
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,300
Currently.

1026
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,300
Currently.

1027
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,300
Currently.

1028
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,300
That wasn't reading anything.

1029
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,300
Max was voiced by Louis CK.

1030
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:18,300
And they're like, well, maybe we'll return to the role at some point.

1031
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,300
You know, Secret Life 3.

1032
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,300
I think it's possible.

1033
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,300
So Duke is the bigger dog, right?

1034
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,300
Duke is the big.

1035
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,300
Yeah.

1036
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,300
And those are they're great.

1037
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,300
It's like you could have been you could just be the cue.

1038
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,300
And I think you'd be like, man, that was a fun little cue.

1039
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,300
Like I got.

1040
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,300
Oh, that was just a walkthrough.

1041
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,300
Absolutely.

1042
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,300
Yeah.

1043
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,300
I got so much of again.

1044
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,300
Well, at least for us, like what we like from all this stuff, you kind of get so much of

1045
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,300
it just in the queue.

1046
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,300
It's like, yeah, you would.

1047
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,300
I feel like you would feel like, oh, that was good.

1048
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,300
That's cute little thing.

1049
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,300
Yeah.

1050
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,300
There was such elation in that line.

1051
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,300
And you know, I would like to like go through it slower.

1052
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,300
But the speed of being there was right at opening, we just had to whip through it.

1053
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,300
Everybody I felt was just like you could tell it was all people who haven't been on a ride

1054
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,300
in a long time.

1055
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,300
And there was the euphoria of that.

1056
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,300
Just so much giggling and this and this.

1057
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,300
And, you know, you're missing a thousand things, but it makes you want to come back.

1058
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,300
Yes.

1059
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,300
Yes.

1060
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,300
Yeah.

1061
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:16,300
I think also because I wrote it in technical rehearsals, the ride did stop once or twice

1062
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,300
when I was riding.

1063
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,300
And then we got stopped in the queue for a little while and very slowly started moving.

1064
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,300
So I did get a chance to like examine a lot of stuff.

1065
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,300
And that probably gave me the distraction of like I'm in a room full of stranger.

1066
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,300
Like, you know, like it probably helped ease me back into polite society.

1067
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,300
Oh yes, being here.

1068
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,300
I know.

1069
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,300
I know.

1070
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,300
It is a weird thing in a way.

1071
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,300
Okay.

1072
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,300
The bug is moving again.

1073
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,300
The scarab is not dead.

1074
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,300
It is moving and something is going on.

1075
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,300
Because the eggs have been laid?

1076
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Maybe.

1077
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,300
It was like it was sitting there and I go, oh, it's for sure.

1078
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,300
I've been thinking, oh, for sure.

1079
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,300
It's dead for 20 minutes.

1080
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,300
No, no, no, no.

1081
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,300
And now it is something.

1082
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,300
It's got something going on and it is moving again.

1083
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,300
So let's keep an eye on it.

1084
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:03,300
I believe beetles one of the like bark worse than their bite kind of, but like not like

1085
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:08,300
good to have them or like lady bugs, you know, or, or, you know, spiders.

1086
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,300
Maybe we're good bugs.

1087
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,300
Maybe beetles are good.

1088
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,300
Maybe bugs are good.

1089
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,300
Yeah.

1090
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,300
So when they, well, it'll be good when they, a bunch of babies fly into your mouth.

1091
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,300
Well, sure.

1092
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,300
Good luck, by the way.

1093
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,300
Either this episode ends normally or it ends with our full swallowing of Goldberg.

1094
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,300
Death is only the beginning.

1095
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,300
I will.

1096
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,300
I won't lie.

1097
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,300
I do want the episode to end in a barrage of tiny beetles.

1098
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,300
We'll see.

1099
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,300
50-50 chance, I'd say.

1100
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:42,300
Jason, the speed at which you went on this ride because of some slowdowns and stuff,

1101
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,300
I think maybe they had not worked out the kinks on this early morning visit for me

1102
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:52,300
because this was the slowest ride I've ever been on in my life.

1103
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:58,300
You could tell, like, I don't, I didn't know the pace of it at first, but once you're like

1104
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:05,300
after the crawl, I feel like I'm in the first room for a full minute and you get like, you know,

1105
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,300
enough time to have a sizable conversation with each animatronic.

1106
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,300
And I'm like, I don't think this is right.

1107
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,300
I think I could tell the pace that this is supposed to have.

1108
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,300
I don't hold it against, I find it kind of tricky.

1109
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:21,300
I don't hold it against, I find it kind of charming that like, oh, this is really made by human beings.

1110
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,300
This is not just like a well-oiled machine.

1111
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,300
Like, they are still figuring it out.

1112
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,300
But it was comical after a while.

1113
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,300
And, you know, having not been on a ride in a long time, it was pretty great to be on a ride for 15 minutes.

1114
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,300
It was the slowest.

1115
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,300
Wow, really?

1116
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,300
Yeah, it really crunched along.

1117
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,300
Where you like felt little vibrations.

1118
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,300
Butterfly, a nice bug.

1119
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,300
Like, there were just things that you could tell were supposed to be a whip around,

1120
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,300
and now you're in front of this.

1121
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,300
And then there's a cat that is a scary cat with scary lightning lighting.

1122
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,300
I forget because it was the cat chewing on a wire.

1123
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,300
I don't remember the context.

1124
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,300
But you could tell it was the kind of thing in a ride that's supposed to be,

1125
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
look over here, a scary thing, oh my God, and now the next thing.

1126
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:01,300
And instead it was like, look over here for a solid 45 seconds.

1127
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,300
Most of the ride through videos online are about six minutes.

1128
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,300
So slow moving.

1129
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:12,300
They want families to do this, you know, I think with little kids.

1130
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,300
I think on Theme Park Insider, the height requirement we had talked about amongst ourselves,

1131
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,300
it's like 34 inches.

1132
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:23,300
And they were speculating that is less because of any whips or movement on the ride,

1133
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:29,300
and more like, oh, the kid has to be a certain height to get the augmented reality,

1134
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,300
the like puppy vision.

1135
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,300
Oh, to line up with the camera.

1136
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,300
Because that's a big part of this ride.

1137
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,300
There's like two or three moments where you look at a screen,

1138
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:45,300
but it's disguised as like a window or a mirror, and you see yourself as a puppy.

1139
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,300
Because you're little stray dogs.

1140
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,300
That's the long and short of the ride.

1141
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:52,300
You're little stray dogs, and Max and Duke are helping you get cleaned up so you can get adopted.

1142
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,300
Yes.

1143
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,300
You're forever home.

1144
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Yes.

1145
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,300
That sweet phrase.

1146
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,300
It's in the PR.

1147
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,300
I forget if it's in the ride.

1148
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,300
So yeah, you get turned into a puppy, and it goes by quick,

1149
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,300
although you get like a longer run at the end.

1150
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,300
But just move your arms a little, wave your arms a little.

1151
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:14,300
And you'll see the augmented reality work on your little dog too.

1152
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:19,300
And I think it's like several dozen dogs that you could be.

1153
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,300
I think they vary that up a lot.

1154
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,300
There's a mix of dogs.

1155
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:27,300
There's a mix of families who will go like, wow, that's on you.

1156
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,300
Yes.

1157
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,300
You get like, yeah, you're being prepped for adoption,

1158
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,300
and then at the end, a family picks you.

1159
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,300
And it's very heartwarming.

1160
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,300
And we were like following along with our family,

1161
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,300
which it's great that they really line it up with your vehicle.

1162
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,300
And then we looked back to see what the other ones were.

1163
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,300
And don't quote me on this because it wasn't mine.

1164
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,300
But I think further down the line, I think there was a same sex couple,

1165
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,300
which, oh my God, in theme park history, has there been this?

1166
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,300
I hope I'm not making that up, and that is a real thing that is nice that they did.

1167
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,300
I saw that too.

1168
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:09,300
Because I think I got stuck at that point, and I think I saw like five families go by.

1169
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,300
I think I saw a number of families.

1170
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:18,300
You have a one in 1,000 chance of getting a same sex couple to adopt you on this ride.

1171
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,300
That's how you win the ride.

1172
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,300
Which is as close to how a corporation will allow it at this point.

1173
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,300
The smattering will start easing you into the water.

1174
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,300
But I mean, when have you seen that?

1175
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:32,300
When have you seen any depiction of anything other than the most binary?

1176
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,300
It's generally a quick thing.

1177
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,300
Generally a quick thing if it's cartoon because they don't want to.

1178
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Certainly a diverse selection of families, different configurations.

1179
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:47,300
Couples and ethnicities and number of kids and that sort of thing.

1180
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,300
And it's all, yeah, it's just very positive.

1181
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,300
Like this ride is just very positive and nice.

1182
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,300
It was nice after these 14 months.

1183
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,300
It was a nice ride.

1184
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,300
Yeah.

1185
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:01,300
The most conflict is there's some fireworks going off really.

1186
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,300
That's like the most like conflict or most...

1187
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:11,300
Which the more I thought about, I was like, huh, did they mean that to be darkly funny?

1188
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,300
Because dogs fucking hate fireworks.

1189
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:17,300
And they're getting shot around in fireworks where else?

1190
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,300
That's as twisted as the ride gets.

1191
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:25,300
That's the revenge by the twisted alley cats who are the, I guess, antagonists.

1192
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,300
They don't even seem that bad.

1193
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,300
The mild antagonists.

1194
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,300
Yeah, they're fine.

1195
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,300
I mean, that's like the scariest part of the ride.

1196
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,300
But it's not, look, it's not that scary, okay?

1197
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:40,300
Good, good kid ride, which Universal was in short supply of.

1198
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,300
It's been said a lot by various people.

1199
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,300
This is a ride Universal needed.

1200
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,300
Definitely something they did not have in various categories.

1201
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,300
Just kids, slow moving.

1202
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,300
Yeah, there's Despicable Me.

1203
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:57,300
But if you're not into 3D or even the jostling is maybe too much for some kids.

1204
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,300
This is, I think anybody could go on it.

1205
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:04,300
And then, and obviously the animatronic thing.

1206
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:14,300
They have not had a slow moving animatronic based attraction since they callously ripped out our friends ET and Botanicus.

1207
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,300
And the mannequin police officers.

1208
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,300
Yeah.

1209
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:23,300
And Meep and Glug Glug and...

1210
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,300
Flop Flop Flop Flop.

1211
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,300
Blue Loop and whatever.

1212
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,300
Blue Chew?

1213
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,300
Blue Chew.

1214
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,300
Blue Chew.

1215
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,300
My good friend.

1216
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Both Blue Chew and Blue Loop.

1217
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,300
The whole history.

1218
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
They both stole their names from ET's friends.

1219
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:44,300
ET's parents Blue Chew and Blue Loop.

1220
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,300
ET's parents need your help.

1221
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,300
They miss their son Blue Loop.

1222
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,300
As soon as you get to the Green Planet, be sure to look for Blue Loop and Blue Chew.

1223
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,300
I'm counting on you and so is ET.

1224
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,300
Oh man, it's hard to draw those guys.

1225
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:04,300
Which truly, like, you know, the ET, you know, like I guess it had to go but it did fill a void.

1226
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,300
It was like, there's a reason it's in like sort of the kids area in Universal Florida.

1227
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,300
And this is just an area that Universal Hollywood was not covering for a long time.

1228
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,300
It didn't have to go. It didn't have to go.

1229
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,300
I don't even know why I'm saying that.

1230
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,300
I went on that, like, I went on Mummy.

1231
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,300
I hadn't been on this Mummy in a long time.

1232
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,300
It is stupid. It's a stupid ride.

1233
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,300
That ending is so bad.

1234
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,300
It's quick.

1235
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,300
Yeah, no, I mean I'm not mad that Mummy, that even bad version of Mummy's there.

1236
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,300
Just ET did not have to go. There was no reason.

1237
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,300
Yeah.

1238
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:38,300
Other than them thinking they were going to do something that was going to really like drive traffic to the park.

1239
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,300
And maybe, I don't know, maybe it did in the short term.

1240
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:44,300
But the long term game, ET was a better play.

1241
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,300
I think maybe they might realize that now, but maybe they don't.

1242
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,300
Maybe they're still in their mind.

1243
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,300
They can replace stuff.

1244
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:55,300
After his appearance as a senator in the deep background of one of the prequels,

1245
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,300
that completely restored the ET franchise.

1246
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,300
People were so excited to see Senator Greleaps.

1247
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,300
Grebleeps? What is his name?

1248
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,300
Was it Spielberg backwards?

1249
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,300
Yeah, yeah. Grebleeps. Grebleeps.

1250
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:13,300
Yeah. Wait, is it ET and Senator Grebleeps?

1251
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,300
I'm not sure. Are they different characters, are you asking?

1252
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:20,300
Well, no, I know they're different characters, but are they both in that little Senate pod?

1253
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,300
That little pod.

1254
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,300
Or is it just Grebleeps?

1255
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,300
They were doing a pod before we had.

1256
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,300
It's not Zirak. ET's real name is of course Zirak.

1257
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,300
I think it's just the ET species.

1258
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,300
Yeah, it's a bunch of ET's.

1259
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
But it's not ET himself. He doesn't.

1260
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,300
I do not believe that ET is in...

1261
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,300
Yeah, that's what I meant. I'm just double checking.

1262
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:41,300
I don't think that's right. I mean, ET is a scientist if you read the book, The Green Planet.

1263
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,300
He's very smart.

1264
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:49,300
That is crazy though. If he goes and has an adventure on Earth in 1982,

1265
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:55,300
and then ends up as a Senator, like in the birth of all of the events of Star Wars, what a life.

1266
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,300
Yeah, and Star Wars is a long time in the past, too.

1267
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,300
Oh, that's right. So that doesn't...

1268
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,300
Well, maybe with some warps and tunnels or whatever, that solves that.

1269
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,300
And he had to traverse the galaxy far, far away, you know?

1270
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,300
Yeah, that's true. So who knows?

1271
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,300
He can time travel, too. He can spin the clock back.

1272
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,300
There's a lot of you. I've been tracking this.

1273
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,300
There's a lot of UFO talk lately that I'm intrigued by.

1274
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,300
And I'm not necessarily thinking like, oh, it's for sure like aliens.

1275
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,300
Something weird seems like it's going on, though I would say,

1276
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,300
whether it's weird technology or something.

1277
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:27,300
But what I love it, if it was like, yep, Botanicus is real.

1278
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:34,300
He's in a little pod, and he's been messing with pilots, Air Force pilots for the last 20 years.

1279
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,300
I mean, what a dream would that be?

1280
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,300
If it was like one of our beloved IPs is real.

1281
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
That would be maybe the dream.

1282
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:45,300
Help me scramble more jets. Help me crash more of your people.

1283
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:46,300
I hate...

1284
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,300
It's my mission.

1285
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,300
I hate the Air Force specifically, and I want to mess with them.

1286
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:58,300
I am Botanicus. I'm screwing with pilots and the Air Force.

1287
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:03,300
It's just a thing I do. All when Harrison Ford crashed, that was me.

1288
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,300
He was flying an old World War II plane.

1289
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:12,300
I didn't like that he took time away from... Raiders took time away from my sequel.

1290
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,300
Yeah.

1291
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:18,300
I never got to be in the movies because Stephen got distracted.

1292
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:25,300
Yeah. So I tried to kill Harrison Ford, but that man is unkillable.

1293
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:29,300
I dropped the Millennium Falcon door on him as well.

1294
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:36,300
I'll keep trying. Please help me. Help me kill Harrison. Hurry.

1295
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,300
Botanicus is real.

1296
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,300
That's what we're going to find out.

1297
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,300
We'll see.

1298
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:46,300
Botanicus is real, folks. I don't have much more to say.

1299
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,300
That's pretty good.

1300
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,300
Look. Hey, look. Check.

1301
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,300
Hey, Mac.

1302
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,300
All right. Go to Teakley and then...

1303
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:02,300
Look, old Joe needs your help, okay? Go find ET's friends. Go find Teakley, okay?

1304
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,300
They replaced you.

1305
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,300
It's for the good of the nation.

1306
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,300
Replaced Spielberg with Biden on the ET ride.

1307
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,300
Ah, ET.

1308
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,300
That's how you make it relevant.

1309
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,300
Yeah.

1310
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,300
Look, Joe needs your help, man. Look, man. Look. They got to do it for me.

1311
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:22,300
All right. So here's another thing.

1312
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:30,300
Now, we said the plot of this ride is that your friends, or Max and the other one, Duke, are helping you.

1313
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,300
Your strays.

1314
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,300
Your strays, and they're helping you find...

1315
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:39,300
And I kind of knew this because I read what the ride is going to be, but I had to recall it because to be honest,

1316
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,300
and I don't know if you felt this at all, I got on the ride.

1317
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:47,300
I got on the ride. Aaron, who'd never read any of the copy, because we had enough time to have sidebar conversations,

1318
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,300
like, what are the babies doing at home?

1319
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:53,300
Like, you know, the grocery's on the way home. We had so much time while sitting in this slow ride.

1320
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,300
Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,300
And one of the side conversations we had was, what is happening?

1322
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:02,300
She truly did not know. I don't know if this was a result of the line rushing by,

1323
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:07,300
but I don't think the plot is necessarily conveyed the best, which is okay, because I'll get on a ride.

1324
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:12,300
Hey, being in Japan, you don't know what the plot of anything is because you don't speak the language.

1325
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,300
So that's okay, but I did not know what the ride was.

1326
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:22,300
Yeah, it's a lot of big set pieces, and if you're focused on the set pieces and the gags and stuff, it's easy to get distracted.

1327
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:27,300
Yeah, if you go through the line too quick, you spend too little time in the room with Max and Duke, you'll miss it.

1328
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:32,300
This is an original storyline, by the way. It's not a book report ride of either of the films.

1329
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,300
It's an original, like, you know, all the characters are here.

1330
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:42,300
It kind of takes place somewhere around the second movie, because Snowball is not antagonist.

1331
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:47,300
I think he was the antagonist in the first movie, and now his friends, now the anti-hero.

1332
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,300
Is he kind of, is there a, he has like a superhero alter ego?

1333
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,300
Yeah, it seems like it. Yeah, he has a drone.

1334
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,300
Yeah, you see him on a drone in that first scene.

1335
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:02,300
Crazy plans, his plans always go wrong, you know, big thing in kids' entertainment.

1336
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:08,300
Am I wrong, isn't the plot like you're just trying to get to the place where you're going to get cleaned up so you can be adopted?

1337
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:13,300
Basically, you're just trying, like, at the start of the queue, there's a sign that says adoption at the pet store.

1338
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:19,300
The pet's store, which is not a store that sells pets, it sells pet stuff.

1339
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,300
And that is the store underneath the ride that you come out into,

1340
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:28,300
but it's also represented in the ride when there's like a big bathing, grooming sequence.

1341
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:36,300
Right. So it's just like, you're just trying to get, there's some mild antics that happen on your way to the groomer.

1342
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Why does the, why do the fireworks go off?

1343
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:49,300
Oh, okay, so I think the cats, first off, like, you go into an alley, you run afoul of the alley cats,

1344
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:56,300
they mess you up, you're all dirty, and Snowball's like, I got an idea how to get you to the pet store,

1345
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,300
we're going to put you all on rockets.

1346
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:03,300
And then you're extra disgusting because you're all burned, you're all ashy from rockets.

1347
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,300
You're very dirty from all these hijinks.

1348
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,300
And then they put you through Ru-Bo Goldberg device kind of washing.

1349
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,300
Right, you're dirty from hijinks.

1350
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,300
Yeah.

1351
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,300
That makes sense, yeah.

1352
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:21,300
So that's, yeah, that's what I was saying before is the most, like, I guess intense part of the ride,

1353
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:29,300
is there's a lot of screens, or a couple screens, big screens that have like the CGI movement on them as opposed to like,

1354
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:35,300
there's some robots that are added there, but the screens augment that idea so stuff can travel very fast and blow up.

1355
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:40,300
Yeah, they just bounce along the crates at the bottom that sparkle.

1356
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,300
Right.

1357
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,300
It's fun interactivity, or interaction between the screens.

1358
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,300
There's a lot of projection mapping in the fireworks warehouse.

1359
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,300
Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1360
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,300
Which is cool.

1361
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:56,300
Yes, it's a very good example of when people say like, oh, like when you integrate screens and the robots,

1362
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,300
that's like the best of both worlds.

1363
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:02,300
It's great. I think it works to great effect in this ride.

1364
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,300
But yeah, the animatronics, you can't undersell.

1365
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:11,300
I think Todd Martin's also pointed out there's an alley cat walking along the piano that looks shocking.

1366
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,300
I love it. I was staring at this thing.

1367
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,300
Yeah.

1368
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,300
Because I was like, oh yeah, really the legs are all moving.

1369
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:23,300
Because usually you would think, okay, we're doing a robot gag where there's a robot cat walking on keys.

1370
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,300
The cat can't like, it's not going to touch the keys.

1371
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,300
It's going to float over it a little bit.

1372
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,300
But I'm watching them like, this thing's really like it's setting.

1373
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,300
It looks like it's touching the keys itself.

1374
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:36,300
And I can't really see where the like mechanics of it are.

1375
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,300
And it's close. It's what I always say. What I like.

1376
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:44,300
This ride is very intimate because of how close you are to everything happening.

1377
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:48,300
It is very intimate. They clear, they cram a lot of space.

1378
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,300
I don't think the Globe Theater, I don't think they had the biggest footprint to work with.

1379
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,300
And it's surprising. I think they got as much in here as they did.

1380
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,300
The queue is a little narrow at some portions.

1381
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:03,300
There's a stairway. It was a little surprising to see like a full-size stairway you had to walk up.

1382
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,300
Oh yeah, you ran a quarter, no just stairs.

1383
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,300
What is this, the Millennium Falcon single rider?

1384
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,300
Yeah, right. A barren staircase.

1385
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:17,300
Yeah, and I do question, I mean there's an elevator too for accessibility purposes.

1386
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:23,300
But I do think one of the things probably slowing down the ride, it's like, man that loading area is real tight.

1387
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:27,300
That stairway into the loading is pretty cramped it feels like to me.

1388
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:35,300
So I think loading guests in wheelchairs or mobility vehicles like, oh yeah, that's going to be kind of tough.

1389
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,300
So the queue is all basically on the first floor, is that right?

1390
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,300
I think so, yeah, because at the end of it.

1391
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,300
And then the ride is basically the second floor.

1392
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,300
Yes.

1393
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,300
Oh yeah, because it's sort of a tight space. There wasn't a lot there.

1394
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,300
I didn't think about the two story nature of it, that's cool.

1395
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,300
So that was the solution for the limited space.

1396
01:11:52,300 --> 01:12:01,300
I read one article that said, oh you take it off from the apartment building's mail room, which I didn't really pick up on.

1397
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:08,300
But that the cardboard boxes were like a nod to how Max gets found in the first movie is like in a bunch of cardboard.

1398
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:11,300
Right, so yeah that's your ride vehicle is a big...

1399
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,300
Different kinds of cardboard boxes.

1400
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Yeah, and you like start in a mail room basically.

1401
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:27,300
So it's as if you're a little adorable pet that's been left in a cardboard box and that's how you're riding.

1402
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,300
It's very, very cute.

1403
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:36,300
Yeah, yeah. And when you see the pets, the CG pets that are you are adorable.

1404
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,300
Yes, they're really cute.

1405
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:43,300
Yeah, our full cute agreement on this point, absolutely.

1406
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,300
When Scott, when you went in, wouldn't it be great if you were like Chukko you were staring back at?

1407
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,300
What?

1408
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,300
Cute pet, cute pet, cute pet. Old clown from the 50s.

1409
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:57,300
Boy, didn't you think those dogs were adorable? What do you mean?

1410
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:04,300
And then I go and talk to like, I want to speak to one of the universal engineers and an old man turns around.

1411
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,300
An old clown? Certainly not, I programmed this machine myself.

1412
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:13,300
There's no old clown, not in any of the hundred options available.

1413
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:17,300
Then his throat is slashed by something invisible.

1414
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,300
Yeah, yeah.

1415
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:23,300
And then a clown smile is painted on his lips invisibly.

1416
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:28,300
And then I'm chased by ghostly lipstick with no body.

1417
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,300
Yeah.

1418
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,300
Yikes!

1419
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,300
Zoinks!

1420
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,300
Yeah, run into the mystery machine. It was parked very close.

1421
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,300
Yes, on that block.

1422
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,300
We got to get out of here, Aaron! Like, whoa!

1423
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,300
Like 200 feet from that ride.

1424
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:51,300
But yes, all the dogs I saw, and it's very, I obviously like this too because this is such a

1425
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,300
end of Haunted Mansion. I like it when you see where this is from.

1426
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:01,300
I go, this is obviously the Haunted Mansion and anyone who makes rides, they think about it.

1427
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:08,300
And it's the same principle. There's three big screens and you're going to go buy it and you see something that changes you or

1428
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,300
the ghost obviously follows you home, but it feels like that to me.

1429
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,300
And it feels like it's the evolution of that idea.

1430
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:23,300
Yeah, and towards the end when you see yourself, the puppy versions of you are all wet and then you get blow-dried off.

1431
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,300
So they're like biting the air and stuff.

1432
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:31,300
You watch that in the longest screen process you can really follow from wet to dry.

1433
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:37,300
And you get wet, of course, you can't avoid the old universal splash-a-roo.

1434
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:43,300
Here's what I thought, and I don't think I've said this before and I don't think I had this thought, but maybe I can't remember.

1435
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,300
But as soon as I got wet, I said, you know what?

1436
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:51,300
From now on, instead of saying like, and universal really leans heavily on this wet thing,

1437
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,300
like they always get me wet and it seems like they don't have that many tricks.

1438
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,300
I like the getting wet now.

1439
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:04,300
And I think I challenge universal to get me wet in different fun ways going forward.

1440
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:09,300
You know what? That's what I say. That's their signature. Let's embrace it.

1441
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:14,300
They have to throw water at you on every ride and I'm all for it now.

1442
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:19,300
Now I think it's their thing and I challenge them to do it in even more unique ways going forward.

1443
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,300
Now it's like a, oh my God, you killed Kenny, you bastard.

1444
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,300
Yes.

1445
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:29,300
It's expected at least a long time ago on South Park.

1446
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,300
Right. They may be able to drop that.

1447
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,300
Like 18 seasons ago.

1448
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,300
But yeah, yeah. So it's a matter of where's it going to come from.

1449
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,300
We know it's going to happen. Yeah, you're right.

1450
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:43,300
There's something. It's like, oh, you, you trickster. You're up to your old.

1451
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:46,300
Yeah. And maybe it's just because I haven't been on a universal ride for so long,

1452
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,300
but I def right after it happened, I went, you got the universal. You always do.

1453
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:57,300
Get Mike wet in surprising way. Get Mike wet. It makes him pop.

1454
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,300
He's going to pop so hard when you get him wet.

1455
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Yes, I will pop for sure, especially if it's a unique way that you've gotten me wet.

1456
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,300
It's a scene with some real intimacy.

1457
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,300
Oh man.

1458
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:19,300
If it was like, if it was like when on the ride vehicle, they just like, like all of a sudden they filled your water up to your ankles and then drained it by the end of the ride.

1459
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:24,300
Even something like that. I would be like, I mean, I don't want to get my pants souped, but I want.

1460
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,300
But if you could just do it in unique ways, there's like.

1461
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:33,300
What would you like? What if Disney did it? Because, you know, the Pime.

1462
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,300
Pim, Pim. Pim. Pim. Pim. Pim.

1463
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,300
Okay, Pim. There's the bar.

1464
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,300
There's the restaurant and the bar next to it.

1465
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:48,300
And they say if you order a beer at the bar, the pints fill from the bottom up.

1466
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:54,300
Oh, so if you were getting one of those and suddenly you look down and you were getting like the Millhouse like ankles.

1467
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:59,300
Yeah. You're also getting wet from the.

1468
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,300
Beer?

1469
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,300
I don't know. I don't know.

1470
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,300
Mrs. Van Houten's Jacuzzi suit.

1471
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:07,300
My shoes are wet, but my ankles are bone dry.

1472
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,300
We could do with just a whole episode just on that menu that came out.

1473
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,300
The Pim test. Did you see this, Scott?

1474
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:17,300
I didn't see the full menu of Marvel's or the Avengers campus came out today.

1475
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,300
Everything's either real big or real small.

1476
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,300
Some interesting stuff, I will say.

1477
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,300
Looking forward to it. A lot of impossible.

1478
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:27,300
Yeah, it's like Marvel Mania in a way. As close as we can come now.

1479
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,300
Yeah, I mean, it's not as good as Marvel Mania.

1480
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,300
Sure. What could be.

1481
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:39,300
I have a question before this episode arrives, which is this happened in an episode and it happens not in an episode separately.

1482
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,300
That Jason had been on this ride. We had not been on this ride.

1483
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:51,300
I have a recurring fear, as you may know, of giant creatures and things in small rooms.

1484
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:57,300
And Jason said, oh, wait till you go on the ride because you're going to see.

1485
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:01,300
I speak to you now and I say, I don't know what you're talking about.

1486
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,300
Well, I think. Yeah, what were you talking about?

1487
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,300
I think Duke was just I had not figured maybe the big dog.

1488
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:11,300
Yeah. Well, Duke in the living room and then Duke is above you.

1489
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,300
But I guess I guess I'm forgetting that room is pretty big.

1490
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,300
The like New York Street sequence.

1491
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,300
After I said that, I realized, oh, you know what?

1492
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:25,300
When you turn the when it rotates, you realize you're in a massive street scene.

1493
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,300
But like you're kind of Duke is on a girder like right above you.

1494
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,300
Oh, no, that's that's not a problem whatsoever.

1495
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:40,300
I'm talking about it's got to be, you know, it stems from Mario games with big boo and especially the big fish.

1496
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Jesus Christ. Oh, it's mainly that there's not even that many theme park versions.

1497
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:51,300
And like that, you know, we talked about Sinbad and the what's what is he?

1498
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,300
I forget immediately the giant ogre.

1499
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,300
I some for some reason he doesn't bother me.

1500
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,300
What does bother me and why has this come up before?

1501
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,300
Well, you did. I don't want to get too much.

1502
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,300
You did Jurassic World. Yes.

1503
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,300
Did the Dominus bother you?

1504
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,300
I got you got room to breathe in there.

1505
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:14,300
It's got to be like it is a 10 foot room and it is a 10 foot character.

1506
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,300
There is where I am.

1507
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:29,300
Right. OK, because it really stems from that you go through certain Mario doors and then you are boxed in to a bizarre nightmare cube where you have if you move forward at all, you will just be touching the ghost.

1508
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,300
And you write it. Those things scare me so much.

1509
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,300
I'm trying to what even is the theme park iteration?

1510
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:41,300
I am scared by the dragon in Harry Potter that you whip around or suddenly.

1511
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,300
I'm always a little. Yeah.

1512
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:46,300
Yeah, because that's so big and you don't really have a sense of what's around you.

1513
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,300
Audience, remind me of what scares me.

1514
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,300
What scares Scott? Please.

1515
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,300
Chucko is a different thing. We'll handle Chucko separately.

1516
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,300
But I think hopefully that conveys the terms.

1517
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:02,300
But I think by announcing it, I've been less and less scared of big things.

1518
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,300
And that dog, that's just a good big boy.

1519
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,300
Yeah, it's a good big boy. I mean, yeah, what else haven't we talked about?

1520
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,300
There's so many good, good cats and dogs in this.

1521
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:14,300
There's another pretty good animatronic trick.

1522
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:20,300
I think it's Chloe, the tabby cat voiced by like Belle is like on a little treadmill at some point.

1523
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:23,300
And they make it look like she's walking on the treadmill.

1524
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1525
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:35,300
And that I think the, you know, the mechanics, the guts of the animatronic was probably hidden by the belly.

1526
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Like, I think that's where it was probably connected to the treadmill.

1527
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,300
Oh, interesting.

1528
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,300
Would be my guess.

1529
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,300
And the legs are just like flapping around.

1530
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,300
Yeah, the legs are kind of moving a little.

1531
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:50,300
Max, Max in the alley is like tied up upside down.

1532
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,300
It's like swinging like a pendulum.

1533
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,300
Oh, and like dipping into a barrel. That's fantastic.

1534
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,300
Yeah, that's really good.

1535
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,300
Or maybe it's Gigi, the puffball dog.

1536
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,300
I mean, I think I remember Patton yelling and that.

1537
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:08,300
Yeah, easily makes up, you know, Betsy the gerbil played by Minka Kelly was doing a sort of a ballet routine.

1538
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,300
Do you remember that scene?

1539
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,300
That was really good.

1540
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,300
Well, Norman, the guinea pig, who's always getting lost in the building.

1541
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,300
I think that's actually the director voice of that character.

1542
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,300
But he, oh, that was the thing.

1543
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,300
Maybe the thing that's the lightest most.

1544
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:23,300
So like after you get adopted, you see the family, there's a big party for you at the end.

1545
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:29,300
In the very back of the room, there is a gerbil with a glow stick, like dancing with the glow stick.

1546
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:31,300
It is so cute.

1547
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,300
Or it's the guinea pig.

1548
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,300
Yeah.

1549
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,300
I can't, it's a little hard to tell.

1550
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:36,300
It's a little far away, but it is so cute.

1551
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,300
They've programmed the movement.

1552
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,300
So cute.

1553
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:44,300
Yeah, I was thinking there's a friend of the show, Jenny Nicholson, tweeted this a while ago,

1554
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:49,300
and she made a point about some newer rides like Rise of the Resistance and the Frozen ride at Epcot,

1555
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:54,300
where like some of those rides seem like more like a different philosophy as far as rides are concerned,

1556
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,300
where you're kind of supposed to focus your attention on one thing.

1557
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,300
Yeah.

1558
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:04,300
Versus like the pirates old school Haunted Mansion, where there's a hundred things happening around you.

1559
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,300
Oh, chaos.

1560
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:14,300
And obviously like we like those two rides, but I was thinking like on this, I go, oh, this really feels like that style,

1561
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:19,300
which I appreciate because I guess I haven't gone on a new ride that felt like this in a while,

1562
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,300
where there's a hundred things going on.

1563
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:24,300
And like you said that gerbil thing, I don't remember that.

1564
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:32,300
It's like behind some other anime shorts, but he like just moves very rapidly.

1565
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,300
And it's just so cute.

1566
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:39,300
And then the dog on like an ottoman dressed like in a little minion costume.

1567
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,300
Like that's fun.

1568
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,300
And they're playing the song from the movie.

1569
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,300
And I thought it was at Justin Timberlake.

1570
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,300
It's not the Trolls song.

1571
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,300
It's not, but that's the Trolls song.

1572
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:51,300
No, but it sounds in the same vein.

1573
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,300
Dance, dance, dance.

1574
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,300
Yeah.

1575
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:59,300
So it's like, I would wonder like if we would talk about Rise of the Resistance and like anyone was like,

1576
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,300
did you see that?

1577
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:04,300
Did you see the part where there was the AT-AT shoot at you?

1578
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:08,300
Like, of course you saw, everyone saw every big thing that happened on that ride.

1579
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,300
But truly, like you said that, I go, oh, gerbil dance?

1580
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,300
I don't remember that.

1581
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,300
I know.

1582
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,300
There's so much.

1583
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,300
Yeah, you're right.

1584
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,300
That's a very cool thing about it.

1585
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,300
Let's counter to your intimacy notion.

1586
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:28,300
If what you want is to like, because yeah, the Rise thing is, it's Kylo Ren looking at you, threatening you.

1587
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:33,300
But you can't have the intimate, you can't have the moment in the chaos ride.

1588
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,300
It's like a different breed.

1589
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,300
And I think, yeah, you want them both.

1590
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,300
You want variety.

1591
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,300
Well, yeah, it depends.

1592
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:46,300
I mean, it depends what intimacy we're talking about, you know, because there is intimacy when Optimus Prime tells you he's very proud of you.

1593
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:56,300
But you can, if the robots are very close to you and you focus on one thing, you do have intimacy with whatever you have chosen to focus on,

1594
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,300
whatever has come into your vision, your line of sight.

1595
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:04,300
So I think Erin had not been on that ride since we started doing this podcast.

1596
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:10,300
So at that moment, like as soon as he landed and just looks for that beach, she left out loud.

1597
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:14,300
She just knowing now viewing it in this lens.

1598
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,300
That was the thing.

1599
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,300
Yes.

1600
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:20,300
You're your bravery.

1601
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,300
He did not.

1602
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,300
I was waiting.

1603
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,300
I was going to take a photo with him, but he would.

1604
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,300
Optimus was not coming.

1605
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,300
Like the meet and greet was not.

1606
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,300
It's like Optimus will be back tomorrow.

1607
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,300
Optimus is not feeling talkative today.

1608
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,300
Yeah.

1609
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:39,300
And I'm sure we all saw the video online where Optimus was saying these this last year has been very trying.

1610
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,300
No, I didn't.

1611
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,300
What are you talking about?

1612
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,300
No, we should talk about that in the other episode.

1613
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,300
We got to show this.

1614
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,300
We should show it to you live so we can get your real reaction.

1615
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1616
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,300
Load it up.

1617
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,300
He's trying times.

1618
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,300
Oh, yeah.

1619
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:58,300
He gives a whole like weird speech that's like trying not to make like anti mask people.

1620
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,300
He's trying to hit all the.

1621
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:03,300
Republicans buy sneakers too.

1622
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,300
Look, Jack, we got to come together, man.

1623
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,300
We have to come together.

1624
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,300
Can't be having this squabbling man.

1625
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,300
Look.

1626
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,300
You've been working on Biden in the off season.

1627
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,300
What's that?

1628
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,300
Have you been working on the Biden?

1629
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,300
Not really.

1630
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,300
I feel like I busted that out.

1631
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,300
OK.

1632
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,300
Yeah, no, I'm impressed.

1633
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,300
You got to get this guy to go low.

1634
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,300
Yeah.

1635
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:27,300
It's got to get this guy.

1636
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,300
Um, Megatron came out and Bumblebee was out later.

1637
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:37,300
But you know, size and big triangle, Bulby, Bulby and Metron.

1638
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:40,300
Optimus Pine takes all of them.

1639
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,300
Crispine takes Crispine takes out to his time.

1640
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,300
Yeah, I guess.

1641
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,300
I guess.

1642
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,300
I guess.

1643
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,300
I guess the Bidens are because Carvey has one now.

1644
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,300
I'm a little bit.

1645
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,300
He did.

1646
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,300
I think he Carvey Carvey in this ride.

1647
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,300
Yes.

1648
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,300
Oh, yes.

1649
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,300
Carvey plays.

1650
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:56,300
Dana Carvey presence in a theme park.

1651
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:57,300
Yeah.

1652
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,300
Good thing.

1653
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:59,300
He's like a grumpy old man.

1654
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,300
A grumpy old dog like he's got a wheel.

1655
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,300
He's got the wheels.

1656
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,300
Tube channel.

1657
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,300
Yeah.

1658
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,300
Oh, is he in?

1659
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,300
Is he an animatronic?

1660
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:07,300
Yeah, he's got the wheels on his back.

1661
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,300
See, I missed him.

1662
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,300
I just caught him in the queue.

1663
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,300
Yeah, he's on the ride as well.

1664
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,300
Yeah.

1665
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,300
What's that?

1666
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:18,900
You know, if you talk about favorite moments in the whole thing, I think it ends really

1667
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,760
cute and the party is great.

1668
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:25,140
But maybe my favorite moment is just the reveal of what kind of ride it's going to be.

1669
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:29,300
That it is a chaos ride, that it's a hard to focus ride when you enter that room with

1670
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,740
the girder and he's over there.

1671
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:36,700
You even miss him operating the machine and snowballs up in the drone.

1672
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,780
It's just such a big pronouncement.

1673
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,020
This is a crazy animatronic ride.

1674
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,020
You're going to see a ton of them.

1675
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:46,020
You're going to have trouble following it, so you've got to come back and see it again

1676
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:47,460
and again to catch everything.

1677
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,460
Yeah.

1678
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:51,700
It's just so you can tell why that's the press photo that they're pushing out the most.

1679
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:56,020
It's a really exciting moment and especially after being endorsed for so long.

1680
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:01,180
I think for so many people, this will end up being their first ride back.

1681
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:06,660
And it's just always going to have, not a lot of rides are tied to an era.

1682
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:11,540
It's not like in this ride makes me reflect on the events of September 11th or whatever.

1683
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:17,300
But this one, oddly this pet's ride, I think, in this awful corona year are going to sort

1684
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:21,340
of be married but in the most joyous way.

1685
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:27,260
Theme Park Insider, they had a really nice review of it and they said at the end of their

1686
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:33,600
write up, after a year in which so many of us have experienced layoffs and isolation,

1687
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:39,340
it's heartwarming to feel wanted and welcome again even if it's by an animated family.

1688
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:40,340
And I think that's right.

1689
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:41,940
I think that's pretty good.

1690
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:42,940
Yeah.

1691
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:48,700
Because it's just like, yeah, they adopt you and then there's a big party celebrating you.

1692
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,700
Yes.

1693
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,700
It's nice.

1694
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,020
It is nice.

1695
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:57,340
I was thinking with kids, this feels like, obviously when you're a kid, this is going

1696
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:01,860
to be one of the first rides you're allowed to go on if you go to Universal.

1697
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:07,060
So this definitely feels like, and maybe I shouldn't say this with Universal, but it

1698
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:12,180
does feel like this should be like a legacy ride for, like this should be like last forever

1699
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,180
and get an update.

1700
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,180
Yeah.

1701
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:17,460
Obviously they won't, they probably will demolish it in 10 years or something, but it feels

1702
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:21,660
like that continuity, that's what we've talked about before.

1703
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,180
Some continuity at Disneyland is nice.

1704
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:27,460
It doesn't need to be everything, but some continuity from like, your grandmother rode

1705
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:31,040
this and your parents rode this and now you're riding this.

1706
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:36,700
There's a nice thing to have a few rides, like a few experiences like that at a park.

1707
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:40,380
It would be nice if they kept something around and not destroyed.

1708
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:43,780
I mean, this is the only, like at this point, like Simpsons is going to have to probably

1709
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:45,260
go at a certain point.

1710
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:48,780
And plus this is kind of like probably a better experience for you if you're a kid than Simpsons

1711
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,780
is.

1712
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:50,780
Yeah.

1713
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:54,620
And if this, I mean, hopefully it seems like the reception so far is very positive.

1714
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,460
Like I had very few criticisms of any of this.

1715
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,460
No.

1716
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:01,740
It's like, I think it sorely, it was a thing that were sorely lacking.

1717
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:06,300
If you have real little kids, you could kill most of the day in Illumination Alley.

1718
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,300
Yeah.

1719
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,300
Oh yeah.

1720
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,300
It's a little par for you.

1721
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,300
You don't even have to go downstairs.

1722
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:11,300
That's my plan.

1723
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,460
There's not a lot to do for little kids down there.

1724
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:17,900
So if I ever take the boy, when I take the boy, it's all on the table now.

1725
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:24,180
If he gets tired of the playground play area at Super Silly Fun Land, there is a like kind

1726
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,420
of a, not hidden, but it's hard to see.

1727
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,420
You forget it's there.

1728
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:31,220
There's a playground at Jurassic in the Jurassic complex.

1729
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,500
I was reminded of that.

1730
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,500
Yeah, yeah.

1731
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,420
And that stuff's not open yet and I'm really looking forward to it.

1732
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:41,660
And like, cause I know that's going to be where we kill a lot of time with him.

1733
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:48,660
And if I get tired of any of it, then it's 110 degree Jameson shots.

1734
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,300
The old little, what did you call it?

1735
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,420
It was like a...

1736
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,980
Like a railroad apartment.

1737
01:29:53,980 --> 01:30:00,660
Which is kind of, in Philadelphia there are a number of like townhouses, like row houses

1738
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:05,940
and stuff where like the corner unit, the ground floor basement, like people turn the

1739
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,460
bottom floor into bars.

1740
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:08,460
Oh sure.

1741
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,460
In Market Billy.

1742
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:12,180
You'd feel the train rumbling by.

1743
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,500
It's Lil Shakey's, the bar on the corner.

1744
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,020
I don't know what the real name is.

1745
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,540
It's Lill Shakey's to me.

1746
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:25,940
Saddle up to the bar with Mare of Easttown and you know, drink away your troubles.

1747
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:30,260
Hey, if you see me at Lil Shakey's, shots on me.

1748
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:37,780
You survived podcast the ride, see your life with pets off the leash edition.

1749
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,780
Hey, if you have closing thoughts, throw them in.

1750
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,780
I don't mean to...

1751
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,860
Well, I just, yeah, I want to say like, I really like this.

1752
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:43,860
I'm going to go on it again.

1753
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:48,140
I'm sure I'll have further thoughts just cause the wait times were much longer than I even

1754
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,140
thought they would be.

1755
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,100
The virtual queue worked great for me.

1756
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,540
Oh, I didn't even try the virtual queue.

1757
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:54,940
If you hear rustling, I'm getting my mic.

1758
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,620
I'm prepared to go over and take a look at what the Beatle situation is here as we wrap

1759
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,620
up.

1760
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,300
So, Garfield finally went to sleep.

1761
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,420
He went to sleep about 30 minutes ago.

1762
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,420
Oh, jeez.

1763
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:07,740
With his owner like in the shadow of...

1764
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:08,740
In the sunset.

1765
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,740
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1766
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,740
The shade moves.

1767
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,740
The sun has moved.

1768
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:12,740
That's another thing.

1769
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:16,220
Yeah, we got to account for the movement of the sun as we do these episodes.

1770
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:22,660
Hey, for more discussion of our triumphant return to Universal and a lot of other great

1771
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:28,420
episodes three a month in vect, then go to podcast the ride, the second gate at patreon.com

1772
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,980
slash podcast the ride.

1773
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:34,540
Check us out on the socials and merch and a lot of fun stuff coming up soon.

1774
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:37,780
Mike's investigating over in Scarab Town.

1775
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:38,780
Okay.

1776
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:39,780
This is great.

1777
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:43,100
We take you now to Mike, four feet away.

1778
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,460
I'm looking at it and I don't know.

1779
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:47,860
It's moving like a little bit.

1780
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:52,660
I do think maybe it has died, which is a really sad way to end an episode.

1781
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:54,140
That's a weird way to end an episode.

1782
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,420
Well, yeah, that's a bummer.

1783
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,540
I don't know, though, because it was like this before.

1784
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:01,620
So I was hoping to go over there and there'd be a bunch of babies.

1785
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,980
But well, yeah, I say, you know, let's not focus on that.

1786
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:07,500
I want it since you guys are over.

1787
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,540
You know, we're back in person again.

1788
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:11,500
I like to offer little treats to everybody.

1789
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,140
And you know, here, I don't think I don't know if you've seen it.

1790
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:20,140
I had this this open container of raisinets down on the grass by me the whole time.

1791
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,660
You guys want to reach in.

1792
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:27,100
Now, I'm looking like just these little like, you know, like these little black guys,

1793
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:30,060
those little black beads here.

1794
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,500
There's more in it than this bag than I thought.

1795
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,740
I felt like it was almost empty earlier, but now it seems pretty full.

1796
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:40,700
If you guys want to reach in and just grab a handful, feel free.

1797
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,180
Wait. Oh, my God.

1798
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:45,780
Wait. These may not be raisinets.

1799
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,620
They are crawling up me.

1800
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:50,780
There are hundreds of them, thousands of them, in fact.

1801
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:52,460
Oh, Jason's just eating them. Fine.

1802
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:55,300
Well, the Ingoldfield are going to town on the raisinets, Garrop.

1803
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,540
Scott's being eaten by beetles, but Jason's eating the beetles.

1804
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,540
Oh, no.

1805
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,180
It's like he has control over them.

1806
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,540
And I'm listening to the beetles.

1807
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:06,980
Jason's been Imhotep this entire time.

1808
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:09,020
Well, Jason, your souls are mine.

1809
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:11,460
Imhotep. What?

1810
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:14,020
And he's daddy as well. He's hot.

1811
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,900
As I'm getting swallowed entirely, I'm not going to have a mouth soon,

1812
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:22,140
so I better say first, fuck you, Jason.

1813
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,700
Jason lives forever, I guess.

1814
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,540
And thanks for listening.

1815
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:31,300
Whoa, bro. Bye bye.

1816
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:40,180
