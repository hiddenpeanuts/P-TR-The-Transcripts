1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,520
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,520
which is different than the Podcast the Ride, the main feed,

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,380
just as Polo by Ralph Lauren is different

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,540
by the U.S. Polo Association clothing line.

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm Jason Scharton, joined is always by Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,080
Have you ever encountered this?

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,040
Like you go to a Marshall's and there's like,

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,800
wait, there's Polo shirts and then there's U.S. Polo.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,120
I guess I know what you're saying,

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,240
but this is never really a conscious thought I have.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,880
So wait, you're saying that there's a,

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,400
like a normal Polo shirt.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,560
Okay, bring Scott Gertner in here.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,920
Scott, maybe you've encountered this.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,240
He's a Polo guy.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,080
But Polo shirts are, it doesn't have to be one

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,600
of those brands to be a Polo shirt, does it?

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,560
I don't know about the exact qualifications,

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,080
but if you notice a lot of store,

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,960
you'll see this U.S. Polo brand.

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,960
And some of the logos will say not associated

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,660
with Polo by Ralph Lauren,

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,320
because Polo by Ralph Lauren came along later.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,880
And like, this was a big like issue.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
And this isn't even today's topic.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,040
I should look into this more.

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm just gonna definitely bring this up later,

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
just in reference to the fact that I've been wanting

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,800
to do a second gate about a character named Polo Bear.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,640
Of course.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,080
Is this coming up on the show or did you just text about that?

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,400
I texted about it, but I think I briefly mentioned it

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
on one episode in the last year or two.

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,560
But it's not been a runner,

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,360
it's not been a continuing runner or anything.

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,080
But Polo Bear is a bear that has different like outfits

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,480
and you can buy it on a sweater for $650.

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,200
So.

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
Let's start buying them and then we can do the episode.

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,240
Well, we'll each buy one a month

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,800
and then we'll be able to talk about it.

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,360
Every outfit.

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
Every outfit.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,980
So yeah, no, we're not talking about fashion today.

46
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,440
We're not talking about bears today.

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,440
We're talking about a man in the 30s

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,900
who played a fancy sport for rich people

49
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,480
and then he got hurt.

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
Yes.

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
Vertebrae.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,640
And that sounds like not a lot, right?

53
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,360
But keep in mind that that man is Walt Disney.

54
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh.

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
Keep in mind that some of the things

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
that spun out of this injury changed the world.

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Right.

58
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,960
The weaver of dreams, the keeper of stories,

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,820
Walt Disney's world famous polo injury

60
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,240
would go on to lead to the modern American

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
theme park industry.

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
That's right.

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,200
Yeah.

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
This time, Walt's polo injury,

65
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,880
I think we rushed this one into production

66
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,080
maybe more than other topics.

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,920
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,840
We discovered it.

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
We realized this had to happen.

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
And you know, look, I came from the world

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,440
of viral videos, right?

72
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,380
With my YouTube and my funnier die.

73
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,200
So I know the importance of a grabby title.

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
And gentlemen, I hope you're prepared to have gone

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,880
super viral with the title Walt's Polo Injury.

76
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,720
I am, yeah.

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,040
And this is gonna be everywhere.

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,680
This is gonna be on the front page of Poe.

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,800
Has Kevin Perjurer done a Walt's polo injury video?

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
No, right?

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
He's mentioned it probably, but it has come up.

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
But this does come up a lot.

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
It is like one sentence in like

84
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,160
quick Walt Disney biographies or like Walt's interest.

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,200
Well, it just came up because we were talking about

86
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,680
the story living by Disney,

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,080
the incredibly exciting development

88
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,320
and that they're gonna build Cotino in Rancho Mirage

89
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,520
and they're gonna finally tribute Walt's special connection

90
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,080
to the Palm Springs area that we've heard so much about

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
for these many years.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,140
It seems like, okay, so there's just been like,

93
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,200
I'd say a glut lately of Walt mythology

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,480
that has suddenly risen to the surface out of nowhere.

95
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,020
There's that, there's Walt's special lamp, of course,

96
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,320
that means so much to Zeddy tomorrow.

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,400
There's one that I didn't even get to

98
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,660
in the Toontown episode that we just did,

99
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,780
which is that, you guys might have read this,

100
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,420
that one of the things that's going into the new Toontown

101
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,780
is a special tree.

102
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,980
And that is a tree that is modeled after Walt's dreaming tree,

103
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,020
which he of course had in Missouri.

104
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,460
We all know about the dreaming tree.

105
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,180
I actually did not see the dreaming tree.

106
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,060
He would stare up at the dreaming tree

107
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,200
and imagine we could tell stories and characters.

108
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,580
I did read that paragraph about the dreaming tree

109
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,780
and I'm like, this is like the fucking yellow cake

110
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,260
uranium in Iraq.

111
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,060
This is like when they're like,

112
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,660
there's actually uranium coming in through back channels

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,500
and they're building, I'm like,

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,140
you made up out of whole, this is total bullshit.

115
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,340
This tree in Missouri.

116
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,400
I saw somebody was upset

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,180
because I compared Han Solo's dice,

118
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,940
which somebody has pointed out

119
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,740
that Han Solo's dice are visible in A New Hope.

120
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,100
They're hanging somewhere, but he never mentioned,

121
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,700
he never touches it, he never gives it a little kiss.

122
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,540
We're not talking about Luke's belt.

123
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,220
So what I'm gonna say, it is all like Han's dice

124
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,980
in the sense that they pulled something from,

125
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
just like they saw it,

126
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,620
they saw a picture of Walt with a tree

127
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,980
and maybe he said it was dreaming tree, maybe he didn't.

128
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,700
And now they're sort of retconning it into being a big deal.

129
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,900
That little thing, STR has always been on the tie,

130
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,540
smoke tree, it stands for smoke tree ranch.

131
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,140
Now we have to really up his connection to smoke tree ranch.

132
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,560
Anyway, this has all been fascinating to learn,

133
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,660
but what worries me is that for the Disney company,

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,520
Walt mythology is a precious resource

135
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,960
and we are losing it by the day.

136
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,560
They are running out of Walt things

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,640
and that's what powers the company.

138
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,760
It is fossil fuels to them

139
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,760
and we're burning acres of mental real estate each year.

140
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,200
They're like more and more and more.

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,120
At this rate, we're gonna lose Walt's entire,

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
there's gonna be nothing left.

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,760
And they just have to be careful.

144
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,040
They can't get greedy.

145
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,200
So if Walt had like a special napkin

146
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,040
or a special belt buckle,

147
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,080
or a magic plate, a tea saucer,

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
save that for 2028.

149
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,760
Yeah, you're right.

150
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,280
They have to really ration out the Walt mythology.

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,640
But what they probably could start doing

152
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,360
is the same thing they're doing to Star Wars

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,960
where in A New Hope, there's a line about

154
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,640
a lot of who died for the plans, spies or whatever.

155
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,680
There's a line, a throw off line in New Hope

156
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,440
about how they got the Death Star plans

157
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,400
and then they made Rogue One,

158
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,600
which is a movie based on one single line.

159
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,840
So maybe it's like if Walt was in a special

160
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,680
and he's talking to like a short sleeve dress shirt Imagineer

161
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,640
and he leaves frame for a second,

162
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,160
they can start adding story to what he did there.

163
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,760
It was Walt went up and he touched this wall,

164
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,880
the special wall he had,

165
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,040
when he would shoot the specials

166
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,040
and it was his not dreaming wall,

167
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,440
it was his, it was a comfort wall.

168
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,560
His Enchant, Walt's wall of enchantment.

169
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
Walt's wall of enchantment

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,160
and they've recreated this wall of enchantment

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,640
for you to lean on.

172
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Yeah.

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,960
In a new.

174
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
It's a freestanding development,

175
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
like in the middle of Nebraska.

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,640
Now you have to go drive to the wall.

177
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,560
Is there anything to do with the walls or a ride

178
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
or a place I can stay?

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,400
No, you touch the wall,

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
maybe you get a little enchantment

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,800
and live your Walt story and that will be $250.

182
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
Yeah, exactly.

183
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,520
There you go.

184
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,200
So like stuff like that or Walt's pointer

185
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,920
when he's pointing at the Epcot thing,

186
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,160
he's got like a long stick.

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh, Walt's wonderful stick.

188
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,400
He loved this stick.

189
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,280
He used to point at things all the time with it.

190
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
And now.

191
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,960
His pointing stick.

192
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
His pointing stick.

193
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,280
His dream.

194
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,080
Point the way to the future.

195
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
It was more than pointing.

196
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
It was a dream.

197
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
He's pointing to.

198
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
Yeah, it was a dream stick.

199
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,320
Walt's dream stick.

200
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,360
There is a detail in this story

201
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,640
that they could scale pretty quickly

202
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,680
at all of the deluxe resort spas

203
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,600
and call it the five o'clock special

204
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,360
or Walt's five o'clock special.

205
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,960
Ha ha.

206
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,800
That's good.

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,240
You could do that tomorrow.

208
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
The closest thing,

209
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,720
because you're talking about when he would get

210
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,560
his pulmonary worked on.

211
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,400
Yes or?

212
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,240
Yes.

213
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,320
Yeah, I'm sure we'll go through it chronologically.

214
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
Yeah, we'll talk about it in a second.

215
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
But there was a time.

216
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,200
In the last chapter.

217
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,000
There was a regular time when he would have it worked on.

218
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,840
So the closest and then he would have a drink,

219
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,040
I believe at the same time.

220
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,880
Yeah, a glass of scotch.

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,960
The five o'clock special is the combo

222
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,760
of getting your back rubbed.

223
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,440
It's a back massage and a glass of scotch.

224
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
And supposedly that's what Walt needed at 5 p.m. every day

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,680
to be able to drive home to his house.

226
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Jeez.

227
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,720
It's the detail that I kept seeing come up.

228
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,520
And I was like, oh yeah, I guess that LA traffic.

229
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,880
The injury is way worse, I think, than I knew.

230
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,360
Walt's physical state seems a lot worse

231
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,160
than I knew.

232
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,080
But this is what, you know, if Disney can spin off

233
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,920
every object that Walt touched

234
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,160
or every piece of his story into something,

235
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,480
it's time for us to grab one

236
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,560
that I don't think they're gonna hit

237
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,920
and that's Walt's polo injury.

238
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,400
And I'm excited we're doing it.

239
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes, it's good.

240
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I mean, they're gonna hear this

241
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,560
and they're gonna steal it from us, I think.

242
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,400
But we'll at least have.

243
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,320
You know, they should plant the flag here.

244
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,880
As we said, the hypothesis, the theory,

245
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,480
that I think Jason, you said in short a couple weeks ago,

246
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
is that it leads to the parks in a way.

247
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
And I'd say that's true,

248
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,080
but it's a little more complicated than that

249
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,920
from what I found.

250
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm curious what we all thought of the story.

251
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,400
Yeah, it is a little more complicated.

252
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,720
I'd love to start by just talking about polo,

253
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,280
which I learned a little bit about.

254
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,120
Did everyone learn?

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,400
Oh please, you know, it occurred to me that I should

256
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,200
and I didn't and it's in philosophy.

257
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,120
Yeah, because the background is very,

258
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,560
it's like a big piece of Hollywood history,

259
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
just kind of lost to time.

260
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,760
Called like, basically like the social networking of its day

261
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
was playing polo with all these other rich guys.

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,840
You'd play polo and then you'd make deals.

263
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,160
And then, yeah, you would, you know,

264
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,560
make movies or whatever.

265
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,920
You're bringing your, this is a sport on a horse,

266
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,760
first of all.

267
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,600
Yeah, you're basically.

268
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,440
All mallets and horses.

269
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Yeah, I was trying to think,

270
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,920
cause like some people were saying it's like golf on a horse,

271
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,080
but it's almost more like action croquet on a horse

272
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,920
or something.

273
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Like you're.

274
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah, cause it's mallets.

275
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,640
It's intense.

276
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,960
Yeah, so you're on a horse holding a mallet

277
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,560
and there's a ball and you're trying to just like,

278
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,080
as if it's soccer or something,

279
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,640
get the ball down the field through a goal, essentially.

280
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,520
And that's the one thing I haven't looked,

281
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,480
I've never seen footage of this in my life.

282
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,080
It is a, there's a goal over here, goal over there.

283
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,920
You got a sport.

284
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,760
Yes, and I'm sure somebody,

285
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm sure I'll get something wrong,

286
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,880
but there are four players on a team.

287
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
So it's four on four.

288
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,600
So you need four people and four horses for a team.

289
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,800
Well, and backup horses.

290
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,520
And backup horses.

291
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,160
Yes.

292
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,240
There are like, I guess you would call it like,

293
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,960
there are, I guess you call them like periods,

294
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,720
like there are, they're called chukkas

295
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,280
and they're seven minutes long.

296
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,640
Do you have chukka written down?

297
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,800
You have, you have just explained something that comes up.

298
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
Okay, okay.

299
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,480
I'll get to it.

300
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,840
You've, I had a big question about something.

301
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,960
So you can, you can play a match of like,

302
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,480
between like four and eight chukkas.

303
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
That's what I understand.

304
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,240
And then it's basically who, how many,

305
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,880
whoever has the most points.

306
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
And then there are four players.

307
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,320
Number one, the player number one on your team

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
is like the main offense guy.

309
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
I was trying to figure out who I would be on a polo team.

310
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
Number two is like similar,

311
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,720
but not quite maybe like not as good on offense,

312
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,840
but still pretty good.

313
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,920
Number three on the team is the tactical leader.

314
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,200
And they're doing a lot of hitting the ball to one and two.

315
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
So they're setting up people to make, you know,

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,840
shots or goals.

317
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,440
So one is the star who drives it.

318
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,960
Who don't, that's a Jora.

319
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,640
It's Michael Jordan, the ball on the team.

320
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Okay.

321
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,840
And then number four is like defense.

322
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,280
That's probably like the last line of defense too.

323
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,080
So they're whacking the horses in the face with the mallet.

324
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,120
Yes.

325
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
That, well, you're not supposed to do that.

326
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
That's a foul.

327
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
There are penalty hits.

328
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,640
You're also like, it's very confusing and I can't,

329
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm sure I won't be able to explain it that well,

330
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,040
but you're not supposed to like,

331
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,000
kind of railroad or like T-bone a horse on your horse.

332
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,440
You're supposed to, there's supposed to be,

333
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,120
there's like a gentlemanly agreement of like,

334
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,400
you kind of ride your horse next to the person

335
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,560
and try to get the ball away versus like,

336
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,720
you can't just run in front of the horse with your horse

337
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
and the horse flies.

338
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,040
Oh, thank God.

339
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,720
It's still crazy.

340
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,640
It's an insane, crazy sport.

341
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,960
Yeah, it's a bunch of rich guys with blunt instruments

342
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,760
riding horses at each other.

343
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
It's literally like, it's like a,

344
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,080
it's a cousin of the joust in some ways.

345
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,320
Yeah, wow.

346
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
Yes.

347
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,080
Cavalrys were- In only last century.

348
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Yeah.

349
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,600
It was one of the, I feel like every sport

350
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,840
at some point was called the sport of kings,

351
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,640
but this is how they trained like horse mounted,

352
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,120
like cavalries.

353
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,960
Right.

354
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Oh geez.

355
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,440
So yeah, I only did a brief explainer on this

356
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,720
cause I did not know what it is,

357
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,520
but it's, they're still played in places,

358
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,680
but it used to be very,

359
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,960
there were so many polo fields in Los Angeles.

360
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,080
25 was the number I kept coming across.

361
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,000
I saw that I think.

362
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,840
Wow.

363
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,960
And there's little remnants of it,

364
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,760
like the Polo Lounge, the famous bar

365
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

366
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,800
Oh, okay.

367
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,720
I believe it takes its name from the popularity of polo.

368
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,840
On the story living episode, I said like,

369
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,880
oh, in Coachella, they're, they call the,

370
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,920
where the music festival is held,

371
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,040
those are the polo grounds because,

372
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
I don't know if it's still used for polo,

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,280
but it was used for polo.

374
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,120
That is not where Walt's injury occurred.

375
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,240
I was wrong about that.

376
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Okay, yeah.

377
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,360
But he was an avid polo enthusiast.

378
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
I'm not sure I know where.

379
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,400
I guess we'll figure out where,

380
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,320
but there were a bunch around here

381
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
and he used ones around here.

382
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,760
That's I think what's strange is that they would be like,

383
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,000
this is a facility that is golf and tennis

384
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,640
and this thing with mallets and horses.

385
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,800
And horses, yeah.

386
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
Right.

387
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,960
Like golf and tennis still,

388
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,000
we kept those, very common,

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,520
polo a little bit, a little more complicated.

390
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Yeah.

391
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,080
Maybe the way in is to talk about how Walt's

392
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,560
found himself playing polo.

393
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,720
Sure, yeah.

394
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Which was the, his runaway popularity in the 1930s,

395
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,600
but also, so much success, but also so much stress.

396
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,840
And so much is being asked of him.

397
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,440
That the job is getting more and more stressful.

398
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,960
In addition, very sadly, I didn't know

399
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,120
that there were two miscarriages in his.

400
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,240
Oh sure.

401
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,160
Or his wife, Lillian.

402
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,520
By the way, I'm pulling a bunch of info

403
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,440
from the article by Wade Sampson and Mouse Planet,

404
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,400
just so I'm not stealing things he's saying.

405
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,640
Sure.

406
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,840
But Walt's doctor suggested that, oh wait.

407
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,680
He had a nervous breakdown, don't forget.

408
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,080
Oh yes, yes, suffering one of his infamous.

409
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,400
Infamous.

410
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
Nervous breakdown.

411
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,960
Hell of a breakdown, I went to pieces,

412
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,400
as he was quoted saying it.

413
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,440
Oh man.

414
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Walt.

415
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,800
This is not what we're used to seeing,

416
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,960
the happy guy who Tinkerbell lands on his shoulder

417
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,320
and he tells us what the submarine ride's gonna be.

418
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,160
Are they gonna.

419
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,560
What a dark chapter.

420
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,760
Is there gonna be some sort of place in Katino

421
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,880
where it's like, come here and relax

422
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,560
from having one of Walt's nervous breakdowns

423
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
that you have around.

424
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
It might be, maybe they are subtly aiming it to people.

425
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,320
They have to show footage of people clinking wine glasses,

426
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,560
but it's secretly like,

427
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,680
you're going through a divorce, are you good?

428
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,760
You're having a Walt's breakdown.

429
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, are you having an infamous breakdown?

430
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,280
Walt's got you covered, he's been here.

431
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,520
I imagine people in these days,

432
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,760
everyone had a nervous breakdown once a week.

433
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,600
Maybe that's what.

434
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
Well it was those days.

435
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,280
It was those days.

436
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
It was a rougher time.

437
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,440
People, it's only a decade plus back from World War I,

438
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,480
he was in World War I.

439
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Sure.

440
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,320
And they obviously didn't call it PTSD at the time.

441
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,440
I think they were just still called it shell shocked.

442
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,280
Sure.

443
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,440
To come back freaked out and broken from the war.

444
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,280
Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,440
And he was shell shocked from driving a car around a little

446
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
and meeting Ray Kroc.

447
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,200
Oh yeah.

448
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,800
Walt was broken from all this.

449
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
And then all these other things happened

450
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,960
and he's so successful, he is starting to lose his mind.

451
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,960
So then this is what, I was about to just read this

452
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,080
and I forgot what was coming.

453
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,800
This is the copy from Mouse Planet.

454
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,960
Walt's doctor suggested that Mickey Mouse's father,

455
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't know if we went through this.

456
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,840
Yeah we did, yeah.

457
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
The weirdness of that phrase.

458
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,040
Yeah.

459
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,280
Here I just run into it like wow.

460
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,000
Mickey's daddy, yeah.

461
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
You didn't like that I think.

462
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,920
Father is, I still find father weird

463
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,760
but daddy obviously jumps at the same time.

464
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,360
Well but now daddy, the whole weird thing with daddy

465
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,400
and like two meanings, like that's not just this problem.

466
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,360
You know, that's always gonna be weird.

467
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,960
Cause we can call Josh tomorrow daddy or zaddy

468
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,240
but that's a different connotation

469
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,000
from calling Walt Mickey's daddy.

470
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,840
Cause we're saying that in a fun way

471
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,280
and the other one is like a cheeky dirty way.

472
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,840
Context clues, I think context clues.

473
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,520
I mean I understand what you're saying.

474
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,240
I'm finding all of it weird.

475
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,400
I, there's no daddy that you said in that sentence

476
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,560
that wasn't bizarre to me.

477
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,760
No, no, I didn't like one of those.

478
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,120
I didn't like the daddies.

479
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
That's why you insist on your child calling you

480
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
papa, papa.

481
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,720
That'd be fine, I'll go with papa.

482
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,440
Papa is good.

483
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
I like, you know what I like?

484
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,520
I like the English or British thing

485
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,320
of calling like grandma gran.

486
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,600
I'm way into that, gran.

487
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,440
Gran.

488
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,260
Yeah.

489
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,160
It's very like.

490
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,880
Well then when you say like that, it sounds formal

491
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,480
but like if it's gran, you know, it's like,

492
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,760
that's less formal.

493
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Are you gonna like, wait, British,

494
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
so a British accent is required.

495
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,120
No, I think you can call it gran.

496
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,800
Hey gran.

497
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,680
What do you think about gran?

498
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,440
Say it in a sentence though.

499
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm going to gran's house.

500
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,240
Yes, I think it'll.

501
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,080
Do you want to go to gran's house?

502
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,920
Do you want to go to gran's house?

503
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,760
Do you want to go to gran's house?

504
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,600
Do you want to go to gran's house?

505
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,440
Unless it's regularly used.

506
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,560
Well it'll have to be, yeah.

507
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,680
I feel like they call Gene Smart that in Mayor of Easttown.

508
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,520
Sure.

509
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,640
I feel like, I ain't gonna be home in time for dinner

510
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,920
but gran'll be there.

511
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,440
Gran'll put something in the oven.

512
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
Gran, you know.

513
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,120
Look at this voice.

514
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,960
Yeah, look at that voice.

515
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,800
What's the region of the.

516
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,640
That's the deliration.

517
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,000
That's the Delaware County.

518
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,120
I was curious about that actually recently.

519
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,080
If you have any remnants of language,

520
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
maybe the listener, people who've listened to you a ton

521
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,280
might even know something that you have

522
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,480
that you don't even know you have.

523
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,560
I have a lot.

524
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,200
Yeah, wooder kind of goes in and out for water.

525
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,840
When I shot one of those commercials a few years ago,

526
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,600
they were like really like, how is this guy saying gas?

527
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,960
And so it had to get to a point

528
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,720
where I'm just doing a million takes and going,

529
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,440
okay, say ass.

530
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,240
Okay, now add a G, gas.

531
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,520
And it sounds so weird to me but it's like, got it.

532
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,120
It sounds normal.

533
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
It's like you feel like how props

534
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,560
don't look like props in movies.

535
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,280
I guess gas sounds bizarre

536
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
but it's gonna be perfect on screen, you'll see.

537
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
Yeah, and I ran into someone else who had been on

538
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,880
and they're like, oh they made me say cool-lada

539
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,160
a lot of different ways.

540
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,120
And I was like, well that's like a proprietary thing,

541
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,760
I guess, but I apparently say gasoline, very strange.

542
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,600
I guess I hear it.

543
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,280
Gasoline.

545
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,760
They made you say ass.

546
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,920
Say ass.

547
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,600
And then say gas.

548
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
Everyone else has been dismissed.

549
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
I am like in an empty room in a house

550
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,880
and they're just trying to get the line

551
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,040
so they can overlay it over the footage.

552
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,360
Oh geez, an idiot, wow, wow.

553
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,200
Well yeah, well Walt also stressed from film shoots

554
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
and the like.

555
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
Yeah.

556
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,440
He needs to take, his doctor suggests

557
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,520
that Mickey Mouse's father take up some form of exercise

558
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,080
to kick it over it to help relieve the stress.

559
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,720
So Walt tried a bunch of things

560
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
and this is a little montage I'd like to see

561
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,440
of wrestling, how is that gonna relieve stress?

562
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,800
How old is he at this point?

563
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,200
Yeah, it's a good question.

564
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Well I don't know, maybe still late 20s

565
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,360
but wrestling and boxing are not gonna,

566
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,640
well I guess people box as an event.

567
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,560
Then golf, but golf drove him crazy

568
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,360
in the way golf drives people crazy.

569
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
It's a precise sport.

570
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Right, does anyone amateur wrestle in their 20s for fun?

571
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,840
That's not something that happens anymore.

572
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,880
And that kind of, we know this wasn't fun wrestling.

573
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,720
This is like.

574
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,560
No, it was not.

575
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,760
It was not going to a wrestling carnival.

576
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,560
It was Greco-Roman probably.

577
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,920
But do people do that in their 20s every day?

578
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,360
Hey Bill, you wanna go wrestling?

579
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,920
Nobody does that anymore.

580
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,480
I feel like they were playing all sorts of sports

581
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,160
we think are old timey back then.

582
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,520
At the club, you'd go down to the club or the YMCA.

583
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,960
I'm sure you could hop in anything.

584
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,360
And the way that in college there's,

585
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,160
oh there's intramural leagues.

586
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,960
There's fun run kind of leagues.

587
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,800
Well that's different.

588
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,280
If you're in college, I'm just saying

589
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,440
once you get out of a setting like that,

590
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,520
when is the last time you would just for fun

591
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,880
in the way you would play a pickup game of basketball

592
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,240
or play tennis, you would go

593
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,600
and amateur wrestle with a friend.

594
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,160
Yeah, unclear.

595
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,000
It's a lot.

596
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,360
It's like a big commitment is what I'm saying.

597
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,320
Let's go like grunt and let me get my face

598
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,240
way up in your armpit.

599
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,080
Yeah.

600
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,920
Let's elbow each other a bunch.

601
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,800
That only happens at like a bachelor party

602
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,320
when somebody gets like out of control or something.

603
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,160
Where do you end up like amateur wrestling your friend?

604
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,840
That's for restraint.

605
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah.

606
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
You have to like put someone down essentially.

607
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,520
Yeah.

608
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,360
Get in the lift.

609
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,160
You're going back to the hotel.

610
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,000
Right.

611
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Going back to Caesar's.

612
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Right.

613
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,160
I mean, I guess we could start it up again.

614
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,080
I kind of liked amateur wrestling in high school.

615
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Sure.

616
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
Jason, were you all right in it?

617
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,880
I tried it in middle school when there would be like,

618
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,640
there was a round of like intramural,

619
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,040
like try out different sports.

620
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,840
And I just got hosed immediately.

621
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,320
I was always little.

622
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,000
Like everyone hit throw spurts.

623
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,880
And then I'm kind of like, you know.

624
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,360
Scott, you ever do it?

625
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,520
Probably in one set.

626
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
In gym?

627
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,200
Never again.

628
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,040
Never again.

629
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,680
There was, we had to take it in gym.

630
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,520
We had to do it.

631
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,360
No, you guys didn't have to do that?

632
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,720
I think they did like one or two class sessions

633
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,240
of like holds and stuff in gym.

634
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,840
But like, man, there was like one padded,

635
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,160
I think a wrestling practice room above the gym.

636
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,720
And a handful of times, my gym class got put in there

637
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,760
and they're like, all right, we're playing dodge ball.

638
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,600
And it's like, it was the size of this garage.

639
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,680
Those dodge balls hurt.

640
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,760
However you got hit with them.

641
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,160
Like, oh, it was just a bunch of 14 year old boys

642
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
just wanging at each other with.

643
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,000
Wanging.

644
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,840
Just wanging.

645
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,600
It's just, just wham.

646
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,440
Yeah.

647
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,800
The other detail about Walt's athletic pursuits

648
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,960
was that due to his, you know, awful childhood,

649
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,080
he was, he didn't play game.

650
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,480
Like he, it was said that he was not athletic

651
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,920
nor was he coordinated.

652
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,760
So.

653
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,720
His brother was worried about him

654
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,000
cause he said he was not physically gifted, I read.

655
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,440
Yes, but he did have.

656
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,680
But he was aggressive.

657
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,160
He did have what WWE would call ruthless aggression.

658
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,000
That's right.

659
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,920
This is so clearly a bad recipe.

660
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,880
This is meant to be stress relief.

661
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
Yeah.

662
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
But in like, he just, he has to,

663
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
but he has to make up for a lack of talent

664
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,160
by just like going at people, wanging them.

665
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,000
Wanging them.

666
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,200
He's going and wanging them.

667
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,760
And it seems like he started with horseback riding.

668
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,120
He got into the outdoors,

669
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,400
the outdoorsiness of horseback riding.

670
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,960
And then polo, it's just like,

671
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,880
he would say you're playing golf on a horse.

672
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,720
Like you said, Mike.

673
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,560
Yeah.

674
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
He was too, he was too early.

675
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,120
Cause I'm sure he would have loved mixed martial arts.

676
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,600
I'm sure he was kind of like UFC guy.

677
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,240
Walt would have been a UFC guy.

678
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,080
That's true.

679
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,600
That's the stress role.

680
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
That's how you get your aggression out now.

681
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,520
But he wasn't, you didn't have to bring a horse into it.

682
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,200
Okay. I take this, I guess there's not amateur wrestling,

683
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,520
but there are MMA gyms popping up and there's,

684
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,360
That's true.

685
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,320
They're not too far away.

686
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,160
So I guess that's kind of-

687
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,200
It seems more fun.

688
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,040
I would think.

689
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,860
Yeah.

690
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,080
So Walt would stroll in to the Sherman brothers

691
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,320
who were really composing something and be like,

692
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,960
well, I just choked a guy out with a triangle hold.

693
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,840
You just put your arm on the carotid artery

694
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,880
and went out like a light.

695
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,560
But we have to remember he hated carnivals.

696
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,520
Right. That's true.

697
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
He likely would not have been exposed to

698
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,800
what was called catch wrestling.

699
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,640
The early days of like wrestling.

700
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,760
Catch a catch can, yeah.

701
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,640
Yeah. With like carnies or like,

702
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,800
I'll wrestle whoever's in the crowd sort of,

703
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,240
and all of this, the outcomes predetermined,

704
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,080
you know, but it's like modern wrestling,

705
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,900
but a lot of holds, still a lot of very unpleasant,

706
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,960
like physical holds.

707
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,920
So like-

708
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,760
You're saying he,

709
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,320
he did probably go to carnivals though.

710
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,760
So he just may not have enjoyed it.

711
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,640
And you're saying he wouldn't have had an affection for-

712
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,480
He wouldn't have had an affection.

713
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,320
Classic professional wrestling, which was-

714
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,280
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,160
Yeah, hold based and also yeah,

716
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,480
big con to try to con the audience. Yeah.

717
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,200
So you don't see Walt in like a,

718
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,200
that kind of unitard that used to be the garb of-

719
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,800
Right. I see, yeah.

720
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,880
But if, yeah, I can imagine him though,

721
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,080
in modern MMA gloves and trunks

722
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,880
with like an endorsement on the side,

723
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,280
Gus Disney on the side.

724
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,640
Yeah, with one of those bottles

725
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,200
that has the metal sphere in it,

726
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,400
like the blender bottles,

727
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,960
like drinking a mix of protein shake and Denison's chili.

728
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Walt with his eye just swollen up and like bleeding.

729
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,800
Like, well, great match today.

730
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,520
Great match today, Will Rogers.

731
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,360
Somebody could-

732
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,920
Yeah, so he started source back writing

733
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,160
and then that leads into Polo,

734
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,720
where you can get this aggression out.

735
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,520
He started like bringing animators into this.

736
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
There were other people in the studio interested in it.

737
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,080
But as you said, Mike, there was the big social

738
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,960
and the networking component of it.

739
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,000
So he starts doing it, I think largely at Riviera,

740
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,520
which is the big fancy country club

741
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,760
that's in Pacific Palisades

742
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,800
that is primarily golf, some tennis,

743
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,080
and I guess had Polo at this time.

744
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,400
And yeah, Will Rogers is around.

745
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,480
I saw Jackie Gleason.

746
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,840
I saw Spencer Tracy.

747
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,600
That might be a modern Riviera club.

748
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,200
Cause I saw Riviera is where Paul Riviera,

749
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,400
I forget where the middle school or high school in LA,

750
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,520
like on the border of like WeHo Beverly Hills.

751
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,040
Oh, is that not the same Riviera?

752
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
I think, yeah, I think there were,

753
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,680
there might've, there's a Riviera now

754
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,400
and I think there was a Riviera then.

755
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,240
Gotcha.

756
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,440
Yeah, cause LA proper,

757
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,960
you just be filled with Polo fields.

758
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,800
Yeah, one of the main ones he practiced,

759
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,240
that was really near the studio,

760
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,720
which if you're in LA is where the Gelsons on Hyperion is.

761
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,880
And then you keep going Hyperion and Riverside,

762
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,600
which I think is now just Griffith,

763
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,080
like of some field or something.

764
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,080
But that was where he would go practice Polo with animators.

765
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,760
That's fun.

766
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,440
So that's where you would go, I guess, to see the stars,

767
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,720
really in the old days,

768
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,080
cause they all seem to be out there.

769
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,240
I see them like whacking each other,

770
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,080
whacking each other and then endangering horses.

771
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,240
That is such a crazy thing to do.

772
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,080
Like I just am putting myself in the mindset

773
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,640
of getting on a horse and then playing

774
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,880
where I have to like navigate the horse

775
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,520
on a field with seven other horses

776
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,240
while I'm hitting a ball.

777
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,360
I don't know how I ever get into the head space

778
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,200
to be able to do that.

779
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,840
Yeah, and also make sure you don't clobber Spencer Tracy.

780
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,200
Spencer Tracy, I read an avid Polo enthusiast.

781
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
The studios would beg him,

782
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,000
please stop playing this hyper-physical violent sport.

783
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,240
And so he would schedule games under aliases.

784
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,280
He had to lie to do his Polo thing?

785
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,240
The man had a lot going on as we've learned in the past.

786
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,360
Geez.

787
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Wait, what was his thing?

788
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,560
What Spencer Tracy's issue?

789
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,240
He showed up in that guy's biography.

790
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,640
Oh, oh, oh, full service.

791
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
He was gnawing.

792
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,840
Oh, he was gnawing.

793
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,680
Oh, okay, he was gnawing.

794
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
I forgot who the gnar was.

795
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,760
He was a gnar and a winger.

796
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,400
He was gnawing, but he was a devout Catholic

797
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,760
so he never divorced his wife.

798
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,320
So he was never technically married to Catherine Hepburn.

799
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,400
But yeah.

800
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,320
Also, yeah, like imagine you've had like a huge meat lunch.

801
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,960
You're drunk off your ass

802
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,280
and now you're getting on the horse.

803
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,960
Get on a horse with a weapon.

804
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,800
With a weapon.

805
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,360
With like a Looney Tunes weapon.

806
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,640
Yeah.

807
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,160
And this is what these guys are doing all the time.

808
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,400
Next to a mount,

809
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,520
because I'm sure the Equestrian neighborhood,

810
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,480
it was just part of Burbank with stables and horse trails.

811
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,840
Like, yeah, I'm sure that came into play.

812
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,000
And the Disney studio is right there.

813
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,040
Yeah, yeah.

814
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,920
Did anybody find Walt's horse's name?

815
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,760
Oh.

816
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,920
I found a list.

817
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,760
I don't think I did.

818
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,600
I received Dave Smith Disney archivist.

819
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,440
Oh, sure.

820
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,240
And Jason look alike apparently.

821
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Soon.

822
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,840
Playing him in a movie soon.

823
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,280
He has seven, just like the dwarves, there were seven.

824
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,920
Okay, let's go through them.

825
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,480
June, Slim, Nava, Aero,

826
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,680
Partner, Taki, and Tommy.

827
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,080
Anybody got a favorite?

828
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,920
Taki I guess.

829
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,760
Taki, yeah.

830
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,320
Partner's pretty good.

831
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,240
We love Taki.

832
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,320
Partner is second.

833
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,520
But like these aren't the best names in the world.

834
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,640
But also other places said he had a dozen horses.

835
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,480
Wow.

836
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,400
And those, so there might be five

837
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,120
whose names are lost at times.

838
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,840
His illegitimate horses?

839
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,880
Yeah, because he did go on to sell,

840
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,800
he sold everything eventually.

841
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,640
Right.

842
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,640
Yeah, do we know what age he stopped doing this?

843
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,520
I guess after the injury, is that immediately?

844
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,360
I guess.

845
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,200
Yeah, it would have to be then.

846
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,160
We're heading into the late 30s when it seems to happen.

847
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,960
Because that is what the article sort of implied,

848
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,360
but I wonder if he ever like snuck back up on there.

849
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,200
Maybe.

850
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,040
You never know, yeah.

851
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,520
He's got his girls again.

852
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,560
Let's get that girls, Tommy's boy, I think.

853
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,560
So where does this go?

854
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,040
Walt is pony crazy.

855
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,160
He's winging at Spencer Tracy and Jackie Gleason.

856
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,680
Seems like Robert Stack was around.

857
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
Yes, I saw that.

858
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,360
Oh, isn't that weird?

859
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,960
Not sure how, yeah, a host of unsolved mysteries.

860
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,240
I'm like, does that add up age-wise?

861
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,080
He would have been around.

862
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,120
He was old when it was on, when Unsolved Mysteries was on.

863
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,800
He's passed away a while ago at this point, I think.

864
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah, I think so.

865
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,280
But anyway, well, how do we get into this?

866
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,400
Well, he got Roy into it.

867
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,880
And Roy, out ahead of what happens,

868
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,600
is like, maybe you should not do this.

869
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,440
Yeah.

870
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,280
Maybe you should.

871
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,720
The common thing Roy would say to him about everything.

872
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,880
Sometimes that stood in the way of Walt Disney World.

873
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,000
But in other cases, yeah, maybe he was,

874
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,920
this feels very analog to motorcycles

875
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,160
and when you got a bad feeling about your friend

876
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,160
motorcycling and it's hardly confirmed.

877
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,080
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,800
But Walt really went all in,

879
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
in addition to buying the horse,

880
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,680
he had a practice cage at the studio.

881
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,040
He had a practice cage in his backyard.

882
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,160
Practice cage.

883
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,680
Like a cage with a fake wooden horse and a goal

884
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,400
that you would like sit on the fake wooden horse.

885
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,040
And eventually I read, his home one abandoned

886
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,880
and his children don't have much memories of his polo time.

887
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,680
They just know like, don't go near the polo cage,

888
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,400
the abandoned cage is filled with black spider.

889
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,760
That's the detail I saw.

890
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,000
Wow, wall cage.

891
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,400
We're gonna talk about Walt's cage is gonna be a thing too.

892
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,520
Yeah, Walt's cage.

893
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,280
I put toilet on the short list.

894
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,120
You're gonna collect all the info about the toilet.

895
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,840
If you've never lived in Southern California,

896
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,400
yeah, black widow spider is much more common

897
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,480
than you would think.

898
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,880
Like if you have a garage or a shed or something.

899
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
Watch out everyone.

900
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,960
Oh yeah, keep an eye out.

901
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,360
So Roy has sounded the alarm, there is potential trouble.

902
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,480
And then, stop me if you wanna tell us in a different way,

903
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,920
but here's where I found it.

904
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,680
Okay, here's the prime example of what scared Roy Disney.

905
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,120
Always pushing himself, Walt eventually wanted to play

906
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,440
with the better players, because these actors,

907
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,160
I think even among them, he's not the best.

908
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,080
But he's kind of, he was trying to match skill levels.

909
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,080
But then, but Walt, with his incredible gumption,

910
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,280
he wants to play with the best of the best.

911
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,920
And there was a South American team, the Argentines.

912
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,080
And Walt wanted to practice with the Argentines.

913
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,600
Actor Robert Stack, remember,

914
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,760
and I guess you gotta do it as like,

915
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,800
anytime the Argentines would come in,

916
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,280
they would bring their horses with them.

917
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,520
The reason they came, most of these great polo players

918
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,480
was to sell the horses and make a lot of money,

919
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,520
which they did.

920
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,960
You could see some of them red hots in our movie profession

921
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,440
and I think Walt was among them,

922
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,820
bidding these fantastic sums for these magnificent horses.

923
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,320
So the Argentines are, I mean, what does that mean?

924
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,120
They're trying to sell the horses,

925
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,440
they're hustling horses to these Hollywood guys

926
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,200
who are impressed with their skills.

927
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,760
But Walt can't play with the Argentines,

928
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,360
he's no Argentine, he's not good enough

929
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
to play against the Argentines.

930
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,000
That's what Roy told him.

931
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,840
Roy knew.

932
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,680
Roy knew.

933
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,360
Stay away from the Argentines.

934
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,160
Now I'm missing some info here.

935
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,360
Is the injury against the Argentines?

936
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,280
That's what I read.

937
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,100
Okay.

938
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,840
Yeah, that's what I read as well, Actor Riviero.

939
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
He played with them.

940
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,080
Or this is with them, but I'm not sure if it means against.

941
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,520
But a ball was struck by one of the players,

942
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,520
it smashed into Walt and knocked him from the mount.

943
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,320
And then, yeah, that's when he,

944
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,640
I guess it crushed his four cervical vertebrae.

945
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,560
Yes, God.

946
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,400
That's crazy.

947
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,280
So he was nailed by one of these guys.

948
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,320
This is like the beginning,

949
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,220
which always scared me,

950
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,000
the beginning of D2, The Mighty Ducks.

951
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,840
Oh yeah.

952
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,520
You relive Gordon Bombay's terrible injury,

953
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,680
because he goes pro and maybe can't make it

954
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,160
in the big leagues.

955
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,280
I was always terrified by this depiction

956
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,080
of Bombay getting beat up.

957
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,920
Yeah.

958
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,000
You could film this in the same way

959
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,880
with quick little glimpses between opening titles.

960
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,200
They should make this.

961
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,040
Yeah.

962
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,080
If this had been in-

963
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
Saving Mr. Banks.

964
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

965
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,120
I mean, they gotta do more with Hanks, right?

966
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,000
You gotta do more.

967
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,040
Well, at this point, this is young Walt.

968
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,080
I mean, I guess Hanks, we can de-age him with the technology,

969
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,800
so Chris Evans is doing it.

970
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
Chris Evans could do it.

971
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,360
All right, say Hanks, let a 68 year old, Tom Hanks,

972
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,600
get the de-aging that Sam Jackson, Captain Marvel,

973
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,520
tech or the, you know what?

974
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,880
Deep fake Walt Disney may be coming soon

975
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,760
because of what they've done.

976
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,440
Spoiler alert on Boba Fett with Mark Hamill.

977
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,120
Just deep fake, different actor,

978
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,360
and then an AI does the voice.

979
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,560
So we got the Walt voice.

980
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,920
Much more of this.

981
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,280
Let's do as much of this.

982
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,840
I think.

983
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,440
So Walt, yeah, let's do it.

984
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,960
It's so effective, it's so settling.

985
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
It's not, you see other things that are unsettling.

986
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,600
I'm settled by the Mark Hamill.

987
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,440
You know what?

988
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,720
I'll say this about the deep fake.

989
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,440
I, the technology with the face doesn't bother me so much,

990
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,000
but the voice is the thing that really is odd.

991
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,800
That they had to, they got a bunch of Mark Hamill clips

992
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,200
and created a database to make so that it is not him.

993
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,880
Yes, that's, because we were like, you know what?

994
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,200
This face is like much better

995
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,400
than when it was on the Mandalorian.

996
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,080
Like the face looks pretty good in a lot of the,

997
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,000
not every shot, but a lot of these shots.

998
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,080
But what's wrong with that voice?

999
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,920
Yeah.

1000
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,200
That's a computer talking.

1001
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,000
Well, I think, I mean, that was weird

1002
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,240
because Mark Hamill was still very much alive.

1003
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,320
But in Rogue One, I didn't mind it for Peter Cushing

1004
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,120
because he is long dead.

1005
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,960
But then for-

1006
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,280
So you won't mind it for Walt Disney when we have the movie.

1007
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,720
Well, I was gonna say proximity, I think is under,

1008
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,120
Carrie Fisher had just passed and then they were doing it.

1009
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,880
In Rogue One.

1010
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
And then that documentary about Anthony and Bourdain

1011
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,760
got in a lot of trouble because they had him-

1012
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Was he deep faked?

1013
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,120
They deep, they used AI to construct his voice

1014
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,040
to have him read some of the narration.

1015
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,880
Oh, I didn't know that.

1016
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,280
Like stuff he did not say.

1017
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,680
And then they had him read Squarespace ads

1018
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,040
for the promotional podcast.

1019
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,880
Oh no.

1020
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,720
And then-

1021
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,240
Are you having problems in your life?

1022
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,080
Wait a minute.

1023
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,280
And then he took baby Grogu to like a local taco stand.

1024
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,120
Yeah.

1025
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,560
Oh no.

1026
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,760
Well, Walt will be-

1027
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,000
Serve bantha meat here.

1028
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,760
Yeah, deep fake Walt movie about the polo injury,

1029
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,000
about maybe a big game, maybe a big polo game.

1030
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,960
That's sort of the-

1031
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,800
Yeah.

1032
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,620
That's the main-

1033
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,460
I wanna see this Argentine's in home.

1034
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,240
I wanna see in super slow-mo 300 level of detail,

1035
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,960
those vertebrae getting crushed.

1036
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,800
Yeah.

1037
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,640
And it'll-

1038
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,920
I'm trying to think, like the ball hit him.

1039
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,560
So it would have been hit from like farther away

1040
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,120
and like at enough speed.

1041
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,600
And it got some air time to like knock him.

1042
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,560
Like it hit him in the chest or the head or the-

1043
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,400
Yeah, I didn't see where it hit him.

1044
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,240
Fall off the horse?

1045
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,200
I think he falls out of the saddle.

1046
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,080
I think the, yeah, the injury happens from wherever he lands.

1047
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,320
I don't know if he landed on his head,

1048
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
if he landed on his back.

1049
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,200
I don't know that the ball did the damage

1050
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,720
and the ball just threw him.

1051
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,840
This is, what are we,

1052
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,160
the Christopher Reeve had his injury,

1053
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,360
his horrible injury,

1054
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,480
didn't even involve games in a movie.

1055
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Yeah, that's just falling off a horse.

1056
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,200
Boy, Walt is lucky it was not worse.

1057
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,040
The other thing I came across,

1058
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,800
and this was a kind of a weird like message board

1059
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,440
or like publicly updated Wiki of,

1060
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,520
did Walt Disney kill some guys in a bullet hole?

1061
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,040
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1062
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,880
Okay, nevermind.

1063
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,040
All right, if everyone else found it too.

1064
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,880
Well, no, no, no, no.

1065
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
That's exactly because I was wondering

1066
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,040
if that's where this should go.

1067
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Well, we still, yeah,

1068
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,760
we still talk about Hazel Jordan and stuff, but-

1069
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1070
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,200
Well, yeah, and we'll get to Hazel Jordan.

1071
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,520
We will pay off why the polo injury is important.

1072
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,320
But yes, this is what happened to me.

1073
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,440
I Google Walt's polo injury.

1074
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,440
I'm expecting to find some kind of mundane information.

1075
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,760
And then I find this question.

1076
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,200
Did Walt Disney accidentally kill someone

1077
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
during a game of polo?

1078
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,720
Oh my God.

1079
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,680
So this is what I was,

1080
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,720
cause I texted you guys.

1081
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,840
This is a little more interesting maybe than we thought.

1082
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,520
So all right, we've told you all that story.

1083
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,840
Walt hurt himself and he's laid up

1084
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,920
and he dreams up some stuff.

1085
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,840
We'll get to that.

1086
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,960
But yeah, this threw me off my horse.

1087
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,840
Walt, he might've killed somebody.

1088
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,160
What are you talking about?

1089
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,280
Did you keep pursuing this information?

1090
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,120
Yeah.

1091
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,560
Yeah, there's kind of an answer.

1092
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,400
Yeah.

1093
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,560
And then there's another bit of LA,

1094
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,200
notable LA landmarks come into play.

1095
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,040
Yes.

1096
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,400
Yeah, that's wild.

1097
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
Okay, okay.

1098
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,240
So why did this come,

1099
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,120
why is this question in the air?

1100
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,800
And this is almost the weirdest thing to me

1101
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,760
of why this has been asked is that this was on,

1102
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,920
this was in an edition,

1103
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,240
this was a card on Trivial Pursuit.

1104
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,560
Yes.

1105
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,880
Somebody posted this on their blog at some point

1106
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
and not just a Trivial Pursuit game,

1107
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,440
but a Disney produced Trivial Pursuit game.

1108
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,280
Yeah, that's right.

1109
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,120
From 1985, where they control it

1110
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,960
and only ask Disney affiliated questions.

1111
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,800
Yeah.

1112
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,960
And they put on a card,

1113
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,680
how many people died from injuries incurred

1114
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,600
playing polo with Walt Disney?

1115
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,240
Yes, that is wild.

1116
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,920
Like obviously that has been retconned from Walt's history

1117
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,720
at this point in the Disney company.

1118
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,760
100%, never ever have I come across this.

1119
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,360
I know, I've never seen this before.

1120
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
I think one of the websites I was looking,

1121
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,880
I can't remember what it was, one of the websites,

1122
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,520
it was like somebody remembered the card saying like,

1123
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,680
how many people did Walt Disney kill or something?

1124
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,520
Yeah.

1125
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,360
And they're like, well, that's not really-

1126
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,200
I thought it was way more severe.

1127
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,040
Yeah, yeah.

1128
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,880
That's not what the card said.

1129
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,400
No, he didn't kill, but he might've been in the games.

1130
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Yeah, he definitely was in the games.

1131
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,240
He was in this game.

1132
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1133
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,120
All right, and you guys all know the,

1134
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,160
let's play Trail Pursuit,

1135
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,400
do you know the answer to that question?

1136
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,760
How many people died from injuries incurred

1137
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,200
playing polo with Walt Disney?

1138
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,040
Was it two?

1139
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,880
Two?

1140
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,720
Two.

1141
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,560
I only have one of the names.

1142
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,080
Two people in, like, and that's just like,

1143
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,520
we don't know, like details are fuzzy there,

1144
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,000
but for sure he played two polo games where somebody died.

1145
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,320
If I was playing a game where someone died,

1146
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,720
I'm not gonna be playing the game anymore.

1147
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,280
Well, didn't also, if you know the timeline, tell me,

1148
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,320
but I think, okay, Roy is saying this game is dangerous,

1149
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,800
don't play it, then two people die in games with him,

1150
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,120
and then his injury happens, right?

1151
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Because he wouldn't have been able to play

1152
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,960
after the injury.

1153
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,800
He keeps going.

1154
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,640
These were two separate-

1155
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,440
He's still playing and asking for it

1156
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,840
after two people died.

1157
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,520
These were two separate games.

1158
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,080
Yes, yes, not the same.

1159
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,920
Yeah, yeah.

1160
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,720
So, right, and obviously there's plenty of stuff

1161
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,360
we all do that's like,

1162
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,320
oh, I really gotta stop drinking that diet soda, you know?

1163
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,720
Like, but still, if I was on the polo court

1164
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,040
and I'd be like, you know, hey, did you hear about,

1165
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,800
hear about Jerry?

1166
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,080
He died.

1167
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,760
I'd be like, oh, okay, maybe, maybe that's enough.

1168
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
Even your beloved tennis?

1169
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,240
You figured somebody died on that court?

1170
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,800
Yeah, that, well, yeah, if it was like,

1171
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,400
because of the normal rules of tennis, then yes,

1172
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,520
but like if, like, I don't know,

1173
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,160
like a bison stampede happened or something,

1174
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,000
then I go, well, that was a fluke, you know?

1175
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,480
Another condition was aggravated.

1176
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,200
Oh, the guy, he was a deep Omicron.

1177
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,040
Right.

1178
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,840
It had nothing to do with the balls and the racquets.

1179
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,480
I mean, you likely were scared

1180
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,200
if you watched Looney Tunes cartoons

1181
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,080
that there was the potential for like,

1182
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,320
the racket to be put over your head,

1183
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,240
and then you see the rib netting,

1184
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,760
and a big bump grows out,

1185
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,040
maybe some birds fly around the bump.

1186
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,520
You knew that was a possibility.

1187
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,360
I sure did.

1188
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,040
You could be stuck with those birds for a while.

1189
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,160
You might have to feed them.

1190
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,640
Yeah, I mean, my mom tried to scare me away

1191
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,880
from every sport other than tennis,

1192
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,520
because there was a contact element to most sports,

1193
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,280
and she made me afraid of all the balls

1194
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,760
until I started playing tennis.

1195
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,680
Mom made you afraid of all the balls.

1196
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,920
Yeah, she sat me down and she just pulled each ball out

1197
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,760
and was like, be afraid of this,

1198
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,600
be afraid of this, be afraid of this, and I was.

1199
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,520
Yes, mother.

1200
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,960
That's right.

1201
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,360
So, who are these deaths?

1202
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,760
Who died?

1203
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,760
October 1935, death number one, Gordon Westcott.

1204
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,400
Gordon Westcott, a fairly prominent actor.

1205
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,360
Yeah.

1206
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,840
Nothing, I haven't seen this person in anything,

1207
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,200
but he was a Warner Brothers contract player,

1208
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,040
was in dozens and dozens of movies.

1209
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,120
He was in movies with, opposite,

1210
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,320
Bette Davis and James Cagney.

1211
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,280
He was in a Bubs, Bubs, Bubsbee, Bubsbee,

1212
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,960
Bugsbee, Berklee, yeah.

1213
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,160
Berklee musical, pretty prominent,

1214
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,520
and this one, now this one is,

1215
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,520
this one literally was Walt's horse ran into his horse,

1216
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,200
he fell off the horse, and his own horse crushed him.

1217
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,040
Yes.

1218
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,360
And several days later, he passed away,

1219
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,520
but this was contact from Walt's horse,

1220
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,960
so this is the most one-to-one.

1221
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,800
Right.

1222
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Of the deaths.

1223
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
Could you say Walt caused it?

1224
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,360
I don't know, there's still, there's horses involved too.

1225
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,520
Yeah.

1226
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,960
But that's pretty crazy.

1227
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,000
We've been talking about this stuff forever,

1228
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,520
and fans of it way before the podcast.

1229
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,440
I was, what's that thing they say online?

1230
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,040
I was this many days old.

1231
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
Oh yeah.

1232
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,520
That.

1233
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,920
Walt's horse hit another guy's horse, and the guy died.

1234
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Yeah.

1235
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,600
Yeah.

1236
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
That's a little close to Walt Disney killing somebody.

1237
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,800
Pretty close, yeah.

1238
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,720
Yeah.

1239
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,640
Obviously, it's basically like, this is Thunderdome,

1240
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,280
so I guess you really can't.

1241
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,080
A detail I came across a couple times is that,

1242
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,320
especially in this era of Hollywood,

1243
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,800
where actors were doing a lot of squash-buckling characters

1244
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,640
and manly man characters,

1245
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,520
there was a streak among the talent in front

1246
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,760
and behind the camera of like, you know,

1247
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,040
stolen valor of adventure, of like,

1248
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,640
I'm a manly man like this,

1249
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,040
and Polo fits that bill,

1250
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,480
because it's very physically demanding,

1251
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,680
and involves riding a horse, you know, tactically.

1252
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,520
Adrenaline.

1253
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,880
Adrenaline in your manhood, kind of.

1254
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,720
Sure.

1255
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,800
In a real situation.

1256
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,320
But who could withstand this?

1257
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,240
This thing is, this is so dangerous.

1258
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,520
But that's, yeah, so that's wild,

1259
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,120
and there's like newspaper reports of this,

1260
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,400
of the funeral happening,

1261
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,920
and I do feel like the Walt involvement

1262
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
was kind of sidelined.

1263
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,600
It's indirect, but that's crazy.

1264
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,680
And then, less than a year later,

1265
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,960
May 1936 happens again,

1266
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,800
and Jason, it seems like you know

1267
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,120
the weird thing about this.

1268
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,280
Yeah.

1269
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,800
Winslow Felix is the guy's name,

1270
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
and this is not an actor,

1271
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,280
but rather a car dealership guy.

1272
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,720
Now, well, this one, it's not Walt's horse.

1273
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,560
This is just, he's partied among the horses.

1274
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,000
But imagine, you're like,

1275
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,400
you're only still a couple feet away.

1276
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,520
This happened to you earlier in the year.

1277
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,360
Yeah.

1278
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,200
And then again, wild.

1279
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,200
But Winslow Felix, I never knew any of this.

1280
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,760
Yeah, I didn't know this.

1281
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,760
That it is, okay, so it's the, off of the 110 freeway,

1282
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,120
by the Shrine Auditorium, by USC,

1283
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,040
still this big, very old school sign

1284
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,040
that is Felix auto dealership.

1285
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,760
I don't know what the rest of it is,

1286
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,440
but it's this big sign with Felix the Cat on it.

1287
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,280
Yes.

1288
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,480
And I never knew why Felix the Cat was on that sign.

1289
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,480
This I did know, and it was that he had given a car

1290
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,720
or sold a car to the Felix the Cat.

1291
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,840
Gave a car, I guess.

1292
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,200
Gave a car to the Felix the Cat.

1293
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,480
Pat Sullivan, Felix cartoon producer, Pat Sullivan.

1294
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,320
Yes, and then-

1295
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,000
Is he a creator or just a major figure?

1296
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,480
The article I'm reading here just says

1297
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,600
cartoon producer, but let's see who created Felix.

1298
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,800
Because I would like to be able to say it

1299
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,800
every other episode.

1300
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,960
So, and his name coincidentally Felix,

1301
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,520
and I guess the guy had the permission to endow this,

1302
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,560
and he's like, oh, you can use Felix the Cat

1303
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,440
on your Felix car dealership.

1304
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,280
Wow, wow.

1305
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,080
And it's just stood the test of time,

1306
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,280
earthquakes, like Felix the Cat is still,

1307
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,400
you can still drive by and see.

1308
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,320
You forget the, I don't know if people know

1309
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,720
that the angels A down in Anaheim,

1310
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,840
and that came down during the Earth.

1311
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,680
Really?

1312
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,480
Yeah, yeah, that was, I remember the morning of

1313
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,360
that being a, or whenever there was no power,

1314
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,200
we probably didn't find it out,

1315
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,240
but I remember my dad telling me the A came down,

1316
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,880
and that's just a pretty thin little structure,

1317
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,000
but they had to rebuild it.

1318
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,080
But yeah, that is weird, the Felix sign remained.

1319
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,320
Yeah, Pat Sullivan and Otto Messmer created Felix.

1320
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,840
So Pat Sullivan was a creator.

1321
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,680
Co-creator.

1322
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,520
Okay, Otto Messmer.

1323
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,800
Of Felix.

1324
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,520
Tougher to remember the two names,

1325
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,440
but you'll find a way.

1326
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,280
Messmer.

1327
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,640
Come out of memory.

1328
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,240
Messmer and Sullivan.

1329
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,280
The new King Features syndicate.

1330
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,560
Unless King Features buy Felix?

1331
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,400
They may have.

1332
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,520
Oh, DreamWorks Animation.

1333
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,120
So part of Comcast, NBCUniversal.

1334
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,760
Okay, so we'll get some weird Felix movie.

1335
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,920
They'll jam that.

1336
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,680
We'll either get a top of the line one,

1337
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,160
or they'll kick it to Woody Woodpecker status,

1338
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,120
and we'll get a weird.

1339
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,600
Oh yeah, well, there's like a weird

1340
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,240
top cat movies produced in other countries

1341
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,400
that have come out in the last five or six years.

1342
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,360
The second one is a prequel to the first movie,

1343
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,560
and these were mostly marketed in Mexico.

1344
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,400
Wow.

1345
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,680
They are CG.

1346
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,520
Yeah, like bad CG.

1347
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,960
Everybody's so, I look, I understand IP is big,

1348
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,720
but like, why is Top Cat have a leg up?

1349
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,040
I like Top Cat a lot.

1350
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,920
I'm a Top Cat fan, but I don't know why.

1351
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,800
At a certain point, I think you could probably

1352
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,600
sub in almost anything, and go like,

1353
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,160
do people really, is it really a draw?

1354
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,360
If it was a different cat with a different hat on it,

1355
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,400
would people even go, oh, that looks okay?

1356
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,240
Like, this is still.

1357
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,400
When you have a better shot making,

1358
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,280
taking the Doughboy's drawings

1359
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,400
that Chris Van Aertsdelen drew

1360
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,280
and turned that into an animated movie.

1361
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,120
Yeah, whatever.

1362
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,680
They're much more of a built-in audience than Top Cat.

1363
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,560
And they'll like farm it out to Mexico.

1364
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,920
Someone's grand, you know, they used to watch,

1365
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,680
when they were at the grand house,

1366
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,520
they'd watch. That is what they're counting on.

1367
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,200
You'd watch, get the rabbit ears going,

1368
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,080
and you'd watch Top Cat, and executive here.

1369
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,760
They remember that, and they're like, let's go, let's do it.

1370
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,120
But it's gonna be, but in the future,

1371
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,560
someone's grand will have grown up with Doughboy's.

1372
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,120
And oh yes, I remember. That's true.

1373
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,400
And they'd spar with each other.

1374
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,720
It was like a verbal polo match.

1375
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,240
Oh, I'd love if Doughboy's drawings came to whatever,

1376
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,320
to the meta, however content is consumed today.

1377
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,320
I would love a reboot of the Doughboy's.

1378
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,600
This is.

1379
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,920
Reboot proves that anyone can be a Doughboy.

1380
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,040
I don't think this is,

1381
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,920
Shao Hing Lee never came up on the show,

1382
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,800
but I wrote a one act play one time.

1383
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,640
Or, Andy Geo. How long ago?

1384
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,480
A few years ago. Oh, yeah.

1385
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,680
Well, Andy Geo used to co-produce,

1386
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,000
and Nick Mondernach was involved as well,

1387
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,840
a show that used to be theater,

1388
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,240
that was like one act plays.

1389
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,080
Right. And I wrote a one act play

1390
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,040
for me and Mike to do, as where we,

1391
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:22,360
it is two guys working at an uncle's hot dog stand

1392
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,920
at the Jersey Shore.

1393
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,200
Because they had been run out of town

1394
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,600
because they wrote a Top Cat movie that was so bad

1395
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,720
that they had to flee Los Angeles

1396
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,600
and work at a hot dog stand.

1397
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,080
It's one of the few things I made,

1398
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,440
never got put up.

1399
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,280
Let's go do it.

1400
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,120
This was never performed.

1401
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,960
Never performed.

1402
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,800
I didn't even know the details.

1403
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,480
The guy wrote this in 2016 or 2017

1404
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,240
when he was doing this. Well, let's go do it.

1405
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,840
I'll dig it out on the old laptop.

1406
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,160
Special Patreon tier.

1407
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah. Sure.

1408
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,320
Come see, that's a new level.

1409
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,840
High level. Come see Jason's one act.

1410
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,920
Well, yeah, I think, I don't know.

1411
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,440
I'd like to see that. Yeah, I mean, whatever.

1412
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,280
Turn it into a radio play.

1413
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
Is it just the two?

1414
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,760
Can I get a one line cameo?

1415
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,560
No, you could do the third character.

1416
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,880
You could do Uncle Johnny.

1417
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,760
It's called Uncle Johnny's Fancy Hot Dogs.

1418
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,000
Oh, it's my, oh yeah.

1419
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,920
Yeah. Oh boy, that's a high status character, eh?

1420
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,200
The owner of the stand.

1421
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,280
Yeah, he's a maniac.

1422
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,360
He's very mean.

1423
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,200
Oh, great.

1424
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,040
All right.

1425
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,360
Cool.

1426
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,320
Okay, well, this is an exciting step.

1427
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,960
Wow, boy, that ties a ton together.

1428
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,600
And if they, so put it up

1429
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,880
and then they'll make the movie based on the,

1430
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,280
it'll be kind of a meta deconstruction of Top Cat.

1431
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,000
The movie's that.

1432
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1433
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,960
Great. Yeah.

1434
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,520
Yeah, yeah.

1435
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,800
We all know Top Cat's many endeavors and qualities and all.

1436
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,640
Well, I do.

1437
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,720
I don't wanna, look, I don't wanna.

1438
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,120
Supporting chaos. My mom was a big Top Cat fan.

1439
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,240
I got her some Funko pops of Top Cat.

1440
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,440
What does Top Cat sound like?

1441
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,720
I can't do a good Top Cat.

1442
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,640
He's not like, he's a little Phil Silvers-ish.

1443
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,480
Okay.

1444
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,800
To reference, man, he's a dead friend.

1445
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,640
Yeah, dead man.

1446
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,480
Yeah.

1447
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,200
Sergeant Pilko.

1448
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,960
He's like, he's always like up to, he's always scheming.

1449
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,000
He's always like trying to, there's a cut, an idiot cop.

1450
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,480
He's always tricking.

1451
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,560
And then they're all just like thieves.

1452
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,960
They're all like, just like stealing and, and carousing.

1453
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,960
They're all like into ladies too.

1454
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,120
It's a, I don't know, it's kind of fun.

1455
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,280
All right.

1456
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,440
I'm not saying it needs to be have another 100 versions.

1457
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,000
I'm just saying there's some charm to the original.

1458
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,560
Okay, okay.

1459
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,160
And we're in worth the part of Winnock play at least.

1460
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,000
At least part of Winnock play.

1461
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,440
So anyway, so this, this is wild.

1462
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,440
Walt, in two scenarios, somebody died near Walt Disney

1463
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,680
while playing polo and then he still went off

1464
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,040
and got the injury.

1465
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,240
There's almost no literature about this,

1466
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,160
but the, the, the, the conspiracist might say,

1467
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,040
what if there is more, what if, I don't know.

1468
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,040
Maybe he, I don't know what, how you cheat in polo,

1469
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,280
but what if he did like pull the reins a little like,

1470
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,600
what if he gave old, what are their names?

1471
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,040
Tacky, what if he gave Tacky a little like,

1472
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,160
a little extra nibble and whispered an idea in his ear?

1473
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,040
Yeah, what I mean, what would happen is I'm sure

1474
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,880
playing polo, you are just like seconds away

1475
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,040
from falling off and really hurting yourself,

1476
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,080
which would get your adrenaline up in such a crazy level

1477
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:25,080
that you would start to probably feel like murderous thoughts

1478
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,800
toward other people who have almost hurt you really badly.

1479
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,720
So hey, it's possible.

1480
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,560
The horse is too.

1481
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,840
I know the Disney company's ability to, to,

1482
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,440
yeah, to retcon and to take Walt mythology

1483
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,840
when they want it, but bury other when they don't want it.

1484
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,080
Was there a, was there a famous Disney fixer?

1485
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,480
That's an interesting question.

1486
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,080
That's a, yeah, cause every studio kind of had.

1487
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,560
Especially in old days.

1488
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,400
Yeah.

1489
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,400
I mean, now they, now Jay Vick said, I don't need that.

1490
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,480
I'm just doing it myself.

1491
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,320
I'm the fixer.

1492
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,400
I'm the fixer.

1493
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,640
But yeah, that's interesting.

1494
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,640
Cause yeah, weird stuff would happen all the time.

1495
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,560
Like Scotty from the full service was kind of a fixer

1496
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,200
in addition to being a pimp essentially.

1497
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,520
In addition to being, I guess you would say

1498
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,000
he was a prostitute himself as well.

1499
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,800
Yeah. Did they have like an all purpose full service guy?

1500
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,520
Not even in the Scotty Bowers way.

1501
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,360
That's what I'm saying.

1502
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,560
But is there, was there a Mike from Breaking Bad

1503
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,200
at the Disney studios or an Irishman or a,

1504
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,800
yeah, there's got to, there would have to have been somebody.

1505
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
I heard you paint Mickey's house.

1506
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,840
I heard you use the den.

1507
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,840
I heard you use it then.

1508
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,680
I don't know.

1509
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,520
I don't know.

1510
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,520
And yeah, maybe we don't know his name.

1511
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,080
We don't know who it is being that,

1512
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,320
or it was like one of these,

1513
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,080
that's how Keenan Wynn got involved.

1514
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,920
Oh yeah.

1515
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,520
Rough character actors, Walt,

1516
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,360
he was around for that first and then like,

1517
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,200
oh, you know what, you pop on camera too.

1518
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,680
What'd you do this week, Walt?

1519
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,600
Who'd you kill?

1520
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,720
Ah boy.

1521
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,440
You know, the fifth polo injury.

1522
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,600
I could keep three out of the press,

1523
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,280
but these two are going to leak.

1524
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,240
There are other, like there's,

1525
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,480
there's other guys, like there was,

1526
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,440
like Sped Red, was it Harry Turtle?

1527
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,840
Or did you come across that name?

1528
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,680
Maybe, I don't know.

1529
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,280
There was a guy who ended up being like,

1530
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,520
in the long run was a producer,

1531
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,960
but like early on.

1532
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,480
That he was playing with you mean?

1533
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,480
Well, like a guy, he was a polo player when he was younger

1534
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,360
and then the depression hit

1535
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,480
and there was like a drop off of polo

1536
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,720
before it got popular again.

1537
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,400
But it was like a guy who like ended up at a dinner

1538
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,440
and then he got hired by Disney,

1539
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,360
but he was such an avid polo player.

1540
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,040
He like climbed the ranks

1541
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,440
and he was in charge of the Donald Duck team.

1542
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,320
Walt capped in the Mickey Mouse team.

1543
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,160
Oh, they named the teams.

1544
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,000
He capped, that's right.

1545
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,160
And they would like, they played in like Mexico City

1546
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,760
and they went to Arizona

1547
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,000
and they said they were often underestimated

1548
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,080
because they had Donald Duck

1549
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,280
in the center of their uniforms.

1550
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,840
Everyone thought they were,

1551
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,280
they were like losers.

1552
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,120
Who are like, they wouldn't be very good.

1553
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,480
Scrappy, mad, not classic champions like Mickey.

1554
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,840
Yeah, so he would go on to oversee

1555
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,040
the like Disney nature movies.

1556
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,560
Wow, so people rose up the ranks in Disney via polo.

1557
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,600
Through the boys club,

1558
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,360
through like the sauna and the polo teams

1559
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,960
and like, yeah, all of the stuff you hear about.

1560
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,080
This is what I keep telling Zach Reno

1561
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,080
that we need to do with tennis.

1562
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,800
We need to start playing in places

1563
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,480
where like the wealthiest Hollywood elites are playing.

1564
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,040
And we'll beat them at tennis and then they'll like us.

1565
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,840
And then they'll let us be in movies.

1566
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,880
But I don't know, I don't know if that exists.

1567
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,720
I don't know.

1568
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,640
I mean, I'm sure it exists.

1569
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,480
I don't know.

1570
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,480
Well, you beat them twice and on the third game,

1571
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,520
you throw it.

1572
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,080
So they think you, they like conquered.

1573
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,360
But do you think they'll still respect me?

1574
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,520
No, you just have to play so,

1575
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,920
you have to sell it so much.

1576
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,160
You're saying I have to take them up to the brink of losing

1577
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,920
and then they still get to win.

1578
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,680
So then they still feel good.

1579
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,600
Yeah, you hustle though.

1580
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,840
They feel good about me enough to say

1581
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,640
that I'll be in the new Top Cat.

1582
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,480
Yeah.

1583
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,720
You are mocap Top Cat.

1584
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,480
That I get to get the golf balls

1585
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,720
or the ping pong balls on me to motion capture.

1586
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,680
You know, Gad seemed hot and cold on the roll anyway.

1587
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,080
He probably wasn't gonna do it,

1588
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,920
but you seem like a good sport.

1589
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,840
You know, you seem like a reliable one.

1590
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Can you do a Phil Silver's voice off the top of your head?

1591
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,680
You know who he is.

1592
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,160
These are all fat cat types.

1593
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,000
These are all, I'm imagining the heads of the studios

1594
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,680
are still like Louis B. Mayer and Daryl Zanuck

1595
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,200
who also played polo with Walt.

1596
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,040
Oh, geez. I read.

1597
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,860
Wow.

1598
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,700
Daryl Zanuck.

1599
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,640
I think Hal Roach was out there.

1600
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,080
I saw that name as well.

1601
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,120
Well, here's what I, here's one other odd little thing.

1602
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,120
Like in that you can't find a lot of people talking

1603
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,840
about the possibility that Walt killed somebody

1604
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,280
while playing polo.

1605
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,720
But oddly, one of the only people,

1606
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,280
I found a big Twitter thread where talking about this issue

1607
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,160
was Connor Ratliff from George Lucas talk show

1608
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,560
and the Dead Eyes podcast, which as we record this,

1609
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,800
he just put out this episode where he has Tom Hanks on

1610
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,640
the center of the whole narrative he's been weaving.

1611
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,000
But he did a mega thread about all of this

1612
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,880
and about how it all really relates to the classic

1613
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,520
Walt's cartoon that hasn't come up yet, Mickey's Polo Team,

1614
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,960
which was a big, a big short where that involved

1615
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Disney characters, but also Hollywood celebrities

1616
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,480
like riding on horses and some of the Marx brothers.

1617
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,320
Yeah.

1618
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,160
Yeah.

1619
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,000
The Harpo.

1620
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,040
The Charlie Temples in the crowd with the three little pigs.

1621
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,320
This was like the original Space Jam 2.

1622
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,440
Yeah, you're right.

1623
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,000
Where even the crowd has celebrities in it.

1624
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,840
Right.

1625
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,680
You're right.

1626
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,500
Yes, yes, yes.

1627
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,240
And which they, which he pointed out also is weirdly

1628
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,520
with polo having all this stress for Walt,

1629
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,080
that that short was the subject of a lawsuit

1630
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,160
because somebody else claimed that they had the idea

1631
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,160
of a short where polo, where the horses ride the people.

1632
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,840
Somebody else had that idea, took Walt to court.

1633
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,520
The case was dismissed.

1634
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,440
So the thing that Walt is trying to do as a stress relief

1635
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,480
is nothing but, it only adds more stress.

1636
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,920
It brings him in, he gets sued because of the cartoon.

1637
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,960
He gets hurt and there's this accident,

1638
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,360
people die in front of him.

1639
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,200
The other thing that Connor found that he posted

1640
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,280
and you solved this mystery, Mike, is why this thing was

1641
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,960
called this internal Riviera Country Club magazine

1642
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,280
was called the Riviera Chucker.

1643
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,800
So that was the phrase that I guess is what you do

1644
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,640
in the game.

1645
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,720
It's called like a period or a quarter.

1646
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,120
Oh, that's what, oh yeah.

1647
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,960
Yeah.

1648
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,780
So.

1649
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,240
But that might actually be a different term also.

1650
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,640
I think that's the same, right?

1651
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,480
It would have to be.

1652
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,320
It could be a play on that term.

1653
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,160
What is Chucker?

1654
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,960
Chucker, Chucker looks like it was spelled C-H-E-U-K-K-A-A,

1655
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,800
A or A-H.

1656
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,640
This is two K's, I feel it has to be.

1657
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,960
Well, is that what a player is called then?

1658
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,800
Well, that's what I'm saying, yeah.

1659
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,840
Maybe it's like what that's maybe what a player is called

1660
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,920
and this is what like the period's called.

1661
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,240
But this is a big article from 1935 about him being

1662
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,840
into polo and the points.

1663
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,400
How he, oh my God.

1664
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,240
Over the course of doing this, and this is before

1665
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,280
the injury, four black eyes, seven stitches,

1666
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,720
four chipped fingers.

1667
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,560
My gosh.

1668
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,720
With pains and aches.

1669
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,560
And it talks about how when he started playing,

1670
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,440
one day he appeared at the office with a black eye

1671
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,120
and he walked past his secretary who said, good morning.

1672
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,680
And he said, yes, it is a good morning.

1673
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,280
As if to say, is there something wrong?

1674
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,720
Was there any reason on my face

1675
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,080
it wouldn't be a good morning?

1676
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,480
What are you implying?

1677
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,680
You bring it up.

1678
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,360
You bring it up.

1679
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,880
So it is like he was UFC guy.

1680
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,080
It was like he was, he just got a UFC fight.

1681
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,680
That's how bad the injuries were.

1682
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,960
Did we all come across a celebrity cut from,

1683
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,080
well, Mickey's Polo team.

1684
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,080
Oh yes, this is crazy.

1685
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,560
This is also, there's so many crazy parts of this

1686
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,760
cause we mentioned Will Rogers.

1687
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,080
Will Rogers you can see in the American Adventure.

1688
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,600
Who's in the bottom of this very, of the Chucker magazine.

1689
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,360
One of Will's last visits to Riviera.

1690
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,120
Here he is talking to Hal Roach, little rascals producer.

1691
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,160
An avid polo player, huge star, humorist, actor,

1692
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,280
fake cowboy, real cowboy?

1693
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,000
Political satire, the original Bill Maher you might say.

1694
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,840
We should all say as much as possible.

1695
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:33,840
Huge, huge star and was an avid polo player

1696
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,520
and died in a plane crash.

1697
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,160
So was excised from-

1698
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,480
Supposed to be one of the silly,

1699
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,600
oh there's a horse that looks like Will Rogers.

1700
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,680
But then he died and they had to cut it.

1701
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,120
Crazy.

1702
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,320
Was in talks with Walt to be the star

1703
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,320
of his first feature length film.

1704
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,320
His first feature length.

1705
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,360
Snow White hasn't happened yet when all this happens?

1706
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,440
This was almost a project he was going to do.

1707
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,040
Where Will Rogers is Rip Van Winkle interacting

1708
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,000
with animated characters.

1709
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,720
Much like the upsetting Alice in Wonderland shorts.

1710
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,320
You just said that the other day.

1711
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,000
I never thought about those being scary.

1712
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,840
But I guess you're right.

1713
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,120
Those are pretty unique.

1714
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,160
They're a little under like the,

1715
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,240
in the way that the voyage to the moon,

1716
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,760
that early-

1717
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,960
Oh yeah, that face.

1718
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,120
The Malay movie.

1719
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,760
The moon face is certainly an aesthetic.

1720
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,280
Much more pleasing aesthetic.

1721
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,560
But in probably like,

1722
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,920
both of these things probably technologically

1723
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,400
advanced for their time.

1724
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,880
So ambitious, incredibly ambitious.

1725
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,480
So Walt almost made this Rip Van Winkle

1726
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,000
with Will Rogers but then he had to go and die.

1727
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So this was almost his first feature length,

1728
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,080
Walt Disney movie.

1729
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,200
Which could have changed everything.

1730
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,360
It could have changed everything.

1731
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,800
This polo-feel deal that's not good.

1732
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,840
That's gonna lead to this creepy out of date

1733
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,120
Rip Van Winkle movie that nobody's gonna like today.

1734
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,440
Could have been a huge hit.

1735
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,560
Could have been a huge hit.

1736
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,680
Could have led to the bankruptcy

1737
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,040
that Roy was always like worried about.

1738
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,360
Like not every Dwayne Johnson movie's a home run.

1739
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,720
Like not every, you know, sometimes you make a rampage.

1740
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,400
They're creative they are.

1741
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,720
But like, oh yeah, creatively.

1742
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,880
They're all masterpieces.

1743
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,880
I mean, sometimes you make a rampage.

1744
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,320
Sometimes you make a Southland Tales, you know.

1745
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,600
Which one's which?

1746
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,320
Yeah, I think if I had to choose one to watch,

1747
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,160
I'd go Southland.

1748
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,520
I know, I think that what I'm saying is like,

1749
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,800
they didn't make a lot of money.

1750
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,720
They are both seeded.

1751
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,400
Well Southland is why the Rock won't take risks anymore.

1752
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,760
Cause he took one and he fell on his knees.

1753
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,080
But a cult, kind of a cult following now, Southland Tales.

1754
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,120
But like what's his biggest, biggest hit?

1755
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,800
Red Notice.

1756
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,640
Wow.

1757
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,240
The biggest film ever made.

1758
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,080
Right. Yes.

1759
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:53,920
Yeah.

1760
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,240
No film has ever been viewed more than,

1761
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,120
other than Don't Look Up like four days later.

1762
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:58,960
Yeah, yeah.

1763
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,400
All the biggest movies of all time came out in December.

1764
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,240
Right.

1765
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,080
Last year on Netflix.

1766
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,040
Right.

1767
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,360
All five of the top movies.

1768
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,280
To Throne Snow White.

1769
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,920
But there's a few paths.

1770
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,320
There's a few paths that never came to be.

1771
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,800
And it's one where Rip Van Winkle is made.

1772
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,960
It's a massive hit.

1773
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,080
It leads to the funding they need to build the Burbank lot

1774
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,320
and all those other endeavors.

1775
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,000
And there's one where it's a massive failure

1776
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,200
and Disney is like washed up.

1777
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,120
This is all over.

1778
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:29,960
And then he's just,

1779
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,440
he's nursing his polo injury with nobody to help him.

1780
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,240
He has no money, no idea,

1781
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,760
no way to get his ideas off the ground.

1782
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,120
Just prowling on like a crazy guy.

1783
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,480
Or yeah, it's like the Orson Welles band

1784
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,000
where it's like makes really interesting work.

1785
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,320
Never has a big hit again.

1786
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,880
Never has a big,

1787
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,760
he's never given Citizen Kane money and freedom again.

1788
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,520
Polo is at the center of all of it.

1789
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,240
If not for the polo.

1790
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,800
So maybe it's time to get to the flip side of it,

1791
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,640
which is that he has to,

1792
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,360
he's forced to stop playing polo

1793
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,440
because of his own injury and witnessing several deaths.

1794
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,280
That had nothing to do with it.

1795
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,120
That had nothing to do with it.

1796
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:09,960
I don't think so.

1797
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,800
Yeah, no, that had nothing to do with it.

1798
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,080
Maybe people just died around you more often.

1799
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,920
That was the olden days.

1800
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,760
Oh, geez.

1801
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,600
It was the olden days.

1802
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,480
Yeah, Penicillin still has the new tag on it.

1803
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,600
But no, so it's not immediate, right?

1804
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,840
He does quit polo,

1805
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,440
but it's not as if he then says,

1806
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,360
what else should I do?

1807
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,840
Maybe I should do Disneyland.

1808
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,720
It's not until the late 40s

1809
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,240
that the injury is getting bad

1810
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,920
and the stress is getting bad again.

1811
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,120
So they hire,

1812
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,760
there's a nurse at the studio

1813
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,160
who becomes Walt's personal nurse as well.

1814
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,680
And that is Hazel George.

1815
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,560
And she begins enacting the five o'clock special,

1816
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,120
a small side room off of Walt's office

1817
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,880
where she would massage him to treat this old polo injury.

1818
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,920
And he would imbibe on a scotch

1819
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,960
while unloading his burdens on Hazel.

1820
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,440
One other weird thing about all this is that,

1821
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,800
you find this, that the side room,

1822
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,120
there's the offices where I work,

1823
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,960
but when it's five o'clock special time

1824
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,720
and I need to go take a load off,

1825
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,080
drink a scotch, get massaged,

1826
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,080
what does he call that place?

1827
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,120
He calls it his laughing place.

1828
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,520
Which just came up in Cotino

1829
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,280
that he called, it was that he called the ranch his laughing,

1830
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,760
he called Palm Springs his laughing place.

1831
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,680
But he also called this little room his laughing place.

1832
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,920
So Walt's using this term.

1833
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,840
I mean, I guess it makes sense to like an old guy

1834
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,640
had like a bad, tired joke.

1835
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,720
And then he just would say it about every,

1836
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,920
maybe when he went to the bathroom and there's like one stall,

1837
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,760
he goes, there's my laughing place.

1838
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,400
And like you're supposed to laugh if you were around him.

1839
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,840
I removed the name Walt Disney from this story.

1840
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,920
A major studio head in the thirties had a private nurse

1841
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,800
who would give him massages and scotch at five o'clock.

1842
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,240
That's like, we're describing an affair.

1843
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,640
Like this is a mystery.

1844
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,200
Maybe, well, yes.

1845
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,240
Maybe, like potentially.

1846
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,080
We've talked a lot about water.

1847
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,960
We were talking about Clarabelle Cowell.

1848
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,280
Having an affair with Clarabelle.

1849
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,360
We've talked about Walt having.

1850
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,680
We know he fathered Rue.

1851
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,160
We established this.

1852
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,320
And an affair with Kanga.

1853
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,240
But yeah, no, this, yeah.

1854
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,360
Well, I mean, like hypothetically,

1855
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,280
I'm interested in the world where that happened

1856
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,440
because it's interesting in the way I'm,

1857
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,760
I wonder if he specifically did all the horse ramming.

1858
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,960
But in looking into Hazel specifically,

1859
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,280
I didn't see any proof of that,

1860
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,640
but maybe they kept the proof in the laughing place.

1861
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,160
No, I'm not saying that's real.

1862
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,760
Did I do a couple of Googles for it?

1863
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,160
Yeah, I did to take a look.

1864
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,360
Cause obviously, yeah, secret room with the female nurse

1865
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,640
where you have a drink every afternoon at your job.

1866
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,320
I'm just asking questions.

1867
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,160
I hear you.

1868
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,080
It does sound suspicious.

1869
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,280
It does sound very suspicious.

1870
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,200
I mean, there's so much weird suspicious stuff.

1871
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,520
Like he was in chronic pain for all of his life.

1872
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,160
You know, you would hear him about being very irate

1873
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,160
sometimes or very short with people.

1874
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,040
And it's like, well, yeah, when you're in chronic pain,

1875
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,240
you're often very irate.

1876
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,960
But like the detail that like he went to a chiropractor

1877
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,040
instead of a doctor, if he had gone to a doctor

1878
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:18,600
and they put him in a cast, it might've just healed up.

1879
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,440
Instead he hurt his life.

1880
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,800
Instead of growing massive calcium deposits.

1881
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,800
Geez, which doesn't help kill him,

1882
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,120
but it doesn't, I don't know.

1883
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,120
It's not good either.

1884
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,800
And if you're dealing with chronic pain and lung cancer

1885
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,880
from smoking a pack an hour, like, you know.

1886
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,400
Yeah, he seems, the health seems so much more poor

1887
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,400
than I thought.

1888
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,080
Here's one thing I'll say about Hazel George.

1889
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,920
This is no slouch Hazel George,

1890
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,720
because she was also a songwriter.

1891
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,320
A like, credited under a pseudonym,

1892
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,840
it credited as Gil.

1893
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,720
And I wonder, is that some weird work around

1894
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,520
to like make it sound like a man's name

1895
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,320
to people not trust a female songwriter?

1896
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,200
If so, that's insane at this time.

1897
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,080
Be surprising.

1898
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,080
But she wrote songs for the Mickey Mouse Club

1899
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,480
and Old Yeller and Zorro and all this stuff.

1900
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,480
Why wasn't she rich?

1901
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,240
Why does she have to be this old man's nurse?

1902
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,080
I don't know.

1903
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,360
Maybe because, was it because of like,

1904
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,320
when you're on the property at that time,

1905
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,880
you're just like in the way that he says,

1906
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,040
you the background painter also go figure out

1907
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,400
how to make a pirate ship fly.

1908
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,240
You know what I mean?

1909
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,440
Like, is it just, it's an all in

1910
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,600
when you're at the Disney lot.

1911
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,880
I work for hire.

1912
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,320
Like, yeah, Steve, Steve Dicco co-created Spider-Man,

1913
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,880
but it's just like, we paid you, you created that.

1914
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,080
And like, eventually decades later,

1915
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,920
the estates make some money,

1916
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,680
but like he should have lived at the top

1917
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,000
of the Empire State Building,

1918
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
instead he just lived at a regular apartment

1919
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,360
in New York City for much of his life, you know?

1920
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,760
Yeah, but even with songs,

1921
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,040
like they would somewhat take care of songwriter money.

1922
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,080
I don't know when the Sherman,

1923
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,160
like Sherman Brothers eventually I think got paid very well

1924
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,560
for all the stuff they did.

1925
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,440
But if there was a way to be screwed,

1926
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,280
cause everybody was screwed.

1927
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,120
But everybody they were trying to screw, so.

1928
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:56,960
Yeah, it's a good question.

1929
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,520
As someone who just listened to a two and a half hour

1930
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,000
interview with Mike Love,

1931
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,960
who dictated every single little lyric or half lyric

1932
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,400
he wrote that he wasn't credited for on the Beach Boys songs.

1933
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,200
I listen to it longer than our podcast.

1934
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,160
It was the poorest quality I've ever heard.

1935
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,960
There's a piano tinkling in the background.

1936
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,480
People are coughing the whole time.

1937
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,440
You hear a vacuum towards the end of it.

1938
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,240
I think they turned the lights out of this room,

1939
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,520
wherever he was and he's still going on.

1940
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,640
And then I thought of bub, bub, bub, and you see.

1941
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,800
Like no, the interviewer left, Mike.

1942
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,400
You were just talking about this a couple of days ago

1943
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,320
and I think you need to do some sort of audio

1944
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,400
to talk about this.

1945
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,880
I can, I'll try to pair this.

1946
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,520
It was fascinating.

1947
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,280
No one else should have to endure the two and a half hours as I did,

1948
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,600
but I can get it down to a tight hour 20.

1949
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,080
There's there.

1950
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,680
There are little tricks, you know, to to screw people out of them.

1951
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,600
I remember it.

1952
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,440
Lou and inside Lou and Davis, when they do the novelty song

1953
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,600
and the producer asked them, it's like, what was it?

1954
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,240
Do you want the session fee or do you want like those residuals

1955
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,120
or the right or something?

1956
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
He's like, you kidding?

1957
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,440
The song's trash.

1958
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,720
Give me the session fee.

1959
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,160
And then it is a massive hit.

1960
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,720
Yeah, I just learned that

1961
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:17,440
Michael McDonald's fee for the sample of I Keep Forgetting on Warren G's Regulate.

1962
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,760
He just got a lump sum of ten thousand dollars.

1963
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,000
Little a little awareness that that would become one of the staples

1964
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,360
of West Coast G Funk, and he could have stood to make so much more.

1965
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,440
But it was a one time.

1966
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,200
That's that's a pretty small.

1967
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,520
There's a yeah, there's a collection of that.

1968
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,840
Those stories isn't it?

1969
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,040
I could call completely, completely wrong.

1970
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,840
Didn't Marlon Brando take up front on the Godfather?

1971
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,600
I think he was like desperate for money and he took like just a lump sum.

1972
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,120
I could be totally wrong about this.

1973
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,600
It's some movie like this where he took like a lump sum

1974
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,880
and then lost out on millions of dollars.

1975
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,040
Oh, something like that.

1976
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:55,760
Oh, no. So he doesn't get money when the from like poorly made t-shirts at the mall

1977
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,160
where it's like where it's dunkle around with Scarface

1978
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,520
and would have made tons of money on that.

1979
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,560
But anyway, I think Hazel sounds cool.

1980
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,360
That's maybe some of my like I think Hazel sounds cool.

1981
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,920
And like she would like, you know, give it to him a little bit

1982
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,520
in terms of like verbal sparring, like they'd have a little, you know,

1983
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,880
she was like one of the only people who could, you know,

1984
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,040
like kind of just show Jester talks truth to the king.

1985
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,960
Kind of. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

1986
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,400
There was even some exchange like that where he Walt described himself as one of the

1987
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,000
what is the phrase?

1988
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,760
One of the last benevolent monarchs.

1989
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,600
He just said that out loud to her.

1990
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,360
And then she said, well, I'm going to last great court gestures.

1991
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,400
That's how that's the type.

1992
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,760
That's how funny stories were right back in the old days.

1993
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,600
I'm giving it. I'm reading it on a curve.

1994
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,400
She seems great.

1995
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,280
Like she seems like a fascinating character in her own right.

1996
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,720
It's just so funny the way the company frames these like mythmaking

1997
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,120
sometimes where it's like, do you know what that sounds like?

1998
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,720
That sounds a little strange.

1999
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,160
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. A bit.

2000
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,560
She becomes an important figure in a number of ways.

2001
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,520
And they will build the biggest one.

2002
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:18,320
But like she so, you know, she she she gives him advice, events to her.

2003
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,840
And apparently, OK, so down the road on the path

2004
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,000
but to his death and by the she's advising on his health and saying,

2005
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,960
maybe you shouldn't eat.

2006
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,200
I was looking at a book where that describes his diet,

2007
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,000
which we're talking about following the Walt diet, which is full and more

2008
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,120
fully fleshed out in this book.

2009
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,040
I saw. Oh, good.

2010
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,520
Chilli and beans, hamburgers, potatoes and pie.

2011
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,560
Yeah. So he got 210 pounds at some point off of all this.

2012
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,200
There's another list that makes sure to include puddings and jellos,

2013
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,880
although I think low fat, low fat gelatin.

2014
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,600
You know, you got to watch that or low fat pudding.

2015
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,360
You know, even though he's he's concerned about health in other ways.

2016
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,360
I found this bizarre wall quote.

2017
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,280
He said this out loud.

2018
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:04,480
Smoking and drinking are sins because you are one of God's creatures.

2019
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,520
And if you don't take care of the body he gave you, you are committing a sin.

2020
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,720
And he said that out loud, but never stop smoking.

2021
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,160
He knew that's his way of saying, I know, I know God hates me.

2022
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:15,920
But what are you going to do?

2023
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:22,560
That is a very strange quote, because like he is that the Disney brand is wholesome.

2024
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,920
Yeah. And the Walt Disney story is wholesome and pure and American,

2025
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,760
not often openly religious outside of like like Christmas Carol level religious.

2026
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,640
Like one or two mentions of God.

2027
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Yeah.

2028
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,600
Religion does not come up a ton, but it came up in this bizarre way of like how you

2029
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,360
you're you sin if you smoke and drink two things that I do a ton.

2030
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,080
You're right. And I'm not going to stop doing it.

2031
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,160
Any right. Very strange.

2032
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,480
Anyway, Hazel apparently is the person who told Walt about cryonics.

2033
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,960
So here's another bizarre part of the story in the legend.

2034
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,840
The idea that Walt might have frozen himself and he for sure was interested in it.

2035
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,760
He looked into it.

2036
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:05,480
You know, we believe that he did not freeze himself, but his interest

2037
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,840
in the entire area came from Hazel.

2038
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,320
But then the biggest thing was getting him into model trains.

2039
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,040
But specifically, the thing that she said to do was

2040
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,480
there is this big Chicago Railroad Fair coming up

2041
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,400
and you should go and take take an animator or something.

2042
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,200
And he went with Ward Kimball, one of the one of the nine old men,

2043
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,120
one of the great classic Disney animation figures.

2044
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,880
Do you guys find any of this, the Chicago Railroad Fair?

2045
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,480
I actually don't have much detail on that.

2046
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,680
I saw this story where he came home one day and put a chunk of metal

2047
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,240
on the kitchen table and was like, that's a piston. Whoa.

2048
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,560
Like that was a memory the family had.

2049
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,960
Anyway, she knew about this. You should go.

2050
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,920
This is a huge deal.

2051
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,280
This is a World's Fair of railroad stuff.

2052
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,280
And he loves trade.

2053
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,000
But apparently the interest in trains was not really before that.

2054
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,160
It came from going to this.

2055
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,760
He came back starry eyed, reminded him of his youth.

2056
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,960
And what does this thing have?

2057
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,440
It sounds boring when you hear about it.

2058
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,640
What does Walt just go look at a bunch of old trains?

2059
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,240
But it was this whole like a World's Fair.

2060
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,160
There was all this other stuff going on.

2061
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,760
There were a bunch of turn of the century vehicles running around.

2062
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,120
And there were fireworks.

2063
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,800
And there was a miniature New Orleans.

2064
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,640
There were themed environments at this event.

2065
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,280
There were little robots.

2066
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,440
There was a robot of Paul Bunyan.

2067
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,000
There was an Indian village.

2068
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,960
There were all of these things that eventually get put into Disneyland.

2069
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,760
He comes back from this thing.

2070
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,760
August 1948, days after he comes back from the railroad fair,

2071
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,880
he sends a memo to a guy and says, hey, we should build this little park

2072
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,080
across the street from the studio.

2073
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:48,000
So if this woman does not say go to this thing and Walt doesn't go

2074
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,160
and steal all of his ideas for the railroad fair,

2075
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,480
then maybe we don't get the ball rolling on Disneyland.

2076
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,760
That's our at least it looks much different.

2077
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,920
It's a different. Yeah.

2078
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,440
Yeah. Yeah.

2079
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,800
You're describing the some of that basic stuff that it's like where I grew up.

2080
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,760
And it's a display of turn of the century vehicles.

2081
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,160
And a railroad is a big part of the robot of potential future episodes.

2082
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,800
I mean, obviously Mickey Mouse Park, the unbuilt Burbank Mickey Park.

2083
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,040
Yes. It's very interesting.

2084
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,320
Also, Walt's diet, trying to find every trying to find

2085
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,560
multiple instances of like, OK, what's Walt's diet?

2086
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,320
Do we eat try to do we each try to eat like Walt for a day

2087
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,400
and see how we feel after a podcast at the end of the chili into scotch, into pudding?

2088
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,160
Just just vomit.

2089
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,000
So I'm caking the floor of the guy.

2090
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,880
My third eye just open like I'm just activated.

2091
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,280
None of that sounds out of the realm of possibility for the way I already eat.

2092
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,600
Yeah, that's all great stuff to eat.

2093
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,360
So yeah, I was trying to pack it in.

2094
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:52,120
It's great. So Hazel is really, yeah, incredibly much more influential.

2095
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2096
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,760
So that's even more of to the theory.

2097
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,280
If not for the polo, if they had had the polar injury,

2098
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,640
might not have hired Hazel, who might not have told him to go to the railroad

2099
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,040
to go this road.

2100
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,840
And then he immediately sends a memo and says, I want to build Mickey Mouse

2101
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,280
Park across the street.

2102
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,040
But the problem becomes money.

2103
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,200
Where am I going to get the money for this?

2104
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,560
He's complaining about how he can't find money to Hazel.

2105
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:18,840
And he says, hey, if I asked you for some money, would you give me some money?

2106
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,600
And she says, yes, which seems odd.

2107
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,480
But it makes him go.

2108
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,200
Maybe people would be enthusiastic about this.

2109
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:28,720
So then he tasks her with going and raising money from the employees.

2110
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:32,440
Will you start a fund to make Mickey Mouse Park happen?

2111
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:35,440
And from that fund grows out the theme.

2112
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,520
But I didn't know any of this.

2113
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,680
So her connection to all of it is very direct.

2114
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:40,320
Wow.

2115
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:44,920
It's always alarming when the company you are an employee of is fundraising

2116
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,840
for the company you are an employee of.

2117
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,200
Look, I feel great about when Funny or Die started saying,

2118
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,680
why don't everyone buy stock?

2119
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,880
And then we all did it.

2120
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,120
And if you'll notice, we're all millionaires today.

2121
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,200
Yes, I have the famous giant sale of Funny or Die.

2122
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,720
I have noticed.

2123
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,080
This one maybe did work out better, although she did end up, you know,

2124
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:11,200
she lived alone in a little apartment her final years near the in Burbank,

2125
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,720
near the studio.

2126
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:16,760
But she did have a friend into her her older years.

2127
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,120
This is very bizarre.

2128
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,440
So there's this book in the 70s about Walt called Walt Disney

2129
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,360
American Original by Bob Thomas, I believe, is the writer.

2130
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,080
A lot of stories from the book come from this woman, Hazel.

2131
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,200
I know we're going to do this.

2132
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,000
You found this? Yeah, yeah, yes.

2133
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,600
How weird is this?

2134
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,200
This is a big book, by the way, like before the you remember

2135
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:44,720
there were in the early 2000s or so, there was a two competing biographies

2136
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,640
came out within the same 10 year span.

2137
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,120
Oh, really?

2138
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:52,160
I think before that, the Bob Thomas book, I believe, talked about a lot.

2139
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:53,960
Yeah, well for you.

2140
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,520
Big major one that told a lot of stuff, not words and all,

2141
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,680
but a little a little bit of words.

2142
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:01,360
This book comes out and it's well received.

2143
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,920
And then the author, Bob Thomas, is contacted out of the blue on the phone.

2144
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,400
By a high pitched voice who says, this is Michael.

2145
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,120
You can guess who Michael is.

2146
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,800
That is Michael Jackson.

2147
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,880
Michael Jackson just personally calls this writer on the phone

2148
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,360
and what it leads to.

2149
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,360
So they so so they meet and they hang out and he asks a ton of questions

2150
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,440
about Walt, among which he says a certain swear word.

2151
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,880
I don't know what the swear word is.

2152
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,400
And he says, did Walt ever say that word?

2153
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,120
Michael Jackson needs reassuring that Walt didn't swear anyway.

2154
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,040
Weird.

2155
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,720
So then they meet and then he says, oh, one more thing.

2156
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,960
Do you have Hazel George's number?

2157
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,600
And he said, no, I only met her once.

2158
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,680
I'll find a way.

2159
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:42,920
He contacted her.

2160
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:47,400
And then Michael Jackson started visiting Hazel, this nurse, all the time,

2161
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,480
all the time, brought her flowers all the time, brought her classical music.

2162
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:54,440
Mike just showed a photo of Michael Jackson

2163
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,560
the bedside of Walt's old nurse.

2164
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,040
What's happening? What do you mean?

2165
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,840
I didn't. This is all a shock to me.

2166
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,200
I was like, all right, then he hired the nurse and I wonder.

2167
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,200
No, the nurse thought of Disneyland, told him about cryonics

2168
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,880
and then became close friends with Michael Jackson until they both died.

2169
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,760
Yeah. And her 90s rice like she died in 96.

2170
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,000
So this must have been happening in like her late 80s, early 90s.

2171
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,800
You know, the late 80s and early 90s when Michael Jackson has nothing else going on.

2172
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,080
Right. He's hanging out with his nurse.

2173
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,320
Wow. Really weird.

2174
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,560
The photo you have is that's like bad era.

2175
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,040
That's like very like iconic.

2176
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,320
Yeah, that's like Michael.

2177
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,320
Yeah. This is now I feel like I have to go back to every episode

2178
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:39,640
and find something we said offhanded without thinking and see if it also leads

2179
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,280
to like national treasure, like rabbit holes.

2180
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,960
I could be. I also get the feeling with this Hazel George stuff that there is

2181
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:52,000
way more even that's been written about because she seems so fascinating

2182
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,080
and is intertwined with so much stuff.

2183
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,880
I wrote all these songs and like was there for his most vulnerable moments.

2184
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,320
Yeah. Shit.

2185
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,720
There's also some exchange where she like kind of jabs him a little and he says,

2186
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,600
oh, you know, my next project is an audio animatronic nurse.

2187
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,320
They have a little like sitcom banter like George and Gracie style.

2188
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,240
It seems like they had a real act going.

2189
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,920
That's fascinating. Yeah.

2190
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,400
And then Michael at the end.

2191
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,160
Yeah. And then she hung out with Michael Jackson, a bunch of Michael 90s.

2192
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,960
Michael knew who she was like he was excited.

2193
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,560
Yeah. Yeah. Weird.

2194
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,640
And also, I looked at this book today.

2195
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,360
She has mentioned on 10 pages of this page book.

2196
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,920
Why did why did he gravitate to I want to talk to Hazel?

2197
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,080
Yeah, right. That's so fascinating, too.

2198
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,440
I mean, he had ultimately had children with his own nurse.

2199
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,840
So it was maybe a feeling. Right.

2200
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,360
Nurses. Maybe it was a nurse thing.

2201
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,680
I guess he had wanted to be like Walt and meet the woman who worked on Walt.

2202
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,640
I don't know. That's interesting.

2203
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,840
There's a lot. There's more here is all I'm saying.

2204
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,960
And we are like we have just found the two hundred and seventy

2205
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,960
ninth weirdest thing about Michael Jackson.

2206
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,640
He shows up everywhere in this and all of these topics.

2207
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,760
He's constantly showing up.

2208
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,520
Yeah. And sometimes we have to make a point of avoiding a lot of a time.

2209
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,840
Yeah. This case, we'll go with it.

2210
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,080
We have to say this woman became the person who inspired everything

2211
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,240
all at the back of everything Disney does today.

2212
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,920
Disney is built on this nurse, her ideas and Walt crushing

2213
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,160
four of his vertebrae. This is what we have learned.

2214
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,840
Yeah. It's why it's the butterfly effect. Right.

2215
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,360
Yeah. Is that what they call it?

2216
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,080
I the Ashton Kutcher movie.

2217
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,120
You know what? I'm just realizing now I pulled up this book.

2218
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,880
This was one of the biographies I was thinking of that were around

2219
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,640
the same times. And it says Disney Editions 2017.

2220
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,520
I think they reissue.

2221
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,480
I didn't realize this.

2222
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,120
This might have been an updated reissue of the time,

2223
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,400
because this is the one I think the family stands by, approves.

2224
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,200
They didn't approve of this other book, Walt Disney Hollywood's Dark Prince,

2225
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,120
which my dad gave me as a present when I was a child.

2226
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,440
And my mom was like, uh, thank you for taking an interest in Scott's interest.

2227
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,760
But this seems weird.

2228
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,400
But which I read, I'm reading about his union stuff when I'm like nine.

2229
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,520
And it's kind of crazy.

2230
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:21,720
This the Walt Disney, the triumph of American imagination came out in 2007.

2231
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:26,280
If you can see, it has the like Neil Gabler is the author.

2232
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,680
It kind of has the font, the cartoony ish font.

2233
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,040
Yeah, I've read that one. Yeah.

2234
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,040
Anyway, bizarre.

2235
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,840
How much said this is I didn't think this would be this vast.

2236
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,520
And I didn't think Michael Jackson would be involved.

2237
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,040
And I didn't think

2238
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,320
people getting crushed by horses would be involved.

2239
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,760
This is unrelated, but I just found a picture of Michael Jackson

2240
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:51,840
with his pet spider tarantula crawling up on his chest.

2241
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,840
Have you ever seen that?

2242
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,960
I'm not familiar with the mythology of Michael's spider.

2243
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,600
OK, that's a scary photo.

2244
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,040
We have a name on the spider.

2245
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,640
Michael Jackson, you should know that.

2246
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,080
I don't know that Michael Jackson's spider's name tacky

2247
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,600
partner.

2248
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,840
Hazel, I have a spider to name.

2249
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,400
I need you to give me some of Walt's names.

2250
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,880
This story. Wow.

2251
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,840
There's a spider on his face.

2252
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,520
Michael, do you know that's there?

2253
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,280
Get it off.

2254
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,680
Michael has like all these.

2255
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,560
Wow. This feels this this story.

2256
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,000
This episode feels like one of those novels that's like a like

2257
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,040
infinite jester underworld or where it's like a journey through 20th

2258
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,960
century America, like, you know, the full run of the 20th century.

2259
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,640
Stories weaving in and out of other stories.

2260
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,680
Yeah, Michael, we understand the 20th century now.

2261
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,160
Here's him in 2003 with a giant spider bite.

2262
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,440
And now we know why, because he's always palin role with spiders.

2263
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,800
Michael, my spider's off.

2264
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,000
Yeah, she was.

2265
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,880
Taylor was begging him.

2266
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,200
John Peters, John Peters tried to warn him.

2267
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,680
Scariest thing. Big spiders.

2268
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,520
You know, well, so look,

2269
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,280
all the things we love came from all this.

2270
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,480
So I guess, you know what?

2271
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,880
There's that thing in Spaceship Earth, which wouldn't exist without any of this.

2272
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,120
Does that line? Thank the Phoenicians in this case.

2273
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,200
Thank the Argentines.

2274
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,360
Thank you.

2275
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,600
And I don't mean like everybody from Argentina.

2276
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,440
I mean, the four specific aggressive polo players from 1930s.

2277
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,560
If you had not crushed Walt's vertebrae, we wouldn't have a podcast.

2278
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,160
Man, that's true.

2279
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,120
I didn't even think about what's not having a podcast because of it. Wow.

2280
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,320
Yeah, that too. That's crazy. You're right.

2281
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,720
That all right. Well, that's all.

2282
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,480
Let's all let's all thank the Argentines, shall we?

2283
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,200
Thank you. Thank you, Argentine.

2284
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:43,880
Thank you, Argentines, for Walt Disney's original sin.

2285
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,560
Ruthless aggression on the polo field.

2286
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,360
Speaking of which, it's been a long episode.

2287
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,440
I think I'm going to go sin and put some scotch in my

2288
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,360
ruined God's vessel that is my body.

2289
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,360
Is your nurse here?

2290
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,920
It is almost five. We should all go have a five o'clock.

2291
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,120
We should all go to go see our nurses.

2292
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,400
We're all we just have to be each other's nurses.

2293
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,040
It might very well might turn into amateur wrestling.

2294
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,880
But for now, we should get off, Mike, for all that you survived podcast.

2295
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:17,040
The ride you learned all about Walt's Polo Injury and the 20th century.

2296
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,960
Keep it tuned here where perhaps Jason's one act play

2297
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,320
about Top Cat and Hot Dogs will get enacted unless that is on the stage

2298
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,040
in the theater.

2299
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:30,280
You know, I still got to cut out the the first play and the first play ever did.

2300
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,760
I have some digital files.

2301
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,440
So many plays to know there's so much plays.

2302
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,360
Well, yeah, this is the well, we'll start a podcast.

2303
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,360
Right. The theater program as well.

2304
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:43,640
You can start as the patron, but also you can like have the seats and like,

2305
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,360
oh, I'll see that one. Oh, maybe I'll skip that.

2306
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,520
You know, we were talking about before we started recording,

2307
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,760
the price of everything is up.

2308
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:53,480
I think black box theaters, the only thing the price is down.

2309
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:58,320
It's going for a fire sale and maybe some actual fires

2310
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,320
for the insurance money.

2311
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:03,160
You know, the UCB theater, I think you mean the PTR theater.

2312
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,320
We bought it. See you there soon.

2313
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,480
Bye bye.
