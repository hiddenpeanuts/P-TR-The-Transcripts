1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, Jabronis.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Thank you for dining with us here at this professional wrestling themed restaurant.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,120
Get ready for a podcast menu filled with slam-widges, elbow drop macaroni, Superman fruit punch,

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,400
and our popular appetizer, king of the onion rings.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,960
All items are seasoned with moonsalt.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,360
That's a spice that gives the food a super kick.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,200
Matt Cardona joins us to talk pro wrestling themed restaurants on today's

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,720
celebratory edition of podcast, The Ride.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:01:00,760
Welcome to podcast, The Ride presents Celebruary, a podcast that believes a meal is not deemed

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,160
great by the ingredients, but by how embarrassing the name is to say to a waiter, my name is

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,680
Michael Carlson joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
That's right.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Yeah.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,480
Either, either how embarrassing or how regular it is.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,160
Those are the two options.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,000
You mean like just saying hamburger, like a, like just without a fun name.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,840
Cause I'm talking about like Rudy Tootie, fresh and fruity, which is a great meal, but

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,760
it's a very embarrassing thing to say out loud to a, what are the waitstaff?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
It's, it's different than just saying all of the chicken sandwich versus all of the

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
broken finger sandwich.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
Yeah, that's a good point.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,600
Scott Gardner, how do you feel on this topic?

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,320
Well, I mean, what I feel that you, you led exactly to what I was thinking at the top,

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
which is sometimes we talk for a while at the beginning and I was worried this time,

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280
like, boy, if we do a lot of interest stuff, we're not going to be able to read every

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,920
single item on the menu of the WCW Nitro Grill.

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,680
Yeah, that's basically if there's an attraction, obviously our guest is a big part of this

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,520
attraction, but also just reading the names on these menus is so exciting to us.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,760
And it's going to be something that everyone should be excited about.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,520
Let's bring him in because we don't have a second to waste here.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,880
This guy is a multi multi hyphenate.

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,800
He's a Michael Jordan of action figure collecting.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
He's the death match king.

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
He hosts the Major Wrestling Figure podcast, the MajorLand podcast, which is about theme

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,560
parks. You can see him wrestle in GCW, NWA, Impact Wrestling.

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,360
He also sounds a lot like a ghost boy that haunts the American Dream Mall in New Jersey.

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,480
And he's a very good friend of podcast.

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
The ride is Matt Cardona, folks.

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
What an intro. How about it very much.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,480
It's actually the Michael Jordan of wrestling.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,320
Oh, I shoot.

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
I thought I had such a good I was like, this is the best intro I've ever written.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
And I was good. It was good.

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,680
It was great.

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,360
I know that I listen to that game game.

49
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,640
I'm going to edit it out to make myself look smarter.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,320
Well, thanks for having me back on, guys.

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,280
Of course. Thank you for doing this.

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,600
Before we start real quick, there's a couple of things I have to address.

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,120
I just want to congratulate you on the release of a fantastic action figure.

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,800
Oh, yeah, I know.

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,520
This is an audio podcast only.

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
But of course, we'll show a picture, though.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,840
Oh, OK. Where does this go?

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,920
This doesn't go anywhere, right?

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
Does it go on your page on the video?

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280
No video. Nobody gets it.

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,200
We might do that.

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
The bare minimum. OK.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,160
He's holding up my my super seven Mac Cardona figure.

64
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,320
Which is right.

65
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,200
I believe those are Michelangelo and Chucks.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,720
OK, yeah.

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,080
So these are the same scale as the ninja turtles made by Super Seven.

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,520
So your hand perfectly holds a nunchuck and many of the ninja turtles weapons,

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,960
which is very exciting to me.

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,160
And I have you displayed being interviewed by April O'Neill.

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,840
I like that.

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,440
Now, are you going to get the the Disney Super Sevens,

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
which are also in the same universe?

74
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,560
So I'm in the same universe as Donatello, you know, Mickey Mouse.

75
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,680
Yes. The Bart Simpson.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
There are so many different properties going to be in scale to you

77
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
and your co-host, Brian.

78
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
It's pretty exciting. Prince John from Robin Hood.

79
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,720
Like, there's all sorts of hijinks you're going to be able to get up to

80
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,640
on my display shelf.

81
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,000
It's very exciting.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm a little scared, but well,

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,200
am I going to fall in love with someone? Maybe.

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm already in love. I have a wife.

85
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,680
I understand you have a great wife.

86
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,160
But this is about to have a Pinocchio little puppet boy son.

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,280
You're about to have a that's right.

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
Fully articulated Super Seven Pinocchio.

89
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm going to have you holding I'm going to have Madden Pinocchio

90
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
holding hands, doing something cute.

91
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,640
I don't know whether they make Pinocchio.

92
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Yeah, he's the first wave.

93
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,080
He's coming out in the first wave.

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
Does he have like interchangeable nose?

95
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,640
So different heads, multiple.

96
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,760
Oh, I like you know what? That's great. I like that.

97
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,920
Yeah. So say hello to your new son.

98
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,320
I don't like I don't like the equating of sons in Pinocchio.

99
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm against this.

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,920
You got to it's church and state. It's too creepy.

101
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,280
Well, we still talk about podcasts, the right toys and I now

102
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,960
it feels like we need to get the same Super Seven scale

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,040
if we ever land on like what type of toys.

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,360
So we can have Scott holding hands with Pinocchio as well.

105
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,560
No, maybe a variant where Scott is dressed as Peter Pan.

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
I don't know if you guys are all action figure guys, right?

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Just Mike. I'm the only figure guy.

108
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,480
Yeah, but Scott's got a lot of like I got a couple back there,

109
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,440
but it's nothing in good.

110
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,000
I have every iteration of Rex that exists between the kids.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,120
You see, he's got the contemporary behind him.

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Yeah, that's true.

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,000
It's all it's a it's a spare amount of Disney related stuff.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,080
It was an old fan.

115
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,920
Wow. No, it's not trash.

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,480
I've been meaning to to donate.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,920
I said to a record yard.

118
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,840
Yeah, no, it's a ho.

119
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
It's the awesome hotel.

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,800
You know it. It's the cool.

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
And it lights up from the inside.

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
You can send a monorail through it.

123
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,960
It's my pride and joy, but it's not an action figure.

124
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
So it's a contemporary never stayed.

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,920
No, no, it's it's not the best to stay in.

126
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,080
I don't think it's very not Disney.

127
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
You know, I mean, you can walk to the Magic Kingdom.

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,120
It has California Grill.

129
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,680
But other than that, there's this.

130
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,360
I want some Disney theming if I met the hotels, you know what I'm saying?

131
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,840
Yeah, I agree.

132
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,280
And a lot of those 70s hotels, you can feel the size.

133
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,960
You can feel like, boy, this is a little box.

134
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,600
It might be a little like depressing to be here for a whole week.

135
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,160
But then on the other hand, you got a lot of Disney theming

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,800
at those like art of animation.

137
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,680
Yes. But I to me, I'm like, oh, this is too much.

138
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,120
I don't want I'm sick of looking at this giant tramp.

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,360
I've passed by this tramp all week.

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
I want like the all star movies.

141
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,080
You can swim in that outdated as fuck Mighty Ducks pool.

142
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
Is that what they have there?

143
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,640
Well, yeah, it's great.

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,560
Of the team or of the it must be of the team, I guess.

145
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Or the movie.

146
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,080
It's got to be like the movie or maybe the cartoon either.

147
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,800
Or it's outdated.

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Yeah, none of this is around now.

149
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Yeah, right. Right.

150
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,240
Oh, weird.

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,400
I mean, that's where I go next time.

152
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,280
Like right mix of it.

153
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,760
But real quick, too, I just want to mention how if the audience doesn't know

154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,560
how dedicated the theme parks you are, Matt, you wrestled.

155
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,080
And for the people who don't know, you wrestle what is called a death match.

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,680
That's right. I'm the death match king.

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,640
You're the death match king.

158
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,360
You wrestled one and then you immediately became the king.

159
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,880
That's right. And then I retired from death match wrestling.

160
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,640
Which is perfect. Right.

161
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,320
Honestly, that's the way to do it, because I watched the match.

162
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,520
Stressed me out. It was great.

163
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,200
But it stressed me out.

164
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,800
And if people don't know, it's a violent match.

165
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,520
It's a little gory.

166
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,280
But you wrestle, I believe, on the East Coast and immediately within hours,

167
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,600
you were on the West Coast at Universal Studios.

168
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,360
That's right. Really in banged up.

169
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,200
So you were like, there's no way I'm canceling my trip.

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
That's why you're not. Yeah.

171
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,680
No, I flew cross country, did not sleep at these shows.

172
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,920
There's no real doctor.

173
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,240
So I use the term loosely.

174
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,640
A nurse stitched me up, barely cleaned me off.

175
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,000
There were no bandages. I took a shower.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
I then taped towels to my back and arm

177
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
because you're bleeding.

178
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,520
It's bleeding. The blood would not stop.

179
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,360
The blood would not stop.

180
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes. But I had to make it to my Disneyland and Universal trip that I planned.

181
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
Yeah, this is dedication.

182
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
The plan was I'll just fly there.

183
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I'll find like a gym, like an L.A. fitness, use their shower,

184
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,120
and then I'll go to Universal. But I could not move.

185
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
I was still bleeding.

186
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,320
I said, I cannot.

187
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,520
I cannot work out. I can't go to a gym.

188
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,040
I need to find some sort of hotel and clean myself off.

189
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,720
So I checked into that Universal Studios Hotel, which is pretty expensive,

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
but I needed to be like right there.

191
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,920
I took a shower and I try to be cautious.

192
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,120
I put towels over the comforter to take a nap.

193
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,520
I needed a little nap and I just bled out all the way through to the

194
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,440
not quite the mattress, but the mattress cover all the way through.

195
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,440
This is yeah, this is insane. Yeah.

196
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,960
It was pretty gory.

197
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,120
My fiance met me. She cleaned me up, bandaged me up, went to Universal,

198
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,400
did all the rides, then went to Disneyland, did all the right.

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,760
It didn't hurt. It hurt doing these.

200
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,240
Imagine the Matterhorn riding the Matterhorn with no injury.

201
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,240
Yeah. But you have to do it right.

202
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,800
Everything bumps you around the time.

203
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,880
But, you know, I held up that GCW world title

204
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,600
in front of the castle of Disneyland. It's an iconic photo.

205
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,240
It had to be done. It had to be done.

206
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,040
It's I mean, this is kind of a rite of passage.

207
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
If you go to Atlantic City, there's always a chance that that could happen.

208
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,240
So you just kind of guaranteed

209
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,840
that that happened.

210
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,400
Right. And I'm sure this this podcast could be a couple of weeks delay.

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,560
So I don't want to spoil anything.

212
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
And I don't want to predict the future.

213
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,120
But if I win the NWA World's Heavyweight title this weekend,

214
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm going right to France, right to Disneyland, Paris.

215
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,520
And I will take a picture of the me in the title in front of the castle.

216
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,120
Wow. Hell yeah.

217
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,400
Hell yeah. That is awesome.

218
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,920
But if I lose, then this means nothing.

219
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,120
That's OK. It's a false promise.

220
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,480
That's fair. But the intention is clear.

221
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,520
That's right. So anytime, I mean, anytime you're holding a title

222
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,320
and you have a theme park trip, you are going to take a picture

223
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,160
with the belt in front of the what they call the weenie.

224
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,960
The weenie is what they call like the icon of the park.

225
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,200
That's why I didn't do this.

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,120
This is an insider. I hate this phrase.

227
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,880
I hate anytime weenie comes up.

228
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,720
The way we term like it's not just the castle, but like Spaceship Earth

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,080
or the Chinese theater.

230
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,560
And it's anything that's like the icon of the park.

231
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,760
It draws you down to the center of the park, you know, like a weenie.

232
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,040
Like for Jason, a big hot dog weenie would get him, would pull him

233
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,120
from wherever he is.

234
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
The first time I've ever heard this term.

235
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,520
Now, listen, I know you guys are above me on the theme park.

236
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,960
Psychoness. But I'm pretty up there.

237
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,040
I've never heard the term weenie.

238
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,560
Yeah, it was new.

239
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,200
Jason is the one who I think told me about it, told us about it.

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,040
Maybe not long ago. Maybe not long ago.

241
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,200
I feel like I probably just like what's the spell.

242
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,440
It's W E E N I E

243
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,720
like weenie, like, yeah, like weenie.

244
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
I have no idea, too.

245
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,600
We should look into like the history, like where does this come from?

246
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,880
Who came up with this?

247
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah. So hold on. Let's backtrack for a second.

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
You think the Chinese theater is the weenie over a tower of terror?

249
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,160
Oh, well, when it opened, maybe it's not so much anymore.

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,920
But yeah, I mean, most of it, usually it's like when you walk in,

251
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,640
you see it like straight away.

252
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,600
Or yeah, that's that's generally what it means.

253
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
But obviously, spatial birth is the front of the park, right?

254
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,040
Not the back like the other.

255
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,360
So the big tree at Animal Kingdom is the weenie.

256
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,040
The big tree is the weenie.

257
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,400
So you're getting used to it.

258
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,360
Like it seems like you're taken to this weenie term.

259
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,280
I don't know what's the weenie.

260
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,200
What's the weenie? I didn't have one.

261
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,760
I think now it's the Cartay Circle restaurant, but that's it's not the strong.

262
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,480
I guess it's not the strongest park in a weenie sense.

263
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,600
Yeah, I don't know if there's a weenie there.

264
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Maybe not a first wheel.

265
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,400
There's various. OK, yeah.

266
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,520
But that breaks your rules of it being as soon as you walk in the park.

267
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,200
Yeah, right. Exactly. That's true.

268
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,080
I would say DC California Adventure has not one big weenie,

269
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,800
but a few little weenies.

270
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,880
OK, that's what I would say.

271
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,760
Yeah, they are little weenies.

272
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,200
But they used to just have that like tin can son, which was truly not a weenie.

273
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,040
So they've got they got better.

274
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,680
They're upping their weenie game.

275
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,640
Yeah. So, yeah, feel free to use that.

276
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,160
Feel free to tell if you want to call Chelsea right now and tell her about it.

277
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,040
Your wife. She does not care.

278
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
She does not care at all.

279
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,200
So much so that our podcast, Majorland, about theme parks has been canceled

280
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,960
because she doesn't care enough. Oh, wow.

281
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,160
It's done.

282
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,520
It's not a hiatus. If you.

283
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,320
OK, yeah, it'll come back.

284
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,000
If she hears the term, though, she might want to be more intrigued.

285
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,240
That's possible. Yeah.

286
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
Maybe really interesting.

287
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,560
So good. Who are the cool guys that told you about it? Yeah.

288
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,480
Wow. Unbelievable.

289
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,280
We're not talking about.

290
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,560
No, we're not.

291
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,160
We're talking about other themed things, but we're talking about, you know,

292
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,280
it's kind of a grab bag episode of professional wrestling restaurants,

293
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,120
some owned by companies, some owned by, you know, specific wrestlers.

294
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,200
And we wanted to have you want to get your take on this,

295
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,160
because you obviously you are a professional wrestler.

296
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,320
You've worked everywhere.

297
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,520
And you also share with me that you have a person you went as a young man.

298
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,320
To WWF New York.

299
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,000
I did. And without getting too much into it right now, before we really start,

300
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,240
it didn't live up to the hype. It sucked.

301
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,840
It was disappointment.

302
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,520
And so I wish it was still there, of course.

303
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,960
I still go there, even though it's not there.

304
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
It's a hard rock.

305
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
But, you know, when I proposed to Chelsea Green,

306
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,080
so we got to go to New York to celebrate.

307
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,840
We went to the hard rock.

308
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,480
So you're calling it that, even though it's a hard rock.

309
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,440
Because it looks identical inside.

310
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,240
Right. They didn't do much to it.

311
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,240
So, yeah. So if the audience doesn't know WWF, when it was the WWF,

312
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,200
they made a Times Square restaurant.

313
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,480
It was a club.

314
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
It was an arcade.

315
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,640
I believe there was an arcade in the basement or was it up in the main level?

316
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,680
So the main level was kind of like WWE Shop.com, like some merch. Right.

317
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,440
So that was pretty cool.

318
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,840
But then you went down these stairs and it was this is when the theme

319
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,560
restaurants were huge in New York City.

320
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,320
And I love that. I'm in I'm in junior high, you know, trading in my dad's

321
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,880
beer cans and my soda cans to get money to take the train to sneak into the city.

322
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,240
And I'm going to all these restaurants and I'm like,

323
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,240
you know, barely have enough money to get a hamburger.

324
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
But I'm getting the shot glass for my collection.

325
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,000
You know what I'm saying? Like Planet Hollywood, All-Star Cafe,

326
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,720
WF New York. It's like, oh, my God.

327
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,120
So it was awesome in that sense.

328
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,560
When you got there, you know, you go to you go to Planet Hollywood,

329
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,680
you see all the outfits, you know, of all your favorite movie stars.

330
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,240
You go to like Hard Rock Cafe and it's like, you know,

331
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,280
all the musicians and stuff like that.

332
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,120
They went to WF New York.

333
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,280
You thought you'd think you'd see like Hogan's gear like on the wall,

334
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,600
like gobbledygooker legs, his outfit on the wall.

335
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,040
But it wasn't really like that.

336
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,800
The theming was horrible.

337
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,520
Yeah, because I remember watching it on TV.

338
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,800
They would always cut to it if you were watching Raw or Sunday Night Heat.

339
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,600
And it looked like the only thing that would be cool is that they would have

340
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,400
like superstars there, but you never saw that on the wall.

341
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,720
Yeah, there was like nothing on the wall.

342
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,040
Once you're, you know, obviously, when you're in the merchandise store,

343
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,440
the gift shop, if you will, you could tell, OK, this is WWF themed.

344
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Once you went downstairs, not really a couple of things here and there.

345
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,760
But it wasn't like I bet if they did it today, they would know how to do it.

346
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
They would do it right.

347
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,320
Like if you ever go to their fan access, right.

348
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,400
They they they they dominate that.

349
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,680
So I'm sure if they did it today, it would be awesome.

350
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,200
But back then, not really.

351
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,920
Well, hang on. I heard that they had black walls and a chain link fence.

352
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,960
That sounds that sounds like pretty good theming to me.

353
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
There you go. That's all you need.

354
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,640
Yeah. So you were when you were a young man and you went like,

355
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,680
you remember going like, boy, this is not nearly as good as Planet Hollywood.

356
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,040
Oh, I was so bummed out the first time I went so bummed out.

357
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,400
And I didn't keep going back because it was there for a while.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,040
I had my ninth grade birthday there.

359
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,800
Oh, yeah. And I now this is a weird story.

360
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,320
So I think I told you, Mike, that I had Chris Jericho on my cake.

361
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,800
And then you asked me, like, did my parents like bringing the cake

362
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,720
or was the cake there?

363
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,080
And then, like, I got to thinking, is this a story that I've just told

364
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,640
so many times where I think there was a Jericho cake and there really wasn't?

365
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,320
You can't like look up like, did they sell cakes?

366
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,880
I tried. Right. Right.

367
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,000
Like in my mind, we ordered a Chris Jericho cake.

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,960
But now that I'm thinking about it, maybe it's just like,

369
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,560
you know, my imagination.

370
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,640
I told enough times that I believe it to be true.

371
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,960
They probably had a cake.

372
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,680
Yeah. Was it like with the photo of Chris?

373
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,040
It was shaped like Chris.

374
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,800
You know, just just a photo of Chris Jericho, one of those Carvel.

375
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,040
I don't know if you guys have Carvel in L.A., but something like that.

376
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Well, maybe it was that maybe your parents like went to a separate location

377
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,800
and maybe it was probably didn't know. No, no.

378
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,040
No, we took the train in from from Long Island.

379
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,720
We went and I got the I feel like I definitely had Chris Jericho my cake

380
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,280
because I know for a fact we bought the Chris Jericho,

381
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,200
his first WWF action figure in the gift shop as well.

382
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,440
Wow. So maybe those memories have bled together over the years.

383
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,240
That's what I'm thinking.

384
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,880
Or if someone's out there and has proved that there were cakes there.

385
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,560
If my mom's listening, she's just a picture, you know, on her.

386
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,640
Yeah. Who knows?

387
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,120
Wow. Your memory was it was like somebody had drawn a picture of him on the cake

388
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,280
or was it one of those like an eight by 10, like one of those like screen things.

389
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,480
Yeah, a screen thing.

390
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,400
Yeah, because I remember being excited as a kid when it would be like

391
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,800
my mom would never like do that because it was a little more expensive. Right.

392
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,080
Because I would be like, you can get I can pull a picture out of a magazine

393
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,680
and we can put it on the cake like any picture like right.

394
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,800
And my entertainment weekly, there's a picture of Batman forever.

395
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,400
Like we could do that.

396
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,520
And it was like, well, it was like probably 12 to 15 dollars more.

397
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,000
So it's like we can just get the icing right.

398
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
Batman forever on the shore.

399
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Sure. Do it today. You could do it.

400
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,200
I think you got it. I think we got an idea for your birthday this year.

401
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,400
You know what Jason found that that certain McDonald's

402
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,480
will sell you a sheet cake. Really?

403
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,080
Jason, yeah. Yeah. Discover this.

404
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Jason texted me like it was I feel like it was late.

405
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,400
I feel like it was like one in the morning.

406
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,520
And he was like, did you know McDonald's certain McDonald's

407
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,560
will sell you like a birthday sheet cake?

408
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,520
And we can't I don't know how to tell which one when just one's will.

409
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, the art.

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,720
It was just one of those like listicle things of like things

411
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,400
you might not know about McDonald's.

412
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,480
And it was like the bigger locations or the busier locations,

413
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,600
maybe ones that have play places

414
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,920
because they would do a lot of birthday parties have sheet cakes.

415
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm sure you have to order them ahead of time.

416
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,480
And it was also like nine or ten dollars.

417
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,720
It was an inexpensive cake, too.

418
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,840
Yeah, it's like a cheap.

419
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,600
They'll sell McDonald's will sell you a cheap cake in certain locations.

420
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,720
So that's what I'm gunning for for my birthday.

421
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,240
That is coming up in a few weeks.

422
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,080
You want a McDonald's cake specifically just to know.

423
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,960
I want a nine dollar a nine dollar McDonald's cake.

424
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
You should make your friend.

425
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,320
You should make all your friends go in on it so that everybody only pays

426
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,960
like 30 cents.

427
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't want to pay for that.

428
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,360
It's make Matt and even though you won't be there in person,

429
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,920
we're going to Venmo request you for 30 cents.

430
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,760
OK, that's yeah, I think you should ask.

431
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,320
You should say each friend don't get any gifts.

432
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,880
Just just bring me a McDonald's sheet cake.

433
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,080
So then you're stuck with a room full of them.

434
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,560
The clock is ticking and you have to deal with a room full of sheet cakes.

435
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,200
And then, of course, you're just setting this up.

436
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,240
So you take most of them home.

437
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

438
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,960
Yeah. So I'll throw it to the listeners.

439
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,760
I mean, there's a lot like anyone who listens to this podcast,

440
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,440
I would assume are most of them are in this in the zone

441
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,920
where they would have been really excited about WWF New York or Planet Hollywood.

442
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,720
So there's got to be somebody else who had a birthday out there.

443
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,720
And if they had a birthday, they obviously like they would have to have

444
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,280
some kind of cake. So maybe maybe we can find out the answer.

445
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,960
Did they do character cakes at WWF?

446
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,800
But when you look at the menu, here's the thing, though,

447
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,480
that makes me think maybe knows when you look at the menu,

448
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,680
it doesn't look like it's very much fun.

449
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,720
The names are not much horrible.

450
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
No horrible names.

451
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,640
Now, Matt, do you agree with us that if it's going to be a theme place,

452
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,600
it has to have Nate Fawn names 100 percent? Absolutely.

453
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,120
Yeah, because because let me pull this even the body slam burger.

454
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
There's something just add something to it.

455
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
It's pretty easy. It's yeah.

456
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,920
It's very easy. Any extra time.

457
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,360
And this is and we want to be employed naming shit like this.

458
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,280
The is a full time job. Yeah.

459
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,600
Oh, wait. Now I remember.

460
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
Well, you feel free to read some boring ones, but there's one that I like on here.

461
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, no, there's there's there's a couple that at least suggest something.

462
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,840
But like here, this barbecue spare ribs.

463
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,080
At WFD. Yeah.

464
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,240
Wild mushroom risotto.

465
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,160
Like this is herb roasted half chicken.

466
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,920
Give us a fucking wrestler name.

467
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,760
Come on. Like it's crazy that they wouldn't do this, because then as we've

468
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,880
we've figured out a lot, we talked a lot about these restaurants in the past.

469
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,600
They'll do one or two, which is what's the confusing thing. Right.

470
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,640
So like it's got I don't know if you were talking about the desserts

471
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,160
where we get something fun, which is the People's Sunday,

472
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,520
which the rock was the people's champion.

473
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,200
I like the People's Sunday.

474
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,480
And I like that it is it's just a regular long description of what's in the Sunday.

475
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,560
But then at the end, that it is what about

476
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,840
it with a cherry as well. Right.

477
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,920
Yes, God, you're right. It says pinned with a cherry.

478
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
So you get a little fun thing with love that.

479
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,760
That's great. Rings of Saturn, though, I think is weird.

480
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,360
That is a themed name.

481
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,840
But like it is that does that have anything to do with is that a wrestling?

482
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,840
Yes. Yes. Perry Saturn and his finishing move was called the Rings of Saturn.

483
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,160
Yeah. OK.

484
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,920
I do have a funny Perry Saturn, WDF New York story.

485
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,480
I would love I am. I was not.

486
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,200
I was not there for this, but I was a part of this. OK.

487
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,080
So my friend's older brother was old enough.

488
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,880
So after if there was a WDF event,

489
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,240
let's say mass were guarded, there would be some sort of after party

490
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,600
at New York where like the wrestlers would go stuff like that.

491
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
But I was not of age to go to these parties, right?

492
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,520
Because they had like a nightclub, whatever you want to call it.

493
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,400
So one of my friends older brothers went.

494
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,520
And I'm not saying he stole Perry Saturn cell phone,

495
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,440
but Perry Saturn dropped his cell phone.

496
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,120
OK. OK. Got it.

497
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,040
So he picked it up.

498
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,800
And I'm not saying he just did not return it.

499
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,240
Right. Wow. So when, you know, he got home,

500
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,640
he opened the phone, obviously,

501
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,200
and has every wrestler's phone number in there.

502
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,000
So like it was this like before we all had like computers and text messaging.

503
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,040
So he like wrote it out on pieces of paper and he would sell people

504
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,760
the phone numbers, you know.

505
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,840
Whoa. So then some of us, we would take like, obviously, when you're calling,

506
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,080
like most of the time, someone wouldn't pick up.

507
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
But we would put our phones together.

508
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,040
So we would get their voicemail and make it our voicemail.

509
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Yo, this is Triple H.

510
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,400
They've been messing stuff like that. Wow.

511
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,560
And then we called Taz from my friend's parents house and task.

512
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,280
Like we prank called him like, like, you know, he picked up.

513
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,760
We said something hung up. He called back.

514
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,240
He must have star six nine us.

515
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,240
And he scared the shit out of us, like screaming at us, threatening us.

516
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
Like we ran out of the house. We were so scared.

517
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,920
You ran out of your own house was my friend's house.

518
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,600
But yeah, ran out of his house because you thought he was like coming.

519
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,960
He thought he was coming. Yeah.

520
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,440
That's great. He did not come.

521
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
He did not. But it worked.

522
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,280
I mean, he was an intimidating guy.

523
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,280
But like crazy, for instance, if I if I lost my now, I have it pass

524
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,240
code protected, obviously, of course, if my phone dropped out

525
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,960
a park, you know, fell off a ride and it didn't chatter and someone picked it up.

526
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,560
They could have Vitz McMahon's phone number,

527
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,080
you know, Dolph Ziegler, the Miz, John Morrison, you name it.

528
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,520
John Cena in the phone.

529
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,720
That's crazy. That is short.

530
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah, it's like you have to put like secret like names to really protect it fully.

531
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,040
Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask, though.

532
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,880
Does that mean you could either you either have or you could get Chris

533
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,560
Jericho's number and tax like, hey, man,

534
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,040
weird question, do you remember the cake situation?

535
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,840
What the situation was like?

536
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,760
Tell me, I'll be up here.

537
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,840
Go text him. I don't think you would know the answer.

538
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,920
Did you ever pose specifically for a cake photo?

539
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,160
Everybody, every superstar at the time had to pose on a day for a cake.

540
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
We're doing your cake.

541
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,280
Vince is directing the cake shoot.

542
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,680
But yeah, just look at this menu.

543
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,400
Horrible. Like right away, this is not you only have one chance to make a first

544
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,400
impression. And as a young kid coming to New York, so excited, I open this menu.

545
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,040
First of all, look at the pricing for me.

546
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,320
I'm looking the hamburger.

547
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,440
I definitely got a kid's menu because I remember getting the burger.

548
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,400
I must say order up the kids menu in like eighth or ninth grade.

549
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
There's no way I was afforded that that New York strip of filet mignon.

550
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,200
There's no way. Yeah.

551
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,280
You'd have to order like a kid's meal.

552
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,600
Yeah, I get the kids meal has a fruit roll up with it.

553
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,520
That's a kid's side.

554
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,200
Yeah, that is funny. That is like that's as good.

555
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,440
Like, I guess it's better than a happy meal, but it really feels like it does

556
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,320
feel it feels fun, but also feels cheap as hell. Right.

557
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,120
Like we just bought we just went out to the the Kroger or wherever is in New

558
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
York. We went out to the CVS.

559
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,760
It's genius. Yeah.

560
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,240
I bought a box of fruit roll ups and we'll just throw it on a kid's plate.

561
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,920
They don't give a shit.

562
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,800
They came here for to think that they were going to meet a wrestler.

563
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,040
And then they OK, they're selling a freezer mug.

564
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,840
Is that something you bought at the time?

565
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,640
I did not buy the freezer mug.

566
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,240
Before we recorded this, I I did steal when I was there, like the bar menu.

567
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,400
And I was going to, you know, bring it and show it to you guys.

568
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,680
But I can't find it. I still have it all these years later.

569
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,400
Oh, wow. I thought that was cool.

570
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,000
But I don't recall them being any cool drinks on there either.

571
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,400
Yeah, I did see that, too.

572
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,040
And it didn't feel like there was anything remarkable.

573
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,160
I mean, the only it feels like the only thing that was cool was

574
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,680
if you went on the right Sunday, they were doing something.

575
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,800
They were shooting something live and you could get it there.

576
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,600
And they did like events.

577
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,240
They did. They did events there.

578
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,000
For instance, the finale, the tough enough. Right.

579
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,200
Was there where Maven is crowned the tough enough season one winner.

580
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,920
Maven, good friend of mine.

581
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,120
We're actually as ridiculous as it sounds.

582
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,480
We're going to the major rest of your podcast.

583
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,400
We're going to have like a party in New York City in Times Square

584
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,560
this upcoming May, and we're going to like Maven as the like the guest

585
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,720
of the night to celebrate the 20 years of him winning.

586
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,600
Tough enough in Times Square.

587
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,000
Obviously, I'd love to do it. I do have New York,

588
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,800
but it's not there and hard rock would be way too expensive.

589
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,720
We'll probably do it some no name shitty bar off of one of the side streets.

590
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,520
But still, you get the idea.

591
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,760
Yeah. Did you ever even ask like how much would it be at Hard Rock to know?

592
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,280
I was there, right?

593
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,120
There's oh, yeah.

594
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,560
There's no way we could afford something like that. No way.

595
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,880
Yeah. Well, yeah, that's that's still really fun,

596
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,200
regardless of the venue, but maybe Hard Rock would want to be involved.

597
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,400
You know, you never know.

598
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,400
And at one point later on when it was still, you know,

599
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,120
they changed the name to like the world. Yeah.

600
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,680
But it was still WWE.

601
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,000
At one point, there was a Toys R Us across the street in Times Square.

602
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,280
So if you're a big nerd like me, it was like a dream to go into Times Square,

603
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,200
bounce back and forth between the New York, whatever is called the time, the world,

604
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,880
get some figures at Toys R Us.

605
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,040
It was incredible. It's an incredible time to be a wrestling fan.

606
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,320
What a great day.

607
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,560
Did you remember crazy?

608
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,760
Sorry, is that that crazy Toys R Us with the Ferris wheel?

609
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,800
And that was the man. Wow.

610
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,360
Yes, I met.

611
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,440
I met Hulk Hogan there and I cut cut class in 11th grade to meet Hulk Hogan there.

612
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,080
And you know, if New York that day or WWE, whatever is called that day. Wow.

613
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,680
Did you can I ask, did you go to the Mars restaurant?

614
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,520
I did. And there was there was an outbrought.

615
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,520
That was my thing was to do all the the theme restaurants.

616
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
The Mars was ahead of its time.

617
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,720
Had one of those like elevators, almost like Skip from Gringotts.

618
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,600
You know, I'm saying, like, you're going to, you know, it was like a fake elevator.

619
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,920
Right. Did you take friends there and were you like, this shit is cool?

620
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,960
And they were like, this is the weirdest, like, no, my friends were kind of into it.

621
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
We would always pick up. We would like take the train to the city.

622
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,240
Go to Chinatown, get some like bootleg VHS is some bootleg

623
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,440
Oakley sunglasses, you know, stuff like that.

624
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
And then and then go to Times Square

625
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,160
and walk around and always always pick a theme restaurant, you know,

626
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
whether it be the world or All-Star Cafe.

627
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,040
What else was there?

628
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,000
Anything, you know, Planet Hollywood, All-Star Cafe.

629
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,280
Yeah, what was All-Star Cafe like?

630
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,680
That came up a little bit last week, but I don't really know what it was like inside

631
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,440
like what you was more like a sports kind of a sports kind of setting.

632
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,280
You know, like somebody's like like Ken Griffey's bat or whatever.

633
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,480
Yeah, stuff like that. I believe. Yeah. OK.

634
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,960
So would you rank W.F.

635
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,360
New York, the lowest of all those like I would have to 100 percent.

636
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,040
I would have to. That's such a bummer because just because of how cool

637
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,080
it could have been. Right. Right.

638
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,160
And even back then, though, they didn't take their

639
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,840
their history, their nostalgia.

640
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,760
They didn't like, you know, they didn't take it seriously, really.

641
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,040
You know, it wasn't until the early 2000s where they really, you know,

642
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,120
paid homage to the legends and the classic superstars, if you will, in history.

643
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,160
Like now they can do so many fun things like imagine like what they could do now.

644
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,760
Like just take some of the things they use at WrestleMania Access,

645
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,240
the big fan fest and just pop it up at a restaurant.

646
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,200
They yeah, that I'm trying to think like right a little bit after this even closed.

647
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
I forget what WrestleMania in Chicago I went to was 22 or something.

648
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,840
And they had you could call a match there.

649
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,880
Yeah, it was still low, still smallish, but you could tell they were

650
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,320
figuring it out like what people might want.

651
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,920
Let me real.

652
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,240
Now, this I would say like compared to and I don't and none of us

653
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,960
went to the Nitro Grill in Las Vegas, but Nitro Grill seems like it's

654
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,200
actually got the right idea here.

655
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,360
But let me let me show a couple of clips here from New York real quick

656
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,240
that that I do like.

657
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,000
And when did this close, by the way, this open like 99 was opening.

658
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
And when was it done?

659
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,400
It closed in April of 2003.

660
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,200
OK, oh, geez, that's pretty short run.

661
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,280
But you fit in a few visits.

662
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,400
Oh, I did, for sure.

663
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,160
Well, OK, so this is they would do like fun.

664
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,840
This is one of my favorite.

665
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,960
I remember this. I remember watching this live.

666
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,720
This is just to describe what it is.

667
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,440
There's a claw machine.

668
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
So they seem to have a pretty good arcade.

669
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,760
OK, I will say I don't recall the arcade.

670
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,360
Arcades are big in New York City.

671
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,960
Probably did have one. I mean, obviously they did.

672
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm looking at it right here.

673
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Yeah, it's a pretty big arcade.

674
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,800
They're doing a little sketch.

675
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
We'll put we'll post a clip of this.

676
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,120
But Cain, the wrestler is very tall, very scary with the mask on.

677
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,000
He tries to win a claw machine for a little boy.

678
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,080
And claw machines are very hard.

679
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,040
I only have one friend named Jeff, who is an expert on claw machine.

680
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,520
And no one else I know is he gets it every time.

681
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,400
It's unbelievable. I don't know how he does it.

682
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,560
Cain did not get it. Cain did not get it.

683
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,200
So he's looking around and he breaks the glass.

684
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,200
Jesus Christ.

685
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,040
Puts his fist to the glass, gives the kid picks out one

686
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,080
to a bunch of the toys and then starts throwing it,

687
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
which is just real fun.

688
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,360
And he gives the kid all the toys.

689
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,000
Very dangerous.

690
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,640
I mean, he just like the glass could hit the kid in the head.

691
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,520
Let's be honest.

692
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,840
But it was the 90s or no, it was 2001, which is basically the 90s.

693
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,640
Here's another quick clip I'd like to post here.

694
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,040
They're just this is sort of they were showing clips of it during Monday Night Raw.

695
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,600
Harry and Harry Reynolds has shown up.

696
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,160
But she's not alone because there you see the mayor of New York City.

697
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,440
Man, Rudolph Giuliani.

698
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
There he is.

699
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,600
The man of the day, WF New York.

700
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
And the mayor's not coming along, by the way.

701
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,840
Hey, that's his fiance.

702
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,720
Oh, really? The mayor is going to party.

703
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,320
Oh, man.

704
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,120
And then, you know, Jerry Luller's getting a little horny for Mayor Rudy Giuliani's

705
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,600
fiance. So the mayor partied at WWF New York.

706
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
Hell, yeah. Wow.

707
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,320
The eventual star of the Masked Singer himself.

708
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,160
Yeah, that's true.

709
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,200
I really think Rudy, that should have been more.

710
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,840
Rudy should have gotten a little bit more involved in the company

711
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,880
and shown up at WrestleMania's and Royal Rumbles.

712
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,040
Now, I think he'd be a great manager for any of the companies.

713
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,440
Some people might think he was a little too over the top in how he comes off, maybe.

714
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,160
But I don't know.

715
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,400
He's a great actor, as we saw in that sketch where he's in drag

716
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,360
with Trump. He commits to personas.

717
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,960
I'm excited to see the mask that he's in and how well he wears that character.

718
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,440
I think he's a fine performer.

719
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,040
He stole the show in Borat, too.

720
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,240
It's an excellent performance in Borat.

721
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,480
So, yeah, so a lot of stuff was going on there.

722
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,440
But, yeah, unfortunately, they're going to have to do something different.

723
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Like there's talk about a Hall of Fame in Orlando that's never happened.

724
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,400
And like, they're going to have to do something that's really on the level

725
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,800
that we're imagining as far as like, I think the restaurant just came a little

726
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,200
too late. You know, you say it opens in 99.

727
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,280
It's like almost the tail end of the attitude era.

728
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,120
But how could you open a restaurant as soon as things get hot?

729
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,280
Of course, it needs to be some planning that gets involved.

730
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,880
Yeah. And then that attitude era, that that late 97,

731
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,360
depending on when you consider the attitude

732
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,160
ending like early 2001, it quickly dies.

733
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,080
And everyone just trades in their DX and NWO shirts and doesn't like wrestling

734
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
anymore. Yeah.

735
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,000
So who's going to this restaurant?

736
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,440
And you've got to assume the rent for that place is astronomical.

737
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,120
Yes. Oh, millions, millions, millions a year.

738
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm looking at literally a copy pasted thing that says exactly that.

739
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,240
The rent is astronomical. I don't know where I got this from.

740
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,080
But it's this something pointed out that nobody makes money in Times Square

741
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,040
to the point where no business can actually be successful there.

742
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,720
We've talked about this with CityWalk, how like a lot of places

743
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,640
or it's just like to have a big ad for your company, for places

744
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,200
where it actually makes money.

745
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,880
So, yeah, I think it did horribly, probably.

746
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah. And there was I was reading to there was a there was the former manager

747
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,720
of the location scam WWE out of four hundred thousand dollars. Jesus.

748
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,720
And that was yeah, he got arrested for this

749
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,840
and that he used the allegedly ill gotten gains to buy himself

750
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,760
one hundred and sixty thousand dollars speedboat.

751
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,560
He stole money and used it on a speedboat.

752
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,680
You can't be like mad at that expensive.

753
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,680
One hundred and sixty.

754
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,400
I don't know how much boats cost, but one hundred sixty thousand dollars

755
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,720
seems like a lot for a speedboat.

756
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,000
But that's just I don't know maybe what I'm talking about.

757
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,120
Extra speedy, I hope very fast boat you can buy with four hundred sixty thousand.

758
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,840
And then you see that.

759
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,800
Oh, go ahead.

760
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,840
I was just because I also I don't know, Scott, if you saw this

761
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,200
and I couldn't find any footage or pictures to confirm this,

762
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,320
but we're probably going for the same thing. Yeah.

763
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,920
Prince played WWF New York.

764
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,840
Princeton, like an after show.

765
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,800
He did a regular concert at a regular venue

766
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,600
and then showed up at the WWF New York at midnight and played till two.

767
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,320
And you see that guest list that's insane.

768
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,680
Alicia Keys, Questlove, George

769
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,160
Larry Graham and Doug E.

770
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,480
Fresh. Not even the main concert.

771
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,400
This is just like I'm tossing this shit off. Who cares?

772
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,320
Right. This unbelievable.

773
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
There could have been like a Farouk and Bradshaw were doing a bit there.

774
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,600
Like hours before. Right.

775
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,080
And then Prince is jamming out with Questlove, which I mean, that sounds great.

776
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,240
Did you guys find information about Chris Angel, the mind freak?

777
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,880
He kind of like had a residency there, if you will.

778
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,680
We really there.

779
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,320
Oh, yeah. You guys did find that when it was called the world.

780
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,360
It switches its name. Right.

781
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,520
To the world, because I think they just want people to come in, you know.

782
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
They don't want people.

783
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,280
People are scared. Yeah.

784
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,720
Or not that they're scared of wrestling.

785
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,640
They just don't give a shit at that time.

786
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Right. The attitude there is over.

787
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,360
So they're not coming to see WV.

788
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,000
So they were all go to the world and they kind of get tricked into that.

789
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,480
You know what I'm saying?

790
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,320
But Chris Angel was like the face that place like doing shows and like,

791
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,240
yeah, whoa, whoa. No, yeah.

792
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,400
Yeah. I know that.

793
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,640
Gee, that baby.

794
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,680
Did you see him there? I did not.

795
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,560
I did not see them.

796
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,880
No. Were you into Chris Angel, though, at that time?

797
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,120
I was not. I'm not not into Chris Angel.

798
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,760
I just wasn't into Chris Angel.

799
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,800
OK, I'm saying we're we're kind of into Chris Angel and maybe we'll be

800
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,680
increasingly as time goes on, just as a little.

801
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,040
Chris Angel content coming to the podcast very soon.

802
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,280
Oh, incredible.

803
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,640
So we will we'll look into that more and do a follow up to if we can find

804
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,520
some more information about this.

805
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,200
Yeah, he did Mindfreak in 2001, two months after 9 11.

806
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,520
It was an off Broadway thing.

807
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,880
And then he like this.

808
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, that was it was the beginning of it being like a legitimate theater

809
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,080
that did other stuff besides wrestling.

810
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,160
Wow, crazy.

811
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,840
A theater in the round.

812
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,800
It was apparently. Wow.

813
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,880
Geez. Wow.

814
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,680
So he likes his close up magic.

815
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,560
So you're allowed the intimacy is maybe the appeal of this place.

816
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,360
I talked to my friend Tommy Blacha, who was an attitude era writer,

817
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,960
and he worked on like he like he did shows at this venue.

818
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,040
And he said the thing that he liked about it was the intimacy,

819
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,560
that it was like a different vibe than than a big arena.

820
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,120
But, you know, it does sound like the theming leaves something to be desired.

821
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,200
So that that overrides the other, I'd say.

822
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,760
Yeah, they had another they had a place called WWF for WWF Niagara Falls as well.

823
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
Yes, I did not go to that.

824
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,680
And I was going to ask, because you overlap with when that closed,

825
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,440
I think, in the company.

826
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,880
But it does. So was that in Canada or like in that it was in like the States

827
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,440
or Canada part of Niagara Falls that I never went to because I went there

828
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,400
like from Toronto, I went there.

829
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,360
So I was I ended up in like a like a gastropub kind of place

830
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,760
that I didn't know at the time is the space that was the

831
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,480
this Niagara Falls restaurant.

832
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,960
That wasn't a was it a restaurant or just a like a like a merch store?

833
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,680
Oh, you're right. Yes, it was not a restaurant.

834
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,360
It was. They did away with that.

835
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,040
They did have a ride called the Piledrive. Exactly.

836
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
They had a ride. Yes.

837
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,960
A drive. A tower ride.

838
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,600
WWE ride.

839
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't think it was as themed as the Tower of Terror.

840
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,600
More like a Doctor Doom, I would say.

841
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,320
One of those do style.

842
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,600
I don't think it was even a doctor do.

843
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,680
Yeah. Yeah.

844
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,800
So you've got the logo, WWE logo at the top of it.

845
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,640
And then it says Piledriver in some of the ugliest font.

846
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,920
Yeah. Pile. Huge driver.

847
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,600
Much smaller. Why?

848
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,520
And then there's a picture of John Cena and Batista.

849
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,440
Now think about this theming wise that like a scary ride.

850
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,000
And then there's a picture of John Cena crossing his arms.

851
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,800
Or maybe you'll see like the rock around the corner looking mean at you.

852
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,680
What does it tell you about the right?

853
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,240
Like you're going to when you get up here, maybe those guys will be there.

854
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,720
And maybe they'll rough you up a little bit before you get on there.

855
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
Maybe they'll be up at the top of the tower.

856
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,880
They'll swing down and knock you in the head a few times.

857
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,040
What does this mean? Yes. That's the story of this ride.

858
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,520
Yeah. I don't know if there's any theming.

859
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,920
I don't know if like you can get immersed.

860
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,760
You know, you definitely drop into a gift shop. You have to. Right.

861
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,600
Well, yeah, that's a choice. Yeah.

862
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,960
I started a gift shop, too.

863
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,760
If you're doing a giant drop and it's called the Piledriver

864
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,040
and the Piledriver is a move that where the person takes the move on their head.

865
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,840
That's the way a move goes.

866
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,120
So it's like even if it was like lightly themed and like they flipped

867
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,560
the chairs over and you.

868
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,280
What if the ride car was like Jerry Lawler with his legs spread

869
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,240
and you were upside down and gave you a pile drive?

870
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,280
Well, no, that's a better idea.

871
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,520
Or it could be like a tombstone pile driver is Undertaker themed.

872
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,960
That's yeah.

873
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,800
I mean, what? Yeah, it was like a giant sort of like he's on the side

874
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,240
of the vehicle, basically, like it's if I was like that.

875
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,800
And then he's like his arms are the restraints.

876
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,280
Oh, there you go. See, now you're talking.

877
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,320
Yeah, he's hugging everybody, basically upside down.

878
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,080
That's what I like to think of the Undertaker's tombstone

879
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,240
Piledriver is he's giving you an upside down hug.

880
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,560
So, yeah, there's all the they could have done something.

881
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,720
I mean, look, these ideas are much better, obviously,

882
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,400
but I think they were struggling to even open the place.

883
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,760
I watched a video about it.

884
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,960
I think it was Expedition theme park that said that they opened it.

885
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,400
It wasn't it was like wasn't working on opening day, like where they did

886
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,400
the big press event and all the wrestlers came.

887
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,680
So that was screwed.

888
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,360
And then some safety board shut it down immediately.

889
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,840
Like there were just permits they forgot to get.

890
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,000
So it was just sitting there not operating for a long time.

891
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,480
And then this facility closed entirely,

892
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,960
but they didn't have the money to demolish the ride.

893
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
So it was or the take the sign off.

894
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,360
So you'd look at, whoa, a ride, the Piledriver.

895
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,080
And there would be no way to get to it or to do it.

896
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,560
Just rusting away for several years.

897
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,880
Wow, because there's so look, there would be an Undertaker ride

898
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,400
of some kind would be incredible.

899
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,480
It's obviously got to be a dark ride.

900
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,880
Like a haunted mansion style.

901
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,560
Yes. And it's got to do that.

902
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah, it's got to go through the history.

903
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,840
The like, you know, fantastic.

904
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,800
For so many years, I've heard there was going to do

905
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,240
there's going to be some sort of collaboration

906
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,320
at Halloween Horror Nights.

907
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,280
Whether it be like an Undertaker or like a Bray Wyatt or something.

908
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,120
There was an Undertaker maze.

909
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,320
Really? Yeah, there's a video.

910
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,080
There's a video of it. I can look it up real quick.

911
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,480
But they did do a little something. It's a while ago.

912
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,040
But that's yeah, I don't know why there was they didn't do more of that.

913
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,520
Let me see there. Yeah, I mean, they have the partnership, right?

914
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,480
So why not do something?

915
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,240
Very close partners. Yeah.

916
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,320
Yeah. And Bray Wyatt would have been perfect, too.

917
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,720
Yeah. Yeah. They've got enough on that.

918
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,360
Yeah, that's true.

919
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,560
Well, yeah, they could do the character, I guess.

920
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,520
So off topic, but kind of on topics as we're talking about

921
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,840
theme restaurants and wrestling.

922
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,720
When you guys went to Japan a couple years ago,

923
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,000
did you guys go to Rivera Steakhouse?

924
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,280
This is a no, but I should have.

925
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,120
I know. I know.

926
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,280
I've heard of this.

927
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,040
Because this is, in my opinion,

928
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,920
the best wrestling restaurant, best wrestling theme restaurant.

929
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,960
It's really not even like supposed to be a theme restaurant.

930
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,880
It's a restaurant that all the wrestlers go to have been going to for years.

931
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,400
Yeah. But it's now like a tourist destination spot.

932
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
So like you, you'd be right up your alley.

933
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,880
You would love it. Like outside, you see like these photos.

934
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,560
You know, it says Rivera Steakhouse is all like, you know, John Cena is out front.

935
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,000
You know, and then when you get inside, it's just literally the ceiling as well.

936
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,080
Wall to wall, just old eight by tens,

937
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,640
pictures of the guys in Rivera Steakhouse.

938
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,520
And what the gimmick is, or so I've been told,

939
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
I've been there a couple of times when you go in,

940
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,400
they'll like adjust the photos to make sure your photos on the wall.

941
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,000
Like if they know you're coming.

942
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,480
Wow. So if I'm coming, they'll put my photo on and I leave.

943
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,560
They take it down.

944
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,040
You know, like the guys, like the icons, Sting, Hogan, Undertaker,

945
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,320
they're always up.

946
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,280
But a guy like me, oh, he's coming out.

947
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,520
They heard through the grapevine.

948
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,640
I'm coming. They'll put me up.

949
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,280
So I come up, oh, look, I'm on the wall.

950
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,320
You know, but then when I leave, it's good, though.

951
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Yeah, that is. Hey, we're not getting pictures.

952
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,880
So you see that when you went.

953
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,200
Did you see your photo when you were there?

954
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,560
Oh, of course. Yeah. Wow.

955
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,280
Was it was prominently like was it by where you were eating?

956
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,960
No, I wouldn't say it was prominent, but it was there.

957
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,360
It's a very small, intimate setting.

958
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,600
It's incredible. And they're they're big.

959
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,120
I guess souvenir. We're all into souvenirs, right?

960
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,440
Is the Rivera Steakhouse jacket?

961
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Because if you read like old wrestling magazines,

962
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,920
like the 80s and 90s, everyone would be wearing this Rivera

963
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,000
Steakhouse jacket.

964
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,560
So when I went for the first time, like, you know,

965
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,600
I needed to get that Rivera Steakhouse jacket.

966
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,000
So luckily, I've been there three different times.

967
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,720
I have three different jackets.

968
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,360
And of all the junk I have, whether it be things I've collected

969
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,360
or things of myself, those are like my pride and joy.

970
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,840
I couldn't get rid of those things because like I have the jacket.

971
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,960
I have three of them.

972
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,080
Yeah, that's yeah.

973
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,680
I look that's one of those things I was like, why didn't we go there?

974
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,520
Here's here's some of the pictures of the Jack different jackets.

975
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,640
Here's look at the look at the Undertaker with that jacket.

976
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,000
Can I say I got to send you a picture of me, Sina?

977
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,240
Well, I think I don't know if Punks in the picture,

978
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,280
but there's a picture of all of us wearing the jacket.

979
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,600
Yeah, here's here's Undertaker on the jacket.

980
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,720
Yeah, this is very I was picturing sort of like steakhouse like

981
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,680
a coat, fancy coat style.

982
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,920
You see me? Oh, it's here.

983
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,960
Oh, here. Yeah.

984
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
Whoa. You.

985
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,120
Wait, who else is in here?

986
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,800
Jericho, Justin Roberts.

987
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,480
That was my first time.

988
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,600
That's when I popped my my chariot, Robert.

989
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,600
Wow. It's yeah.

990
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,640
It's a it's like a rite of passage.

991
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,320
Oh, yeah. It's such a rad, like shiny 80s feeling jacket.

992
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,800
That's a jacket you wear, Scott.

993
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,920
Yeah, it's like the jacket.

994
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,440
I like the Carl Wilson war in the Beach Boys.

995
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,720
I think those jackets are back in style.

996
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,720
Like that style, like that satin jacket,

997
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,720
and it's like chalk line and nerds clothing all bringing it back.

998
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,160
Oh, look at this photo.

999
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,160
This is black with red stripes that.

1000
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,120
Oh, jeez. Yeah, this rules.

1001
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,320
Yeah, this is on the this is next time we go.

1002
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,560
This is the top of the list.

1003
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,600
You got to go now.

1004
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,520
I don't know if you're able to buy a Ribera, like if you're just a fan.

1005
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,960
Oh, interesting. You know what I'm saying?

1006
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,760
I think it has to be given to you from the back.

1007
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Wow. So they have so so they might not just sell it.

1008
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,280
They it's literally they only make so many for now.

1009
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,520
Don't quote me on that.

1010
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,480
Don't quote me on that.

1011
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,320
But like, I don't know of any fans who have walked in and gotten one.

1012
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,040
Now, maybe they bought one off like Virgil, who was selling it or something.

1013
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,520
You know, but sure. Yeah, right.

1014
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,720
Why did this why did this connection form?

1015
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,880
Why did why did it become a wrestler hotspot?

1016
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,640
It was just like a place that they went to when they were in Japan.

1017
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,640
They'd be over there and they just took to to it was like a mutual love and respect.

1018
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,000
You know, wow. Wow.

1019
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,360
Let's be honest. It's no club 33 style steak.

1020
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,120
You know, it's not it's not the best steak in the world,

1021
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,880
but it's the environment, the atmosphere.

1022
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,240
And that's what we we love all that stuff, right?

1023
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,520
That's where that's why we go to these theme parks for the atmosphere and to be immersed.

1024
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,560
Yeah, the food sucks. The food sucks.

1025
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,240
I'm not saying it sucks. It's just not the best.

1026
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,320
Sure, sure. Sure.

1027
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,440
Yeah, great.

1028
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,600
Well, maybe we'll make an exception if they're like a podcast.

1029
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,080
They like podcasts there.

1030
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,520
Because like, you know, maybe they like American podcasts.

1031
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,240
I found the clip of Undertaker at the press conference.

1032
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,920
This is the year 2000 when there was an Undertaker on at house.

1033
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,360
Honoring the Undertaker's achievements in horror.

1034
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,480
After 10 years of being in the World Wrestling Federation and being the Undertaker,

1035
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,960
it's I'm quite proud of this.

1036
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,240
You know, it lets me know that people outside of our business

1037
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,800
kind of appreciate what it is, the Undertaker.

1038
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,480
So there he is.

1039
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,840
He's getting he's getting an award from the Bride of Frankenstein.

1040
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,800
And wow.

1041
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,440
And he is in his American badass face.

1042
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,400
Right. American badass is a rolling face.

1043
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,120
Exactly. He's in the biker outfit, but he's he's

1044
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,560
greeting the supernatural Undertaker.

1045
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,680
Yeah. So then he he goes through this is the haunted house

1046
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,640
that they had at Universal in 2000.

1047
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,960
So these are some of the things you would see, like there's a,

1048
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,080
you know, there's a guy dressed as a vampire.

1049
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,280
He's a guy dressed as Kane there.

1050
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,960
This is incredible. I had no idea about this.

1051
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,560
Yeah, I didn't know until a couple of years ago.

1052
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,880
So I don't remember this guy being here, but.

1053
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,800
So he's trying to play.

1054
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,160
He's trying to play along like he goes, Oh, yeah, this is my life.

1055
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,680
This house is my life.

1056
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,600
Yeah, he grew up.

1057
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,640
He grew up like this.

1058
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,280
He grew up in a house with perpetual smoke and spider webs.

1059
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,320
And that's why he's the Undertaker. Exactly.

1060
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,480
To the American bad.

1061
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,400
They had a bleep bass, huh?

1062
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,600
Yeah, I could say. Yeah.

1063
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,520
You need to come back.

1064
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,680
Brings back a lot of memories of a time in my period with my soul.

1065
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,120
Was that his darkness?

1066
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,200
He's talking to like a doppelganger of himself currently. Exactly.

1067
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,760
Yeah. And he's like, Oh, yeah.

1068
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,440
The cameraman tilted down to the purple gloves.

1069
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,720
That's like a 94 style Undertaker.

1070
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1071
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,040
And then under because really, this is a great performance by him.

1072
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,240
He's just like, Yeah, I've been there.

1073
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,240
Yeah.

1074
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,240
Dead man walking.

1075
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,600
Yeah. And then I think there's a McFauley here.

1076
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,720
There's the hell of it.

1077
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
So they have a hell in the cell spot.

1078
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,800
That's awesome, actually.

1079
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,280
These look like the hell in the cell with me and Shawn Michaels.

1080
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,920
So there you have it.

1081
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,840
So, yeah, so they I think it ended with a hell in the cell.

1082
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,520
So, yeah, I don't know.

1083
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,160
That's the last time they did something like that, but it shouldn't be the last.

1084
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,960
You know what I said about how I want a celebrity

1085
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,400
restaurant to feel like you're going inside their brain and like how Alan Hale,

1086
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,960
I think, feels that way a little bit because there's a merchant.

1087
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,440
It's the sea and he's there.

1088
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,720
This feels like that.

1089
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,520
I love a maze themed after one guy and like, let's jumble up all his memories

1090
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,120
and like you're you're like all his whole life is flashing before your eyes.

1091
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,440
That's really good.

1092
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,680
Yeah, it's great.

1093
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,080
I mean, they're they're all anybody

1094
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,560
if you've been in W.W.F. or W.W.E.

1095
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,560
that you've had, you know, the history on screen.

1096
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,240
So I feel like you could do that with so many different

1097
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,480
of the characters or the performers over the years.

1098
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,840
Obviously, Undertaker was someone that leads itself to the horror maze the most.

1099
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,360
Sure. But I don't know, there's probably like a Steve Austin one.

1100
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,560
You know, it could be done.

1101
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,200
It could be done. Yeah, it could be.

1102
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,040
Not everything has to be scary now.

1103
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,480
You know, now you can walk through just like the movies and then it's not super

1104
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,960
scary. Some of these houses.

1105
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,680
Yeah. Do a sting sting one.

1106
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,440
That would be great.

1107
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,440
A sting with a crow.

1108
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,160
What about like a sting versus Undertaker like Freddy versus Jason style?

1109
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,240
I mean, it's fantastic.

1110
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,040
You could do a whole honestly, let's say like you do eight houses.

1111
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,360
It's true. I mean, I don't know.

1112
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,080
The audience for it, I think, is there, but maybe maybe I'm crazy.

1113
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,040
What about Mac Cardona maze?

1114
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,960
What are you doing if you get the shot?

1115
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,720
You know what? Let's do that, because because we're a little low on time.

1116
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,640
And I want to make sure we get to this spot.

1117
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,680
I want you. Yeah.

1118
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,480
Talk about what if you could do a restaurant themed experience just for you.

1119
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,960
Oh, wow. Your history.

1120
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,120
Oh, wow. As a professional wrestler.

1121
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,880
Man.

1122
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,240
That's that's a good question.

1123
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,160
I would definitely have a lot of memorabilia on the wall,

1124
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,040
way more than WF New York did a lot of action figures on the wall.

1125
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,800
Yeah. You know what?

1126
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,080
I went to I don't know if you guys are going to talk about it.

1127
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,680
I went to Jimmy Hart's restaurant.

1128
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,480
I forget the name. It was in Daytona Beach.

1129
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,440
Yeah. I went a couple of years ago with Chelsea and his restaurant

1130
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,360
is kind of like how my restaurant would be.

1131
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,560
I don't want to say rush.

1132
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,800
It's more like a bar.

1133
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,080
But Chelsea and I were looking for dinner and we saw like we were at

1134
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,160
like waiting outside for this this restaurant to let us in.

1135
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,560
We saw this shitty ass hotel and like on the side said Jimmy Hart's bar,

1136
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,960
whatever, whatever the bar was like, like Jimmy Hart,

1137
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,160
like the mouth of the South Jimmy Hart, like no fucking way.

1138
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,640
We walk in and sure enough,

1139
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,760
it's Jimmy Hart's bar.

1140
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,680
I got to send you guys some pictures and it was cool.

1141
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,920
There's a lot of memorabilia on the walls,

1142
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,920
a lot of action figures on the walls, right?

1143
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,920
And then there's a cardboard cutout of Jimmy Hart.

1144
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,200
So like, oh, Charles, you got to get a picture with this.

1145
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
So we take a picture.

1146
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,280
I shit you not.

1147
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,480
Chelsea with the cardboard cutout, Jimmy Hart and all of a sudden here.

1148
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,840
Oh, yeah, baby.

1149
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,400
And then Jimmy Hart comes out.

1150
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,160
The real Jimmy Hart.

1151
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,120
And then just take a picture with the real Jimmy Hart.

1152
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,040
It was the cardboard cutout on the real Jimmy Hart.

1153
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,920
So he was always like hanging out there probably. Yeah.

1154
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,240
And I think the bar has since closed down.

1155
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,320
I think now he does because now Hogan has his own spot or Hogan

1156
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,480
has had his own spot for years.

1157
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,840
But it's like, you know, it's a ball.

1158
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,560
And yeah, is that right in Tampa?

1159
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,400
And now I think Jimmy Hart does karaoke on Monday nights

1160
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,000
during raw at Hogan's bar.

1161
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,040
So I'm serious about that.

1162
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,320
That's you know, I believe it.

1163
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,840
Do you want to like a low key spot is what you're saying with memorabilia.

1164
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,480
You don't want something like giant.

1165
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,400
I mean, realistically, I don't think I could open up a spot in city walk.

1166
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,880
Like, let's be realistic.

1167
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,120
Like Big Dreamer. Sure.

1168
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,760
But blue sky. If we were blue sky in here.

1169
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,360
Like the major wrestling figure restaurant.

1170
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,840
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

1171
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,360
I would love something like that with action figures.

1172
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,120
Then we'd have exclusive action figures because listen,

1173
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,600
you guys know what that figment popcorn bucket.

1174
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,680
People want that exclusive item. Yeah.

1175
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,440
That's stuff you could just get on the website.

1176
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,200
You're not going to get a pro wrestling tease.

1177
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,040
You need some exclusive stuff.

1178
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,680
Yeah. Exclusive action figures, some meet and greets every once in a while.

1179
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,280
We have somebody in there.

1180
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,680
You know. Yeah. OK.

1181
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,880
What about like, yeah, the exclusive action figures would have like you're

1182
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,600
you guys, but wearing the Rivera jackets.

1183
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,160
Yeah. Or you know, we would do we would copy the Rivera style

1184
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,760
and make major wrestling figure podcasts, restaurant jackets,

1185
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,760
but look like the Rivera jackets.

1186
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,720
We would sell those.

1187
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,760
We make sure the fans are able to buy those. Yeah. You know.

1188
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,360
So and then, you know, we'd have cardboard cutouts of us.

1189
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,880
Like so like if we weren't really they could take pictures with it like WWE,

1190
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,280
WWE, the new cardboard cut.

1191
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,720
Like how easy would it have been for a fucking rock cardboard cutout?

1192
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,920
You take a picture next to the rock and it's not really the rock. Of course.

1193
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,720
So easy. Yeah.

1194
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,560
All those restaurants now have at least a step and repeat.

1195
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,880
We like take the picture for Instagram, you know.

1196
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,800
And now with the technology, like, you know, like what Disney does,

1197
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,120
like photo pass, they just Photoshop it in after.

1198
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,920
You know, it's a template. It's already there.

1199
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
Yeah, it's a good point.

1200
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,320
So so let's say where would you want it to go in City Walk?

1201
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,040
Oh, something out of City Walk.

1202
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,160
Cowfish needs to go.

1203
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,800
Look, you cowfish.

1204
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,200
Yeah, that's a big, that's a big lol.

1205
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,800
Is there some hatred toward cowfish?

1206
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,280
It's just kind of I had it once and it's kind of weird.

1207
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,800
I will say this, I moved to Orlando five years ago, a little over five years ago.

1208
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,760
But the year prior, I was coming down a lot,

1209
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,840
like looking for housing and where I wanted to live.

1210
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,000
So I would go to Calif.

1211
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,800
It's all time and I fucking loved it.

1212
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,040
I like like two of my favorite things, burgers and sushi combined.

1213
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,680
You know, I have a burger and great sushi.

1214
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,400
And over these past five years, every time I go, it gets worse

1215
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,720
and worse and worse.

1216
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,360
I'm always hoping that this is the time where it's going to turn around.

1217
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,520
Yeah, it never does.

1218
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,800
It never does. It's got to go.

1219
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,160
It's got to go.

1220
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,280
You're describing the arc of, I think, every restaurant

1221
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,680
we're covering this month.

1222
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,360
It happened every single time.

1223
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,520
They gear up for a big opening and then like, all right,

1224
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,240
well, the boss ain't showing up anymore.

1225
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,680
So maybe trim some of those expensive ingredients.

1226
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,520
We want to go home early. Right.

1227
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,600
We're shutting down the kitchen 45 minutes early.

1228
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,480
It all feels like this happens with so many different places you go.

1229
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,640
It all feels like a con.

1230
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,600
It feels like truly like, let's see how like we'll do a lot

1231
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,040
for the six months or something or a year.

1232
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,120
And then let's just keep taking away and seeing how much we got,

1233
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,000
like how much money we can make while making the customers still like

1234
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,080
kind of think it's good to the point when it's just completely awful.

1235
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,880
And then they've made so much money

1236
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,240
off of just like the first year, the idea of how good it was the first year.

1237
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,200
I will say this hard rock at CityWalk in Universal in Orlando.

1238
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,400
My favorite place to go to always. That's my spot.

1239
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,520
Wow. Really? It's very reliable.

1240
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,720
It's very reliable. Yeah, very reliable.

1241
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,520
You know what you're going to get. Right.

1242
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,720
Listen, is the food the absolute best? No.

1243
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,920
But you know, you're going to get I think they have great chicken

1244
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,880
fingers, great chicken fingers.

1245
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,480
But the vibe is cool. It's a cool vibe.

1246
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,080
It's always packed. There's always music playing. Right.

1247
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,520
There's like guitars on the wall. Sure.

1248
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,960
You know, you get some drinks before the park.

1249
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,840
I love it. CityWalk.

1250
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,520
That hard rock is my go to 100 percent.

1251
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,160
Hmm. That's I don't think I've actually been to that hard rock to eat.

1252
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,920
So I'm a sucker for a hard rock.

1253
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,080
I'm a sucker for a hard rock.

1254
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,760
I see your heart. Do you have any hard rock shirts and merch?

1255
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,440
I do have a couple. Yeah, I'll cut them up.

1256
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,680
Wearing the gym, you know, but nothing crazy.

1257
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,720
OK, no, no, no denim jacket or anything.

1258
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,840
No, no, no, no denim jacket.

1259
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,760
No. And then honestly, I have not been to Planet Hollywood

1260
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,080
in Disney Springs, so I can't even say it was good or bad.

1261
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,520
You know, I know they redid it.

1262
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,720
They renovated it. Right.

1263
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,200
I know professional wrestler QT Marshall, his boots are hanging up in there.

1264
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,080
Oh, really? Yeah, he used to work there for years.

1265
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,640
Wow. Wow.

1266
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,120
He used to work there for years.

1267
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,120
And they just had a big ceremony a couple of months ago where he went.

1268
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,360
I think I don't know if it's his trunks, too, but definitely his boots are on display.

1269
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,200
I think next to like Dorothy from Wizard of Oz is like shoes.

1270
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,160
Wow. QT's boots.

1271
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,040
I absolutely dream. Right.

1272
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,240
Yeah, that's that's there we go.

1273
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,840
They should put that on the menu where you can you can get QT's boots

1274
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,600
full of a milkshake and cakes on top.

1275
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,840
Slurp out of QT's boots. Yeah.

1276
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,120
I think that that's great.

1277
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,000
So so I'm so yeah, you'll be a crowd.

1278
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,440
You'll be in the cow fish.

1279
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,680
The major wrestling figure podcast restaurant.

1280
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,120
Well, like I said, we're going to do a pop up bar in New York City in May.

1281
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,760
You guys should come down.

1282
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,200
We'll go have a drink at that Hard Rock, which was WF New York.

1283
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,720
Well, that could be our pregame.

1284
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,600
We'll go because we're going to we're going to a spoiler alert.

1285
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,760
We're going to call it major wrestling for your podcast, New York.

1286
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,520
You know, that's great.

1287
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,320
And we're going to play off the same logo.

1288
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,160
It's going to be a pop up.

1289
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,120
They put a little banner outside. Wow.

1290
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,360
But we're going to do some drink menus, but we're going to have some real menus,

1291
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,200
like some real like like what WF should have had.

1292
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,080
Obviously, we're going to theme towards ourselves.

1293
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,600
Of course, at my wedding, I fucking had the the major Margarita.

1294
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,840
Wow. Yes.

1295
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,920
And Chelsea Green had the hot mess martini.

1296
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,240
Oh, wow. Did you make it a specific?

1297
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,120
Did you like taste it before and say, like, no, I wish I did, because listen here,

1298
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,640
they fucked up the martini because we like vodka martinis.

1299
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,920
They made them gin.

1300
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,000
Hmm. Oh, listen, I'm all about the I'm just like you guys.

1301
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,760
I'm all about the gimmicks.

1302
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,000
You're talking to the guy right now who had wedding exclusive action figures.

1303
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,200
OK, I've really I've seen these.

1304
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,720
Yes. A mutual friend of ours had them and I saw them.

1305
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,040
Yes. You were what?

1306
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,800
What was it? It's of me and Chelsea Green.

1307
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,880
So they're called micro brawlers.

1308
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,960
I have it right here, actually.

1309
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,520
So I don't have them in the package here, but, you know, so they already made us.

1310
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,200
So I was able to get them repainted, right.

1311
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,240
And like a nice traditional white and gold.

1312
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,720
So, for instance, my my buttocks, my my gear usually says always ready,

1313
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,880
but it says just married on the back and hers.

1314
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,520
Usually says hot mess, but it says, guess what?

1315
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,920
Just married and in the package, it says like wedding exclusive.

1316
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,680
So the fans who might not necessarily be fans of us,

1317
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,200
but collect this style of figure knew I was making these

1318
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,320
and was like sliding into my DMS, like trying to get them early.

1319
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,520
So now they're not for sale.

1320
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,560
These are for my friends and family at the wedding.

1321
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,800
And I'll pay anything.

1322
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,200
I said, OK, thousand bucks.

1323
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,400
Listen, a lot of people paid it.

1324
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,600
A lot of a lot of people paid it.

1325
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,720
So then at the wedding, people were like so drunk or like didn't know

1326
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,480
what's going on, like in their gift bags.

1327
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,520
They didn't. That's where these wedding brawlers were.

1328
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,360
They didn't take them.

1329
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,560
So, of course, I took them all took them all home and I sold them afterwards.

1330
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,160
I made so much money off these goddamn wedding brawlers.

1331
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,200
I recommend everybody make wedding

1332
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,040
exclusive wrestling figures for their wedding.

1333
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,720
Wow. Look, I'm getting married and this is now shot to the top of the priority list.

1334
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,800
Right. And the wedding is exclusive something. Right. Yes.

1335
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,440
Yeah, this is not to be a micro brawler, to be anything like something you like.

1336
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,080
Maybe what is was a podcast to ride microphones or microphone?

1337
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,080
You know, the mic box, you know, the square.

1338
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,240
I think that could do something.

1339
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,360
Puppets something a puppet of me or something.

1340
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,520
A puppet of Lindsay and maybe. Yeah, something. All right.

1341
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,560
I think you should.

1342
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,680
I'd like if you acknowledge my favorite thing in your collection,

1343
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,160
which is the Ninja Turtle with the big tail that looks like a penis.

1344
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,480
So I'd like I would like a mic in a wedding tux and hat.

1345
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,200
But with no pants and whatever you want to do with that, if you want.

1346
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,200
You want me to have a turtle penis?

1347
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,840
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, that's where I'm heading.

1348
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,160
Yeah, we learned that the turtle's tail is also its penis.

1349
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,920
Well, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.

1350
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,640
If you had a giant one of those at your wedding, that could be the weenie of the wedding.

1351
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,280
All right. Everyone.

1352
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,960
And you got to have a step and repeat so everyone can get, you know,

1353
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,640
a photo next to the weenie.

1354
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:26,360
It's really driver is really drawn to that weenie, to that giant turtle weenie.

1355
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,960
Now, would you invite our friend John Morrison to your wedding?

1356
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,280
Yeah. Oh, yeah. He's in.

1357
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,040
Well, he invited you to his wedding.

1358
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,560
That's where we first met.

1359
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,800
That is true. We talk about this the first time you do the show.

1360
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,920
Yeah, we met at our friend John's wedding

1361
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,120
and we started arguing about theme parks.

1362
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,520
And you asked me what the best ride, I believe, in the Magic Kingdom was.

1363
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,480
And I just wanted to clarify, you meant Disney World and you said,

1364
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,040
it's not called Magic Kingdom at Disneyland.

1365
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,000
And I would say I would say there was a little bit of hostility, it sounded like.

1366
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,600
And then I said, well, drunk.

1367
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,920
Sure. It was a wedding, of course.

1368
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,360
I was I wasn't mad. I thought it was funny.

1369
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,760
And then you and then I said, well, there are there's material

1370
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,640
that does refer to Disneyland as Walt's Magic Kingdom.

1371
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,840
So I just wanted to make sure.

1372
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,440
And then you think you just said Space Mountain like angrily.

1373
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,640
Right. Like Space.

1374
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,360
John was at my wedding and he left for a period of time.

1375
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,440
Like where John go?

1376
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,760
He went to his hotel room, came back and he had elbow pads on

1377
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,040
and knee pads under his suit so he could break dance.

1378
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,280
So if you invite him to the wedding, he might steal the show.

1379
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,520
I had he I yes, he danced at his what he danced a little bit.

1380
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,160
Is his wedding, I think.

1381
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,400
Yeah. And he is a he does a lot of aerial tricks.

1382
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,800
He does do like a lot of parkour, a lot of parkour.

1383
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,960
Yeah. Oh, there could be a theme.

1384
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,840
If you're if you're saying at my wedding, I could get John to do like a theme

1385
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,680
stunt show. OK.

1386
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
I think that's possible.

1387
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,080
Like, sure. I still like steel Lindsay, like the rings or something. Right.

1388
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,080
And then like John dressed as like a superhero comes in.

1389
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,920
I dig that. Yeah, we could do that.

1390
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,200
Hold on a second. Hold on.

1391
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,120
You're not the hero at your own wedding. No.

1392
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,600
We need some realism here. Come on.

1393
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,640
Well, I would, you know, I'll like I'll shout directions.

1394
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,720
OK. Sure. OK.

1395
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,480
So you're at the very least.

1396
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,040
You're the guy on the train going like you don't mess with Spider-Man.

1397
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,240
Well, I'd like to think it's like, you know, Ving Rhames is in the van

1398
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,320
and Mission Impossible, and he's helping Ethan Hunt.

1399
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,840
He's helping Tom Cruise. Right.

1400
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,440
He's not on the front line, but he is somebody is on the team.

1401
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,320
So I'll be on the team. I'll be shouting.

1402
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,480
I'll be like, get him. Stop him.

1403
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,680
Stop that thief.

1404
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,320
And then from a van from a van parked at the side of your wedding.

1405
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,080
Yes, exactly.

1406
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,040
It's going to be a very long completely off the rails here.

1407
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,320
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

1408
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,240
Well, but guys, don't hate me.

1409
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,720
I have to go. I actually have to go win a championship at the pack

1410
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,320
and then hopefully bring it to Disneyland in Paris, which,

1411
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,880
do you know, it's like 30 degrees there? Jesus.

1412
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,360
I thought it was going to be like nice weather in Paris.

1413
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,920
It's fucking cold.

1414
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,720
That was a lot of why I didn't like it.

1415
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,080
It was so bitter cold.

1416
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,080
Just the most frosty field.

1417
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,120
I was not.

1418
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,680
I didn't have the best feelings about it,

1419
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,320
but maybe the magical still poke through, especially if you show up with that belt.

1420
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,680
I don't know. I'm staying at that Marvel hotel.

1421
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,520
So I'm not necessarily a Marvel guy, but the Disneyland Hotel

1422
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,000
is close for renovation.

1423
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,160
Sounds like I might as well stay this Marvel one, I guess.

1424
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,480
It's got some theming, at least.

1425
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,400
So you hopefully I'm not a big Marvel guy, though.

1426
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,760
And I'm not a Marvel guy.

1427
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,440
It's not a Marvel guy. You know what I'm saying?

1428
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,200
But it's only kind of Marvel.

1429
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:45,120
So it's like the hotel New York presents the art of Marvel.

1430
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,760
It's the most boring music.

1431
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,160
Yeah, the most confusing several themes at once.

1432
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,640
OK, it's weird.

1433
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,480
So, yeah, I don't think it'll matter.

1434
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,240
But they do have a planet Hollywood that looks like the old Orlando one.

1435
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,680
It's the kind of like, yeah, that might be where I have to eat that.

1436
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,680
OK, old school. I dig that.

1437
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,880
Yeah, that yeah.

1438
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,720
I walked into some door there

1439
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,320
and a long enough time to see the mask from the mask

1440
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,000
and then be yelled at in French to get out of wherever I was.

1441
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,000
I was scolded at Planet Hollywood.

1442
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,200
But you can take them on.

1443
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,880
You can take any any French Planet Hollywood.

1444
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,960
Well, if I have my championship, I'll smash them with it.

1445
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,080
And if I don't, I'll and I'm screwed.

1446
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,880
I don't have to run out.

1447
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,120
Sounds like a plan.

1448
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,680
Hey, Matt Cardona, you survived podcast, the ride.

1449
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,440
Thanks for joining us.

1450
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,960
Let's let's exit through the gift shop.

1451
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,280
Is there anything other than all the stuff Mike said at the top

1452
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,200
that you would like to plug?

1453
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,480
Oh, man, listen, just the Mac Cardona.

1454
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,000
Follow me on social media, the major rest of our podcast.

1455
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,840
So I couldn't stay too long, guys.

1456
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,200
You know, I got championships to win.

1457
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,640
You know what I'm saying? You're everywhere.

1458
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,320
Pretty good excuse, I guess.

1459
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,400
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1460
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,880
You're tapping out, but we're we got a little more to come.

1461
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,840
So we'll continue.

1462
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
So I'm going to have to listen, though, which is cool.

1463
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,200
I you know, I already did my part about to listen to it.

1464
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,880
Yeah. So we then we have to make sure to not like shit talk during part two.

1465
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,840
Like, you know, I'm coming after you.

1466
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,280
OK, never mind.

1467
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,360
We'll see. We'll see if it's worth it.

1468
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,960
If the shit really good.

1469
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,000
But anyway, thanks for doing the show.

1470
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,960
Thanks, guys.

1471
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,960
Talk to you soon. Good luck.

1472
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,640
Well, guys, Matt is gone.

1473
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,440
And we are, of course, now recording this a few days after we had the interview

1474
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,040
with him. And I want to announce in case people don't know on social media,

1475
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,920
he has won the NWA World Title,

1476
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,360
National Wrestling Alliance World Title, and he is currently in Disneyland, Paris.

1477
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,880
Yes. And has achieved.

1478
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:49,000
Wow. And has taken a photo with the title in front of the castle.

1479
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yeah. That is available.

1480
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,120
Wow. He called it in the episode and it happened.

1481
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,000
That's incredible.

1482
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,080
So I am glad we waited a few days to take to do this

1483
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,040
so we could have confirmation that that happened.

1484
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,840
Look at this.

1485
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,480
We maybe like we've been talking about the PTR curse, but maybe.

1486
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,120
I mean, as has been said on Twitter, maybe it is the PTR blessing.

1487
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,120
Because look at this.

1488
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,320
We give Matt a little magic, goes and wins the title.

1489
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,440
Yeah. You have planet Hollywood, a little magic.

1490
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:18,800
And within the week of our episode, they are coming back in Times Square.

1491
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,680
And Matt has sent you photos in the Paris,

1492
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,600
the only remaining old school tacky and the same

1493
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,600
planet Hollywood on the planet.

1494
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,000
Yes, it is.

1495
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,760
Everything is coming together.

1496
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,120
Everything is connected.

1497
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,560
Everything is coming together.

1498
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,840
It's quite beautiful.

1499
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
Simulation buzz buzz.

1500
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:44,080
Yeah. And and also the planet Hollywood coming into coming to New York,

1501
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:49,960
three or four stories, stories two and three are the planet Hollywood.

1502
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,680
First story, 100 seat chicken guy.

1503
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,120
Yeah. Boy.

1504
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,920
Saw Squad will have representation at the new planet Hollywood.

1505
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,160
It is wild. Yeah.

1506
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,240
Overwhelming.

1507
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,760
Because, yeah, it's been a roller coaster.

1508
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,400
We heard like we kind of learned for the first time that it was defunct.

1509
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,960
The planet Hollywood, the current one in New York is defunct.

1510
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,440
Jason, I think, maybe knew before, but it was a shock at first.

1511
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,000
I figured it out during the episode.

1512
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,880
Yes. Yeah.

1513
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:17,320
So because they had been doing takeout and delivery.

1514
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,480
Yum, yum.

1515
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,520
Yeah, that's what you want. Yeah.

1516
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,800
Yeah. And I mean, I don't know if you guys saw this, but

1517
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:28,440
Dive is coming back on an actual submarine.

1518
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:32,320
Oh, wow. The 300 feet below the surface.

1519
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1520
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,800
You have to like you have to enlist.

1521
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,320
You have to. You have to be a Navy man.

1522
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,280
Yeah. Yeah. You got to be in the Navy to experience.

1523
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:45,520
Well, but was this diplomatic negotiations that caused like a Russian troop drawdown?

1524
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,760
It's like just bring back that if we can get going, we can.

1525
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,720
Yeah. Push back some of these.

1526
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,640
I when you say when you said that, when you said that you had enlist,

1527
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,240
I looked at Jason, I looked away back to you and I looked at him.

1528
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,160
And then Jason has turned like he's put a full sailor suit on

1529
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,160
and he's ready for Fleet Week, I guess.

1530
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,840
Reporting for duty.

1531
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,920
So I mean, it's a little sailor suit.

1532
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,200
I don't know if that's regulation with little shorts.

1533
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,560
It is a sailor suit with little shorts.

1534
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,640
Yeah. So it's and is the big lolly regulation.

1535
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,320
Are you given that?

1536
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,880
Oh, yeah. When you well, typically when you if you if if they assign you

1537
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,480
to the good ship lollipop, that is what what happens.

1538
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:31,400
Jason is admiral of the good ship lollipop.

1539
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,480
Oh, good ship lollipop. It is a sweet trip to the candy shop.

1540
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,400
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1541
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,760
Oh, boogie, boogie bugle boys will fall in line.

1542
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,600
By the way, to also keep tying things together.

1543
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,280
And, you know, like, OK, Matt, he left our episode. Yeah.

1544
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,640
To go win this title.

1545
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,360
And that's cool. But something that he missed out on was hearing

1546
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,800
one last piece of crucial info about

1547
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,480
WWE Times Square, which is that it used to be the Paramount Theater,

1548
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,680
which is around from the 20s to the 60s,

1549
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:10,360
where they hosted a lot of concerts from prominent acts, including

1550
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,320
the Dorsey Brothers.

1551
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,560
There we go. Jason's favorite band.

1552
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,920
Dorsey Brothers play were in the building.

1553
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:23,440
So, Matt, you didn't get to react to you didn't get that Dorsey Brothers.

1554
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,160
Oh, man. Which is the real title, I feel.

1555
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,240
Jason has changed into a different sailor suit now, hearing that news.

1556
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,240
It's more of a double breasted.

1557
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,040
Yeah, it's like a dress sailor suit.

1558
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,720
It's a dress. Yeah, it's formal dress. Yeah.

1559
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,200
And he's ready for a big band.

1560
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
So congratulations, Matt.

1561
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,720
I, you know, I feel like we gave you some fun before.

1562
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,200
We were able to help you take your mind off of things and you're welcome,

1563
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,040
you know, for for what we did for you.

1564
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,040
But now we keep plowing ahead because we can't miss these other

1565
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,920
yeah, like restaurants.

1566
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,040
There's incredible ones, especially because we switched to in person,

1567
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,920
which allows Jason now to show us this incredible artifact

1568
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,160
that he has in reality.

1569
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,640
Yeah, this is the full menu for the WCW

1570
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:18,880
Nitro Grill Las Vegas that was located in the Excalibur Hotel.

1571
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,080
And I just want to shout out listener Jason Query

1572
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,080
sent this to us.

1573
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:24,560
Whoa.

1574
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,760
A while ago. February 2020.

1575
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,000
I remember driving to the forever dog office to pick up some mail

1576
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:38,360
and I believe picking it up then in a balmy day in March 2020.

1577
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,720
And little did I know what awaited me after that from Wuhan.

1578
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,440
You started coughing as soon as you open the package.

1579
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,200
I mean, I have to think that was just coincidence.

1580
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,880
But yeah, WCW Nitro Grill, where the big boys eat.

1581
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,360
Where the big boys eat.

1582
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,160
Incredible. Jason was his name.

1583
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:56,560
Yeah.

1584
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,080
I'll say, OK, well, thanks, Jason, for that.

1585
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,560
It's wonderful seeing it in person and seeing a big thing.

1586
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,880
It is the menu itself is a big boy.

1587
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,440
That's tall. That is a way.

1588
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,400
This is not like some of these other that that WWE times square

1589
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,360
one looked a little chintzy and we've seen other ones that like,

1590
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,960
it's just a piece of paper.

1591
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,400
That's a mighty menu. It's great.

1592
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,960
This is here. I'll hand it to you.

1593
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,360
And thanks again to Jason Query for sending that.

1594
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,680
The only thing that I'd say it's lacking, I like hearing that

1595
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:28,000
that big boys tagline and maybe the pictures in the menu somewhere,

1596
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,360
because there are photos of the WCW stars at the time.

1597
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,080
The only thing that it's missing, as far as I'm concerned, is this great.

1598
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,040
Maybe you guys ran into it, I think, accompanied with that big boys tagline

1599
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,920
was, I mean, you tell me the wrestler, it's a bald guy.

1600
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,560
And he's he's making this face like, ah, and he's got a knife and a fork.

1601
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,880
He's ready to eat.

1602
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,040
This is a big boy who's ready to get eaten.

1603
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,000
That big boy is Bill Goldberg.

1604
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,480
Goldberg, Goldberg, a very big star from the WCW day.

1605
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,560
He's still in WWE wrestling.

1606
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,520
Yeah. Gearing up for a big match in Saudi Arabia this weekend.

1607
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,400
That is true.

1608
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,440
That is where he's going.

1609
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,240
So, yeah, he's he's prominently displayed.

1610
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,840
And he is the big boy.

1611
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,320
I think they're showing off.

1612
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,680
Which is very I don't want to bring the lead.

1613
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,040
There's also a hologram.

1614
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,000
There's a hologram sticker on the front of the cover.

1615
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,080
Like you would find.

1616
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,200
From WCW to NWO.

1617
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,920
It's like you switch back and forth.

1618
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,120
You're seeing both logos, it looks like.

1619
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,440
That's cool. Yeah.

1620
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,080
So the the big the big angle in the old days was the NWO, the New World Order,

1621
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,160
which was a group of I mean, the core was like Hall, Nash and Hogan

1622
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,720
when Hogan turned from a good guy to bad guy.

1623
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,000
And so there was a war going on

1624
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,240
and they were representing it in a hologram on the menu. Yeah.

1625
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,480
Just some background of this restaurant.

1626
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,720
This opened in May 1999 and closed in September of 2000.

1627
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:07,720
It was located at the Excalibur Hotel, which look, I love all the fine MGM resorts,

1628
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,120
MGM Casino Resort hotels in Las Vegas.

1629
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,840
But the Excalibur Hotel has some fucked vibes.

1630
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,320
Like there is a dark energy in the Excalibur.

1631
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,160
Don't disagree with you, but I also really like the Excalibur.

1632
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,360
Yeah, I always stopped by. Yeah.

1633
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,920
Yeah. And it was something in early 90s.

1634
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,960
My family and we'll do all episodes about it someday, I'd imagine.

1635
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,440
But like my favorite thing is that there's a weird little like it.

1636
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,600
So it's it's a castle if you've never been, obviously.

1637
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,200
And there's a big moat or lagoon in front of it.

1638
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,560
And I always like to point out to people that there's a little like thatch

1639
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,280
hut that implies that some little like hobbit guy would come out of it

1640
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,040
and lives there.

1641
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,280
And I found out that that was part of the lagoon show,

1642
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,160
like a phantasmic type thing in early 90s Vegas,

1643
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,760
family friendly days that they don't do anymore.

1644
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:02,640
So I'd love to know more about that show and what happened out of that hut.

1645
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:07,320
Yeah, I mean, that whole area that that and New York, New York, like lot

1646
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,080
and Luxor, especially a lot of good themed entertainment

1647
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,000
at their at the height of their powers.

1648
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,240
Yeah. New York, New York, I think of the budget ones is the one that I like

1649
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,960
to go walk around and hang out at. Sure. They've updated it. OK.

1650
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,720
It's not so set in time.

1651
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:27,120
The the ways that the Excalibur has updated have all been pretty trashy.

1652
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,280
I mean, no offense to the nitro grill, but I would I mean, I think trashy.

1653
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,640
They would proudly say it is trashy.

1654
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,040
And that might also be how they describe its eventual replacement.

1655
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:41,040
Dixlas, last resort, which is listed as open.

1656
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,840
On the Excalibur website currently, we were concerned that like,

1657
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,880
you know, all the Dixlas resorts were going.

1658
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,320
Dix closed in San Diego, which was a spot we would go once in a while

1659
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,800
during Comic Con over the years.

1660
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,360
And I don't know, have I ever said this piece of information

1661
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,480
that we learned when we were last last at Dix a few years ago?

1662
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,880
The name of the dog.

1663
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,480
Oh, you told me, but I don't remember it now.

1664
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,400
Maybe I haven't said this before.

1665
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,880
So Dixlas Resort is a place where they would they go.

1666
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,320
They insult you, basically.

1667
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,480
You put on it's like Ed Debevix or other places like that.

1668
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,040
They put a big like paper kind of hat on you and they write something.

1669
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,080
And probably as of a couple of years ago, most of the jokes were just like,

1670
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,560
this guy's gay. That was mostly the joke.

1671
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:27,360
Oh, you say as of a few years ago, a few hours ago,

1672
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,440
someone at the Vegas waiter at the Vegas scrawled that on somebody's hat.

1673
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,320
Right. So there is still free speech somewhere.

1674
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,520
Yeah. It's the last place for free speech in the country is Dixlas Resort,

1675
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,960
where you can just call people gay and hope to get a big laugh from it.

1676
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,480
But so there's like the character of like Dick and he has like a dog.

1677
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:52,600
And it's a very like, you know, Fritz, see the cat Fritz,

1678
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,680
the cat style art and the dog's name from Dixlas Resort is Aspite.

1679
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,760
There's some original.

1680
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,200
That's original.

1681
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,640
I think there's I think I have a tweet.

1682
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,400
It might be five years or six years ago.

1683
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,960
I think I had a tweet trying to get Dix on board with Jason

1684
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,760
to play Aspite in a movie or something. Yeah.

1685
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,840
But I don't they didn't respond.

1686
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,840
Dixlas Resort Films presents. Yeah.

1687
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,880
The least gay movie you've ever seen.

1688
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,200
Maybe that's not a good thing for Jason to be associated with now. Yeah.

1689
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,520
The homophobic restaurant.

1690
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,760
But this thing, though, I mean, the nitro grill vibe is so

1691
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:35,600
I mean, this is you guys could tell this must be in line with the vibe

1692
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,440
of the league in general, but it's such like it is intense,

1693
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,200
shaky fonts like, oh, yeah, yeah.

1694
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,120
How shaky can a still font on a menu be?

1695
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,680
And then it's all the food and items are revealed by

1696
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:56,000
it looks like they carved out of steel to make and like not well.

1697
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,520
And symmetrically, yeah, somebody took a chainsaw to reveal the menu items.

1698
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,960
It's it's really funny.

1699
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,680
It's really funny.

1700
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,760
And it's better like the WWF New York menu looks like a menu.

1701
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,120
Like it doesn't look that little least gives you the vibe of like the graphics

1702
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:12,600
you would have seen in the late 90s. Yeah.

1703
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,120
There's a very funny image of Hulk Hogan like doing a bicep curl.

1704
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,400
But he's just he's got a very tiny shrimp.

1705
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,720
He's bicep curling to get a shrimp to his mouth.

1706
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:29,080
Well, tiny in the like compared to him. Right.

1707
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,360
But that shrimp is huge for like imagine if that shrimp was in front of you.

1708
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,360
That's a mammoth shrimp.

1709
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,640
That would be as big as his mustache.

1710
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,320
It wouldn't be wouldn't give him a workout.

1711
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,440
But like, my God, that's that's really wild.

1712
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:46,560
And then he's wearing pants that are he's wearing Terminator pants and boot.

1713
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,760
Like it is lightning shooting up the pants.

1714
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,440
And then his boots have like Arnold's

1715
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,160
robot skeleton face.

1716
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,000
Yeah, that's geez.

1717
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,640
This is crazy. That's Hollywood. Oh, boy.

1718
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,640
I wrote down some of my favorite menu items because they went all out.

1719
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,200
They did name the menu items what you would think they would be named.

1720
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,840
So like the onion rings are called wrestling rings.

1721
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,560
OK, great. That's so much better than everything else.

1722
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,080
Yeah, this is of all the things we're talking about this month.

1723
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,880
This is the only one that did it right.

1724
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:24,680
I think every single thing has a stupid name.

1725
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,960
It's so great. Yes.

1726
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,440
Chicken fingers are called broken fingers.

1727
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,440
And if you would like really good, if you'd like them on a roll,

1728
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,200
that's called a broken finger sandwich.

1729
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:40,160
I'll have the broken finger sandwich is such a funny thing

1730
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,360
to say out loud to another person.

1731
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:46,680
Slappuccino instead of cappuccino.

1732
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,320
Violent act of sipping a cappuccino.

1733
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,760
Yeah. Ring side salad.

1734
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,920
Pretty good. Pretty good.

1735
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,480
T-bone steak after Booker T.

1736
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
It's the Booker T.

1737
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,560
Booker T.

1738
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,800
Bone steak. Yeah.

1739
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,480
Penne pile up.

1740
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,800
Penne pile up on the list of power plant.

1741
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,600
Power. Yes.

1742
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,000
The power plant is where like guys would train or guys and girls would train.

1743
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:20,560
Yeah. Like they go from the range of specific like names of wrestlers

1744
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,520
to just general stuff like, you know, they have the Booker T.

1745
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,080
Bone, but then they also just have big boy brownie,

1746
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,200
which is where the big boys eat.

1747
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,120
Yeah, of course.

1748
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,720
We're all big boys.

1749
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,800
Heavyweight hot fudge Sunday.

1750
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,880
Cheesecake Uncensored.

1751
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,800
Uncensored was one of their pay-per-views.

1752
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,680
Some of them are paid.

1753
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,560
Some of them are named after pay-per-views.

1754
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,440
Some of them. Yeah.

1755
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,000
Spring Stampede Sirloin.

1756
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,240
Some of them named after wrestlers and some just named after violent acts.

1757
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,880
They're not all home runs.

1758
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,880
The Cho Cold Chili, I thought was an interesting choice.

1759
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,760
Usually a restaurant you want to avoid just the

1760
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,520
like bringing up the idea of choking.

1761
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,640
Specter that hangs over.

1762
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,640
But it's pretty good still.

1763
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:02,960
It's pretty good. Yeah.

1764
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,080
I like the one that requires capitalization to make it work,

1765
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,280
which is that's a diamond cut kind of where the stakes are.

1766
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,600
And that's a

1767
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,920
broken rib, black eye.

1768
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,200
That feels like reverse.

1769
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,000
Like, shouldn't you capitalize the crazy broken rib, black eye?

1770
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,280
Not vice versa.

1771
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,040
I think that's right.

1772
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,080
But I love it. They got to amend it to make it work.

1773
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,280
They have on the burgers.

1774
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,640
The burgers are all funny.

1775
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,040
But I think my favorite.

1776
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,320
Well, I should I'll say the other ones.

1777
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,400
They have like Sting Burger.

1778
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,600
Well, that's like in the way of Sting's career.

1779
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:46,400
That the waiter just lingers in the rafters above the restaurant

1780
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,800
looking at you for a long time and then finally brings the burger

1781
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,880
at the end of the meal. Sting, I think we've said it.

1782
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,800
I think I've said this in the podcast before, Scott.

1783
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,720
So Sting was a wrestler. He had a little face paint.

1784
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:59,400
He was almost kind of like a surfery kind of guy, like a real baby face,

1785
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,720
as they say. And he would.

1786
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,160
And then all of a sudden, the crow came out.

1787
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,360
And I believe Dusty Rhodes was just like, we should just do that.

1788
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,800
And he just put the crow makeup on.

1789
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,840
Wow. And Sting became the crow Sting, which everyone Sting is great.

1790
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,600
He's still around. He's still wrestling.

1791
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,760
He's in AW now.

1792
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,200
But yeah, did the crow just did the crow.

1793
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,000
That's that's some of the great wrestling stuff of all time.

1794
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,320
As we're just one of the bookers like, hey, you know, we should just do

1795
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,040
that thing in the movie I just saw.

1796
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,000
I think Dusty Rhodes is the biggest culprit of that, where it was just like,

1797
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:28,960
I was watching a movie.

1798
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,520
I was watching a movie last night.

1799
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,920
And then like, here's what we should do.

1800
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,040
Do Austin Powers. Yeah.

1801
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,760
So, oh, man, did Dusty ever do an Austin Powers game?

1802
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,440
I'm not sure.

1803
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,560
So so they have Sting burger, Hogan burger, Thunder burger,

1804
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,640
which was the name of one of the shows, Thunder.

1805
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,920
But then they have the DDB.

1806
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,800
Oh, baby. The Diamond Dallas burger,

1807
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:00,040
which smothered in Cajun spices, which I just I keep saying,

1808
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,360
like they hit all of the things.

1809
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,880
Some of them are like kind of clever.

1810
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,160
Some of them don't really make sense.

1811
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,160
And some of them are like clunky like this.

1812
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,520
Yeah. Diamond Dallas burger.

1813
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:12,400
DDP. There's got to be a different thing that could be diamond down.

1814
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,480
Like Diamond House Page is the name of the guy, the wrestler.

1815
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,640
So DDP. So sure.

1816
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,600
But DDPs like a dish of peas.

1817
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,640
That could be that, you know, these peas.

1818
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,720
Yeah. I hate to give notes on a perfect menu.

1819
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,560
No David Arquette entree.

1820
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,400
Like no David Arquette nods.

1821
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,200
Well, when was it opened?

1822
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,360
Nineteen nine. So it was 99 to September 2000.

1823
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,120
And then all of the all of the, you know,

1824
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:46,560
intellectual property and shows and stuff for WCW, of course, in 2001,

1825
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,200
was sold to WWE.

1826
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,480
Right. But the Arquette.

1827
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:51,760
So so maybe I've said this before on the show.

1828
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,760
So, Scott, there's a movie called Ready to Rumble that came out in the year

1829
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,400
2000 with Oliver Platt and David Arquette.

1830
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,040
And it's promotion for the movie.

1831
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:06,200
David Arquette won the world title in WCW, which a very controversial

1832
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:10,120
moment. Fans very upset about it.

1833
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,280
It's like an honorary college degree.

1834
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,040
Yeah, that's not the same thing.

1835
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,440
He's of course, he's made a documentary recently about trying to earn back

1836
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,240
the respect of the fans for it from it, I should say.

1837
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,000
And pretty brutal documentary parts.

1838
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,840
Well, I was there.

1839
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,520
He wrestled a match against the guy that Cardona wrestled a death

1840
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,760
match against and almost died because he got cut on the neck and had to go.

1841
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,800
Luke Perry drove him to the hospital.

1842
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,200
What? Because his son was wrestling on the show.

1843
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,680
This is all in Highland Park.

1844
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,400
Like, oh, wow. The high hat.

1845
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,880
That's in Highland Park, right? Yeah.

1846
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,680
It's all the high hat.

1847
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:48,000
We're watching this go down and we're like, God, David,

1848
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,880
our cat's really taking a lot of abuse in this.

1849
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,120
And they're like, oh, is he bleeding badly from the neck?

1850
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,560
So I'm just saying the point is I don't think there was enough.

1851
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,640
Arquette wasn't there long enough to make the menu, but yeah,

1852
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,200
he should be on the menu. He's part of history now.

1853
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,360
Yeah, something's like char brats, char kit.

1854
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,120
Oh, perfect.

1855
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,080
Our cat broiled. Yeah.

1856
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,480
So so it would be we could make maybe make an insert

1857
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,600
and add some stuff we think should have been on here.

1858
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,200
So the char kit, I think for sure.

1859
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,160
Goldberg or two goldberg or great

1860
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,200
and crippler cross face cheese steak.

1861
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,560
Yes, that is that is a very dark one.

1862
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,360
That that move has been used by a lot of people.

1863
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,560
But look that up, folks, if you want.

1864
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:39,840
Yeah. So it's a it's a cheesesteak sandwich that could cripple you.

1865
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,000
Yeah. I mean, there's such a weird like just this picture

1866
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,760
of Kevin Nash on the menu with this awful looking cheeseburger in general

1867
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,600
that he's not holding.

1868
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,160
He's not holding. And it's no way it's that big.

1869
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,040
Yes, I don't think it's that big.

1870
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,000
No, it can't be that big.

1871
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,080
It's the same thing with the Hogan and the shrimp.

1872
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,240
Like the food is not mutant size, I don't think.

1873
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,280
We've seen pictures of this boys.

1874
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,640
Everything's 30 percent bigger. Yeah.

1875
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,560
So, man, springboard shakes,

1876
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,040
which is like springboard is like when you jump off the top rope,

1877
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,840
basically like you spring off the apron on the top rope.

1878
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:22,000
It's really like it's so it's so the opposite of what WWF New York did.

1879
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,240
And like whoever was in charge and like for some reason,

1880
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,760
this stuff isn't well documented.

1881
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,080
I'd love to know who was in charge.

1882
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:30,520
Who got to do this? Yeah.

1883
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:33,280
I had to think of all these. Well, this man on earth.

1884
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:39,120
The thing because I read a book by this writer, Bill Handstock,

1885
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:46,080
about the history of WWF last year, two years ago.

1886
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:54,360
And the I feel like the McMahons had a complex about wanting to be

1887
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,520
not even wanting to be old money, they just want it to be new money.

1888
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,120
So that's why the headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut.

1889
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,720
Oh, yeah. They wanted the respectability.

1890
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,680
Like they were making so much money there, like we should be respected.

1891
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,800
We should be have the respectability.

1892
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,680
And there is a sense of the WWE menu.

1893
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,720
It looks like a steakhouse menu,

1894
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,320
even though the contents are like Ruby Tuesdays.

1895
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,520
Yeah. What Tommy Blanchett said is that the food was actually not bad.

1896
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,200
And that the vibe in there was all right.

1897
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,000
He said he found it to be like on the wrestling scale,

1898
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:33,040
kind of a classy affair as opposed to Nitro Grill, which was like trash.

1899
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:35,680
But the but I think trash is what they're aiming for.

1900
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,960
Well, proudly and hitting Vince has always supposedly been

1901
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,400
anything you can see evidence of it has always been a little bit embarrassed

1902
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,640
by wrestling pro wrestling.

1903
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,960
That's why he changed the name to Sports Entertainment.

1904
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,800
As far as WWE and everyone's got to wear suits a lot behind the scenes.

1905
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,120
Yeah. And it's all like there's a there's a one of my most quoted.

1906
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,680
There's a movie called Beyond the Mat, which is a documentary

1907
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:01,040
that Barry Bloustein made where he follows like Terry Fung, McFowley.

1908
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,280
And there's a scene with Vince in the office and where Vince

1909
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,760
just and it's one of I say this maybe a couple of weeks.

1910
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:13,280
I go, oh, we make movies, which is something Vince says to the camera,

1911
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,280
which I think gives you his feeling.

1912
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,160
I think he always wanted to be more of like,

1913
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,680
I think Ted Turner and guys did a lot of different things,

1914
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,880
not just a wrestling guy. Sure. Sure.

1915
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:27,800
With, you know, the football league and the other thing, like his other endeavors.

1916
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,400
So I could see that maybe even being part of it.

1917
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,800
But maybe that's just totally a fluke that he was just like,

1918
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,920
because they eventually took the WWF off of it.

1919
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,520
And it was just the world.

1920
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,160
Yes. You could see like Vince, maybe he's just like, we're in the nightclub.

1921
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,600
We make nightclubs.

1922
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,400
We don't do wrestling anymore.

1923
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:48,600
Yeah. And even restoring that paramount, like archway, like does add

1924
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:52,280
like New York, New York, old society. Yeah. Right.

1925
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,200
Respectability. I was trying to find I couldn't find any clips,

1926
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:59,240
but I swore King Kong either climbs that or walks by it.

1927
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,680
And the Peter Jackson one.

1928
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,920
Like, yeah, I don't know.

1929
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,080
There was just a million.

1930
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,120
I mean, there was a million of those kinds of arts ways.

1931
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,920
Let's be frank of New York in the 30s.

1932
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,720
So they may have well CGI something like that.

1933
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,520
And that's that's one is recreated in various theme parks.

1934
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,920
I forget if that's the one.

1935
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,880
I don't know if it is at Universal Florida.

1936
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,960
I think one of the entryway, maybe into the arcade

1937
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,560
or right around that New York, the mummy area.

1938
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,280
Yeah. Unless there unless I'm wrong and it's the paradise,

1939
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,520
but it's one of those old school.

1940
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,480
And I think you see that paramount in in Race Through New York with Jimmy Fallon.

1941
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,200
I'm fairly certain.

1942
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,000
Yeah, I was thinking, too, this is something that, you know,

1943
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,920
A.W. has right now, the company, the wrestling company

1944
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,040
has a lot of like WCW influence in it.

1945
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:47,520
They've got some of the announcers, some of the old school feeling stings there.

1946
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,400
He's still in the crow makeup.

1947
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,800
Feels like something that a Tony Khan, who runs the league,

1948
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:59,080
could put somewhere around an A.W. restaurant with this type of menu.

1949
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,040
Mm hmm.

1950
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:04,680
They want to destroy the league with a single restaurant location.

1951
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,640
Yes. The drags down the entire operation.

1952
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,280
His father owns the Jacksonville Jaguars.

1953
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,520
So they have money. OK.

1954
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,920
Oh, so they've got one. They should.

1955
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,120
If you got money, then please waste it on it. Yeah.

1956
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,800
Yeah. At least a pop up.

1957
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,360
That might be the modern equivalent.

1958
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:24,000
It's less, you know, the rent on a themed entertainment menu.

1959
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,320
And it's more like a weekend long pop up food.

1960
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,040
Yeah. Like the Save by the Bell restaurant.

1961
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:31,080
And I said recently that the Doughboys had a A.W.

1962
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:34,600
announcer Excalibur on, who also does PWG out here.

1963
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,320
And Mitch tried to get, you know, get the Doughboys into A.W.

1964
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,440
I think he went about it the wrong way, saying they should be managers

1965
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,800
because Excalibur seem not interested in that at all.

1966
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:48,800
But what I would say right now to Tony Khan is three guys who do a podcast

1967
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,800
and have done a month about chain restaurants.

1968
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:55,760
We're the guys to help make the new menu for your eventual themed restaurant.

1969
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,560
Yeah.

1970
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,520
That's how we could insert ourselves into A.W.

1971
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,880
We're the restaurant guys.

1972
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,680
Practical. This is realistic.

1973
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,640
Yes. And we can steal.

1974
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,160
We're stealing it from Doughboys, who obviously are food associated.

1975
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,560
So we have a feud going too.

1976
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,600
That's good. We're coming in with a business plan and a feud.

1977
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,400
Yes. So anyone who knows Tony out there or Tony, if you're listening,

1978
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,920
we're the guys, we'll put together a menu for you.

1979
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,360
And let's make this happen, I think.

1980
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,760
Real quick, too, that we forgot to talk about the drink menu.

1981
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,120
Yes. Yeah.

1982
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,400
Which I like this.

1983
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:32,600
One of the first of all, one of the different headers here says fans

1984
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,280
with like a period after each letter, because it stands for frozen,

1985
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,040
all natural smoothies.

1986
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,040
Fans.

1987
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,160
Fans.

1988
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,120
There's a lot of flip.

1989
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:45,240
But like even that, like they could have just said smoothies

1990
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,840
and they went the extra mile to try to make it something else.

1991
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,200
The categories, they do everything.

1992
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:55,360
They find, they're finding the possibilities in every part of the menu.

1993
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,360
Exactly. And there's a Bam Bam Blitz named after Bam Bam Bigelow.

1994
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:04,480
There's the Nitro Chino, which is a slap a Chino and ice cream.

1995
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:08,120
So it's referencing a different part of the menu, which you have to appreciate.

1996
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,040
Callbacks, callbacks to the menu.

1997
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,200
Sharp shooters, which are shots.

1998
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,160
Sharp shooter is Bret Hart's submission finisher.

1999
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,840
OK. Brain freezers.

2000
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,480
Fear the spear.

2001
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,920
Fear the spear. That's Goldberg's finishing move.

2002
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,600
It was the spear. It would be basically a tackle.

2003
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,360
Jaeger Meister parrot, Bay Coconut, rum and pineapple juice.

2004
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,240
No, we should make fear this year.

2005
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,960
We should try fear the spears.

2006
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,360
We should do that. Yeah. Why?

2007
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,680
Look, if we have if I have the bachelor party, we should all at least

2008
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,200
recreate fear the spear in Vegas.

2009
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,520
At Dix.

2010
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,640
When we go to Dix in Vegas for the bachelor party,

2011
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,800
we're going to make the waiter in between him.

2012
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,840
Waiter, I need a shot of Jaeger, a shot of coconut rum, a shot of pineapple juice

2013
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,200
and an empty rocks glass, please.

2014
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,720
It'd be like, OK, well, hey, were you sucking each other's dicks in the bathroom?

2015
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,640
All right. Yes, it's the bachelor party.

2016
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,880
We're having fun now. Give us a fear the spears.

2017
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,120
You homophobic waiter.

2018
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,240
I'll yell on the ropes.

2019
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,640
Yeah. So all this stuff, the drink menu.

2020
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:26,200
Scott, let me ask, what do you think of the wine list at WCW Nitro Grill?

2021
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,320
Well, I don't appreciate that they called it the wine list with an H

2022
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:36,840
as if by by having some of the wine that you offer,

2023
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,800
that I am being some kind of whiner, right, to spend it with.

2024
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:44,200
Now, granted, what was I doing about fear the spear just now?

2025
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,960
But whining. Sure. That's true. Sounds awful.

2026
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,920
I would rather have even these.

2027
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,680
I don't know. You might be looking at a different generation.

2028
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,000
I was going to say, yeah, what does because this doesn't have that.

2029
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,600
Yeah, that does. Oh, this is different.

2030
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,120
They changed it. They turned it into the wine.

2031
01:33:59,120 --> 01:33:59,840
Oh, interesting.

2032
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,960
Well, that's probably like leftover misogyny from the 90s or something.

2033
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:10,000
Right. Nothing wrong with having some mum extra dry sparkling wine.

2034
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,920
My nice visit to the WCW Nitro Grill.

2035
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,920
Now, if you ordered wine in the Dix last resort, they might say you're a whiner.

2036
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,160
Something they might still keep up that tradition.

2037
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,600
But that's interesting.

2038
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:23,640
Yeah, they did. They either changed it or like they changed it at some point.

2039
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,960
So how?

2040
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,680
So I well, then I like your menu.

2041
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:34,480
And I thank Jason for sending us the menu that was not insulting

2042
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,480
to my favorite beverage.

2043
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,160
So also the entrance to this place, like you have a photo of it somewhere.

2044
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,240
I don't have the entrance now.

2045
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,840
It looks like it's not a large photo,

2046
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,080
but it looks like this is kind of the set of the show.

2047
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:51,600
Another good another slam against another body slam against WF

2048
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,200
New York, because it was like just like a chain link fence.

2049
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:59,440
And then in the actual dining area, there is a circle like the entrance way

2050
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:05,640
of the show. Like it's just so much so easy, like so much easy stuff they did.

2051
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,440
So smart. It didn't help them survive, but also the company went under.

2052
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,480
So I don't know.

2053
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,000
Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.

2054
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:16,320
This is like but the legend lives on as with a TV show.

2055
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,160
Yeah. Cancel before its time.

2056
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:22,280
This is the freaks and geeks of, you know, they didn't reap the rewards then.

2057
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,760
But now we speak of it in glowing terms.

2058
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:29,200
Yeah. Also, the server aprons were world titles.

2059
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,800
Cool. I mean, look at there's the others like a black apron.

2060
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,560
But then they had like a picture of the WCW world title on them.

2061
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:39,600
She's all the trouble that Cardona had to go to to get a belt.

2062
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,440
He could have gotten a job at this restaurant.

2063
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,760
Here, some of the bar, some of the bars were themed around pay-per-view events to

2064
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:51,160
the bash at the beach bar had booths that were made to look like shark teeth.

2065
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,800
I found a picture of that. That looks pretty awful.

2066
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,160
It's a bunch of like, you know, like the the rings on boats, whatever that the

2067
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,440
rescue ring. I don't know what that word is.

2068
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,120
It's pretty that that room is pretty chintzy.

2069
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,920
Yeah. But at least they tried.

2070
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Themed rooms.

2071
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:09,880
That's something. Yeah.

2072
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:15,760
Well, also, I don't know if you guys watched the video promoting this place.

2073
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:20,400
I think I did. But there is one element to it that really puts it over in terms.

2074
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,840
And this was only, I guess, on opening night.

2075
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,720
This wasn't a regular feature of the place.

2076
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,120
But there is a cooler person who was present

2077
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:34,280
at Nitro Grill than I'd say I've heard any of these other wrestling restaurants.

2078
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,840
Let me let me give you a taste of this.

2079
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:42,880
Welcome to the Nitro Grill.

2080
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,560
And let's get ready to party.

2081
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:53,520
So much zooming in and out and DJs and stuff and then like Sting and Goldberg

2082
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:58,400
there. But somebody else off the beaten path.

2083
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,200
Here we go.

2084
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:05,720
Kevin Eubanks from Tonight Show Bass.

2085
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,560
I did not see that. Yeah.

2086
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,120
Oh, yeah. Because you know, Kevin wrestled in WCW.

2087
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,600
Oh, OK. I didn't know that.

2088
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,600
Right. He did a run in during the Jay Leno.

2089
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,520
You have to have seen this.

2090
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,640
OK, so Jay.

2091
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,240
So everything is connected, I guess.

2092
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,200
So Jay. OK, with Jay's Jay's appearance.

2093
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,560
Hold on one second here.

2094
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,440
I just want to make sure I'm right, because it's confusing.

2095
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:32,320
Like Rodman wrestled.

2096
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,600
Karl Malone wrestled.

2097
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,440
Oh, that was all WCW. OK.

2098
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,840
Jay Leno wrestled Hogan.

2099
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,640
It was a tag match.

2100
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:41,880
I think I believe it was Jay Leno and DDP.

2101
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,040
Oh, great. Is that right, Jason?

2102
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,080
I think that sounds right.

2103
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:50,880
Yeah, it was Jay Leno and DDP versus Hogan and someone else at Bischoff,

2104
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,160
I believe Eric Bischoff, who was the guy in charge of the league.

2105
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,520
And then Kevin did a run in and Kevin has like white, like cut off

2106
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,080
sleeve kind of shirt. And Kevin was like in good shape.

2107
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:05,440
And I think Kevin threw a cutter like a diamond cutter also in the ring.

2108
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,760
I think Kevin got more involved than Jay did.

2109
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:12,760
Jazz guitarist and the Kevin Eupinks.

2110
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:15,800
Yes. Everyone cheering for him in the wrestling ring.

2111
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,960
Yes. And Jay wrestled.

2112
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,720
And I think Hogan and Jay did an angle on The Tonight Show as well.

2113
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,840
I think there's a clip of them hyping up the match. Oh, great.

2114
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:27,680
Yeah, here's Kevin.

2115
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:28,680
I don't know if you can see this.

2116
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:31,440
Kevin's kind of got like a sleeveless white shirt.

2117
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,360
Wow. Wow. And he's jacked.

2118
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,840
It's cool. He looks cool.

2119
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,360
But you almost could tell, like you could kind of tell Jay was

2120
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,560
not fully in into this idea, but maybe Kevin was like, this is my shot.

2121
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,240
Kevin might. Kevin seemed like he was a real fan. Wow.

2122
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:51,480
So, oh, yes, I am a I mean, look, no offense to these other restaurants.

2123
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:57,560
But hey, you know, Matt wasn't so high, I feel like on this time square.

2124
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,200
I think Nitro Grills by far. Yeah.

2125
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,320
We don't nobody was there on the ground, but yeah, it sounds

2126
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,520
sounds pretty awesome.

2127
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,680
Yeah, there's I'm you banks being there is really exciting.

2128
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,440
I'm surprised no one has done anything with you banks again

2129
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,560
because it seemed like he's a big fan.

2130
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,960
I mean, maybe he's a little too old to get involved now, but

2131
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:19,520
that would be a fantastic callback.

2132
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,000
Yeah, there's something because there's a lot of sort of retro stuff going on.

2133
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,280
Even in like G.C.W.

2134
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:29,320
I feel like you could do a Kevin Eubanks run in still with the white

2135
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:34,000
same exact sleeveless shirt action figures of wrestling mode.

2136
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,080
Kevin Eubanks.

2137
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,040
Scott, what is that?

2138
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,200
Where is the Eubanks clip?

2139
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,320
What is the name of that video?

2140
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,800
That's got a WCW Nitro Grill commercial in 1899. Great.

2141
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,560
OK. So I can watch this watches on my own time over and over again.

2142
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,520
Big TV.

2143
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:52,560
But there is another competitor, I would say, for potentially

2144
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,280
greatest wrestling affiliated restaurant of all time.

2145
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:59,040
I think we have to give at least a little bit of time.

2146
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,920
How could we not nod to in the celebrity owned restaurant month?

2147
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:09,200
To the great, the mythic, the legend Hulk Hogan's Pasta Mania.

2148
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,600
One of the dumbest things of all time.

2149
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,120
I feel like there is a love.

2150
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:19,400
There's a degree of happiness I've had in my life ever since.

2151
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,640
I whenever the first time I learned of Hulk Hogan's Pasta Mania was

2152
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,760
that phrase and knowing it was in the Mall of America.

2153
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:30,080
That's just a fact you can carry with you the rest of your life.

2154
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,800
Yes, makes me happy every time I think about it.

2155
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:37,680
And so it is so fun, like Hogan, like from the pictures,

2156
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:42,720
like the badly drawn picture on the front of the worst menu,

2157
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,040
the worst start for sure.

2158
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,920
And and, you know, I mean, well, this isn't the last time that we'll see

2159
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:51,920
one of our chosen celebrities holding up a big plate of pasta.

2160
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,880
But it's it's it's a pretty funny one, right?

2161
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,680
A funny guy to see holding up.

2162
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,040
God, it's funny. Yeah.

2163
01:40:58,040 --> 01:40:59,360
Looking at you all intense.

2164
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,000
Oh, some of this.

2165
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,240
Well, and just some of the details they chose to emphasize one.

2166
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:09,600
I just remember seeing years and years ago, like one of the like

2167
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,880
print ads or something.

2168
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,520
It's like pasta healthy for kids.

2169
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,120
And it's like, well, it's not totally bad in reasonable quantities, but healthy.

2170
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,800
This is that was his whole angle.

2171
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:27,080
I feel like promoting all of it is like, yeah, you got to eat your pasta, brother.

2172
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,800
Eat your pasta.

2173
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:34,080
Yeah. And the mix and match pasta is I mean, I have one of the menu pages here

2174
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,840
or it might be the menu page.

2175
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,120
I don't think there was a lot of options, but just the list in bright.

2176
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:42,000
So badly printed, just like not straight

2177
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,280
printing seemingly on bright hulk yellow paper.

2178
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,320
It's really something like this would be a cool,

2179
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,520
independent local wrestling show, not the menu

2180
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,520
for one of the most famous people in America's restaurant.

2181
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,320
In a really prominent location, in a really prominent location.

2182
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,800
He looks like on the front of the menu, the draw, the little like drawing of it.

2183
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,960
It looks like his hands have that he doesn't have hands

2184
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:12,160
and they're just permanently plates of pasta like he he's like a me air.

2185
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:15,520
He's like, yeah, Edward pasta hands or something.

2186
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,360
But something else is off about this menu that really stuck out to me

2187
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:25,200
under mix and match your options for pasta, angel hair shells, fettuccine,

2188
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,960
penne, nuggets, nuggets, pasta, nuggets, excuse me.

2189
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,560
Is that pasta nuggets?

2190
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,280
Jason, you've never had pasta nuggets?

2191
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:37,440
I don't know. Unless that's like, does he mean chicken?

2192
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,000
No cheese or something like no key.

2193
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,360
No key. What am I saying here?

2194
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,560
I'm trying to think of like the bigger pieces of pasta.

2195
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,760
I mean, that's like, is it a kidified way to bring up?

2196
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,920
No key. Yeah. Maybe pasta nuggets, pasta nuggets.

2197
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,680
I don't know.

2198
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,920
I mean, it does say, you know, it's these are some of Hulk's

2199
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,600
favorite international pastas, which I'm sure he really consulted

2200
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:02,840
the countries of the world.

2201
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,760
Travels abroad.

2202
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:07,000
You know, I'm getting white clam pasta nuggets, brother.

2203
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,920
Pasta. I travel far wide, brother, to find the best pasta nuggets.

2204
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,400
You can eat as much pasta as you want.

2205
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,800
Don't eat too much sushi.

2206
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,320
Oh, too much sushi.

2207
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,400
Oh, great.

2208
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:26,240
The greatest is how lazy this whole thing.

2209
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,400
It's so great how lazy it is.

2210
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,960
It feels. Yeah, there's too many.

2211
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,680
It didn't last a year at the Mall of America.

2212
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,640
It wasn't even a year. It wasn't even a year.

2213
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,440
I think there was another one.

2214
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,040
Was in the food court, too.

2215
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,920
This might be the smallest location we're talking about this month. Yeah.

2216
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,240
Hulk, Hulk, or onion cheese for little pasta maniacs.

2217
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,960
Little pasta maniacs.

2218
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,280
And then would you consider yourself a little pasta maniac as a child?

2219
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,840
Oh, or now?

2220
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,520
I mean, spaghetti and meat,

2221
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:04,040
sauce and sausage was a once a week affair at my house. So, yeah.

2222
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,640
So, yeah, you were a little pasta maniac. Sure.

2223
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:08,520
Sorry, Scott.

2224
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:11,720
I got to put your pasta maniac money where your mouth is, brother.

2225
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,080
Come to the Mall of America.

2226
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,360
Show me how much pasta you can eat.

2227
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,960
I'll stuff you full of Hulk.

2228
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,440
Hulk EOS.

2229
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,200
Hulk EOS is on the pasta maniacs menu.

2230
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,120
But who knows if I'm saying that right?

2231
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:27,000
Maybe only Hulk himself could tell me Hulk EO.

2232
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,800
And what is that? What's the Hulk EO?

2233
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,320
That has to be like they bought like bulk quantities of spaghetti.

2234
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,280
Oh, yeah. OK. Yeah.

2235
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,440
Well, I don't know if Hulk himself even knows

2236
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,360
how to say some of this stuff, because this is look, it's a longer clip.

2237
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,440
I'm tempted to play the entire thing because this, I think,

2238
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:49,520
is one of the greatest things a camera has ever been pointed at,

2239
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:55,080
which is this is from WCW Monday Nitro, September 4th, 1995.

2240
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,600
And this is this is the Hulkster himself in the Mall of America

2241
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,200
promoting as aggressively as only he knows how.

2242
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:08,160
Here's Hulk trying to get the little pasta maniacs to the Mall of America.

2243
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:12,280
All right. Michael Jordan's got his restaurant in Chicago.

2244
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,720
Coach Don Schueler, the Miami Dolphins.

2245
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:18,960
He's got a steakhouse with WCW's own world heavyweight champion, Hulk Hogan.

2246
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:23,680
Children just like surrounding like just a mob of children.

2247
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:30,560
Oh, God, in the tiny, the clearly there is no room to order in this little location.

2248
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,200
So Hulk's being mobbed.

2249
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,240
But this guy's going to fight through the mob.

2250
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,840
He's got pasta mania in the Mall of America.

2251
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,280
I want to try to get a word with him.

2252
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:41,360
If I could squeeze in there, Hulk Hogan coming up

2253
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,720
debut edition of Monday Nitro.

2254
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,280
You've got Big Bubba in the main event.

2255
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,280
Who's the greatest wrestler in the world?

2256
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:54,400
You know something, Eric Bischoff, tonight on Monday Nitro

2257
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,640
pasta mania is going to all my hulking maniacs running wild.

2258
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:00,880
And I've eaten so many hulkeroo's and hulkyoo's.

2259
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:05,240
I feel sorry for Big Bubba, brother, because tonight, brother,

2260
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:10,320
first time on TNT, I'm putting the WCW heavyweight title on the line.

2261
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,720
And with pasta mania running through my brain,

2262
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,200
this is the debut episode.

2263
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,080
Wait, really? Of Nitro?

2264
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:29,000
Yeah, it's the debut episode on TNT coming to you from Mall of America.

2265
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,880
And there is a essentially a local food court restaurant

2266
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,600
commercial in the middle of it.

2267
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,240
It is. Yeah. Yes.

2268
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,760
It is so crazy because like WCW crosses over like wrestling

2269
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,120
and theme parks and all these rest.

2270
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:44,560
It's like Mall of America.

2271
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,080
They did shows there.

2272
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,160
And then you could also see it in Universal Studios.

2273
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,920
Like there's a long tradition of wrestling at Universal CityWalk.

2274
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:56,800
And the early days of Disney, MGM, which we haven't barely even gone down.

2275
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,360
That's right. Oh, yeah.

2276
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:01,080
Yeah. So in mall, you're in all our favorite places.

2277
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:05,800
So I guess that's like that was the idea, maybe partly for having pasta mania there.

2278
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:08,920
Well, and there was there was a whole big separate event,

2279
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,480
which you can watch in pretty camcorder quality.

2280
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,760
So it's not really worth playing, but it's worth that.

2281
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,280
You can look that up on YouTube.

2282
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:19,400
And it's just to say the official name of that event.

2283
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:23,960
That is the Hulk Hogan's pasta mania grand opening pasta challenge.

2284
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:28,000
You can see in this flyer macho man is part of it as well.

2285
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:34,200
But that I've thought about that so often over the whole grooves and all the use.

2286
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:39,120
I don't think I don't know if Hulk, you is anything we spell.

2287
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,080
I never pictured the spelling of Hulk.

2288
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:44,440
You look at the videos which we just found.

2289
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:46,480
I think that's what he thinks he's saying. Yeah.

2290
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:50,200
But maybe that if maybe he hits his restaurant, he's telling us

2291
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,960
that spelled like iOS at the end.

2292
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,160
But Hulk, you would be H.U.L.K.

2293
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:01,400
A Y.O.U. or Hulk or or O.O.

2294
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,880
Like you who?

2295
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,080
Hulk, you and what is you?

2296
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:05,920
Yeah, I don't.

2297
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,560
It's it's all so unclear.

2298
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,800
This is one.

2299
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:13,920
This is one of my favorite things about wrestling is that

2300
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:17,760
like people learn how to do like a promo, which is like they're cutting a prom

2301
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,680
like that, that he's doing the same energy as if he was.

2302
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,080
He's trying to weave in the angle with the big Bubba.

2303
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:28,520
Is if he's going up against like this is all a challenge to his opponent.

2304
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:32,640
But the opponent is the notion that children would not come.

2305
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:33,320
Exactly.

2306
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:34,880
Pasta is possible from him.

2307
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,480
So like there's been that's happened.

2308
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,040
I feel like in recent times there was there was a clip.

2309
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:40,760
There's a wrestler in A.W.

2310
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:45,560
Eddie Kingston, who is so good as far as being like a talker and on the mic.

2311
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,680
And there was a clip where somebody is like, hey, cut a promo on this chocolate

2312
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:52,200
chip cookie. Now, that's like a self aware version of this, too.

2313
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:56,120
And he did it. He does like a really intense promo talking about the chocolate

2314
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:57,560
chip cookie.

2315
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:05,280
Or I saw a wrestling legend slash home shopping legend, Don West cut a promo a

2316
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,960
couple of years ago at a convention.

2317
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,640
I don't do you guys remember this guy, Don West?

2318
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:13,440
It was not home shopping. It was like a different thing, a different network.

2319
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,120
And they would sell beanie babies.

2320
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,240
They parodied it on SNL.

2321
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:18,800
Was it on QVC?

2322
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,920
No, it was something.

2323
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,520
It was like a less a less good QVC.

2324
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:25,800
There was a sketch. You remember the Mark Hamill like home shopping sketch?

2325
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:29,720
Yeah. So this was a parody of a guy named Don West who eventually went on to

2326
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,480
announce wrestling and he was a guy who would talk like this.

2327
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:36,960
Can you believe it's like my taffer impression, but he would be like, we have

2328
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:40,280
the glory bear, we have Tabasco the bull.

2329
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,560
I can't believe this deal.

2330
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:46,560
He's like only nine hundred and ninety nine dollars for these are all on YouTube.

2331
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,640
Watch them. They're amazing.

2332
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:51,680
We have 50 retired beanie babies.

2333
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,080
How are we doing this?

2334
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,240
And he would go nuts.

2335
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,880
And we watched it all the time as kids.

2336
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,360
And then he would be became a wrestling

2337
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:01,800
announcer and I saw him cut like do a promo like this a couple of years ago,

2338
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,240
live in person in Schomburg when there was a wrestling convention before AEW.

2339
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:10,160
But it's one of my favorite things is having like seeing people just go into

2340
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,320
their schtick like this with any sort of topic.

2341
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,760
It's really fun.

2342
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,080
Well, just the other day, the Super Bowl

2343
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:23,200
started with the rock cutting promo on the Super Bowl, like selling us on the idea

2344
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:27,880
of the Super Bowl on the field at SoFi Stadium.

2345
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:31,160
It's probably a massively planned market

2346
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,440
because it's like WrestleMania is there next year.

2347
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,360
Yes, he'll probably be in a match.

2348
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,400
NBC, you know, Universal was broadcasting the Super Bowl.

2349
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:45,120
Like it's it all just kind of like ties together in the background.

2350
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:48,120
So, yeah, Hogan doing this with pasta is very funny.

2351
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:51,800
Yeah. And he kind of like half looked.

2352
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,360
They had no time to prep this just like kind of like,

2353
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,320
he just like check out the menu and maybe share a couple of things we have.

2354
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,360
Yeah, OK.

2355
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,520
He looks at Hulky.

2356
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,720
Oh, just mixes up in his brain.

2357
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,760
All right. OK, you exactly we got somebody.

2358
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,920
OK, you like right before like they're like, he's like, what am I doing?

2359
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:08,880
OK, what is it?

2360
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,720
Pasta? Tell me some of the dishes.

2361
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:11,720
And then they're like, here it is.

2362
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:12,680
And he goes, all right, I got it.

2363
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,960
And he just does the thing he does all the time.

2364
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,360
And it's fantastic.

2365
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,880
You got to be stuffed in your face full of hocus on your brother.

2366
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,360
We don't have hocus on you.

2367
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,640
That's not a thing.

2368
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,880
This doesn't matter. Just let him go.

2369
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,600
This could immediately generate some goodwill for like Disney.

2370
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,080
If like Bob Chapek or Josh tomorrow

2371
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:36,960
like recorded a video where it's like, we heard your cries and they're back

2372
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:40,880
at Disneyland Resort, the parking trams are back.

2373
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:42,560
You've waited years.

2374
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,840
You want Bob Chapek to cut one of his trademark problems.

2375
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:49,560
Bob Chapek cuts a promo going like the Food and Wine Festival back.

2376
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,880
The parking trams are back.

2377
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,840
That's more of an Eisner energy, though, what you're giving me is like

2378
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:59,000
that Eisner yelled a lot, but he had definitely had that like

2379
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,880
manic quality sometimes, but not aggressive.

2380
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,640
Chapek looks like we know that when he speaks, he's very soft spoken.

2381
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:10,600
But he also, you know, like big bald dude, he could like if you looked at him,

2382
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,680
you might think that he could speak like that.

2383
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,000
Yeah, and everybody's only making him angrier and angrier.

2384
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,720
Like he should just be a heel.

2385
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:18,920
He should be a heel.

2386
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:19,960
Yeah, that is true.

2387
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:23,280
He's he's right on the line right now because this happens in wrestling where,

2388
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,480
you know, people are getting booed, but they don't quite want to go to the dark

2389
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,280
side. So he's a tween.

2390
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:31,160
He's like a tweener, they call him, where they're in between being a.

2391
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:34,240
Oh, but to the audience, a lot of the audience is getting booed.

2392
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,240
So he really should just embrace it.

2393
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:40,320
I've seen your petitions and shove them up your ass.

2394
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,520
Did you know that the Star Wars Hotel

2395
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:45,880
Cruise ship Han and Leia spent some of their honeymoon on it?

2396
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
But you'll never see them walking around in the park, you scumbags.

2397
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:55,080
J.J. characters only because JPEG rules.

2398
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,160
Understand.

2399
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,920
Yeah, you don't like Lightning Lane?

2400
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:02,480
Well, everything is Lightning Lane now.

2401
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,680
Pay for each ride and the entrance ticket.

2402
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:09,920
Cat's a Lightning Lane to get here on the freeway because JPEG said so.

2403
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,920
Oh, Kathleen, Kathleen,

2404
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:15,920
she comes on screen with a garbage can and drops like DVDs of like,

2405
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:20,920
this is the uncut original trilogy and just throws it in a garbage can.

2406
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:22,840
Like they. Oh, man.

2407
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,600
Should also start wearing the sting face paint as well.

2408
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,000
Oh, yeah.

2409
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:32,400
Statistically, it is likely that Disney

2410
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:36,960
owns the crow and we just have missed it somewhere in there.

2411
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:40,720
It ended up at Fox 2000's portfolio at some point.

2412
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,320
Of course, they probably own that.

2413
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:45,040
The crow. He's in Star Wars now.

2414
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,200
The JPEGster says so.

2415
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,200
Oh, what's this?

2416
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,760
The last copy without McClunky.

2417
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:55,400
Oops, McClunky this crack.

2418
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:59,840
It really doesn't like cuts his own forehead with it.

2419
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:05,640
Yeah, it's just blades on stage.

2420
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,160
I love this JPEG.

2421
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:13,080
JPEGster, I think, is the way to, you know, because you don't have to like him.

2422
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:14,480
He's just got to get the job done.

2423
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:15,640
Yeah, that's true.

2424
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:20,560
So well, then, OK, then tomorrow has to run in with a chair and like,

2425
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:23,560
but the big twist is that he just turns heel to.

2426
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:27,040
No, everyone thought he was the good guy, but no, he's bad.

2427
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,640
Maybe he's worse tomorrow.

2428
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:31,120
You're not going to be so pretty when I'm done with you.

2429
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,680
And the big, yeah, it's like the end.

2430
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,400
So the NWO reveal was that Hogan was the bad guy.

2431
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,440
He was the he was the mystery man.

2432
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,040
Oh, sure. Yeah.

2433
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,960
So it could do a similar thing where tomorrow everybody

2434
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:47,080
always they thought tomorrow was daddy, but he's bad daddy.

2435
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,160
NDO, Disney order.

2436
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,040
Yeah, exactly.

2437
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,840
And I'm your new Disney daddy and you're going to like it.

2438
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:56,040
And, you know, like there's a wrestling

2439
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:59,680
faction called the Bullet Club that generally they end up kicking out their

2440
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,560
leader a lot, so like it's always kind of a turn on them when they're not expecting

2441
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:08,160
it. So like Iger's like doing his final wave goodbye and then tomorrow and

2442
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:10,760
Chapek attack him. Oh, yeah.

2443
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,080
And Iger is dead.

2444
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:16,600
Yeah. And he puts him Kenny Omega's finishes, the one winged angel

2445
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,360
puts him on his shoulders and like drops him real hard aggressively.

2446
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:25,280
And that's what Chapek does to Iger through maybe jumps off the stage at a D23

2447
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:27,200
through some tables.

2448
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:31,200
Well, yeah, everyone notices it's like, oh, there's very elaborate, like three

2449
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,400
stories scaffolding, two stories scaffolding.

2450
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,400
Wonder what that's for.

2451
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:39,760
You wanted your Yeti back so bad, Everest.

2452
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:41,000
Well, guess what? We put up.

2453
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,720
Guess what? We have a new Yeti.

2454
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:46,400
It's Iger's dead body.

2455
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:48,120
We too.

2456
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,640
We glued some fur on it.

2457
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,440
Boys, isn't that scary?

2458
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:58,400
And he's not going anywhere because Chapek says so.

2459
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,760
Man, he really should.

2460
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,880
This is the way this is the future for him.

2461
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:07,320
One thing before you pass Pasta Mania, which is that the I found picture.

2462
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,080
Oh, wait, two things. What?

2463
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,680
So, yeah, immediate decay.

2464
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,600
It's gone so fast.

2465
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:16,280
And then the inexplicable

2466
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:20,520
eventual like fate of the Pasta Mania sign.

2467
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:21,680
You guys seen this?

2468
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:22,160
Yeah.

2469
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:28,040
What? That the marquee was just sitting in like a vacant Minneapolis St.

2470
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:34,280
Paul lot just like and not over a door, just over a regular wall with a bunch of

2471
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:38,280
trash in the parking lot, depending on there's a lot of photos of this.

2472
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:41,760
And you can get real sad with them if you want, because there's real bitter snow

2473
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:44,160
around there. Yeah, I don't know.

2474
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,440
I'm obsessed with how did the Pasta Mania

2475
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:50,160
sign end up on some random like auto parts wall?

2476
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:51,720
It's so miserable.

2477
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:52,560
But I love it.

2478
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:58,320
Someone bought it and then was told, get that out of the garage.

2479
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,800
I want to park my car in there.

2480
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:01,960
Somebody's wife.

2481
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,720
Yes, his wife is like, it was enough.

2482
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:07,560
Do you undersold how big it was?

2483
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,800
I thought it would hang on the wall.

2484
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,960
OK, we could we could buy a new car for the cost of this.

2485
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:16,720
Yeah. Instead, it's taking up space,

2486
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:21,480
put it somewhere, go call your friend at the junk parts place.

2487
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,240
You know, there's more.

2488
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:23,920
There's so much.

2489
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:27,840
I mean, Hogan has it now like a real seemingly like kind of trashy place called

2490
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:30,680
Hogan's Beach, which I believe is in Tampa.

2491
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:31,560
It's a new place.

2492
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:35,360
Like we don't have time on the show right now to even get I'm sure there's more

2493
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:38,360
funny Pasta Mania shit out there, too.

2494
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,040
But like, yeah, where did all the pieces go?

2495
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,400
Like all five pieces, all five.

2496
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:45,440
And you know, there's that I mean, I guess you're right.

2497
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,320
There's not that much.

2498
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,720
But it's acknowledged still to this day

2499
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:55,320
because that you guys see that the Mall of America has a log flume ride.

2500
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,040
Oh, yes.

2501
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:59,960
And there is a Paul Bunyan and a babe, the blue ox.

2502
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:07,240
And I found photos of Paul Bunyan wearing a pasta mania torn shirt

2503
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:11,400
with a yellow chef's hat, his big like his big axe.

2504
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:13,360
There's pasta dripping off of it.

2505
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:16,280
I don't have the photo, but there's pasta coming out of the ox's mouth.

2506
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:20,200
And he's got a big belt that says he's like the pasta champion of the world.

2507
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,200
And I saw these photos and I was like,

2508
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:26,400
that's so funny and cool that they promoted the opening of pasta mania

2509
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,960
by dressing up Paul Bunyan.

2510
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:29,120
No, no, no.

2511
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,120
I kept digging.

2512
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,480
This was for Halloween 2019.

2513
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:33,280
Wow.

2514
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:37,160
That is so much cooler than what so many theme parks do.

2515
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,800
Acknowledging the weird history of your place.

2516
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:41,920
That is awesome.

2517
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:46,160
That is like a Knott's Berry Farm type of we know what the fans of the place

2518
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:47,960
want to see. We're nodding to the history.

2519
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:48,880
We don't hide from it.

2520
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,400
It doesn't cost a lot of money.

2521
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,960
You know, it's there for the people who want it.

2522
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:54,920
You know? Yeah.

2523
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:56,200
Yeah. Geez.

2524
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:57,600
Awesome. Awesome.

2525
01:58:57,800 --> 01:58:58,800
Yeah, that is great.

2526
01:58:59,000 --> 01:58:59,880
Yeah.

2527
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,920
Just like you have to pay like a Disney,

2528
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:06,200
like a couple hundred bucks to get like a retro night like that.

2529
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:09,320
That might get close to acknowledging some dumb shit.

2530
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,480
Once briefly they do it, but like, yeah, they don't want to.

2531
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:14,320
You could tell. Right.

2532
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:15,520
Well, what do you do?

2533
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,040
You want to name check anything else before before we wind it down?

2534
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:21,600
Well, I mean, we didn't even get to the Scott Steiner Shoney's restaurant,

2535
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:23,000
which is sadly closed now.

2536
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:26,840
Scott Steiner is one of the beefiest men in wrestling.

2537
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,160
I would say Big Papa Pump is his nickname.

2538
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:31,880
OK, Scott, let me let you know.

2539
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:36,040
He only cares about two things, his freaks and his peaks.

2540
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:39,400
And his peaks, his peaks are his muscles.

2541
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:40,720
A peak. Yeah.

2542
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,760
Like it's a mountain.

2543
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,880
You know, like we shown the bicep off and he says his peak.

2544
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:50,880
And he that's what shape says about but he means the Disney means he meets

2545
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:53,200
the mountain, Disney Mountain, Matterhorn Mountain.

2546
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,760
Yeah, he really shouldn't call the fans a freak.

2547
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:58,280
So it seems like counterintuitive.

2548
01:59:58,480 --> 01:59:59,600
Well, he's healed now, though.

2549
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:00,720
Yeah.

2550
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:07,680
So, yeah, the big bad booty daddy is another nickname.

2551
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:09,280
OK.

2552
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,920
Yeah. So he I forget if he actually owned it.

2553
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:14,840
I think he like was a franchisee, like franchisee basically.

2554
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,720
Uh huh. And he had a big opening.

2555
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:19,880
I guess we could put some pictures up, but he had a big opening in Hall

2556
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,160
Hall and Nash, Kevin Nash, Super Shredder.

2557
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:26,160
They were there. Some other friends of the WCW days.

2558
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:28,600
And they're all posing with Shoney Bear.

2559
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:31,920
Scott is you know, Scott usually Shoney Bear.

2560
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,120
Shoney Bear is a mascot of Shoney's.

2561
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:37,560
I've never been or I've never like there's no Shoney's around me growing up.

2562
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:38,400
So I don't know anything about Shoney's.

2563
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,680
There was one Shoney's around us as a kid.

2564
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:43,000
And it was only there for a brief moment.

2565
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,200
And we went once.

2566
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,880
And as a kid, I was like, this sucks.

2567
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:49,480
This is like it's a kind of a breakfasty place.

2568
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:51,120
But the toast was burnt.

2569
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,520
The meal wasn't very good.

2570
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:55,680
Again, for a kid to notice, it means it's probably pretty bad.

2571
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:57,600
But did you ever go to Shoney's?

2572
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,880
No, I used to confuse with Perkins.

2573
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:02,560
There were Perkins here and there growing up.

2574
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:07,120
But Shoney Bear was just basically like kind of a genericy Teddy Bear.

2575
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:08,120
That was the man.

2576
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,480
It probably still the mascot of Shoney's.

2577
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:16,200
So Scott had franchise this location and it's great because where was it?

2578
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:16,960
Where was this guy's?

2579
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:19,520
Oh, shoot. My phone is now dead.

2580
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,600
So could you look up Scott's side of Shoney's?

2581
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:27,480
And specifically for the listener, he is usually wears like a chainmail headpiece

2582
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:32,760
combined with Oakley sunglasses or at least one of those two things, often both

2583
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:33,800
at the same time.

2584
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,160
So imagine that next to the Shoney's logo.

2585
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,480
Ackworth, Georgia.

2586
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,560
There you go.

2587
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:40,680
Interesting.

2588
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:43,000
And this only started in 2016.

2589
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:44,720
Yes, and the pandemic killed it.

2590
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:46,080
It's recent.

2591
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:47,720
And yeah, he usually my phone is here.

2592
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,840
Usually Scott looks like this guy.

2593
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:53,240
But then he had like the shirt on, like the shirt and tie.

2594
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,560
He did wear a shirt for his Shoney's.

2595
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:56,280
Yes.

2596
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:01,800
And he had a little like a memorabilia case of all Scott Steiner related, you know,

2597
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,480
title belt and pictures and stuff.

2598
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:08,520
But yeah, Nash Hall, Scott Steiner with Shoney Bear.

2599
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:09,440
Wow.

2600
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:12,280
Right there is one of my favorite photos.

2601
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:13,480
Great.

2602
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:15,640
And there's a really scary looking picture

2603
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:21,600
that is now accepting applications of like Scott Steiner with both of his peaks out.

2604
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,600
Oh, yeah. He's flexing.

2605
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:27,800
And it looks really scary, like you're applying to a haunted house or something.

2606
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:28,360
Yeah.

2607
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:31,080
Are you man enough to work at my Shoney's?

2608
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:33,760
Yeah. You man enough to clean my restroom.

2609
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:34,480
Yeah.

2610
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:38,080
Yeah. Can I have off to go to prom on Friday?

2611
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,200
What do you think?

2612
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,440
Maybe the peaks can answer that one freak.

2613
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:49,360
His he was also Jeff Jarrett was there at the opening of Buff Bagwell to WCW Legends

2614
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:50,920
and just fantastic.

2615
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:53,480
I wish it's closed now, sadly, I think during the pandemic.

2616
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:57,480
But I never got to go to the Scott Steiner Shoney's.

2617
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:01,040
What do we give the belt to everything we talked about today?

2618
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,000
Now that we've thrown in Scott Steiner Shoney's.

2619
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,680
Well, let me throw one more menu item.

2620
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,560
I forgot to shout out.

2621
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:06,680
I don't think we said it.

2622
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,080
Crush rooms.

2623
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,880
We didn't say crush rooms.

2624
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:13,120
The episode almost ended and we didn't mention crush rooms.

2625
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:14,200
Crush rooms are so good.

2626
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:15,680
What a failing that would have been.

2627
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:16,520
Thank you, Mike.

2628
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:17,760
That's the best one.

2629
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,120
Yeah. Crush room.

2630
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:19,640
Crush room.

2631
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:23,000
Bringing violence into the act of eating.

2632
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:23,360
Yeah.

2633
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:24,400
Okay.

2634
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,720
Well, there's no question with that.

2635
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:28,160
If there was any question before you say crush rooms,

2636
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:35,560
I think the the world's heavyweight wrestling related restaurant title

2637
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:39,720
to the championship of the world obviously goes to the WCW Nitro Grill.

2638
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,120
I think so.

2639
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:46,280
Until Cardona's can get up and running off the ground, which I think I should

2640
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:51,480
pitch him that it should go in the giant indoor water park that the showboat

2641
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:56,200
hotel that he has wrestled at a couple of times now, I feel like is building

2642
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:00,880
as they wait for their gaming license to come back online.

2643
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,840
Seems like a good place to invest your money.

2644
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:04,640
Yeah. Yeah.

2645
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:05,800
For it, Matt.

2646
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,840
And yeah, until until Tony Khan reaches out to us and we help him make the first

2647
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:13,440
AEW restaurant. Yeah.

2648
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:14,400
Yeah.

2649
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:17,200
Well, again, we got luck on our side.

2650
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:17,880
We helped Matt.

2651
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:19,400
We brought back Planet Hollywood.

2652
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,800
And I think this is one of these endeavors is going to happen by virtue of us

2653
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:28,000
talking about it in this in this big boy of an episode.

2654
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:31,600
Very big boys at home, happy with your content.

2655
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:35,760
You show it down like a bunch of big plate of hookah youth.

2656
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,960
Then if so, you survive podcast, the right wrestling restaurants edition.

2657
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:41,640
Boy, that was fun.

2658
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:48,920
Hey, more celebrity to come on both the second gate and the main feed.

2659
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:50,480
So much fun to come.

2660
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:51,320
Yeah.

2661
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,320
Do we do?

2662
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:53,720
Do we save the best for that?

2663
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:56,400
We may say the weirdest for last weirdest for sure.

2664
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:59,120
Yeah, it seems right.

2665
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:00,960
Do I have the plug things in front of me?

2666
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:04,440

podcast, the ride.

2672
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:24,760
Yeah, actually, we make Jason cut a promo as we leave on one of his favorite foods

2673
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,320
or like Oscar rings.

2674
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:28,760
The concept of Oscar ring.

2675
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,520
Yeah, like the challenge.

2676
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:34,760
Like that it's something that he thinks it won't be devoured by Jason, but it will.

2677
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,200
Right.

2678
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,600
I maybe Oscar like.

2679
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:39,640
Yeah, I'm going to ask you.

2680
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:40,840
So, yeah, you're a wrestler.

2681
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:43,080
And like that's one of your things is you're not going to beat somebody,

2682
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:45,880
but you're going to Oscar them up.

2683
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,400
So your rise. OK, let's see.

2684
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:49,440
You're having a feud with

2685
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,640
like another like you're feuding with Nick Weigert.

2686
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:53,840
It's a podcast feud.

2687
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:56,680
OK, doughboys host Nick Weigert.

2688
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:58,360
And you're basically saying you're going to beat him up.

2689
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,960
But you don't see you talk on only food terms.

2690
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:03,560
OK, so that's the prompt here.

2691
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:08,440
All right, Nick, Nick, listen to me.

2692
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,960
I know you're hearing this.

2693
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:13,120
I want you to listen to me right now.

2694
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:15,520
You're weak right now.

2695
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,720
You've been a fit guy in the past,

2696
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:21,520
but you're coming off a year of not eating meat.

2697
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:28,320
And so I feel pretty comfortable in saying that I am going to Oscar the hell out of you.

2698
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:37,800
Oh, and I have a leg up and the nutrients and the delicious, tangy flavor of crab

2699
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:43,640
mixed with a savory egg based sauce, a mother sauce, if you will.

2700
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:46,840
Yeah, it's going to be a real motherfucker for you, son.

2701
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,600
Oh, wow.

2702
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,880
I like the methodical character you have.

2703
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,840
Yeah, you know, he's not putting the voice on.

2704
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:58,400
He's he's confident in his abilities and he's just a stone cold killer.

2705
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:02,720
But he's crazy and he's got a vast supply of Bernays sauce.

2706
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:05,400
Yeah, he's going to make all of their podcasts.

2707
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:12,720
The hose, like Steve, I drive a beer truck, but the hose sprays Bernays sauce in the ring.

2708
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:14,840
Or just that to them.

2709
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,520
Like, like there was a match where Orange

2710
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:21,520
Cassidy pushed Chris Jericho into a giant vat of orange juice.

2711
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:23,920
But it's it's warm sauce.

2712
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:27,480
It's congealing. That sauce also was very difficult to make.

2713
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:30,520
And like, you got to eat it fast before it congeals.

2714
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:32,040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2715
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:33,640
That's a Dorsey Brothers song.

2716
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,600
Jason Sheridan is in the arena.

2717
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:37,280
Oh, my God.

2718
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:38,440
What's that? What's that?

2719
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:40,400
It's a big band song. What's that hose full of?

2720
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,960
Oh, my God. He's clinking, clanking crab legs together.

2721
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:46,080
We know what's about to come.

2722
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:50,400
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

2723
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:51,640
That's Jason Sheridan.

2724
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,640
Oh, yeah. And it's not it's like the the Warriors.

2725
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:59,040
But instead of Coke bottles, it's stone crab legs on my fingers.

2726
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:05,160
Oh, Wiger crab meat shall you eat in the year twenty twenty two.

2727
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:09,320
There's a crab and there's a there's a gimmick called the Brood.

2728
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:10,160
They were like vampires.

2729
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:13,360
They would do a blood bath and maybe there's like a crab bath.

2730
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,320
So there's a wrestler in the ring and crab.

2731
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,720
Oh, just crab and old bass.

2732
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,840
Just stinging the eyes.

2733
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:21,840
I know you're a heat seeker, Wiger,

2734
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:25,760
which is great because you're going right to hell.

2735
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:27,840
He's just like, you know, actually, not bad.

2736
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:29,520
Three forks.

2737
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:31,440
OK, buddy.

2738
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:33,600
Hey, that was fun. Thanks.

2739
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,200
All right.
