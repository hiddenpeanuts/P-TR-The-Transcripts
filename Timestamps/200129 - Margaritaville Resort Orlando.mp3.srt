1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,840
You go for it there.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,920
All right, fans up.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,060
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,520
My name is Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,560
Joining me as always, Skipper Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
It fins up.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,920
And Skipper Scott Gertner.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,760
I just got the same one.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,240
Two skippers on this journey.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,080
Fins up.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,920
Only one captain, you are the captain now.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,560
I am, this was a whole confusing thing

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,720
about what a skipper and a captain are.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,120
Didn't we, do we talk about this already?

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,960
I believe we talked, yeah.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,600
And then we kind of found an answer

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,560
where it's like the skipper.

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,120
Skipper steers, skipper mans the wheel.

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,480
Right, and the captain just tells him what to do, I guess?

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,320
I think so, yes.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,400
I might be wrong, anyway.

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,200
The skipper yells at the guy in the funny hat.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,760
He hits.

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
Sweater.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,880
Skipper hits the captain with his hat.

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
Yeah.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,540
That's the whole thing.

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,960
Is Gilligan the captain?

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,680
That's what, I think that's what we were talking about.

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,280
And I think we've already forgotten what we like learned.

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,600
I think Gilligan is the captain.

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,440
I don't think.

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
No, he's the first, he's the first mayor.

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
I don't think maritime hierarchy

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,520
was really well enforced on that three hour tour.

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,800
No, I don't think so.

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640
But it was just.

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,840
That was the problem.

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
Had there been a solid captain,

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,880
they never would have been in that scenario.

42
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,320
There were only two crew members on the minnow though

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,560
in Gilligan's Island, yes.

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
Two crew members of Gilligan.

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,040
I guess I think that was the full staff.

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,440
Was there a captain who died?

47
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,640
I don't think anyone died on Gilligan's Island.

48
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,880
No, but before they got there.

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,720
Oh, off screen?

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,760
During the crash, yeah, or whatever.

51
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
And they just.

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,960
Don't mention him in the opening theme.

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,720
Let's never bring this up again.

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
The dead captain.

55
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,040
The navigator.

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,080
Or the corpse of.

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,880
The navigator.

58
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,480
The bubbler.

59
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,240
They're all dead.

60
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,840
Did I ever tell the story,

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
I knew someone who worked in entertainment

62
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,600
on a cruise line when they were younger

63
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,960
and she told me facts about like,

64
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,200
well, the Lido deck, the entertainment people

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
and even some of the performers,

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,240
because they're like good with crowds

67
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
and good at communicating,

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,600
they are the ones who get in charge of the lifeboats.

69
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,160
When everyone is put on a lifeboat,

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,480
they become the one in charge.

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,720
And by the rules of the ocean,

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,600
you have to listen to them.

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,480
And also every lifeboat has a gun on it.

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,680
And so your Lido deck person doing the limbo contest

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,360
is trained how to use a firearm

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,640
should there be a mutiny in a lifeboat, potentially.

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,440
This was the long and short of it she gave me.

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,360
Oh my God.

79
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,120
So like a singing impressionist on a cruise

80
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,560
is potentially doing voices.

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,680
He'll do William Shatter

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,560
and then he'll shoot you in your head.

83
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
Settle down.

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,280
Christopher Walken.

85
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,880
The skipper is the captain.

86
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,720
What?

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,640
That's what it says.

88
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,120
Or at least Jonas Grumby, the skipper on Gillings Island,

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
which is his name. His name is Jonas Grumby.

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,520
Jonas Grumby, played by Alan Hale Jr.

91
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,520
The skipper was the owner and captain of the SS Minnow.

92
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,320
And he owned the boat.

93
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
He owned the boat.

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,040
So once back on land,

95
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,520
he has to go through a Sully-esque trial

96
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,120
about like other options he could have taken.

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Yeah.

98
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Or maybe wait, no, because if he's the owner,

99
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,680
then he's not subjected to that.

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,640
Had there been a different boat ownership company.

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
That's what you avoid by buying the boat yourself.

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Yes.

103
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,640
You never want to own the boat.

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
You never finance your own movie.

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,520
You never own your own boat.

106
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Do you know Gilligan's first name?

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,920
I didn't.

108
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,520
Vince.

109
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,000
No, Willie Gilligan.

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,640
Gilligan is the last name?

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,480
Yeah.

112
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,120
I don't think that ever occurred to me.

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,360
I thought it was like Gilligan Gooffeather.

114
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,080
Yeah, Gilligan Beckett or something.

115
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,120
Gilligan served in the United States Navy

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,440
with Jonas Grumby during an unspecified war

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
and saved him from being struck and killed

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,720
by a runaway depth charge.

119
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
Wait, so what war would it have been?

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,200
We're in the 60s?

121
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,960
I guess World War II or Korea.

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,800
Korea?

123
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,040
I think Korea.

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
Did they know, wait, no, they don't know MASH.

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,880
MASH is a different, that's not Navy.

126
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Yeah, no.

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,160
That was not a crossover.

128
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,000
No.

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,320
That would not have been a good taste.

130
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,520
But they would respect each other if they met.

131
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,400
So Gilligan was the first mate

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,840
and the skipper was the captain, the skipper.

133
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Even though it was Gilligan's island,

134
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,320
he was not the captain.

135
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,840
I'm not sure they ever called it Gilligan's island.

136
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,760
Right.

137
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
That's just what we know it as.

138
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,200
It's been Grumby's island.

139
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
Yeah.

140
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,720
I mean, I like that.

141
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
He loved the skipper.

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,040
I prefer it in the same, I'll always,

143
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,560
I really think of it as revenge of the Jedi

144
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,560
and I really think of it as Grumby's island.

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,400
I'm a purist.

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,160
The Star Wars made a lot of merch

147
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,000
that said revenge of the Jedi as well

148
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,560
because they've just tried to make as much stuff.

149
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,280
So there's like revenge of the Jedi figures

150
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,960
that maybe had like alternative costumes

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
that might've been in the movie or whatever.

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,280
There should be Grumby's island merch.

153
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,560
I would have a poster that would be Grumby's island

154
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,760
released only in France.

155
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,360
I don't know if, I don't know.

156
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Anticipation was so high for Grumby's island.

157
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,200
This episode, by the way, is all about

158
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,680
going against island, obviously.

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,560
Yeah, yep, you figured it out.

160
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,920
A show I've never seen a full episode of.

161
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
Literally.

162
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,240
I would catch it on Nick at night sometimes.

163
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,880
I've seen pieces of it,

164
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,400
but I don't think I've ever watched a full one.

165
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,840
Certainly on the Jaws episode,

166
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,840
I assume we talked about when the Harlem Globetrotters,

167
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
yeah, the Harlem Globetrotters meet,

168
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
go to Gillings Island when they throw a bunch of basketballs

169
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
into Jaws' mouth.

170
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
That's my main familiarity.

171
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,840
And then I think there's a big basketball game

172
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,320
on the island.

173
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,360
But yeah, I'm more familiar with that than the show,

174
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,200
I guess.

175
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
But I don't know how I,

176
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,720
cause I, you know, I'm like a,

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,920
I was like a Brady Bunch loving kid,

178
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
you know, when I was like nine.

179
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,360
And like, I've been like a kitsch guy my whole life.

180
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
How did I not know Jonas Grumby?

181
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
That's amazing.

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,120
I didn't know that till now.

183
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,960
Or Willie Gilligan.

184
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,800
Did you know Willie Gilligan?

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,720
No, I didn't know that either.

186
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm just less obsessed with that

188
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
cause it's not as,

189
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,680
It's not as funny.

190
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,280
Delightful as the name of Jonas Grumby was the skipper.

191
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,120
No one ever called him that.

192
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
Yeah.

193
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,280
I mean, I've never seen the show.

194
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
So maybe they did call him that every episode

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
and I don't know.

196
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,360
This is an uncle Joey scenario.

197
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,800
With the argument we've had about,

198
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,080
did anyone call Joey Gladstone uncle Joey?

199
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,920
Right.

200
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,760
Cause he's not an uncle.

201
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,280
If you know that, if did anybody call,

202
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
well, it's gotta, if we know that name

203
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
and somebody must have called him Jonas Grumby,

204
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,040
but with like the, you know,

205
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,280
would Ginger ever casually call him Jonas?

206
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,640
Right.

207
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
Let us know.

208
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
There's gotta be something.

209
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,360
I forget that we said any of this and we'll go,

210
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,400
why is someone telling us this?

211
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,720
In a year we'll have the same conversation

212
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,120
about the skipper.

213
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Probably.

214
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,800
And was he the captain?

215
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,640
Yeah.

216
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,480
Yeah.

217
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,300
What episode,

218
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,080
if you know what episode we talked about this already,

219
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,920
please let us know.

220
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,400
Are you sure we did or was this just in life in conversation?

221
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
It's all one now.

222
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,320
It's all a blur.

223
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,160
Who knows?

224
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,040
Was it content or was it our off time?

225
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,120
There's no way to know.

226
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,880
Just doing content for free.

227
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,520
None of that is what we are actually talking about today.

228
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,040
What we're talking about is Margaritaville Resort Orlando,

229
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,520
which you know from the file name,

230
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,560
but why are we talking about this?

231
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
You know, again, things we've talked about a number of times,

232
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,120
but to reacquaint everybody with the tail,

233
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
sit right back and you'll hear a tale.

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,440
How did this all play out?

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,040
Mike, a long time, Jimmy Buffett, obsessive,

236
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,480
a rare Jimmy Buffett fan under the age of 55.

237
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,760
You made a swear of all this,

238
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,360
this Buffett culture insanity.

239
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
Yes.

240
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,880
And specifically that they're opening a hotel

241
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,800
and timeshare community in Orlando.

242
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,840
Resort, can they call it a resort?

243
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,400
Mixed use was the term I saw thrown around a lot.

244
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,240
Oh sure.

245
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
Okay.

246
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
So there is like a main hotel building

247
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,960
with restaurants and bars and stuff,

248
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,680
but then there's a bunch of cottages that you can rent,

249
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,520
thus making it kind of a bigger campus.

250
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,840
Thus there being a lot of street names

251
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,600
and official street names that had to be figured out.

252
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,280
Approved by a city, like it's a real.

253
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
Yeah.

254
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
Yeah.

255
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,080
Real city streets.

256
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,080
So at some point, you must've been on an email list.

257
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,560
Yeah, I've just done the general, you know,

258
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
Margaritaville fans email list, I assume.

259
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,200
I don't think it was anything special.

260
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,520
And there was an email that was,

261
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,760
they were inviting fans to name,

262
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,400
help name the streets at this new resort,

263
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,760
this mixed use place.

264
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,600
Yeah.

265
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,880
And ultimately you go, now that you look around there,

266
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
I feel like there's like probably

267
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,400
only like nine streets all told.

268
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,680
I kind of figured it was going to be so sprawling.

269
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,520
Yeah.

270
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,600
That they needed a giant amount,

271
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,560
which is why we sent the giant amount.

272
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,400
In a event that presaged the podcast.

273
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,240
Yes.

274
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,080
The three of us. By year two?

275
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,520
Yeah, over a year.

276
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,600
The three of us and Anthony Geo,

277
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,680
eerily that is the group.

278
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
Yes.

279
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,400
All coming up with together 100

280
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,720
Jimmy Buffett related street names

281
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,840
to send to this, this email person

282
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,360
that probably never anticipated,

283
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,640
that maybe anticipated getting like three or four ideas

284
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,040
from a couple of people.

285
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,160
Yes, did not expect 100 I don't think,

286
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,560
but never like at least had a poker face about being shocked

287
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,800
if they were shocked at the amount.

288
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,240
And let's just say what we knew of this resort then

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
was very blue sky.

290
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,120
It seems like it was going to be very grand.

291
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,800
Yeah. Wonderful concept.

292
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,280
Wonderful concept.

293
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,600
And it also seemed like it was going to be very finished.

294
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
Which maybe it will.

295
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,720
Which maybe it will.

296
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
There's still, there's still,

297
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
there's still working on it,

298
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,760
which is very clear when you go there.

299
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
But yeah, I, you know, honestly,

300
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,280
and then, you know, so this is in Orlando

301
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,600
and it's not that far from Disney world.

302
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,120
So I thought, you know, like we start this podcast,

303
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,280
we've had this obsession with this Margaritaville resort.

304
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,760
I knew it, it seemed inevitable that we'd all be

305
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,040
at Disney world together at some point in time.

306
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,520
I think my picture of it was always that

307
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,320
we would all rent a cottage together and be hanging out.

308
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,880
And that that would be the grandest week we ever had.

309
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,360
The combo of Disney world and Universal

310
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,360
and that we're in this crazy, nice, luxurious resort

311
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,680
and keeping prices low by all splitting this fun party house.

312
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
I think that's what I imagined we would end up doing.

313
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
It didn't happen. I hate to go back.

314
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,640
Should we do a little,

315
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
should we say a little of the names that we submitted?

316
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
I mean, we've certainly done this and tweeted it,

317
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,760
but feel free.

318
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,600
No, I know.

319
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,440
Try to say ones you don't think we've said before.

320
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,600
It's a good reminder, some good callbacks.

321
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
I just found the email thread and they,

322
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,760
I think I've said a little of this before,

323
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,360
but they, you know, they're giving you the,

324
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
you name it, Jimmy Buffett related things.

325
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,920
And then say like Alley Bay Boulevard Circle.

326
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,160
So just a few of them.

327
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Again, we won't do all of them.

328
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,480
Cajun Court, Damp Ramp, Rumba Ridge.

329
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,400
I think these are all yours.

330
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,840
Yours were at the end.

331
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,600
Winkin' Whale Way.

332
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,440
Was that me?

333
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,280
I forget.

334
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,760
I don't think that's me.

335
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,480
Boogie Board Bend, Five O'clock Cove,

336
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,640
Steel Drum Summit, Tailgate Turnpike.

337
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,480
These are all by the way.

338
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,080
I think we all wanted to not,

339
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,920
we wanted to slip a couple weirder ones in,

340
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,960
but we wanted a good shot at getting an actual street.

341
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
There's some broad ones in there.

342
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,400
A lot.

343
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,360
And my, the one I like the best that I submitted

344
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
is Marshall Park named after Jimmy,

345
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,600
and I wrote after Jimmy's friend,

346
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,840
movie producer, Frank Marshall,

347
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
which that did not happen, but.

348
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,680
Skip and Work Circle, Tomcat Trail,

349
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,920
Moonshine Alley, Jerk Circle.

350
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,000
Or no, my favorite of yours, Scott,

351
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,480
was Short Street, I remember.

352
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,600
Short Street.

353
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,160
Anyway, and then David wrote back,

354
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,720
awesome list, Mike, really appreciate your creativity

355
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,360
and time to put this together.

356
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,440
I will keep you posted on the results.

357
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,560
He thinks you're one guy too, right?

358
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,680
Yeah, I mean, I did not want to like take credit.

359
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,080
I guess I did take credit for all of it,

360
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,800
but I don't want to be like my three friends and I.

361
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
You're trying to be like Tyler Perry saying,

362
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,720
you don't have a writer's room.

363
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,960
I guess that is what's gonna happen.

364
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
That's what I'm doing now.

365
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,040
But sure enough.

366
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,320
Do you want me to email David Hurst back right now

367
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,160
and explain that it was not just me?

368
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
No, no, I'm just saying his perception.

369
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Oh, I see, I see, yeah.

370
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,920
He just receives like a hundred from one man.

371
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,960
Right. Yeah, yeah.

372
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,800
I mean, I think.

373
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,640
So he's on eggshells because like this is a crazy man.

374
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,040
Yeah, I think my idea was it was funnier.

375
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,280
Even if I just was like. It is, yeah.

376
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,560
Yeah, because I wasn't, yeah.

377
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
No, I agree with that.

378
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,000
Look, we're getting plenty of credit here

379
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
with our audience. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
We're getting it.

381
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
Now, what I think you should do with this person

382
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,560
is email him and say, hey, we got to go down there.

383
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,720
We loved it.

384
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,000
We walked around and we're so excited

385
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,320
that you used one of our names

386
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,400
and see if you get an acknowledgement.

387
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,080
That's, I think, the missing component.

388
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
We should have congratulated ourselves

389
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,280
and said, you're welcome or because,

390
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,080
and we've covered all this on the main feed

391
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
at some point in time,

392
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,560
but in that list of a hundred, they did use one.

393
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,000
And that name is Dreamsicle Drive.

394
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,840
Yes, and it is one of his, Jimmy's songs is,

395
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,520
he has a song called Dreamsicle.

396
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,120
But I'm just saying, well, I'm taking credit for it,

397
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,800
but also maybe someone else submitted it.

398
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,920
I shouldn't even think that.

399
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,360
It's crossed my mind.

400
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,880
It's occurred to me that maybe that was like one

401
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
that was already on the list or somebody else submitted it,

402
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,920
but I think we can't go there.

403
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,880
I think we have to operate from. We did it, we got it.

404
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,640
We named a street in America.

405
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,000
There's only so many of those.

406
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,040
It's such a huge honor.

407
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,720
We're not asking for a lot.

408
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,400
I don't think we're asking.

409
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,240
I don't think it's unreasonable.

410
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,400
I realize now, David, the last email I sent David,

411
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,120
he didn't respond.

412
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,640
He does not work for this company.

413
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,800
He has already gotten out of there.

414
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,760
I said, so after this and like four months later,

415
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,480
I said, hey, David, just following up,

416
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,880
how did the naming go?

417
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,960
And he said, Mike, we submitted over 50 names

418
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
to the county for approval.

419
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,800
Oh, once we finalize our site plan,

420
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,040
we will assign names to streets probably late this summer.

421
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,440
This is 2016.

422
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
Have a great holiday weekend.

423
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,680
We have to know what,

424
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,840
I want to know what that list of 50 was.

425
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,960
We must've had more on there.

426
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,200
We must've like really helped flesh out that 50.

427
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,520
I mean, surely the county would not have taken along

428
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,440
with moonshine in it or jerk in it.

429
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,840
Yeah, when I submitted Drink and Drive,

430
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,560
which doesn't seem like they would like name a street,

431
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,880
but I wanted to see if I could sneak it in.

432
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,880
May 27th, 2016, then I emailed David March 27th, 2018.

433
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,160
And I say, hey there, David,

434
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,920
just wondering if the final streets were,

435
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,400
or the street names were ever finalized.

436
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,480
Thanks, no response.

437
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,680
Now he may have sniffed out by this point,

438
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,880
we are not, or you are not a person

439
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,280
who's going to buy property at this resort.

440
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,400
Well, that's another good point

441
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,280
because I kept getting emails

442
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
from a different email address.

443
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,560
You got the perspective.

444
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,400
Asking me.

445
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,240
Perspectives.

446
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
If I wanted to put a hundred grand down

447
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,640
to buy one of these places.

448
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,480
Mm-hmm.

449
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,840
And I did not put a hundred grand down.

450
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,880
Do I regret it?

451
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,720
No.

452
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,920
Did I ever explain to you guys how

453
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,520
I was always pitching the idea to our friend,

454
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,280
had not been on the show,

455
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,880
but our constant and real life friend, Andrew Grissom,

456
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,720
that I was saying like,

457
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,120
and I think like, you know,

458
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,360
what could be cool is we all go in

459
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,840
on this Margaritaville cottage,

460
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,560
and like, don't you think that'd be fun?

461
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,240
And he was really cross about it.

462
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,600
Like, no, why would I do that?

463
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,320
Like, why would you not want to like,

464
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,120
go hang out at a time,

465
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
like we're going to go to Florida

466
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,880
and all live in a house together?

467
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,920
And he, we had several of these conversations

468
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,800
before I realized he thought I meant

469
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
we were all going to buy it together.

470
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,640
Oh.

471
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,400
Because he was so cross.

472
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,240
It's like, what?

473
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,760
We're going to go to a house that has like a hot tub

474
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,840
and we're all going to hang out and get drunk.

475
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,960
He thought you were doing an actual

476
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
Yeah.

477
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
Time share presentation.

478
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,960
Yeah.

479
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
He was.

480
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,960
Which he's correct if that's what he thought.

481
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,120
If me suggesting that seven adults

482
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,080
all buy a Florida time share together

483
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,280
in equal, but that is a terrible plan.

484
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,160
He was mad.

485
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,240
I, he wasn't mad at me,

486
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,880
but I believe I threw it out to him

487
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
to name some streets and he refused.

488
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,200
Man of principle.

489
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,480
Man of principle.

490
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm pretty sure it's not a joke.

491
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,920
I think he was the only other person I asked,

492
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,200
like, hey, you know, we're naming some streets

493
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
if you want to get in on this.

494
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
And I think he was,

495
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,640
I think he didn't know what I was talking about.

496
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,480
And thus he's never appeared on the podcast.

497
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,320
That's right.

498
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,160
That's right.

499
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah.

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,840
We had to have gotten in on this.

501
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,680
Before you committed, have been on,

502
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,920
have logged now logged the hours.

503
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,320
January 2016.

504
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,160
Wow.

505
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Wow.

506
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,820
Yeah.

507
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,900
No.

508
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,740
Yeah.

509
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,300
Could scarcely have dreamed of what was to come

510
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,860
this entire podcast and that we would successfully

511
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,220
name a street and then that we would all

512
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,300
get to go there together.

513
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,380
As you listeners know,

514
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,900
we were all in Orlando together in October

515
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,340
and thus we were afforded the opportunity

516
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,340
to go not by they would invite us or anything.

517
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,780
No, it was like, well, we certainly have to go

518
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,980
and see Dreamsicle Drive for ourselves.

519
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,220
So we took time out of a kind of tight week

520
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,580
in which we were trying to spend, you know,

521
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,180
in fun theme parks.

522
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,940
We carved out a couple hours

523
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,260
to make sure we stopped by the Margaritaville resort.

524
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,140
We took a lift.

525
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,740
We all shared a lift.

526
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,940
Mike, you brought this up in the live show in Orlando,

527
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,060
but there was the very funny detail

528
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,780
that the driver as we're pulling in is like,

529
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,740
hmm, what's all this?

530
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,820
I've never been here before.

531
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,340
I've never been here before.

532
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,340
I've never taken anyone here.

533
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
What's this about?

534
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,100
And like these Orlando drivers,

535
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,940
Lyft Uber, whatever, probably taxi,

536
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,580
like they know everything so well.

537
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,500
That is something you know,

538
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,660
cause it's such a tourist place.

539
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,620
Sometimes in Los Angeles,

540
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,340
I think so many people have just started driving.

541
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,500
Sometimes people, I feel like I'm in a Lyft Uber in LA,

542
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,940
they don't necessarily know this place

543
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,220
and it's obviously packed.

544
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,060
It's got so much stuff.

545
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,060
Orlando, nine times out of 10,

546
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,380
when you're in those cars, people know everything.

547
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,260
They know all the hotels.

548
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,580
There's so many hotels.

549
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,300
And they're like, oh, you're going to the Marriott Village,

550
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,020
you're not going to the Marriott Plaza.

551
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,100
Okay, got it.

552
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,540
And they're retired cast members.

553
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,340
They're other like, they know everything.

554
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,140
Yeah, and he had never,

555
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,980
he had never been there.

556
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,940
He had never taken anyone there for any reason.

557
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,780
And it took a while too,

558
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,380
cause we went from Disney Springs

559
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,460
to Margaritaville Resort.

560
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,780
Margaritaville Resort, close to Animal Kingdom.

561
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,620
Yeah.

562
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,460
Yeah.

563
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,860
Which I now, first of all, let me say, thank God we did not.

564
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,460
For that, as soon as I saw the distance, I was like,

565
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,540
oh, thank God we didn't stay here

566
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,300
and then try to commute into Disney World.

567
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,500
The old trip reminded me,

568
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,340
it's like pretty important to be on campus

569
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,060
or exceedingly near campus.

570
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,900
Yeah.

571
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,940
Or getting around is going to be a huge pain in the ass.

572
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,540
Maybe important context to say also,

573
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,740
when did this hotel open?

574
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,700
Was it beginning of 2019?

575
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,740
It's so confusing, the timeline.

576
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,580
Yeah.

577
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,780
It seems like 2018.

578
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,100
They were supposed to be open earlier.

579
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,380
Yeah, we kept seeing updates and what's up.

580
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,380
There's a lot of drama behind the scenes.

581
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,220
Yeah.

582
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,900
There's at least one lawsuit happening.

583
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,540
And didn't, now on the way to this,

584
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,060
somebody who we were talking to

585
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,900
to coordinate things for Orlando trip,

586
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,220
didn't somebody say, give us the little info,

587
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,460
it's not going well.

588
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,420
Well, somebody, yes, somebody told us that

589
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,780
Buffett had pulled out of ownership.

590
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,620
Wow.

591
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,700
The actual Margaritaville company

592
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,620
and they were licensing the name.

593
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,140
They're distancing themselves.

594
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,420
In a very Trump manner.

595
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,260
Yes.

596
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,780
There's a lot of Trump properties that the Trump,

597
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,420
it's just the name stamped on it,

598
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,980
but nobody in the Trump organization operates it.

599
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,660
Right, so there's still a lot of Buffett stuff,

600
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,540
especially in that hotel, obviously,

601
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,660
but he's not actually involved anymore.

602
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,740
That's very confusing to me because one thing I learned

603
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,180
is that the presidential suite

604
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,300
is called the Jimmy Buffett suite.

605
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,340
In the hotel?

606
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,180
Yeah.

607
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,940
Yeah, that name, that's printed on the outside.

608
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,220
Well, there's so much stuff inside,

609
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,140
it's like his lyrics and stuff are printed around too.

610
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,860
And they're selling all the merch.

611
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,300
Yeah, they're selling the blender

612
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,220
and all the streets are named after his songs.

613
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,060
Right.

614
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,100
So this is a weird distinction

615
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,140
that he has nothing to do with it,

616
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,140
but they're licensing, it's a Tokyo Disney situation.

617
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,260
I think by necessity and not by choice, maybe.

618
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,900
I can give, okay, a little bit of time.

619
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,420
So the vlogger Tim Tracker,

620
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,140
who posted the walkthrough where someone spotted

621
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,980
one of the streets.

622
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,820
That's how we know.

623
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,660
That's how he named it.

624
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,860
He did a very thorough,

625
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,980
his video was published on February 5th, 2019.

626
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,340
And in it, he a few times goes like,

627
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,820
so this isn't open yet.

628
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,820
Or like this seems, they just took the walls down.

629
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Like there's a couple of moments like that.

630
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,980
So that's early 2019.

631
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,700
We can pin that down.

632
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,980
Technically open, people can walk around it,

633
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,940
but a lot of stuff not operational.

634
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,940
So surely by October, they have their shit together, right?

635
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,420
Our-

636
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,780
And remember we named stuff in January, 2016.

637
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,900
Yeah.

638
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Long time ago.

639
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,740
I saw the estimate at this property

640
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,740
in a news article at $750 million.

641
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,860
Does that sound high?

642
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,740
For like the full comp,

643
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,580
if you think about the full- That's what it cost

644
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,700
to build everything they built?

645
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,100
The full, yeah, building, licensing,

646
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,620
utility, like that's what I saw the estimate at.

647
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,420
And they also had to probably bulldoze that,

648
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,460
the China-

649
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,460
The Chinese, what?

650
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,300
Not a theme park.

651
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,900
Like actual China, like physical China sort of stuff.

652
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,740
Wasn't it?

653
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,580
Yeah.

654
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,420
I don't remember what- I don't know what that was.

655
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,020
People kept calling it a park.

656
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,340
It seemed very-

657
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,780
It seemed like a garden.

658
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,620
So that's probably what,

659
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,620
like a Chinese gardens kind of situation.

660
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,820
Yes.

661
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,660
Yeah.

662
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,260
I think the tin tracker referred to it

663
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,340
as like a roadside attraction.

664
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,020
The nice way you refer to like ball of,

665
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,660
largest ball of yarn.

666
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,500
Sure.

667
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,340
Yes, okay.

668
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,380
So, yeah, that number doesn't ring true with me,

669
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,340
mainly because of the houses,

670
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,660
but here maybe that's okay.

671
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,740
So let's get to this moment where,

672
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,660
so we land and I was going through my videos and photos

673
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,500
and there's a video where the driver says,

674
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
so wait, where do you want me to drop you off?

675
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,180
And I very pointedly say,

676
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,140
oh, right here on Dreamsicle Drive.

677
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,220
It was really the hammiest I could do it.

678
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,180
We didn't tell him though, right?

679
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,140
We weren't, we didn't try to confuse him by saying,

680
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,580
we made the street.

681
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,420
No, yeah, I think that would have been

682
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,660
exceedingly confusing.

683
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,620
Yeah, yeah.

684
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,420
We also like, there's a gate,

685
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,060
there was a gate and we're like,

686
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,860
I was like, okay, what lie do we say?

687
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,700
What lie do we-

688
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,140
And he just went, drop it off.

689
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,540
And they were like, okay.

690
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,740
And that was all they took.

691
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,460
The only thing that might've been weird is that again,

692
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,500
no one had ever been dropped off there before.

693
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,540
No one has dropped off.

694
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,700
That's never happened.

695
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,420
No one gets out of here.

696
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,900
No one gets out of here alive.

697
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,700
Shet, bail, dive out of the car windows.

698
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,420
In that same video, Jason, you say,

699
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,740
oh, we're meeting somebody.

700
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,900
You like jam in, you get the excuse in to the driver.

701
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,620
You were so anxious even before this started.

702
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,780
I will say- I think I was right.

703
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,060
I don't know why, this place made me very,

704
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,860
the hotel was fine.

705
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,660
We didn't get attacked by ghosts though.

706
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,700
We were just saying-

707
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,780
No, but just the, it is rare you go to Orlando,

708
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,460
a place notable for its crowds.

709
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,540
And it's just empty.

710
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,380
This was so empty.

711
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,660
And I think that and the combination that for a while,

712
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,540
we were just standing on a street corner,

713
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,140
like in the eyeline of the guard shack,

714
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,980
of like the secondary entrance to the property.

715
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,620
And every time I would look over,

716
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,060
they would be looking at us.

717
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,460
And I'm like, oh my God.

718
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,220
You saw guards looking at us?

719
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,780
Yeah, you guys didn't notice that?

720
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,620
No.

721
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,020
Like across the street, there was a different,

722
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,140
there was the side entrance to the property

723
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,220
and there was a gate.

724
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,940
When we were at Dreamsicle Drive?

725
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,620
Yeah, and people kept coming out

726
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,460
and like looking right at us.

727
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,140
I did not notice that whatsoever.

728
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,980
Okay.

729
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,820
So that might change the context.

730
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,180
I think that may have like,

731
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,500
I had been like, oh God, are we gonna get lost?

732
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,780
Are we gonna?

733
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,980
Just cause it just felt like,

734
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,660
you know how when you wanna be at Disney World,

735
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,580
time goes so fast and you're like,

736
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,500
I wish you could just move slower.

737
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,980
This was the place in Orlando where it felt like

738
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,500
time was moving very slowly to me.

739
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,100
And I think our show was that night too, right?

740
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,780
Our show was that night and I was like,

741
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,740
oh God, we gotta get back up I-4 to my hotel

742
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,220
to work on the show and then get to the hotel.

743
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,060
Sure.

744
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,700
So I'm always a little like anxious before I perform.

745
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,660
I'm always a little like in like show mode days anyway.

746
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,060
You don't feel like walking around

747
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,740
in a mostly abandoned timeshare community.

748
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,460
Well, and I had such a nice time with you guys

749
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,460
at Disney Springs, like we had such a,

750
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,900
Disney Springs is so nice and I had such a nice time

751
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,540
even though I walked out of the restaurant

752
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,860
without my credit card.

753
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,980
Oh yes, you were chased down.

754
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,820
That's right.

755
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,140
I was just so, it's such a high.

756
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,180
And then like, we're just driving.

757
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,140
We ate at the boathouse.

758
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,700
And then we were just driving forever

759
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,820
and then we'd just show up at like

760
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,980
an empty housing development.

761
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,380
And I was like, oh no, like highest highs, lowest lows.

762
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,220
And I think I-

763
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,260
Kicked down to the, yeah.

764
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,740
You wanted, it was just like you had not,

765
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,980
I had not seen you that anxious all trip.

766
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,100
You wanted to leave immediately

767
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,940
and you kept saying like, I'm freaked out.

768
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,460
This is freaking me out.

769
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,460
Yeah, I don't know.

770
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,980
I did not see the guards either but-

771
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,620
Bad energy, like just a bad vibes from that place.

772
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,500
Did you think though, maybe the guards were just like,

773
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
oh, I've never seen somebody on that street before.

774
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,340
Like, huh?

775
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,260
Wow, a person.

776
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,500
There's a couple of people over there, huh?

777
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,700
Are they still there?

778
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,780
Yeah, they are.

779
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,620
Certainly we weren't doing anything wrong.

780
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,700
There was no trespassing occurring.

781
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,220
That was the vibe I got from you, Jason.

782
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,460
I thought you were, I thought you,

783
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,940
you seemed very much operating from

784
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,900
we're doing something wrong, which we were not.

785
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,620
We're walking around a resort where anyone can go.

786
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,980
Well, kind of.

787
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,180
I think the hotel is more public property than like the,

788
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,100
But there's never like a,

789
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,900
there's never like a, who are you here to see?

790
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,980
That's true.

791
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,300
That's what makes it different.

792
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,380
I had a relative at the place Leisure World

793
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,100
in Orange County, he has a check-in station,

794
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,500
like, okay, give us the name.

795
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,580
And it's not that scenario.

796
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,620
So that to me indicates it's fine.

797
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,820
Anybody can go there.

798
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,900
I think it took me a while to process like,

799
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,500
oh, they don't have their shit together finishing this.

800
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
They surely wouldn't have their shit together

801
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,780
for operational security.

802
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,660
But I think anywhere, I think any like resort

803
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,940
that has a bunch of like villas and stuff,

804
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,020
I think you can go to.

805
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,500
I don't think that's a problem at all.

806
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,740
I have, I certainly have your good boy instinct of like,

807
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,780
oh, we're gonna get in trouble.

808
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,620
But if it's for the podcast now,

809
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,740
I do, my brain overrides that by saying,

810
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,700
it would be maybe the funniest, greatest thing of all time

811
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,980
if we were kicked out of the Margaritaville Resort.

812
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,940
That would be the greatest.

813
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,900
I guess that's true.

814
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,020
You're a little more, yeah, you're a little more.

815
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,540
But I'm not, I'm saying I have that instinct,

816
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,300
but then I go, man, wouldn't this be great

817
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,980
if the security comes over and I don't,

818
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,820
what would they even do?

819
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,780
I mean, obviously like, hopefully they don't kill us,

820
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,340
but they shouldn't kill us.

821
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,140
They shouldn't kill us, but you never know

822
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,540
if they call Florida cops, you never know.

823
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,220
And even killing us is in the picture for you.

824
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,060
I wasn't saying they were gonna kill us.

825
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,460
I didn't say they were gonna kill us.

826
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,300
I wasn't worried they were.

827
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
There was no problem here whatsoever.

828
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,140
I'm just saying, wouldn't it be funny

829
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,380
if we ended up in the Margaritaville jail or something?

830
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,660
Like that would be great.

831
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,100
That would be so funny.

832
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,580
A laid back jail with pastel colors.

833
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,140
Yeah, with Jimmy Buffett lyrics on the wall.

834
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,260
Little umbrellas stuck to the bars.

835
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,100
Yeah.

836
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,180
I mean, you also, just the fear of the unknown.

837
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,620
You don't know the people who closed quickly

838
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,700
and set up shop at the villas.

839
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,460
Like you don't know what you're getting from that.

840
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,980
Well. Those kinds of characters.

841
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,540
I poo-pooed your they'll kill us thing.

842
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,700
It is possible there are a number of gun owners in the.

843
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,540
That's true.

844
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,380
Margaritaville.

845
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,100
I don't think they would come out of their balcony

846
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,460
and just fire around.

847
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,300
But maybe.

848
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,140
I don't know, maybe.

849
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,100
You actually have changed my perspective with it.

850
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,340
They go out on their porch.

851
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,180
Like.

852
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,220
Someone's on Instagram live out here.

853
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,460
There's a.

854
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,300
Boom.

855
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,140
There's a gun tapes to that, like Jimmy Buffett style chair.

856
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,540
They're always hawking out on their balcony.

857
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,260
They like rip it down and just like nail the three of us.

858
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,020
Thank God none of us were in hoodies.

859
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,860
Oh my God.

860
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,700
Jesus.

861
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,380
That's too chilling.

862
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,060
But I, okay.

863
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,540
So we're.

864
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,540
We did a little Instagram video that people might have watched.

865
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,020
Celebrate reveling in a dreamsicle drive.

866
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,980
Which intersects with several streets.

867
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,460
Fins up circle.

868
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,020
Latitude lane.

869
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,940
And sea plane lane.

870
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,900
So it covers a lot of ground.

871
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,580
Now these are called streets,

872
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,860
but they might more accurately be referred to

873
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,900
as parking lots.

874
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,180
The bulk of this is empty parking spaces.

875
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,420
That's so much of what we walked through.

876
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,460
We posted a couple of photos.

877
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,700
We will post more.

878
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,540
But this was just,

879
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,060
this was mainly like walking through a giant parking lot

880
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,060
that incidentally happened to have some like children's,

881
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,060
they looked like giant kids play houses

882
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,380
is what these houses look like.

883
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,220
Yeah.

884
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,060
They're there.

885
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,900
What would you, yeah.

886
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,860
Pastel colors.

887
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,700
Yeah.

888
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,100
Basically yellow, blue, orange.

889
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,620
And I mean the big thing that I noticed

890
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,060
and it's a little better by the hotel.

891
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,420
Minimal landscaping.

892
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,820
Like not a lot of greenery.

893
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,660
Yes.

894
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,100
There's a lot of like sections

895
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,180
where you just see open swamp land.

896
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,020
Yeah.

897
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,860
Open marsh.

898
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,700
Zero.

899
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,020
It's definitely not like lakes.

900
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,980
Portrayed it all the concept art is lakes.

901
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,820
Yeah.

902
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,140
It looks like, it's like mining runoff.

903
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,740
Like it looks like runoff or I don't know.

904
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
It's brown.

905
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,540
It's very brown water.

906
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,740
And there's just no privacy in between cottages.

907
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,180
They're right on top of each other.

908
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,340
And there's like no trees, no fences.

909
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,860
It's all like a share.

910
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,100
If you imagine if 12 houses all have one shared,

911
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,780
thin, narrow backyard.

912
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,020
That's all like stones instead of grass.

913
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,020
And then you all have Margaritaville branded jacuzzis.

914
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,620
Which seem to be entirely industrial plastic.

915
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,460
Yeah.

916
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,580
That look like they have Margaritaville advertisements

917
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,420
on this.

918
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,380
Like they look like shit.

919
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,420
The Margaritaville jacuzzis look like shit.

920
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
Yeah.

921
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,100
The whole thing, I get this,

922
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,300
this whole thing was kind of like a perma fire festival.

923
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,140
Yeah.

924
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,700
It felt in the way that like all those structures

925
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,220
were like FEMA air drops and sort of falling apart.

926
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,340
And there's just like a lot of tarps peeling and,

927
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,980
you know, you could see with the right color correction

928
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,620
and aerial shot of this area, it might look like sand,

929
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,980
but you're there in person and you realize,

930
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,380
oh, there's maybe, I might call this dirt.

931
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,980
I guess a thin line between sand and dirt.

932
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,860
If like a hurricane, I think I said this

933
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,740
in one of our previous episodes,

934
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,580
a hurricane came, those things are flying away,

935
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,500
it feels like.

936
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,940
Like those, it feels like they didn't even like

937
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,420
bolt them to the ground.

938
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,340
There's no stuff.

939
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,660
Like they just, yeah, set them down on top of the land.

940
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,580
And there's such rows that I think they would

941
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,020
topple like dominoes.

942
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,700
If we leaned on one of them.

943
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,540
I think so.

944
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,740
Yeah, fall, fallen over.

945
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,220
Whoops, it's like peewee in the bikes.

946
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,900
In the whole.

947
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,740
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

948
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,300
And they would go around, yeah, the whole resort would have.

949
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,380
I think so.

950
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,260
Next line, next line, next line.

951
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,820
Like a giant domino rally.

952
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,980
Which would have been really fun.

953
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,380
Again, also would look very impressive in an aerial shot,

954
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,340
but would be less, and then we'd get shot, maybe.

955
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,180
Maybe.

956
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,740
But maybe we could tequila our way out of it.

957
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,340
I wish with a fun dance.

958
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,900
Trying to find a picture, but I can't seem to find it,

959
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,900
of the rubber utility line, hoses,

960
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,660
just sticking out of the ground.

961
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,500
Oh, that's what those were.

962
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,980
Yeah, it's a bunch of like black, just loose wires.

963
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,900
Loose wires, loose gravel, just like, unbuilt lots.

964
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,580
Unbuilt, like, lots you'd think,

965
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,340
this is a little close to the main building.

966
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,380
You'd think you would have finished these,

967
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,020
or at least put some temporary plantings, or something.

968
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,780
It feels, if a plane accidentally lost some fuel,

969
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,060
or some gasoline, while passing by above.

970
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,940
Oh no.

971
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,500
And it's sprinkled in the wrong place.

972
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,380
It might all just like, poof.

973
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
If somebody lights a cigarette in there.

974
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,180
It might be bad news.

975
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Or a cigar, because there is a cigar bar in the main hotel.

976
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,420
I mean, we're making our way.

977
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,260
We're making our way.

978
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,420
We're heading over there.

979
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,660
Chronologically, the way we made it through,

980
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,020
that was the other thing.

981
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,020
The space felt like, I couldn't tell if we were three miles

982
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,060
from the hotel, or two blocks.

983
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,380
And I guess it was kind of in between.

984
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,340
We were probably maybe like, a little under a mile.

985
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,180
Like, I don't know.

986
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,260
We were wandering in and out.

987
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,420
We were at a far point, certainly.

988
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,260
We were at a far point, but it was closer than it.

989
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,140
I mean, it's far.

990
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,420
It does go for a while.

991
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,860
And there's a bunch of land

992
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,100
that they haven't even started building, seemingly yet.

993
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,980
I think that's right.

994
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,820
There's a phase two that may never occur.

995
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,460
I feel kind of, I don't know.

996
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,900
I think I also just feel bad for the people

997
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,700
who may have got in on this, thinking it was gonna be like,

998
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,780
this will be our investment,

999
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,980
our vacation home, our tropical paradise.

1000
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,820
And it's like, oh no.

1001
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,300
We love Jimmy Buffett.

1002
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,580
We're gonna be living with a bunch of Jimmy Buffett fans.

1003
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,340
Oh no. We're gonna be all drunk

1004
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,780
and horny together.

1005
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,900
Lou Perlman Jr. took our money

1006
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,060
and is in another country now.

1007
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,780
And it's like a key party,

1008
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,260
but you don't even need the keys.

1009
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,500
Just like, all the doors are open.

1010
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,540
Just go in, have sex with my wife whenever you want.

1011
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,900
Lift up the side of the whole house, sneak under.

1012
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,740
Sure.

1013
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,340
You don't even have to have the door unlocked.

1014
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,380
All right. Pleasure having sex with you.

1015
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,740
You too.

1016
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,580
Bye bye now.

1017
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,060
And yeah, it's very possible.

1018
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,620
People very early were like, holy shit.

1019
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,540
This is, it's not the retirement homes

1020
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,660
that Jimmy Buffett is also building and has built.

1021
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,580
That's latitude Margueriteville.

1022
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,460
That is latitude Margueriteville.

1023
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,980
55 and older, I believe.

1024
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,500
Yes. This is a different situation.

1025
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,060
This is if you don't need assisted living necessarily.

1026
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,540
Yeah. This is a place to spend your last few mobile years.

1027
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,220
Yeah. So.

1028
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,700
This is also not a casino, a Margueriteville casino.

1029
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,740
Oh no, there are those.

1030
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,740
Which you probably are safer putting your money there.

1031
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,460
Than.

1032
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,540
Now we definitely, I also,

1033
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,940
I definitely have a photo of just a bunch of like

1034
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,700
cement blocks, all that are like half formed something,

1035
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,900
but they just bailed on it.

1036
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,140
Like, I would get to that later.

1037
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,980
Yeah, whatever.

1038
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,460
There's a really good photo of the two of you,

1039
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,700
like under a little shack, sort of dispiritedly pointing

1040
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,500
out to a, like to a marsh, to a green tarp fence

1041
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,980
that's peeling off.

1042
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,900
What would be interesting is, sorry.

1043
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,740
Oh, go ahead.

1044
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
I was just gonna say like the walkways,

1045
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
when you try to walk like between streets,

1046
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,820
there would be a walkway, you know,

1047
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,740
like sometimes how you like, it's not the sidewalk,

1048
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,660
but there's a walkway between two houses to get

1049
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,460
to the other street in between some of the houses.

1050
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,300
Yeah.

1051
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,340
And those felt so unfinished.

1052
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,380
And it did feel like you were trespassing.

1053
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,340
That, yeah, that I wasn't sure like, is this public street

1054
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,340
or is this just like a guy getting from his front yard

1055
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
to his backyard?

1056
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Unclear.

1057
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,140
I think that whatever it seemed to indicate that,

1058
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,660
cause like, you know, where I grew up in the suburbs,

1059
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,740
there would be those types of things that you would walk

1060
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,540
from, it wouldn't be a sidewalk around with a street.

1061
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,900
It would just be kind of a little shortcut through houses.

1062
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,340
But the houses would have a nice space in between them.

1063
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,180
So clear, this fence thing.

1064
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,500
And it would be a clear, yeah, fences

1065
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,580
and a little walkway to get to the other street.

1066
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,420
You should not buy property somewhere

1067
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,780
where it's not clear what is property.

1068
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,020
I don't, it was not like when we were walking through,

1069
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,340
it was like our shoulders were hitting both houses,

1070
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,260
but it feels like that in my mind.

1071
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,940
Like there's a phrase we haven't even said yet.

1072
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,100
The bike share set up.

1073
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,220
Oh.

1074
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,420
Do we remember that?

1075
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,380
Not really. No.

1076
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,940
Okay.

1077
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,020
There was multiple bike share stations,

1078
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,020
like download the app to unlock this bicycle.

1079
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,060
Right, right.

1080
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,580
And they were all very full.

1081
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,780
Like they all were installed.

1082
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,620
Right.

1083
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,140
And they're like, download the app here to check it out.

1084
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,180
We should have ridden bikes around.

1085
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,020
That would have been fun.

1086
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,860
That would have been fun.

1087
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,980
Yeah. Yeah.

1088
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,980
But at this point, the desperation was kicking in

1089
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,460
to keep moving and get over to the hotel

1090
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,820
where we knew it was safe.

1091
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,540
Now, because I love bizarre decaying places

1092
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,380
and abandoned, not that I'm going into,

1093
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,660
I don't go into like fully abandoned malls or anything,

1094
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,300
but I like when like, oh, this should be full of people

1095
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,460
and it is not, this is some weird capitalism.

1096
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,900
Like things like that, I really eat up

1097
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,420
the surprise electronics episode coming soon.

1098
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,260
Speaking of, so I'm like, I'm eating all of this up.

1099
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,980
And at some point I said to Jason,

1100
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,300
or just to both of you, like,

1101
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,060
I think this is my favorite thing of the trip.

1102
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,220
And Jason shot back immediately.

1103
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
Oh, fuck you.

1104
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,340
I saw you were teasing me.

1105
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,780
And I was just like.

1106
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,780
When we say that, like I sometimes, you know,

1107
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,260
sometimes I'm exaggerating if I'm telling a story about you,

1108
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,700
but we are not exaggerating that you were like on edge

1109
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
this whole time.

1110
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,740
I think like five things hit me at once,

1111
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,100
including like feeling bad if people who live there

1112
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,740
and like, we're just making fun of their

1113
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,580
unfortunate decision.

1114
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,940
But I guess we didn't see any of them.

1115
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,340
So you need to wait for the sun to go down

1116
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,660
for the I am legend monsters to come out.

1117
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
So.

1118
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,620
There were like two or three places

1119
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,380
with cars in the driveway.

1120
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,980
And then there was one person

1121
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,860
and they might've just been working on the house.

1122
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,700
I couldn't tell.

1123
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,540
Clear.

1124
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,380
And this is out of it.

1125
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,300
One or two people walking inside somewhere.

1126
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,420
Out of at least 200 houses.

1127
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,460
Something like that, yes.

1128
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,460
Is it, is the total, I think one article headed at 324 units.

1129
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,900
Wow.

1130
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,740
Geez.

1131
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,420
It's also unclear to me,

1132
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,780
which of these are functioning as property you own

1133
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,660
and what's our time share?

1134
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,500
Yeah, I don't know.

1135
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,900
I'm so confused.

1136
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,740
I don't know.

1137
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,700
I don't know what any of this is.

1138
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,980
They could have switched around.

1139
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,500
With the emails that I have been getting

1140
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,700
for a long time was buy it.

1141
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,500
Like fully straight up buy it.

1142
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,580
But I think maybe a lot of people buy it and then rent.

1143
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,980
It's like, it's like a big bear scenario.

1144
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,140
It's like cabins that you rent out a lot.

1145
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,620
So probably a lot of these are owned by people

1146
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,900
who do not live there, but they throw them up on VRBO.

1147
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,300
Right, yes.

1148
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Yeah, I didn't find any.

1149
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,180
I searched Airbnb for this like map area.

1150
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,460
I didn't find any for this place,

1151
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,940
but there's so many resorts.

1152
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,980
Like Airbnb Orlando is insane.

1153
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,580
There's just so many resorts

1154
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,180
and so many people just renting out vacation places.

1155
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,740
I saw the things on VRBO because as soon as we

1156
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,860
like started seeing some street names, I was like,

1157
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,540
okay, well we gotta find out if any of these are.

1158
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,100
So I was like at one point feverishly searching

1159
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,020
are there listings yet on VRBO and are any of these

1160
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,700
and then our names and like latitude length.

1161
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,300
Fuck, damn it.

1162
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,500
I was so anxious.

1163
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,820
So the revelation, I love that within a 15 minute video

1164
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,100
that we just via one zoom in,

1165
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,300
we discovered Dreamsicle Drive.

1166
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,140
Now here's a question.

1167
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,660
We kind of breeze past our name.

1168
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,780
Do you think that that street reflected the spirit

1169
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,060
of Dreamsicles in any particular way?

1170
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,780
First of all, what is a Dreamsicle?

1171
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,740
Well, Dreamsicle is a popsicle.

1172
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,180
It's a brand name popsicle.

1173
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,980
It is not his brand name.

1174
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,020
Creamsicle. Creamsicle.

1175
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,340
Dreamsicle is a portmanteau of dream and creamsicle.

1176
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,540
Right, I'm saying but Dreamsicle is a real,

1177
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,620
wait, say it again.

1178
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,500
Huh? What did you just say?

1179
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,820
I said it was a portmanteau.

1180
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,460
It's a creamsicle and dream together, isn't it?

1181
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,180
But Dreamsicle is, it's a real.

1182
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,100
Is that at this point someone has the brand of that.

1183
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1184
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,940
It's a, here, hold on, let me find it.

1185
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,260
I should have had this loaded up.

1186
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,460
Can you real quick, Scott, fill me in.

1187
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,140
Is VRBO vacation rental?

1188
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,060
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

1189
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,980
Okay. Yeah.

1190
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,780
I'm not seeing anything,

1191
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,660
I'm not seeing the actual package with it,

1192
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,380
but people are referring to this as a Dreamsicle,

1193
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,820
which is what you would think a creamsicle,

1194
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,380
orange and ice cream.

1195
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,980
Okay, so maybe that's a casual terminology

1196
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,940
for the classic orange with the white

1197
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,140
coming out of the bottom popsicle.

1198
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,180
But I think one brand has at least called it

1199
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,780
a Dreamsicle over the years.

1200
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,220
I see.

1201
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,100
But that's when you hear the song,

1202
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,340
Dreamsicle, that's what's conjured to you.

1203
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,180
Yes. Got you.

1204
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,020
Yeah.

1205
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,940
I, it was.

1206
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,660
Unless Jimmy made it up.

1207
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,500
I mean, I know the answer,

1208
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,020
but did anything on that street make you go,

1209
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,340
yep, this is a street that is like a Dreamsicle?

1210
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,540
No, and it didn't, I'm trying to think of the lyrics

1211
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,940
to Dreamsicle, which I've brought up before.

1212
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,220
We definitely, when this came up before,

1213
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,660
you read the lyrics. Yeah.

1214
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,900
So let's not read the lyrics again.

1215
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,660
No, we don't have to do that.

1216
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,980
But it's a very casual song.

1217
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,020
He names a lot of food in it.

1218
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,340
As I said on Doughboyz, Jimmy Buffett writes about food

1219
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,380
more than Weird Al.

1220
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,500
Dreamsicle, Big Dill Pickle.

1221
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,300
That's a line in the song.

1222
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,860
What a disgusting combination.

1223
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,740
Yeah, awful.

1224
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,420
No, not those, yeah, do you chase a popsicle with a pickle?

1225
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,260
Get out of here.

1226
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,380
Yeah.

1227
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,980
The sickle part rung true to me

1228
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,580
because I saw a pale rider and a black hood

1229
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,620
in the distance.

1230
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,260
Something is coming, the hammer is coming for this place.

1231
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,340
Those weren't security guards.

1232
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,300
No, they weren't security guards at all.

1233
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,940
Pestilence, famine.

1234
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,340
So we keep, as quickly as we can,

1235
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,860
make our way out of this neck of the woods.

1236
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,420
We say goodbye to Dreamsicle Drive

1237
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,180
and we make our way to the hotel area

1238
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,780
and we pass by the pool and the pool is,

1239
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,940
as you'd expect out of this, a sprawling pool

1240
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,380
and I imagine the Jacuzzi and slide type campus.

1241
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,700
And now we finally see some people.

1242
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,020
There are some people and I don't wanna cast dispersions

1243
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,380
on everybody there, but certainly there were

1244
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,020
a few specific people there who I saw,

1245
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,780
who I would describe as looking like sex traffickers.

1246
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,060
I don't mean to add to the joke,

1247
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,900
but it seemed like there was a convention.

1248
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,100
I'm just saying that I'm actually being serious

1249
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,420
because I feel like there were itinerary signs.

1250
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,100
Oh, you're not saying sex trafficker convention.

1251
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,020
Maybe though.

1252
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,420
I would, maybe.

1253
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,780
It was called, it was some, you know,

1254
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,620
it was probably some like generic name

1255
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,540
that's like paradigm holdings ink.

1256
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,500
I'm like, what is this?

1257
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,140
Oh, it's a, don't ask anymore,

1258
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,980
but it's a sex trafficker name.

1259
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,340
A legitimate business, I know that for sure.

1260
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,540
Concrete or something.

1261
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,380
Headquarters and what?

1262
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,900
Headquarters and Little St. James.

1263
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,940
Yeah.

1264
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,940
The other Margaritaville Resort

1265
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,500
was gonna be built there.

1266
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,140
We're gonna build another one of these down there.

1267
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,140
So, and I also recently, like I stumbled upon,

1268
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,340
and this will come up a little more,

1269
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,900
I found the YouTube channel

1270
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,740
of Margaritaville Resort Orlando that,

1271
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,060
and it's a channel like hosted by this young,

1272
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,980
like influencer type girl who I looked up

1273
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,100
and she hosts all of the things in the Orlando,

1274
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,500
the magic at the game, like all the little things

1275
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,380
at the games, like we're doing the, you know,

1276
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,100
the half court shot or whatever.

1277
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,780
So their promotional material is hosted by like,

1278
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,900
you know, like young, excitable millennial kind of girl,

1279
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,180
and you look around and there is not that anywhere.

1280
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,420
And if you are that, don't go to this place,

1281
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,220
or at least not when this particular convention is in town.

1282
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,820
Also, booking.com has this room, right,

1283
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,260
like rooms at this place right now for like 198, $200.

1284
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,380
I feel like you can probably find something comparable

1285
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,980
much closer to attractions.

1286
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,700
Well, how can any hotel justify the prices

1287
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,700
when you know only like 40% of it is full?

1288
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,260
I mean, cut some deals.

1289
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,900
The hotel, yeah, cut some deals.

1290
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,500
I mean, the hotel felt finished.

1291
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,780
The hotel looked comparable

1292
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,540
to other Margaritaville hotels I have seen.

1293
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,980
Well, it had the requisite giant sandal.

1294
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,780
Had the giant sandal and the,

1295
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,340
did it have the giant, it had the giant pop top behind it.

1296
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,020
Pop top? It's usually, yeah, step.

1297
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,900
From the song. It's a flip flop.

1298
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,460
Fist up, stepped on a pop top, blew out my flip flop.

1299
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,260
What's a pop top though?

1300
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,460
The can they used to have. A soda little tab.

1301
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,940
When you used to have to pull the whole thing off, yeah.

1302
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,100
And there's that behind the flip flop?

1303
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,540
Yes, it's kind of on the floor behind it.

1304
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,180
Let me see my photos here. Usually.

1305
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,020
Yeah, they have those statues at all the hotels.

1306
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,580
Like that's the, what did they call it

1307
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,700
in the Imagineering story?

1308
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,100
The weenie, the big item to draw your eye.

1309
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,420
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1310
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,820
And I know from the YouTube channel that around Christmas,

1311
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,020
they put a big Santa hat on it.

1312
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,700
Here's another thing about the YouTube channel.

1313
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,420
Some of the videos that I saw, I was the 14th viewer of.

1314
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,860
There was a video about weddings,

1315
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,140
about get married at Margaritaville Resort Orlando.

1316
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,180
I was the third viewer of this video.

1317
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,820
And there's pictures of like husband and wife,

1318
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,700
like woman in bridal gown, and they're both like holding

1319
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,220
like, you know, bizarre multicolor margaritas together.

1320
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,940
This is not a way to get.

1321
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,740
Very strange.

1322
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,020
Very strange.

1323
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,420
We kind of breezed by it real quick.

1324
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,300
There were a lot of different places in the area

1325
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,620
that are like fitness centers

1326
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,460
that were all named also after Jimmy's songs.

1327
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,460
There was Finn's Up Fitness and the Saint Somewhere Spa.

1328
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,660
So they still had that stuff there named.

1329
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,980
Those were not open when Tim Trek,

1330
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,180
I remember Tim Trek or like banging on the, like.

1331
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,020
Right.

1332
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,140
Oh, is this, all right, nevermind.

1333
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,940
I mean, if you're in Orlando and heading to Orlando

1334
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,540
and your goal is to lay low,

1335
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,060
full marks for this place, high marks.

1336
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,940
Yeah, and you could also lay low.

1337
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,340
There was like almost no one in the restaurant slash bar

1338
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,060
called Euphoria.

1339
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,660
I gave that a good look.

1340
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,180
And I imagine there aren't a ton of people

1341
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:45,060
in the comedy club bonkers with a Z.

1342
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,300
Bonkers with a Z, comedy and cocktails

1343
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,180
every Friday and Saturday.

1344
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,020
Doors open at 7 p.m.

1345
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,980
We were also told it was a cigar bar,

1346
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,700
the worst thing in the world.

1347
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,100
Oh my God.

1348
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,740
Especially for people who use their voices

1349
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,300
for their profession.

1350
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,700
Their only job is to speak.

1351
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,540
It's to speak.

1352
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,460
And they have to do it in a room full of cigar smoke.

1353
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,300
Full of people with stogies.

1354
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,820
There was the old days, they had to do it.

1355
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,260
This is. Oh yeah.

1356
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,340
Yeah, and Jimmy Hoffa did it all the time.

1357
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,180
Yeah.

1358
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,060
But it's a current. Rickles did it.

1359
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:17,900
Yeah.

1360
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,740
He was inhaling the smoke.

1361
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,140
The standards are different now.

1362
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,580
Should I tell the story then about someone telling us

1363
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,580
that we should perform at bonkers?

1364
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,420
Sure.

1365
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,780
Okay, so we were in that hotel

1366
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,460
and they have a Margarita gift shop,

1367
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,780
Margaritaville gift shop.

1368
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,740
We walked in on a conversation between the employee

1369
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,980
and an older gentleman.

1370
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,820
Yeah.

1371
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,820
And none of us knew exactly what the context was,

1372
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,260
but they were just lamenting the fact

1373
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,940
that things are changing.

1374
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,860
This country, man, things are changing.

1375
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,580
Who knows what it was about.

1376
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,420
This ain't what it used to be like.

1377
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,860
Like that's what I, my biggest regret of the trip

1378
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,380
is not catching the sentence before I know.

1379
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,220
We all, three of us heard it, I think,

1380
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,180
and we all were hoping one of us had the key

1381
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,380
to exactly what they had been lamenting.

1382
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,580
But, and they weren't doing it in an angry,

1383
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,740
they were, well, yep, things are different.

1384
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,700
Things used to be a different way, I guess.

1385
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,620
They didn't keep talking and then say,

1386
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,940
well, I'm sure for damn hell,

1387
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,620
I'm saying Merry Christmas this year.

1388
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,460
Right.

1389
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,280
I don't care.

1390
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,620
Could have been that, who knows?

1391
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,780
So we're walking around.

1392
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,020
I tried to find something to buy that I would use

1393
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,060
and I couldn't.

1394
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,100
I bought a visor.

1395
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:27,940
Yes, yes.

1396
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,940
But now I do now have three Margaritaville visors.

1397
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,780
Well, that's good.

1398
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,620
I'm proud of that.

1399
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,440
That's good.

1400
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,280
Yeah.

1401
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,260
And then I believe, Scott, you left,

1402
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,980
you were walking around exploring.

1403
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,100
Yeah, of course.

1404
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,380
And Jason, we were looking at the clearance shirts.

1405
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,740
And I found a design that I actually liked

1406
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,740
and I was trying to look for the large.

1407
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,420
And it was like a kind of a minimalist

1408
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,980
compared to the average parrot

1409
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,260
with a backwards baseball cap and a Margarita.

1410
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,620
And that's like an American flag flowing in the background.

1411
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,500
Like it was a little more tasteful than that.

1412
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,460
Not that I wouldn't wear that parrot shirt,

1413
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,300
but I just couldn't.

1414
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,700
It was like, all those shirts are like $35 or something.

1415
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,940
And I was like, I'll buy the parrot shirt for on clearance.

1416
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,940
Half maybe.

1417
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,780
Yeah.

1418
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,180
So I saw, and it was like Margaritaville

1419
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,580
and it was a plane.

1420
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,380
And I said to you, just to you.

1421
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,220
Just to me.

1422
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,540
And you said, oh, is this the hemisphere dancer?

1423
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,380
Oh boy.

1424
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,380
And we were far, we were far from the cash register.

1425
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,180
We were outside.

1426
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,540
The clearance rack outside to draw you in.

1427
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,540
The cashier overhears what I say

1428
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,460
and she gets so excited and leaves the desk

1429
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,180
and runs toward us.

1430
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,620
And she says, yes, it is the hemisphere dancer.

1431
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,780
She's so excited.

1432
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,620
She's an older lady.

1433
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,620
She's very, very nice.

1434
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,340
And she's so excited that I know the name hemisphere dancer,

1435
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,060
which of course to the listeners who don't know,

1436
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,420
is Jimmy Buffett's plane that was shot up

1437
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,700
by the Jamaican government.

1438
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,540
Yeah.

1439
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,380
He was not in the plane.

1440
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,220
He was not in the plane.

1441
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,060
He was docked.

1442
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:06,900
He was docked.

1443
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,820
He was somewhere else.

1444
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,300
And of course he wrote the song,

1445
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,980
Jamaica Mistake about that incident.

1446
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,020
Really?

1447
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,980
Believe it or not, that's what happened.

1448
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,060
So I think I even,

1449
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,060
I can't even remember exactly the details of the conversation.

1450
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,980
I think I said something to her about that whole story

1451
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,580
and she knew the whole thing.

1452
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,740
She was way in.

1453
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,980
You had met, you dreamed this person.

1454
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,260
You conjured her from the matrix.

1455
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,100
She was a lifer.

1456
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,300
To be a party to the story.

1457
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,820
All the employees in this building were very friendly,

1458
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,020
very, very nice, you know.

1459
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,460
And she wanted to know everything about us.

1460
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,620
I mean, obviously like they're not getting a lot of people

1461
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,260
in this gift shop also.

1462
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,260
Are they getting a lot of people that are as young

1463
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,620
as two men in their mid thirties?

1464
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,220
Probably not.

1465
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,820
We're probably the youngest guys that have ever been in there.

1466
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,020
And she was just like, oh my, who are these guys?

1467
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,580
Why we're from Hollywood.

1468
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,100
Why?

1469
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,820
So we said, we sort of told, we told it, we were like,

1470
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,660
oh yeah, we're doing a show tonight in Orlando.

1471
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,220
We have a podcast.

1472
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,860
It's about themed entertainment.

1473
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,180
We're big Jimmy Buffett fans.

1474
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,420
And she goes, you have to perform at Bonkers.

1475
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,940
It's our, what, the comedy and cigar club?

1476
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,380
It's our cigar bar that has comedy on the weekends.

1477
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,780
And she was just like insistent that we,

1478
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,980
and I think she was even like,

1479
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,900
I'll go find the manager or something,

1480
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,180
the manager of Bonkers.

1481
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,020
And we're like, that's okay.

1482
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,500
We'll find an email or whatever.

1483
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,340
Well, it's okay.

1484
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,180
It's all right, thank you so much.

1485
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,340
But she was like, she, yeah, she,

1486
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,700
I think a couple of times she was like,

1487
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,300
I'll go find the manager of Bonkers to talk,

1488
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,380
so you can talk to them about.

1489
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,780
She made a lot of sales that you got,

1490
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,820
Scott, you bought something.

1491
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,100
That guy earlier bought something.

1492
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,940
That was a big day.

1493
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,500
That was maybe the biggest day in the history of,

1494
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,660
what's, do we know the name of the store?

1495
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,500
Oh, I don't.

1496
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,780
I don't have a picture of it.

1497
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,980
You know, Margaritaville Gear.

1498
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,420
Could have been, probably, sounds right.

1499
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:05,420
So you came out and told us this, told me this.

1500
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:09,420
And my first thought is, oh my God, that is so funny.

1501
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,060
If we performed, because we like our odd venues.

1502
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,380
We like performing in the Abandoned Sports Authority.

1503
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,260
We could perform at Margaritaville Resort Orlando.

1504
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,580
That's a great idea.

1505
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,060
Then I thought for two more seconds and thought,

1506
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,220
no, that's the worst idea.

1507
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,860
With the kind of clientele that we,

1508
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,980
with a bunch of cigar chompers,

1509
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,020
we're gonna show up at Bonkers and like,

1510
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,860
all right, so let's talk about Horizons.

1511
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,660
Now, do you like the farming path or do you like?

1512
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,740
And then they would all take their cigars

1513
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,860
and just throw them at our foreheads like darts.

1514
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,900
I think we would have to adapt to them.

1515
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,700
So I think we would just do like a Jimmy Buffett cover show.

1516
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,780
We would just perform Jimmy Buffett songs.

1517
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,780
Podcast the Ride live at Bonkers.

1518
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,020
And we would just do like,

1519
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,660
Jamaica Mestaca and stuff.

1520
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,660
So just the Sunday through Thursday programming.

1521
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,500
Yeah, right.

1522
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,340
We would just do the same show they do.

1523
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,620
And then in between we would say, you know,

1524
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,420
who likes to drink margaritas in here?

1525
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,420
And then they would all hoot and holler, I assume.

1526
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,900
And then we would come back.

1527
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,060
Then they would offer us some sort of a residency.

1528
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,700
I think probably what we should do

1529
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,940
to really capture their hearts

1530
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,700
is to come out at the beginning and say like,

1531
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,660
hey, what's up guys?

1532
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,340
We're gonna do a little comedy tonight.

1533
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,780
So I hope nobody here is triggered.

1534
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,940
Oh. And then they'd all go,

1535
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,420
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,700
Oh, is that Stitch?

1537
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,540
Is that Stitch here?

1538
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,780
No, I was trying to do like,

1539
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,860
braying hogs.

1540
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,620
Oh.

1541
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,100
And then we'd lay out a margarita trough.

1542
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,380
They'd dunk their heads in

1543
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,980
and we'd go, good night everybody.

1544
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,540
Wow, that was the best comedy show I ever saw.

1545
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,860
More millennials need to be like those guys.

1546
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,020
You know, I wanna do this.

1547
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,540
I want to do this.

1548
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,660
Let's start building the trough.

1549
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,940
It wouldn't be the only live show we do in Orlando,

1550
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,860
but it would be like,

1551
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,340
you know, like the late night bonkers slot.

1552
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,460
And you earlier, you just half an hour ago

1553
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,540
were saying you don't want to die.

1554
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,820
You were hoping you didn't die on this property.

1555
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,820
Now you wanna do this comedy show there?

1556
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,260
We would be the heroes of the thing.

1557
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,420
We would be the heroes of bonkers.

1558
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,380
We weren't gonna like,

1559
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,620
we're not gonna like trash them.

1560
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,140
We're just gonna do Jimmy Buffett songs

1561
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,260
and tell stories from his life.

1562
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,540
And they would, we would be kings.

1563
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,660
We would be kings of bonkers.

1564
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,500
You were really making the assumption

1565
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,980
that every person in the clientele

1566
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,500
is an encyclopedic Jimmy Buffett fan.

1567
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,500
That's obviously not true.

1568
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,860
You're making the assumption that anyone is.

1569
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,740
You are.

1570
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,020
There's a lot of people who would say,

1571
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,300
big hardcore Jimmy Buffett fan, love Jimmy Buffett.

1572
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,100
Great, name five songs.

1573
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,940
And then they'd run out after three.

1574
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,300
Cheeseburger, Margaritaville,

1575
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,340
and then maybe a third if they.

1576
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,500
Sweet Home Alabama.

1577
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,620
Brown Eyed Girl.

1578
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,860
I was gonna do a funny bit

1579
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,260
where I try to light a cigar

1580
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,020
without like cutting the end off.

1581
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,660
Got like, just kidding fellas.

1582
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,660
Of course you gotta cut the end off.

1583
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,860
You would, yeah, you would be the king.

1584
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,100
You would, they would love it.

1585
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,700
They would, you would be,

1586
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,220
they would sign you to an exclusive bonkers deal.

1587
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,980
And you would never do this podcast again

1588
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,060
because it was too lucrative to stay at bonkers.

1589
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,740
It's a residency.

1590
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,860
Yeah.

1591
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,940
Jason Sheridan performing every night

1592
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,300
at bonkers for five straight years.

1593
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,980
And then he would have permission to be there

1594
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,580
because he'd have, they'd give him a luxury condo

1595
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,540
on Latitude Lane.

1596
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,380
And as we said.

1597
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,380
Or like, you know, Mustard Place or some shit.

1598
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,220
There's no.

1599
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,980
Who here's got things to say

1600
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:37,020
about their spouse, right ladies, the husband, right fellas.

1601
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:37,860
Yeah.

1602
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,300
Handful, right?

1603
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,860
Handful either way.

1604
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,260
You would, we've said it before.

1605
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,980
There's no place you're more like happy

1606
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,340
and healthy than Orlando, Florida.

1607
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,180
Yeah.

1608
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,020
Just saying.

1609
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,740
But there's nowhere he's, I've,

1610
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,340
nowhere I've seen him lately that made him as unhappy

1611
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,140
as Margaritaville Resort Orlando.

1612
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,500
Other than doing that closeup magic

1613
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,940
with that magician at Disney, in downtown Disney.

1614
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,900
That's so, yes.

1615
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,540
That was the only other time he was that anxious.

1616
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,940
It's been some grumpiness.

1617
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:10,860
So anyway, I'm not, I'm not declaring we're doing it.

1618
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,500
I'm just saying it would be fun.

1619
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,500
Let us know what you think Orlando.

1620
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,740
If you've ever seen, if you're a listener in Orlando

1621
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,060
and you've ever seen a show at bonkers

1622
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,340
or go see a show at bonkers for us,

1623
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,340
let us know what you think the vibe is.

1624
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,740
Let me see who plays at bonkers.

1625
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,580
Sorry, keep talking.

1626
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,660
It's like Polly DeLuna Lino.

1627
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,340
Bonkers Comedy Productions.

1628
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,420
Oh, it is Polly DeLuna Lino.

1629
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,060
I guessed you exactly right.

1630
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,660
Yeah, that is good.

1631
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,980
Bonkers Featured Comics.

1632
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,260
Oh, there's a, is bonkers a chain?

1633
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,100
Yeah, I believe it is.

1634
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,140
Oh, okay, so there's one in Waukee and I see.

1635
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,220
So here's Carrot Top and Louie Anderson.

1636
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,020
I don't know if they do,

1637
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,540
I don't know if Carrot Top plays the bonkers at the.

1638
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,700
I don't think so.

1639
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,540
I would assume he doesn't.

1640
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,000
Carrot Top is very popular.

1641
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,260
But I'd love to see what his crazy mind could make

1642
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,140
of some of those Margaritaville glasses.

1643
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,820
Oh my gosh.

1644
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,640
Up on the sida.

1645
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,940
They turned margarita glasses into a chandelier.

1646
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,260
That's like, if you look up at the ceiling,

1647
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,100
we haven't talked about that.

1648
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,940
It's all like that.

1649
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,260
I like that.

1650
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,940
And one of the videos I watched, they said,

1651
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,060
and did you know that to fill all of these glasses,

1652
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,920
it would take such and such the hundred thousand ounces

1653
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,940
of salt?

1654
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,180
And I'm like, we're gonna fill the glasses

1655
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,300
with salt all the way?

1656
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,140
What are you talking about?

1657
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,500
I have some problems with the Margaritaville

1658
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,620
YouTube channel.

1659
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:33,980
Um, so we left there and, uh, again,

1660
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,900
we had to like, the weather's getting bad,

1661
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,780
but we're thinking like, well, maybe we can make a quick

1662
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,780
stop over at Sunset Walk.

1663
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,920
Cause we've talked about Sunset Walk a long time ago.

1664
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,420
Sunset Walk is a little like, we've even said,

1665
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,620
maybe it's the Sunset Walk saga is now.

1666
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,380
And we walked around this very depressing little mall

1667
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,900
that had like a map saying what's open.

1668
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,900
Like the items on the directory were bold if it was open.

1669
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,060
And I think 20% of it was open.

1670
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:03,900
Yeah.

1671
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,340
There was like a shaved ice place.

1672
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,080
It was a very depressing place.

1673
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,820
A pet store called Don't Forget About Me.

1674
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,100
Oh my god, I forgot about that.

1675
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,460
You had it, ready to go?

1676
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,300
Yeah.

1677
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,920
It is in like, the logo is a big bone.

1678
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,100
It's got cartoon dog, cat, fish, bird.

1679
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,980
And then in Comic Sans Fine, it just says,

1680
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,620
don't forget about me.

1681
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,460
The number four.

1682
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,700
It's, yeah, sorry.

1683
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,500
It's maybe the saddest I was, like the saddest I felt there

1684
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
was looking at that sign.

1685
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,340
Don't Forget About Me.

1686
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,100
We were, I was away from my cat.

1687
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,900
We were all away from our pets during this.

1688
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,900
It made me depressed.

1689
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,300
It made me depressed thinking about it now.

1690
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,300
Doesn't make me in the mood to buy stuff.

1691
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,660
Yeah, right, like what?

1692
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,500
Is that supposed to be like,

1693
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,380
don't forget to get me a souvenir?

1694
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,380
Is that the idea?

1695
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,180
No, I think it's like, don't forget to buy me food.

1696
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,900
Don't forget to buy me the things I need.

1697
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,980
I think it, is it supposed to be read like,

1698
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,780
don't forget about me.

1699
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,340
I think in their minds, probably is.

1700
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,680
It does sound sad though.

1701
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,580
It does sound a little more like the Sarah McLaughlin.

1702
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,420
Oh no.

1703
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,240
Yes, it does.

1704
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,080
PTA commercials.

1705
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,260
Don't Forget About Me.

1706
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,460
Then like, I get a treat too.

1707
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,740
It should be called like, I get a treat too.

1708
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,580
You know?

1709
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,620
But there's something about the logo in the Comic Sans,

1710
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,540
this is not the greatest photo of it,

1711
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,260
that makes me sad.

1712
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,100
Just so sad.

1713
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,860
It feels like a sign, and with the four,

1714
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:33,780
it feels to me like a sign made by some pets.

1715
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:38,340
And so that the bad language is like them attempting to talk.

1716
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:43,020
What it's making me flash to is if your pet died

1717
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,580
and then they mustered up enough courage

1718
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:48,020
with their dying breaths to speak in English

1719
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,220
that they had accrued over a lifetime.

1720
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:55,220
And as they die, they say, don't forget about me.

1721
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,940
It's like the Simpsons when Santa's Little Helper

1722
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,060
and they sped.

1723
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:00,900
Damn you.

1724
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,300
So Don't Forget About Me is a chain.

1725
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,140
Oh.

1726
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,140
There's one in Branson.

1727
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:08,980
Sure.

1728
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,460
There's one in Branson Landing.

1729
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,060
You know, don't.

1730
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,180
Which we have to go to, unfortunately.

1731
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,020
The Itch Sugar.

1732
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,660
I'm not saying a saga, but we have to go to Branson.

1733
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,540
Itch Sugar next to Don't Forget About Me

1734
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,060
across from Horizon Store.

1735
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:25,060
This is like the multi-century old mosques.

1736
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,460
And I ran those cultural sites.

1737
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,380
Our cultural sites are just the sunset walk.

1738
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,740
Our cultural sites were set up earlier this year.

1739
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,580
They were set up earlier this year.

1740
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,940
They're out of Candy Piss, right?

1741
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,500
We asked, didn't we ask?

1742
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,700
No, there was a stack of Candy Piss.

1743
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,540
We saw the Candy Piss.

1744
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,380
Oh, there was a stack.

1745
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,420
Yes, so there was a Itch Sugar

1746
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,180
and there was the candy urine that came up on the show

1747
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,020
not long ago.

1748
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,740
There was a little stack.

1749
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:53,260
There was a Ruth Bader Ginsburg doll.

1750
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,660
Doll, yes.

1751
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,460
There was a, and then near the Itch Sugar,

1752
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,940
there was some, like there was a pub

1753
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:02,260
that had weird fake British soldier statues

1754
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:05,260
and a really plasticky Big Ben shooting out of it.

1755
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:08,100
So it's like a semi-themed mall a little bit.

1756
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,820
And then it started pouring.

1757
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:10,660
Pouring.

1758
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,500
Right then.

1759
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,740
Studio, don't forget Studio Movie Grill,

1760
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,060
a massive building that I think we eventually settled on.

1761
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,900
Like, oh, this is one of the movie theaters

1762
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,100
with food service.

1763
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,980
It is one, and again, now I, okay,

1764
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,540
so I have now transitioned

1765
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,060
from the Margaritaville YouTube channel

1766
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,820
to the Sunset 365 YouTube channel.

1767
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:28,660
Oh my God.

1768
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,900
Hosted by the same person who also hosts Orlando Magic Games.

1769
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,540
And she filled me in on all the fun stuff

1770
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,100
to do at Sunset Walk.

1771
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,980
And one, she talked about Studio Movie Grill

1772
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,140
and said, you know, it's a place where you can chow down

1773
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,980
in your seat while you watch your favorite flick.

1774
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,940
And that passed, and then I was like,

1775
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:50,420
but my favorite flick, but I'm seeing the theater right now.

1776
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,620
How do I know it's my favorite?

1777
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,980
When are you ever in a movie

1778
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,900
and then you declare it's your favorite flick while it's on?

1779
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,980
That's all, I don't think that's ever happened to me.

1780
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,100
That's a, they need new, I have, again, a lot of,

1781
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,940
I have as many problems with the Sunset 365 YouTube channel

1782
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,860
as I had with the Margaritaville YouTube channel.

1783
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,060
They need a better copywriter.

1784
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,420
Better copywriter, the host is fine.

1785
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,060
Cory is a lot of fun.

1786
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:13,900
Yeah, sure.

1787
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,900
The, it's the copy is the issue.

1788
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,300
Right.

1789
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:22,300
Now, Cory, now I know a lot about Cory.

1790
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:26,740
Cory hosted the Sunset Walk New Year's Eve event

1791
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,100
not too long ago as we recorded this

1792
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,900
with Gloria and Emilio Estefan.

1793
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,980
They were at, they spent their New Year's Eve

1794
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,140
at Sunset Walk.

1795
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:35,980
What?

1796
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,420
Because Sunset Walk now is the home to Estefan Kitchen.

1797
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,260
Oh.

1798
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:44,700
The first non-Miami location of their restaurant chain.

1799
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,980
And you might be thinking their restaurant chain

1800
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,900
that's at downtown Disney slash Disney Springs.

1801
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,660
No, that's closed.

1802
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,660
That was Bongo's Cuban Cafe.

1803
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,340
That's closed.

1804
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,900
Wait, okay, so I'm thinking of Lario's on the beach.

1805
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,020
No, that is also a Gloria Estefan restaurant chain.

1806
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,180
Wrong, this is Estefan Kitchen.

1807
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,540
Get it straight.

1808
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:05,380
Estefan.

1809
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:08,740
That is like our avatar doctor salute.

1810
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,580
No.

1811
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:13,020
I'm confused.

1812
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,100
Is Bongo's at Sunset Walk?

1813
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:15,940
No.

1814
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,060
Bongo's was at downtown Disney

1815
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,060
before it became, wait, maybe it was at Disney Springs

1816
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,740
for some of the run of Disney Springs.

1817
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,700
It was, I believe.

1818
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,540
I believe it's at Bongo's there.

1819
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,820
Yeah, it lasted a long time.

1820
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,660
No, Bongo's Cuban.

1821
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:27,620
And there were multiple name changes.

1822
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:29,260
The West Side.

1823
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:33,940
Bongo's Cuban was at Disney Springs.

1824
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,540
Now is that, what's the one at City Walk?

1825
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,620
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1826
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:41,460
I can't even think of the name.

1827
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,380
Chiarusco?

1828
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,900
Yeah, what's that called?

1829
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,220
Oh, that I gotta look.

1830
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,900
That's not, the City Walk one

1831
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,780
does nothing to do with Gloria Estefan.

1832
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,940
Don't ask about it.

1833
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,300
Don't forget about Bongo's.

1834
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,340
Don't forget about Estefan Kitchen.

1835
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:02,100
And Estefan Kitchen Express is different.

1836
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,180
Estefan Kitchen is not Estefan Kitchen Express.

1837
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,540
Is that at airports?

1838
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,020
Maybe, not totally sure.

1839
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,900
What are they, is it the same type of food?

1840
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,740
Don't know.

1841
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,580
Don't, okay.

1842
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,940
But you know Gloria and Amelia are bringing

1843
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,660
the spirit of the Cuban people

1844
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,460
to every restaurant endeavor they set up.

1845
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:19,300
Right.

1846
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,660
Let's say Anger Lee.

1847
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,900
No, I look, I get it.

1848
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,980
I understand you're trying to push me.

1849
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,180
Samba, that's Samba.

1850
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,020
Samba.

1851
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,580
Samba is not Bongo's.

1852
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,620
Samba is not Bongo's.

1853
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,260
Samba is not Bongo's.

1854
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,820
Samba is home of the Kaipirino.

1855
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,860
The favorite drink of the Brazilian people.

1856
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,100
It's Brazilian.

1857
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,180
Cuban Zate Kaipirinas.

1858
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,340
They spit them out.

1859
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,460
So now this brings us to,

1860
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,140
I'm sorry to extend this out,

1861
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,980
but I thought this was gonna be one of those

1862
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:53,820
that we just breezed through

1863
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,340
because we just talked about this bizarre walk

1864
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,180
that we did. Right.

1865
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,380
But there is one place that I realized we didn't go into.

1866
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,220
No.

1867
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,660
That is on the property and that is the water park.

1868
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,660
Island H2O Live. H2O Live.

1869
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,660
Correct.

1870
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,940
Yes, yes, you got it.

1871
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,020
Island H2O Live. Island H2O Live.

1872
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:16,020
So from that name, what do we know is the kind of the vibe

1873
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,100
and the theme of this water park?

1874
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,580
Why of course, social media.

1875
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,700
It's a social media themed water park.

1876
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,500
So this is the biggest example, I think,

1877
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,500
of Margueriteville kind of scaling back their closeness.

1878
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,580
The ambition of 2016.

1879
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,060
I feel like I saw a concept art early on

1880
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,780
of like a tropical lush paradise.

1881
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,940
Yeah, you know the way water parks are with palm trees

1882
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,420
and it's a relaxing chill.

1883
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,500
You feel like you're in Key West or something.

1884
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,060
You know exactly what you would expect

1885
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:54,580
from a Margueriteville adjacent water park.

1886
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:55,620
No, no, no.

1887
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,380
This is slides, some trees, not many,

1888
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,580
but it's a lot of plastic and a lot of booths

1889
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,020
where you can take selfies and stuff.

1890
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,540
And there's a lot of corrugated metal.

1891
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,420
An excessive amount of corrugated metal.

1892
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:16,300
Steps, walls, railings, and if you climb to the top of it,

1893
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,300
you can see the gas station across the street.

1894
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,540
I think you, from my memory of the very tall slide

1895
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,340
and its proximity to the street,

1896
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,020
I think you could climb to the top

1897
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,620
and throw yourself off into traffic.

1898
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,780
If you wanted to end it all there,

1899
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,540
as did a mourning father,

1900
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,740
or as did somebody in a Baywatch episode,

1901
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,980
I saw it was filmed at Raging Waters.

1902
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:42,420
Good place to kill yourself.

1903
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:43,420
Wow.

1904
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,740
So there's a hot tip.

1905
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:47,620
If anyone goes into this water park, that might happen.

1906
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:52,460
You may take a look around and desire to kill yourself.

1907
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,300
If it happens.

1908
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,220
It seems pretty deserted from a distance

1909
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,420
and from driving by,

1910
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,060
and I'm assuming with a thunderstorm breaking out,

1911
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:05,660
they had to go into their partial closure anyway.

1912
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,660
Or you might be cutting them a break

1913
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,380
because this might be a little desolate.

1914
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,380
Oh, okay. This place.

1915
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,900
I don't know that it's doing great.

1916
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,460
I read positive reviews that were like,

1917
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,300
it was so great.

1918
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,780
Once we got in, it's like we had the place to ourselves.

1919
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:19,900
Yeah.

1920
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,700
Which would be nice at any water park.

1921
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,220
Now, why?

1922
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,140
Why isn't this working better?

1923
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,540
It's cheaper than the Disney ones.

1924
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:34,540
It's cheaper than staying at Cabana Bay

1925
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,860
or the volcano bay.

1926
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,220
So why isn't this doing better?

1927
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,660
Well, it might have something to do with the theming.

1928
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:46,180
Now, so here's what I had in mind.

1929
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,260
I don't know if you guys saw all this.

1930
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,380
Do you guys know the names of the slides?

1931
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:53,700
I cannot pull the exact specifics,

1932
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,740
but the word rough comes to mind.

1933
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,420
I just remember it's rough.

1934
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,500
I would also apply that word to all of the names

1935
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,860
that I'm about to read.

1936
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,340
So here's some of the water slides you get to go on.

1937
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,420
Hashtag heights, profile plunge.

1938
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:10,980
Oh my God.

1939
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,980
Reload rapids, follow me falls, reply racers.

1940
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,120
Oh my God.

1941
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,540
It's a slide themed after replying to somebody.

1942
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,780
You know, like what you do if you work in an office.

1943
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:29,700
I like to ratio run the one where you get dragged

1944
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,500
as you go down the slide.

1945
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,780
That's very, that's a hair raising experience.

1946
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,540
Bad take tsunami.

1947
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,300
To celebrate all the bad takes you see online.

1948
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,700
Cancelled cabana.

1949
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,940
Delete this den.

1950
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:53,620
Okay, you got the drop down live streaming.

1951
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:57,940
My personal favorite, chat creek.

1952
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,740
That's the lazy river.

1953
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,540
It's called chat creek.

1954
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,140
And they try to justify it in the description of like,

1955
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,340
lay back, relax and have a chat with somebody

1956
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,620
you're swimming with.

1957
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,740
Have a chat, fuck you.

1958
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:16,300
It's a chat room that is a lazy river.

1959
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,580
And then maybe you're wondering,

1960
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,940
is this like a pop century situation

1961
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,340
where there's like iconography

1962
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:26,180
and like a big hashtag or you know, like a big,

1963
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,820
you know, Michael Ian Black is looking over the top

1964
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,420
of one of the slides.

1965
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,180
No, it's not.

1966
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,420
These are just regular slides.

1967
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,460
They are not even, they're not painted.

1968
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,380
There's not like the Twitter bird flying by.

1969
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,700
There's no theming otherwise.

1970
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,620
This is just what they're called.

1971
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,140
Let's talk about convenience.

1972
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:47,500
This water park is very far away from the hotel

1973
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,540
and even further from the cottages.

1974
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:51,460
Oh my God.

1975
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:54,580
From where we were dropped out from our street,

1976
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,980
Dreamsicle drive.

1977
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,580
This is like a three mile walk.

1978
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,420
A few miles.

1979
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:03,420
I saw no indication of an internal transit option.

1980
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,100
No, there weren't like golf carts buzzing around.

1981
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:05,940
It's bikes.

1982
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:06,780
You'd have to buy it.

1983
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,620
I guess so.

1984
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,460
I mean, I guess you can.

1985
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,900
Which you have to rent on top of living there.

1986
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,740
Yeah.

1987
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,580
You could buy your own bike.

1988
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,700
You could buy a golf cart.

1989
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,340
Or you could buy like a golf cart, I guess,

1990
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,660
or rent one somewhere.

1991
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,500
I just.

1992
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,340
They will.

1993
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,660
One nice thing about this resort,

1994
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,220
it won't stop you from buying your own bicycle.

1995
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,460
They won't.

1996
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,940
They haven't banned private bicycle use.

1997
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,780
Not yet.

1998
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,740
As far as I know.

1999
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,900
And one of the videos they pointed out behind the hotel,

2000
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:36,460
cause the pool overlooks that marsh runoff body of water.

2001
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,900
There is what appears to be a dock.

2002
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,820
And I think they implied that if you were

2003
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,300
in a far away cottage,

2004
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,980
you could get on a boat and come over to the pool.

2005
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,180
Cause there's two identical,

2006
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,420
there's like pools, some just for the hotel,

2007
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,140
some for the hotel and the cottages.

2008
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:57,980
I don't know that you want to count on that boat system

2009
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,260
being up and running anytime soon.

2010
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,500
I don't.

2011
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,240
That seems like a trim from the budget of this property.

2012
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,260
Yeah.

2013
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,420
One thing they did think to do in the water park

2014
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,220
was have an area that's only for adults

2015
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,780
where they don't have kids hassling them.

2016
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:16,660
Cause kids go crazy in the water park.

2017
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,500
If you want somewhere you can just have a drink

2018
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,100
and chat with your adult friends.

2019
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:26,100
And that's why the adults area is called private domain.

2020
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,660
And it's a little like hat and guy in sunglasses

2021
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,180
meant to conjure your private mode

2022
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,220
or your incognito mode of your browser.

2023
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:40,220
So the 21 and up area is themed after what you do

2024
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,780
when you're going to look at porn on your browser.

2025
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:43,620
Sure.

2026
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:47,980
Jason to Holly pond, get to know,

2027
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,280
get to know your neighbors.

2028
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,820
Swipe right to something.

2029
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,300
Farmers only falls.

2030
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,600
No names, no names bar.

2031
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,900
There are also the food places, you have those too?

2032
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:08,740
Yep.

2033
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:09,580
Yeah.

2034
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,020
You go for it.

2035
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:13,300
Megabytes, BYT.

2036
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,820
But then it's spelled Y.

2037
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:15,660
Right, I know.

2038
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,540
Not like bite food.

2039
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,620
I don't know.

2040
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,940
I guess the burger is in place of the E.

2041
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:22,180
Something happened.

2042
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:25,380
This was like, all right,

2043
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,260
let's hole up in a suite at the hotel.

2044
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:28,820
We have a weekend to figure out

2045
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:31,420
what we call everything at the water park.

2046
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,820
There's something that happened

2047
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,540
was that five people got in a room

2048
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:37,100
and none of them had any ideas until one of them

2049
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,260
checked in or got a text from his nephew

2050
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,300
and then went, wait a minute,

2051
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,900
say nephew, tell me all the words that you use.

2052
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,580
What are some things that an 11 year old would say?

2053
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,820
Did you get the, did you see the name of the shack?

2054
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,300
Yes, yes, go for it.

2055
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,060
The tag shack?

2056
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,100
That's within private domain is tag shack.

2057
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,340
Oh, that's in private domain, domain.

2058
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,180
Tag shack.

2059
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,740
Tag your friend, tag.

2060
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,980
Tag.

2061
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:11,580
It's a bar themed after clicking on a photo

2062
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,620
to indicate to an algorithm that a friend is in it.

2063
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,340
This is all instantly, it's so instantly dated.

2064
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,180
It feels like it's themed after 2015 social media.

2065
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,380
It is a pop century.

2066
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:27,420
It's like, let's blast back to the tens.

2067
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,780
The only tags in this bar just say,

2068
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,260
well, liquor and hepatitis.

2069
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,340
Oh man, we should have gone here.

2070
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,980
Yeah, you checked in at a yeast infection.

2071
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,660
This is also really speaks to the fact

2072
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:47,660
that we need to get jobs doing this.

2073
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:49,740
Well, what if I told you, Michael,

2074
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:50,580
Go ahead.

2075
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:53,380
That there is a way that you could earn money

2076
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,500
while you slide.

2077
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,340
Go ahead.

2078
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:58,700
Go ahead.

2079
01:15:58,700 --> 01:15:59,540
Oh no.

2080
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,580
Get ready.

2081
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:05,500
So there is a tab on the website of IslandH2O Live,

2082
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,900
which if you type in islandh2olive.com,

2083
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:12,180
what your brain will see is islandh2olive.com.

2084
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:15,180
So if you go to islandh2olive.com,

2085
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:18,780
then it's slides, restaurants, stuff you expect to see,

2086
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,860
and then influencers.

2087
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,620
What the fuck, influencers?

2088
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,540
What are you talking about?

2089
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,980
I click on it and let me just read their copy.

2090
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:31,780
Being an IslandH2O Live influencer means being in the know

2091
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:34,580
plus perks for you and your social network.

2092
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,180
Interested in spreading the fun of IslandH2O Live

2093
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,780
and making money while you slide?

2094
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,100
Here's how.

2095
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:43,180
And then there's a bunch of jargon explaining that,

2096
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,180
okay, so you submit.

2097
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,380
First step, you need an annual pass to IslandH2O Live.

2098
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,300
That costs $80.

2099
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,900
So you get your annual pass and now you can submit.

2100
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,820
And I think you have to send a photo in.

2101
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,500
I think they have to approve you in a very influencer,

2102
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,540
like, how do they look kind of way.

2103
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,500
So they're kind of eyeing you in that way.

2104
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,300
And then they will maybe approve you

2105
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,500
to become part of the influencer program.

2106
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,420
Once you are selected, you will be set up

2107
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:15,820
with your very own store in quotes with a discount link.

2108
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:19,780
Tools such as approved posts, images, and emails

2109
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,900
to help you start sharing, earning, and saving

2110
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,100
can be found by joining the Facebook page,

2111
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,380
IslandH2O Live Influencers.

2112
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:31,380
So to recap, go to the Facebook page to download emails.

2113
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,260
What?

2114
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,260
And approve post.

2115
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,740
How do I get my approved posts?

2116
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,300
Go to the Facebook.

2117
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,100
It's next to the emails.

2118
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,260
And then next to that, inner tubular.

2119
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,740
Being an influencer means you are in the know

2120
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:47,740
with the most tubular team in town.

2121
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,620
The fun times and perks you receive

2122
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:52,540
will be the ultimate hashtag FOMO for your social squad.

2123
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,020
What are we talking about?

2124
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,420
So go to the Facebook, download the emails,

2125
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,300
and then so you can give hashtag FOMO to your squad.

2126
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,140
If they're your squad, why do you wanna give them FOMO?

2127
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,140
That's a bad thing.

2128
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,660
That's a mean thing to do, right?

2129
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,220
I don't, this whole thing,

2130
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,940
what are we even talking about?

2131
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,820
Facebooks and there's also,

2132
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:15,100
like side note, there's events.

2133
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,220
And there's an event called Splash Bash Out Loud and Proud.

2134
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:22,860
It's an LGBTQ plus event full of drag queen performances,

2135
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:26,980
go-go dancers, stilt walkers, and party goers.

2136
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,260
They really, I think they have a grasp on the community.

2137
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,460
They know that gay people love stilt walkers.

2138
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,300
That's true, yeah.

2139
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,340
Something.

2140
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,900
That is at least a choice.

2141
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,260
Like that is at least,

2142
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,740
that seems like there was some thought put into that.

2143
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,140
That could be a fun event,

2144
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,860
but if you wanna learn about it,

2145
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:45,740
you go to facebook.com slash splash bash,

2146
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:50,100
slash splash bash 2019.

2147
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,060
And when you do that,

2148
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,340
you will learn that splash bash 2019

2149
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,500
has been postponed until 2020.

2150
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,100
But the URL is still 2019.

2151
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:00,780
Anyway, that's a side note.

2152
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,900
Back to IslandH2O Live influencers

2153
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,820
and giving hashtag to FOMO to your social squad.

2154
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:09,740
Where are, what is all this?

2155
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,660
And I don't understand what you get

2156
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,620
if you make it through this fog.

2157
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,300
You get money for sliding,

2158
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,620
and for like now you have to be an activated

2159
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,620
like promoter of this water park.

2160
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:21,460
It sounds like that's right.

2161
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,420
I think so, but do you possibly make like enough money

2162
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,540
to recoup the annual pass?

2163
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,380
No, it's not very clear.

2164
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:32,180
Do you, can you possibly make like a lot of money?

2165
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:34,900
Will they, could you make a thousand dollars off of this?

2166
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:38,180
Scott, you are obviously paid in splash bucks,

2167
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:41,420
which you can turn in for different megabytes

2168
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,260
and shareables.

2169
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:44,700
I am.

2170
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,580
What if I wanna get paid in apps?

2171
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,260
I'm on the IslandH2O Live app right now.

2172
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,100
Oh, great.

2173
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,020
If you are an adult,

2174
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,300
follow the instructions below.

2175
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,620
Otherwise hand this to your parents

2176
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,540
to enter the following numbers.

2177
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:00,860
61, 59.

2178
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:01,700
All right.

2179
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,020
You're entering numbers.

2180
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:03,860
Why are you entering numbers?

2181
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,140
Do you have a smart band?

2182
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:05,980
No.

2183
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:06,800
Do you have a Vantage account?

2184
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,640
No.

2185
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,480
Vantage.

2186
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,300
Nickname.

2187
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,140
Hashtag.

2188
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:12,980
It's a Buffett thing.

2189
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:13,980
Inner tubular.

2190
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:14,820
Oh, okay.

2191
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,060
I was gonna say like a little seagull.

2192
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,380
That's good.

2193
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,580
Hashtag little seagull.

2194
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,100
I do like inner tubular.

2195
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,860
So if you're, so if you're on,

2196
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,700
yeah, but that didn't relate to anything.

2197
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,260
That's the, I like that too.

2198
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,020
But then what the copy I read after

2199
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,740
had nothing to do with inner tubular.

2200
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,580
So it was useless.

2201
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,420
But you're right.

2202
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,260
The phrase itself is fine.

2203
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:36,080
That is fun.

2204
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,420
Again, the bar is so low.

2205
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:41,260
I'm latching onto like, okay, still Walker drag glade

2206
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,260
of an inner tubular.

2207
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:44,620
These are at least, there's something.

2208
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,420
Something close to what a human being would want.

2209
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,260
Yes.

2210
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,460
This is, there's something approaching fun.

2211
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,420
Little seagull is unverified.

2212
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,260
I don't know how to verify myself.

2213
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:56,180
I still have to get verified and get vantage points.

2214
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,040
All right, I'm looking at the wait times.

2215
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:58,880
Oh, you can see the wait times.

2216
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,540
Oh, wait, drop down is three minutes.

2217
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,940
The downloader is three minutes.

2218
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:06,540
Follow me falls is three minutes.

2219
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:09,140
Reply racers, three minutes.

2220
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:11,860
Reload rapids, three minutes.

2221
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:14,620
Hashtag heights, three minutes.

2222
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,220
Profile plunge, three minutes.

2223
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,000
Live streaming, three minutes.

2224
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,320
Lazy river, three minutes.

2225
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,760
Pelican paradise teal, which what is that?

2226
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:24,600
It is.

2227
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,420
Oh, that's right.

2228
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:28,480
After all that hashtag shit, reply falls.

2229
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,640
Suddenly there's one that's Pelicans paradise.

2230
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,800
They just forgot.

2231
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,960
They forgot it was social media.

2232
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,800
Wait time?

2233
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,620
20 minutes.

2234
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,440
What?

2235
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,360
Why?

2236
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,320
Pelican paradise blue, 20 minutes.

2237
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,160
Huh?

2238
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:40,980
Whoa.

2239
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,280
Pelican paradise pink, 20 minutes.

2240
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,120
What?

2241
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,600
Pelican paradise orange, 20 minutes.

2242
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,080
Oh, that's a racing slide.

2243
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,760
That's gotta be a racing one.

2244
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,600
Every slide is three minutes.

2245
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,160
I'm Orlandoing right now.

2246
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,440
Like this is the time of year most water parks closed

2247
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,640
to do seasonal maintenance.

2248
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,320
Why is there even a three minute wait

2249
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,560
for the lazy river for Chatt Creek?

2250
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,400
You get a hundred.

2251
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,220
Just jump right in that.

2252
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,480
You get a hundred points for going on the ride?

2253
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,600
So that's another thing.

2254
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,800
So you can earn money as an influencer,

2255
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,440
but you can also earn points if you're just a regular,

2256
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,360
if you're just a normie at the park.

2257
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,100
So yes, and you can, so by downloading the app,

2258
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,280
you can earn points as you slide.

2259
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,080
Now I watched a video about this as well.

2260
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:24,020
And they told me that this is very important.

2261
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,240
Be sure to save time by downloading the app

2262
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,520
before you get in the park.

2263
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,480
But remember, don't set up your profile

2264
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,360
until after you're in the park.

2265
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,120
Oh no, I'm screwing up here.

2266
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:34,960
You messed up.

2267
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,240
You messed up the process.

2268
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,420
You need to go to the Facebook and watch the video.

2269
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,080
So then you can earn, learn how to earn points.

2270
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,160
And van, our vantage points,

2271
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,040
our vantage points, the points that you're earning

2272
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,040
or is vantage points different?

2273
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,240
And how do you get verified?

2274
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,520
I don't know how to get verified.

2275
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,600
I'm trying to figure it out.

2276
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,160
And I'm trying to figure,

2277
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,360
oh, I've reset my theme now

2278
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,400
to a different color of the actual app.

2279
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,600
Cool.

2280
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,620
My music here.

2281
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:59,600
Now I get to pick my favorite music.

2282
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,920
Okay, now this I know about.

2283
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,240
This is interesting.

2284
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,240
This actually is kind of a cool idea.

2285
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,960
So before you get on every slide, you scan your band.

2286
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,080
It's a very magic band kind of situation.

2287
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,920
Oh, I like this.

2288
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,160
And that will choose, and I've been going on on every slide,

2289
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,040
but on some of the slides, it will choose.

2290
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,000
So you just picked a color, your color's green.

2291
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,320
Well, that's unrelated.

2292
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,920
Okay, but no, no, no.

2293
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,760
Oh, it's not.

2294
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,280
I think you can choose a color

2295
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,600
and the slide will light up with your favorite color.

2296
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,440
Yes.

2297
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,260
Now that's the first thing

2298
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:27,960
that's actually good about this whole episode.

2299
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,360
It's kind of good.

2300
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,600
And perhaps even better,

2301
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,800
you can pick the music that plays

2302
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,400
while you go down the slide.

2303
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,240
I'm seeing that.

2304
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,740
So I'm in all out eighties here.

2305
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:41,400
You can play Belinda Carlisle, Heaven is a Place on Earth.

2306
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,240
Which what better descriptor of Margarita Philips.

2307
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,560
Duran Duran, Hungry Like the Wolf, I Picked All Out Eighties,

2308
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,320
Genesis, Land of Confusion,

2309
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,520
Huey Lewis, and the News, Hip to Be Square,

2310
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,600
and oh, Power of Love.

2311
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,040
Imagine going down a water slide

2312
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,120
listening to Power of Love.

2313
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,240
Why didn't we go to this fucking place?

2314
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,160
Yeah, we maybe shouldn't have.

2315
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,280
It was raining horribly.

2316
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,120
Yeah.

2317
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,520
We weren't even thinking about it.

2318
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,840
But here's still the issue, Mike,

2319
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,360
is that what you just described,

2320
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,200
I wanna hear,

2321
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,240
da, da, as I begin to slide.

2322
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,480
I don't think you can pick that.

2323
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,520
I think all you can do is pick the station.

2324
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,920
And I don't know at what point the song begins playing

2325
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,120
because I was curious.

2326
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,600
I looked at the playlist, Girl Power,

2327
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,180
and I was thinking I would specifically choose

2328
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:29,760
to listen to Fight Song.

2329
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,040
And that if my ideal water slide experience would be,

2330
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,560
I would cross my arms, close my eyes,

2331
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,920
get ready to go down the slide, solemnly in tone,

2332
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,120
this is for Hillary.

2333
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,060
And then Fight Song would play during my slide.

2334
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:42,760
But I couldn't do that.

2335
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,320
All I could do is pick Girl Power,

2336
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,200
the playlist in general,

2337
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,400
which is so open-ended.

2338
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,160
That's everything from I wanna dance with somebody

2339
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,320
to garbage, only happy when it rains.

2340
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,600
That's such a wide swath what Girl Power is.

2341
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:59,480
So it's customizable, but not that customizable.

2342
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,200
But this does say I can still,

2343
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,040
well, no, no, you're right.

2344
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,360
Mike, you're not even in the park.

2345
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,200
No, I can't select it.

2346
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,100
If you do too much to your profile,

2347
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,840
they will force you to go down Doc's Drop.

2348
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,040
The water slide that by the end of it,

2349
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,560
all of your banking information and your address

2350
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,000
have been leaked to the internet.

2351
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,920
No, you're right.

2352
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,320
Yeah, okay, Scott, you're right.

2353
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,120
You can't select the actual song.

2354
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,920
You can just see what's on the list.

2355
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,360
Yeah, just hope you like something within that.

2356
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,960
What's also strange is there's no Jimmy Buffett option.

2357
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,740
No, no, and here's another thing.

2358
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:34,440
So it's not clear how,

2359
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,040
Buffett seems to have distanced himself

2360
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,200
from Margaretville Resort Orlando.

2361
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,960
I don't think Island H2O Live

2362
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,920
is related to Margaretville Resort Orlando

2363
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,120
in any way either.

2364
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,080
I think they're pretty separate.

2365
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,840
I saw some description of it in a Yelp review

2366
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,400
that was like, like pseudo related.

2367
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,360
They're like pseudo affiliated

2368
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,120
in that they are next to each other.

2369
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,160
So no, you can't slide to Buffett

2370
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,360
unless it happens to be on one of those lists.

2371
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,760
Now, one option is you could do,

2372
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,840
pick the all kids bop channel.

2373
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:11,160
So if you wanna slide while a group of 40 children

2374
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,760
all sing thrift shop and mass,

2375
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,720
then that is an option for you.

2376
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,600
But yeah, if you wanna get more specific than that,

2377
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,760
I can't help you.

2378
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,180
So I Googled,

2379
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,280
Margaretville Resort Orlando controversy

2380
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,280
and got a couple.

2381
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,640
So there's at least one lawsuit going on.

2382
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:34,640
And this is so confusing.

2383
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,120
Ace Hospitality LLC.

2384
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,000
This is from the Orlando Business Journal.

2385
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,360
A vacation ownership and management company

2386
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,860
and furniture provider

2387
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:47,040
for Margaretville's vacation cottages

2388
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:51,000
filed a lawsuit alleging wrongdoings

2389
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,800
by several related entities,

2390
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,040
as well as some that appear to be related

2391
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,040
to Boca Raton based Falcone Group,

2392
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,800
the ownership entity of Margaretville Resort Orlando.

2393
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:08,560
So the management and the ownership,

2394
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,320
but not the management of all of it,

2395
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,520
of some of it who is also the furniture provider

2396
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,120
appears to be suing the property owner

2397
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:23,120
and representing 160 owners of about 270 units.

2398
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,120
That was like a like,

2399
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,440
it is like an internal,

2400
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,960
I can't even, I can barely understand that,

2401
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,760
but it seems to boil down to like,

2402
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,960
well, the people who,

2403
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,680
the furniture people are supposed to have

2404
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,920
the first right of refusal for representing the people,

2405
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:46,500
but then the people who are represented by the units,

2406
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,960
the owners owners have, those look nicer.

2407
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,400
And it's so very, very confusing.

2408
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,360
It's really confusing,

2409
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,880
but there's one thing that is not confusing at all,

2410
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,400
which is you don't cross the Falcons.

2411
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,160
Don't you dare cross the Falcone Group.

2412
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,120
You fucked up Margaritaville.

2413
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,120
That's the Batman.

2414
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,280
Yeah, that's the big crime family in Gotham.

2415
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,720
What's his name plays him in Batman Begins?

2416
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,560
Um, uh, Roberts.

2417
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,400
Yeah, Eric Roberts.

2418
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,800
No, no, no, no.

2419
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,160
The one before the Batman Begins.

2420
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,000
Oh, with Batman.

2421
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,840
It was Falcone, Falcone.

2422
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,560
And it's the English guy,

2423
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,400
but he's doing an Italian.

2424
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,200
The guy from Eternal Sunshine.

2425
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,120
He's a very good actor.

2426
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:26,960
Yeah, yeah.

2427
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,800
What's that guy's name?

2428
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,040
I can't think of anything today.

2429
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,360
But Tim, somehow they got in league

2430
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,640
with the fictional character Falcone.

2431
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,320
The other story that came up about this.

2432
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,920
So the thing that was here before

2433
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,920
was called Splendid China.

2434
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:41,760
Okay.

2435
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,600
Oh my God, we have to do a whole thing there.

2436
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,040
And this information is coming from the website

2437
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,480
Click Orlando.

2438
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,320
So they call Splendid China a theme park.

2439
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,120
But I just remember when we first talked about

2440
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,520
what was here before,

2441
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,360
it was selling a lot of the, you know,

2442
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:59,760
China, China, like you keep in your house,

2443
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:00,720
like in a kitchen.

2444
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,120
Oh.

2445
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:05,000
But yes, I think there was some garden stuff.

2446
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,120
The headline on this,

2447
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,520
Neighbors Blame Margaritaville Resort Construction

2448
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,480
for Rat Infestation.

2449
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,200
The Oak Island Harbor neighborhood near Kissimmee

2450
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:20,320
said rats are overtaking their homes

2451
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,520
and they believe it's all because of a nearby construction

2452
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,920
on a resort.

2453
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:28,080
So the idea here is that Splendid China

2454
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,920
sat empty for a while.

2455
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,400
And quote,

2456
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,120
Neighbors think that over time,

2457
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,600
the empty theme park attracted rodents

2458
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,720
and the new construction is pushing groups of rats

2459
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:43,120
out of the property into their neighborhood.

2460
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,640
Resident David Webber said,

2461
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,520
it's creepy.

2462
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,520
It makes you feel like you're unclean

2463
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,880
and we're not unclean.

2464
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,440
We take care of our house.

2465
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,680
We're clean people.

2466
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,160
Oh God.

2467
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,720
The resident said he is,

2468
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,440
this is awful.

2469
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,120
The resident said he has spent more than $7,000

2470
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,160
for damages caused by the rat infestation

2471
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,320
and to get rid of the rodents.

2472
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,680
I guess for this community,

2473
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,480
it was the year of the rat.

2474
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:16,320
New six asked Margaritaville Resort Orlando

2475
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,040
owners for comment.

2476
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,000
We have no comment at this time.

2477
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,960
This is the first we have heard about it.

2478
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,400
Margaritaville Resort spokeswoman,

2479
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:28,360
Veronica Figueroa with Hemsworth Communications said,

2480
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,040
this is back in 2017.

2481
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,120
All right, we've done it.

2482
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,640
We have bought a bunch of rat poison.

2483
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,880
It is a white powder and we will lay it out

2484
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,200
to poison the rats.

2485
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,840
Oh no, we mixed up the rat poison

2486
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,680
and the salt for the margaritas.

2487
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,400
Oh no, all our guests have been drinking

2488
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,160
rat poison rimmed drinks for a week.

2489
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,160
The glass is so rimmed with rat poison.

2490
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,800
While all of the rats get bigger and stronger

2491
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,200
by eating pound after pound of salt.

2492
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,040
Oh my God.

2493
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,720
Don't tell the Falcons.

2494
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,720
They're gonna have our asses for this.

2495
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,200
This is unbelievable.

2496
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,040
This is one of my favorite ones ever.

2497
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,960
I'm having so much fun.

2498
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,240
I will repeat what I said while we were there.

2499
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,200
I think it's my favorite thing we've done.

2500
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,400
I think I've come around.

2501
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,480
Hey, no fuck you from Jason.

2502
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,320
No fuck you.

2503
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,160
I'm so glad.

2504
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,760
That's why I was so happy we were there.

2505
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,000
The content we were discovering.

2506
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,160
Maybe people haven't had a good time living there.

2507
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,480
Maybe rats have ended up in people's homes,

2508
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,120
but we've had nothing but a blast.

2509
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,760
Well, no, the rats have been pushed to other people's homes.

2510
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,600
Hey, all right.

2511
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,720
They're out of the cottages.

2512
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,360
They're not even anywhere near.

2513
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,360
Well, it meant lots that make up a large portion

2514
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:47,920
of the undeveloped part of the property.

2515
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,920
It just seems like, I mean, honestly,

2516
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,680
if they planted another few hundred more palm trees

2517
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:59,400
and greenery, it could fool me a little more,

2518
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,760
but it was just like the active construction site

2519
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,400
in that they had opened it up to guests and media tours

2520
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,720
and like, it's just a little unbelievable.

2521
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:14,160
Well, I think what I wanna do is get this place hopping.

2522
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,280
I want it to have the energy that I see

2523
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,960
when I watch Sunset Live 365, the YouTube channel.

2524
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,040
I want it to be full of influencers.

2525
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,760
And I would love for that to be us,

2526
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,600
but we don't live there yet.

2527
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:34,080
We live in ratless places in Los Angeles,

2528
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,640
but it was my thought, well, I really wanna know

2529
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,760
what is all the jargon?

2530
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,720
I want access.

2531
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,440
I wanna be able to go to the Facebook group

2532
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:45,600
and download the emails and find out what it really is

2533
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,520
to be an influencer.

2534
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,160
So I thought maybe I should just get an annual pass

2535
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:53,240
and just so I can apply for the influencer program

2536
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,240
and start getting all this stuff.

2537
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,800
But there's a catch.

2538
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:01,600
You have to physically be there for like a,

2539
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,360
what do you call it, like an orientation session.

2540
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,040
They offer you a choice of can you be here

2541
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,680
for one of these five dates in November?

2542
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,760
And presumably that was November 2019.

2543
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,440
So they haven't set up their new,

2544
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,480
unless this was delayed like Splash Bash 2019 was.

2545
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,520
But here's what I'm thinking,

2546
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,880
because I just really wanna know what is it like

2547
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:26,920
to be an Island H2O Live influencer?

2548
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,440
And I think what I'd like to do,

2549
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,280
and it's your guys choice,

2550
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,040
you can go in on this with me or not.

2551
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:34,840
I kind of want to sponsor an Island H2O Live influencer.

2552
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,680
Oh, interesting.

2553
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,640
The total cost of this would be $80.

2554
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:38,480
I'm willing to pay it,

2555
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,240
but if you guys are willing to go in on it,

2556
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,960
what I would like to offer to a listener is,

2557
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,600
if you would be willing to go to,

2558
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,520
there's a lot of steps here.

2559
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,560
You have to get approved, first of all.

2560
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:52,480
However, whatever shady means they do to approve you,

2561
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,280
you have to have an annual pass,

2562
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:58,280
which you can bill us later, bill me later.

2563
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,360
And then you have to go to the orientation

2564
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,480
and make it through the orientation and get approved.

2565
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,080
But then I wanna see everything that you get.

2566
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,600
I wanna see what are all of the emails,

2567
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,400
what are all the things that you,

2568
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:12,360
what's the packet that you get to post about?

2569
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,600
How many points do you get?

2570
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,760
Do you get verified?

2571
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,400
Is that how you become verified?

2572
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,160
Is that how you get vantage points?

2573
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,000
Right.

2574
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,720
I wanna know, actually, as you keep going,

2575
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,040
own the island.

2576
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:23,880
That doesn't seem accurate.

2577
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,320
I don't think you can end up owning it.

2578
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,760
Although maybe this thing might be selling real soon.

2579
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,560
The more passes you sell, the more you earn.

2580
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,280
So this involves selling passes now.

2581
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,480
It's like pyramid scheme.

2582
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,320
It's a pyramid scheme.

2583
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:36,640
This is a water park that operates its own pyramid scheme.

2584
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,840
And I wanna sponsor somebody to,

2585
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,560
so what I will say, just like say,

2586
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,280
I wanna be an influencer to send that to

2587
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,520
podcast.gmail.com and we'll do our own vetting as well,

2588
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,840
unless we forget about all this and get too lazy.

2589
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:53,080
But I just, I really wanna know if anybody out there

2590
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,800
has a lot of time to waste and wants to become in Orlando,

2591
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,360
an IslandH2ILive influencer

2592
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,480
and is willing to go to the orientation,

2593
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,320
but you have to tell us everything that you do.

2594
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,920
Yeah, there's gonna be multiple people

2595
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,440
I think they're gonna wanna be involved in.

2596
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,560
I think there might be two, so I'm not really sure.

2597
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,320
So maybe it's gotta be the first.

2598
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,200
But we also have to know,

2599
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,200
I don't know when there's gonna be another session.

2600
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,560
This is gonna be hard to figure out, honestly.

2601
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,440
But I wanna do it, I wanna crack it.

2602
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,400
And you would be in an elite group

2603
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,400
because the Facebook group, IslandH2ILive influencers,

2604
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,880
I checked it has 15 members.

2605
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:27,720
Oh my God.

2606
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,040
There's only 15 of these people.

2607
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,760
Is that including you or?

2608
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,120
No, I couldn't join.

2609
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,480
Cause I'm not an influencer

2610
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,680
because I couldn't be there in person in November.

2611
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,080
I wish I knew about any of this before.

2612
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,600
What I would like is to sponsor a listener

2613
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,600
to infiltrate the sex cult rings at the hotel.

2614
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,520
So what you're gonna need to do

2615
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,280
is go to an Orlando costume shot.

2616
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:53,640
You're gonna need a tuxedo, a cape, and a mask, a raid mask.

2617
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:55,840
You run into your old friend from college

2618
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,080
who's now a piano player.

2619
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,120
He gives you the password Fidelio.

2620
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,280
This is very important.

2621
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:01,920
There's only one password.

2622
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,960
Don't give it a second time.

2623
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:08,760
And what happens if you get asked why you're there

2624
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:09,800
or who you know?

2625
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,400
Then the whole group of men,

2626
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,360
then everybody in the masks might be staring at you

2627
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,200
for a long time.

2628
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,240
Well, that is true.

2629
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,920
We gotta hold off on this part then.

2630
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,760
Okay, we gotta hold off on this part.

2631
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,080
Whatever you do, don't smoke any weed.

2632
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,880
It will make you too aggressive.

2633
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:30,880
This is a real, this is a secret society.

2634
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,160
This is a real, this is a secret society.

2635
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:38,600
I wanna figure out how to get in there.

2636
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,320
This, do we keep going past the layers

2637
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:46,440
and discover this was all part of the Epstein scheme?

2638
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,560
We alluded to it earlier

2639
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,640
and I think the answer is 100% yes.

2640
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,480
Yeah.

2641
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,300
Yeah.

2642
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,140
For sure.

2643
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,800
All of the answers are behind the wall

2644
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,080
of the IslandH2O Live Influencers Facebook page.

2645
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,320
I think that's right.

2646
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,160
I think that's where-

2647
01:36:59,160 --> 01:36:59,980
Make sure.

2648
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:00,980
The plane is back there.

2649
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:04,020
To be an influencer, you gotta write on that wall

2650
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:06,580
and you gotta get your squad, your hashtag squad,

2651
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:10,460
to write on that wall to give them hashtag FOMO.

2652
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:14,500
Everybody who didn't get to be on the Lillita Express

2653
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,660
has a major hashtag FOMO.

2654
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,500
Yeah, that's true.

2655
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,980
Tom Wilkinson.

2656
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:21,860
Tom and Tom Wilkinson.

2657
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:22,700
Tom Wilkinson.

2658
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:23,540
Wonderful actor.

2659
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,360
Wonderful actor.

2660
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,620
Who I'm not implicating in any of this.

2661
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:26,460
No, absolutely not.

2662
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,300
No, no, no.

2663
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,140
It's a wonderful man.

2664
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:29,940
Not on the flight logs as far as we know.

2665
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:31,780
His hands are clean.

2666
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:34,260
So, is there anything else?

2667
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,100
I mean, I can't believe how much this-

2668
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:36,940
I don't know.

2669
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,900
I really thought this would be a breezy 45 minutes,

2670
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:39,940
but there's so much.

2671
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:43,180
And so let us know if you wanna be part

2672
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,380
of the influencer program.

2673
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:48,060
Give us, your social squad, your podcast squad,

2674
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:51,420
hashtag FOMO, by going to the orientation meeting

2675
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,260
and taking pictures of everything you see.

2676
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,260
Every soda that's offered to you,

2677
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,460
every email with points and emails.

2678
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,740
How many emails come in an email to you?

2679
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,860
Who knows?

2680
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:02,780
We'll find out.

2681
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:03,900
I mean, I also wanna apologize.

2682
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,540
There's gonna be so many people wanting to do this.

2683
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,780
We can only choose one.

2684
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:10,860
So don't be brokenhearted if you don't get chosen by us

2685
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,220
to be our representative.

2686
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,940
Now I feel like I am IslandH2O Live.

2687
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:16,740
Because what are our criteria?

2688
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,580
Yeah, I know.

2689
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,620
Yeah, we're just getting in on the pyramid scheme.

2690
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,980
Except we're not all, we're, look,

2691
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:22,940
we're gonna foot the bill.

2692
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:23,780
Like, we're not, and I don't-

2693
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:25,300
But is it followers?

2694
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,100
Is it social Instagram followers?

2695
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,940
Is that like the highest count?

2696
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,620
Whoever has the highest count?

2697
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:31,860
Maybe they ask that too.

2698
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,220
That might be something that- They must ask that.

2699
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,060
Yeah.

2700
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,500
That's gotta, yeah, that's probably part of it.

2701
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,340
Right.

2702
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,580
Do you think you have what it takes

2703
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,220
to help the podcast, the Riot guys, you know,

2704
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:45,700
like pull a casual scheme and get some more content?

2705
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:48,140
Whatever you do, protect Cody.

2706
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:51,100
Cody is the one innocent that we know.

2707
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:53,540
Cody and the employees of the hotel,

2708
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,420
the nice lady works at the gift shop.

2709
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:56,260
Yeah.

2710
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,700
Their hands are clean.

2711
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,940
Oh yeah, she's fine, yes.

2712
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:02,940
Just be on alert if you step into bunkers.

2713
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:07,300
Whatever you do, just don't write any personal checks.

2714
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,940
Don't sign any land agreements.

2715
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:12,620
Just double check everything.

2716
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:14,740
You can look organizations up on the internet.

2717
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,300
Don't sign your will.

2718
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:18,140
Don't sign anything.

2719
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:20,060
Don't sign all your money over to the-

2720
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,860
Lawyers, lawyers, lawyers.

2721
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:25,620
To Inner Tubular Inc. or the Falcone Group.

2722
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,100
All right, we gotta get out of here.

2723
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:30,780
This was such a, this was a splash and a bash, guys.

2724
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:32,620
I have another answer to one of my questions.

2725
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:34,980
Creamsicle, creamsicle difference.

2726
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:36,420
Sherbet-like shell of the creamsicle

2727
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:38,060
is identical to that of the dreamsicle,

2728
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:39,540
but the payoff inside is ice cream

2729
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:42,260
and the former, ice milk in the latter.

2730
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:44,860
Oh right, because you have to have

2731
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:46,460
a certain amount of milk fat.

2732
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:49,140
Anyway, I went out with a real bang on this episode.

2733
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:49,980
Yeah.

2734
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:52,020
I feel like everyone wanted to know.

2735
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,580
It was a dreamsicle of an episode.

2736
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:55,420
Really, yeah.

2737
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,900
And this is why it all happened.

2738
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:58,540
It's all now coming together.

2739
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,620
Four years after we created that list,

2740
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,940
we know what this was about.

2741
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:05,340
We're gonna infiltrate a secret elite society

2742
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,500
of Inner Tubulars and find out

2743
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,740
what they're doing back there.

2744
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:10,780
And we're gonna earn points along the way.

2745
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:11,620
Wow.

2746
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:14,540
What a, well this is more engaging than like a,

2747
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,700
sort of like multi-season television show.

2748
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:17,540
Yeah.

2749
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,380
The threads and the-

2750
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,780
It's like a Dan Brown book.

2751
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,580
Our lives have been pretty interesting

2752
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:25,820
ever since that email of 100 street names

2753
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,260
came into our lives.

2754
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:28,100
Wow.

2755
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,140
Who knows what'll happen from here?

2756
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:29,980
Who knows?

2757
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,980
And unfortunately, they're coming to an end soon

2758
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,780
because we've gotten too close.

2759
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:35,380
Oh yes.

2760
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,700
This may be the final episode of Podcast The Ride.

2761
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,340
We'll be sniped as soon as we leave.

2762
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:42,020
But as far as I know, we survived Podcast The Ride,

2763
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:43,700
you survived Podcast The Ride.

2766
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:51,340
And I apologize if then that's too much of a mess

2767
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:52,220
and we can't figure it out.

2768
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,620
But there's something there.

2769
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,500
NBA keeps subscribing to the second gate.

2770
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,260
How could you not after this kind of shit?

2771
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,380
Lot of fun coming up in February.

2772
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:05,500
It's been a splash, it's been a blast.

2773
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,340
A blast.

2774
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:07,180
It's been a blast.

2775
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,820
It's really been a blast.

2776
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:09,940
Hashtag blast.

2777
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,940
Yeah, we'll see you in the private domain.

2778
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:12,780
Bye.

2779
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:15,220
That tag, what was it?

2780
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:18,580
We'll tag you at tag shack.

2781
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:19,420
Tag shack.

2782
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:20,260
Tag shack.

2783
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,100
Goodbye.
