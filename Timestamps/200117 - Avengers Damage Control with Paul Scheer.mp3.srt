1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,600
Warning, the following podcast may include confusing Marvel Universe distinctions, Hawkeye

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,720
crushing it on guitar, and a surprising amount of bullseye the target dog.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,760
Marvel Comics scribe and podcast superhero Paul Scheer joins us for The Void's Avengers

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:47,840
Damage Control, the virtual reality experience on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,640
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who never avenge

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,380
but would consider it if the bar at the Carthay Circle stopped serving Manhattans.

9
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,560
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always Jason Sheridan.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,520
Yes, and I would do that selflessly because that's not really one of my go-to drinks there.

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,840
You're saying you would aid us in our avenging.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Yes, mutual aid.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Yeah, that's true.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
Scott Gidner here as well, but he is a Carthay Manhattan fan as well.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Yeah, yeah, certainly.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
That would be rough.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,200
I have been mad about, and it's not mad, I guess.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,760
I hear that little private terrace that I love so much, the second floor wine area is

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,160
now AP only and I've heard the lines are crazy.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,640
It's the alfresco tasting terrace.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,160
The alfresco, okay, thanks, yes.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,480
The alfresco tasting terrace is now AP only, which isn't a problem if you're an AP, but

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,480
I think it's made the lines crazy and that does make me want to hulk out.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Yeah, okay.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Hopefully those lines die down before the next time I go.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,680
All right, well, let's bring our guest in here because we're going to talk about a whole

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,440
bunch of fun stuff.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,840
You know him from Black Monday.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,640
You know him from the comic book he wrote.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,480
He's written many comics, but Cosmic Ghost Rider destroys the Marvel history.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Marvel history, sorry, not the Marvel history.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
It's Paul Scheer.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Welcome back, guys.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,140
I'm so excited to be back and I feel like we're not talking about something Disney related,

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,480
so this is a real big departure for me.

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,480
I feel like the two times I've been here we've done...

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Well, the other was skydiving.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Oh, skydiving is not the end of it.

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Oh, yeah, so maybe I am breaking.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
But what we have not still done, this does not break the pattern of you haven't done

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,480
a ride on podcasts.

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
Oh, that's true.

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
So it's staying in that.

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
How do you consider VR?

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
I mean, is VR a ride?

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
It's kind of a ride.

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
It counts.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,720
I also don't want to poke too many holes, but Disney owns Marvel, so we are talking about

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Disney.

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
All right, all right, there we go.

52
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
So we've just destroyed your whole argument.

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Edit all of this out.

55
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
We've humiliated you in the first minutes of the podcast.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
But does Disney own The Void?

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Yes, they do.

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
I think they own part of it.

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I think they own part of it.

61
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,680
Because they do things that are not Disney related.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,240
Jumanji is not, or they've done things that aren't Ghostbusters.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,440
Yes, but Jumanji is a separate VR company.

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Oh, I don't know.

65
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,520
There's a Jumanji escape room on Melrose that I drive by all the time that I'm fascinated

66
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
about.

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Really?

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,520
It's like by where the Groundlings is.

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
But it always is Jumanji.

71
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,160
It's not like, oh, it just opened up for Jumanji 2 or it came out when Jumanji came out.

72
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,760
It is 365, seven days a week, Jumanji escape room.

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Wow.

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,360
And was before the new films, do you think?

75
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,680
That was why I didn't even, I saw it one time and I was like, that's odd that this is still

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,760
the Jumanji escape room because it was post-Jumanji, but pre-Jumanji 2 back in the dice or whatever

77
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
it is.

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,560
And also constantly change it.

79
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,720
Melrose, like any time I'm like, oh, is that restaurant I still like?

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,240
No, gone, gone two years ago.

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,640
Jumanji has the staying power of a great escape room.

82
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,080
We just did what we're talking about today, which is a void.

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,120
We're doing the Avengers void.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Avengers damage control.

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,520
Which is kind of a deceptive title because you swing by a damage control warehouse.

86
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Right.

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,040
But like, you're not doing too much damage control.

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,320
You're not doing too much damage.

89
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,520
I mean, you're helping with the traditional term damage control, but in the Marvel universe,

90
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,600
damage control are these guys who help clean up after superhero fights.

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,880
This has been my literal passion project for such a long time.

92
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,120
All I want to do is a damage control television show.

93
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Oh, sure.

94
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,880
And then I think last year on NBC, this is before everyone at Marvel TV got fired.

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
They did.

96
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
They did.

97
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,120
I think pilot a damage control show.

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,120
I think if you could do an I think that would be the only way you could bring some humor

99
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,660
into the.

100
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,360
I mean, like as a sitcom, you could do a damage control sitcom.

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,920
It really is a bunch of contractors just dealing with the fallout of all these great things.

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,040
They're not great things. These battles.

103
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,960
And that they never get to go experience themselves.

104
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, they're they're strong enough to be effective, but they're not brainy enough to

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
be superheroes.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Sure.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,920
You notice if they weren't there, they do.

108
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,640
These people do need to be employed.

109
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,540
It seems like at the end of the game, though, not to give away a spoiler for the void experience,

110
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:25,480
but the character that Taika Waititi plays in Thor Ragnarok seems to be a part of damage

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,520
control because he then tasks us with the cleanup.

112
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Yes.

113
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

114
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
So now is that in Marvel lore?

115
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,600
Is he now part of damage control?

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,080
It seems like he injected himself for Scott.

117
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,320
So Jason and I are Marvel boys.

118
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,640
Yeah, I knew this was coming.

119
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,200
I'm just trying to I want to make sure Korg is the character we saw at the end who came

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,120
through Dr. Strange's portal at the end.

121
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,040
OK, but you're not even a Marvel boy in movies.

122
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,440
No, I don't do anything.

123
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
I feel suddenly.

124
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Yeah, no, nobody has.

125
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,160
And feel free to.

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,120
No, I don't want to change it.

127
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,520
But I was coming into this thinking like I'm the least Marvel person and I'll need a lot

128
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
of translating.

129
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,320
And I was also suddenly self-conscious of like, I don't want to be a not Marvel guy

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
in like a snooty way.

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,480
I don't want to be like that.

132
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Sure.

133
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
It's trash.

134
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
I do not.

135
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Is that how I sound?

136
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,560
Even saying that I don't know really see the Marvel movies.

137
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
There's only so many hours in the day.

138
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah, sure.

139
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,040
It requires a lot of hours to watch all of these.

140
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Sure.

141
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,320
22, 22 movies.

142
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,240
So 44.

143
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
No, probably probably.

144
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Probably the 70s.

145
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Probably.

146
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,040
Yeah, if you're really committing to it.

147
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,760
Yeah.

148
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,600
I mean, well, it's OK.

149
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,280
Different fun junk imprinted on your head.

150
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,360
I mean, some of the same stuff that imprinted in our heads.

151
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
But a lot of overlap.

152
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,760
Yeah, I'm just saying like, you know, this stuff imprinted on us as children.

153
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,880
But you guys and I find this, you know, your knowledge base is in the comic

154
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
books that then grew into the films.

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
There's some people who just know the film.

156
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,320
Yes.

157
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,200
You don't have to.

158
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
You don't have to do that work.

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,960
You don't have to do that backlog.

160
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,840
Yes, because they so in the movies, Damage Control is mentioned very briefly

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,560
as like the cleanup company that like kicks Michael Keaton's like salvage

162
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,360
company out in the Spider-Man movies.

163
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
Who is the head of Damage Control?

164
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,920
You see her for a second, right?

165
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,720
Is it somebody I thought a big name person like walks in with them?

166
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,880
Maybe I'm wrong. I could be totally wrong.

167
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,160
But let's maybe in Guardian Glenn Close is in Guardian.

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
He's in the Nova Corps.

169
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,120
Yeah, she's in the Nova Corps with John C.

170
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,840
Riley. Yeah.

171
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
Got to look just do you have a notepad?

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,880
Did you want to write all this?

173
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,040
I'll start taking it.

174
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,560
I get to relax in this way.

175
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

176
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,200
This will be fun.

177
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,960
This is the in there's only been like 12 damage control comics

178
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,600
spread out over a few limited series, a number of them written by Dwayne McDuffie,

179
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,920
who co-created the character Static.

180
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Oh, yes.

181
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,120
From Static Shock, if you remember that cartoon and comic series and multi

182
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,680
award, he passed away a number of years ago, but a widely beloved figure

183
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
in the comic book world.

184
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,640
I would also say what I like about damage control is something that I really enjoy

185
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,440
in Marvel comic books, and I think they do it, but not always,

186
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,680
which is just these really weird one offs like they're not like

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,200
like damage control is a fun, bizarre idea.

188
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,560
And I think it may just be the state of where comic books are,

189
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,560
that you can't really take chances on on creating characters like that.

190
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,320
You know, it's a sort of even when I tried to reboot it at Marvel

191
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,800
at a certain point, like, oh, if we do that, we'd need to tie it into a main series.

192
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,840
And like it would be like an addendum to a larger story.

193
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,040
Like we'd have to like tack on three.

194
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,000
But yeah, so you I think there's something really fun about those

195
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,160
older creators at Marvel that were able to just be like, oh, here's a funny,

196
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,560
I weird idea that it can exist in this world.

197
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,600
And it was sold as like in the 80s.

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
It's like it's a sitcom in the Marvel universe.

199
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,040
Yeah, exactly. Which I love.

200
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,360
Yeah, it seems like yeah, it seems like I mean, you obviously have firsthand

201
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,640
experience, but it does seem like it's, you know, think people are like

202
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,080
they're trying to cater to the audience that watches the movies more and more now.

203
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,760
Yes. So it's like people are not they're going to just glaze over

204
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,800
if they go into a comic store and see the yeah, they're not going to get

205
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,720
it. Why am I why?

206
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,040
Why am I enjoying like these toughs?

207
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah, it's roughnecks who have to clean up all the garbage,

208
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
you know, after this thing.

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,520
But I did like the way they at least introduced it and continue to build out

210
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,400
the world because, you know, at least knows it in the Marvel universe.

211
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,880
There is a damage control, but they don't look like the roughnecks.

212
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,960
They look they look pretty much like shield. Yes. Yeah.

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,160
Yeah, yeah, they don't.

214
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
So that's my question.

215
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,320
I guess we should just dive into it.

216
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
This is a confusing thing.

217
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
OK, so you're saying that Avengers damage control is like an area of Marvel lore,

218
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
but that name of this VR attraction is damage control,

219
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
but they are not particularly affiliated.

220
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,440
Yeah, I felt like they were trying to have their cake and eat it.

221
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, they were. Yeah, yeah.

222
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,880
As you might know, yeah.

223
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,840
So there's like six Captain Marvel's spread out over a couple companies.

224
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,680
And there's an age of Ultron is the name of the second Avengers movie

225
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,320
and the name of a crossover that happened a couple of years prior.

226
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
Not the same story, though.

227
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,160
So it's like sometimes they like to use a phrase that gives you a feeling.

228
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah. So that's kind of what they're doing here,

229
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,760
because it's like a new damage control, essentially.

230
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,080
Yeah. Like even the idea of like a damage control, like it felt to me.

231
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,000
Like there's a thing in the Marvel universe

232
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,440
that's still playing a little bit of catch up about that shield

233
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
is not a part of the world anymore,

234
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,240
because it feels like that was like a shield facility that we were visiting,

235
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,160
not like a damage control.

236
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,800
Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,840
I mean, at least in my in my looking at it.

238
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,360
So and you're you're saying, OK, so we're going to have to delineate here

239
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,960
between different versions of the Marvel universe.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,840
There is the MCU, which is a Marvel cinematic universe.

241
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,880
That's the movies and kind of some of the TV shows. Right.

242
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,400
But for sure, all of the Disney plus.

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,560
Yeah, the ones that they liked.

244
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,160
But they sort of like tried to ignore some of the shows.

245
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,640
Feige produced like I would say MCU is anything that Kevin Feige has touched.

246
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
The KSU. Right.

247
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Yeah, because I would I would argue that things like The Punisher on Netflix

248
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,880
or Jessica Jones, even though they are in the Marvel, the new Marvel world,

249
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
that's not Kevin Feige approved.

250
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,120
And I think he's going to reintroduce a lot of these things

251
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,920
the way that he would like to do them.

252
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,440
The Disney plus shows will fall in the MCU.

253
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,840
Yes. Continuity. Right.

254
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,960
And then there's obviously the Marvel like comic universe,

255
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,560
which is 616, would you say?

256
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,000
616. Yeah.

257
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,080
Is the name of the like the multiverse worlds.

258
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,000
But it's still MCU.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,720
No, no, no. You wouldn't call it MCU.

260
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,200
You don't call it officially Marvel comic universe.

261
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,560
No, you wouldn't call it that.

262
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,640
The MCU just became like the kind of the way they phrase it.

263
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,600
Now, my question is, I've heard Feige and other people talk about

264
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,640
there's a Marvel theme park universe.

265
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know what it's called.

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,760
Yes, I know about that, too. Yeah.

267
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,360
But it's a different continuity from the MCU.

268
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,000
Which is smart because I believe that what they want to do

269
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,320
at the theme parks is keep it evergreen because obviously

270
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,760
it can't keep up with the films.

271
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,440
You can't like rebrand the Spider-Man ride based on the specifics

272
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,440
of how that franchise grows.

273
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
You have to be like, and we're stopping here.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,360
Yeah. You can't have a character meet and greet in the park

275
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,440
and then suddenly stop it because they are dead in the continuity of the movies.

276
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,600
Yeah, you have to kind of just embrace like,

277
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,880
I feel like there's going to be a lot of like hologram training facility.

278
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,520
That's the thing I keep on hearing about, like the Avengers training facilities.

279
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah. So it's sort of like they like the danger room and the X-Men.

280
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,160
It's sort of like you will be able to experience things here.

281
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,600
The Tony Stark will live large over the park,

282
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,800
but you will not necessarily be like, I think it'll be less like Spider-Man.

283
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,440
Come on and have this adventure with me.

284
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,280
Right. Yes. Yeah.

285
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,960
Yeah. So so it'll be not tied to the movies.

286
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,520
And my question, of course, is, is this void in that universe

287
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,320
or is it in the MCU proper? We don't know.

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
I don't have an answer to this.

289
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,600
Well, clearly it is all 100 percent

290
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,240
foggy approved because all the characters and actors and likenesses

291
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,160
and voices are in this, which I was very impressed with.

292
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,360
Yes. Yes, that's true.

293
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,640
Let's say right now, if you don't want to be this is will be spoiler

294
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,120
written. Oh, yes. You want to do the void.

295
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,920
You don't want to hear about what's going to happen in it.

296
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,960
Go do it and then restart this.

297
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,040
Yeah. Go find your local void.

298
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,840
Which there's a way there's here. I can say there's a few.

299
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,400
There's a bunch in SoCal and then Atlanta, Vegas, Minneapolis, D.C.,

300
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,720
Plano, Texas and Malaysia are the places where you can do this thing.

301
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,800
So if you're listening to this and you live in Malaysia,

302
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,320
A, I'm very surprised and B, go.

303
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
You guys are huge in Malaysia.

304
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,640
You guys are like the sugar man of Malaysia.

305
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,360
Like you just like this is the podcast.

306
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,200
Somehow it's like on all the stations down there.

307
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,760
We don't realize until we're in our 80s.

308
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,040
We never knew. Statue of Jason in the town square.

309
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,040
Mayor that as mayor. Yeah.

310
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,080
He did elect you mayor.

311
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,760
They took it. We cannot go there, though.

312
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,800
Otherwise, we will have turf wars with the Mercurial Casino owner.

313
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,080
Right. He's in Malaysia.

314
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,320
Oh, is that right? That is where the Mercurial Casino owner, the Maggott.

315
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,440
Yeah. Yeah.

316
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,880
Was he from he's the guy who from Fox with that?

317
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,680
I was a fox park.

318
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,960
And now it's yes, the one where the streets were not wide enough

319
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,720
and the emergency exits weren't quite correct.

320
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,000
And you're the mayor of that now.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,160
Oh, cool. Mayor of an unopened theme park.

322
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,600
And the head of a banana republic.

323
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,560
I will say just to speak about the void for a second in general,

324
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,160
before we even get into this ride.

325
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,520
I love the void.

326
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,320
I think it is a brilliant idea

327
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,200
that I hope to see expanded across the country because it literally is a very

328
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,200
small space. We went to one inside a mall and I think they do interactive

329
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,920
experiences really well.

330
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,720
My only complaint with the void is the limited amount of

331
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,080
activities you can have in the void.

332
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,600
There's not like it seems like one runs and like the Star Wars one,

333
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,800
the rise of the resistance is fantastic.

334
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,360
It's great. But that one just you couldn't go like multiple times

335
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,120
in a day. It's a sort of like it's one that's kind of runs every now

336
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,360
and then they'll be like, oh, Nick Ademus runs every day at one forty five.

337
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,960
Right. Right.

338
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,000
Like they have to reset the you couldn't go do the Star Wars void thing

339
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,680
over and over and over. I mean, you could, but it'd be like

340
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,120
each experience is like five percent different.

341
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,760
It's different in the margins and not like, yes, I went down this door

342
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,880
and a totally different thing happened.

343
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,440
But I will say that based on the rise of the resistance,

344
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,120
to this ride or the other, you're saying you got rise of resistance on the brain.

345
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

346
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
As do we all. It's this is the week.

347
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,360
What is it called? The secrets of the Empire.

348
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,960
Yeah. So sorry. So sorry.

349
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,640
No, no, I don't blame you.

350
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,000
The the this one actually has a thing where you can get a score,

351
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,360
which I think is the best part of this.

352
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,920
This game that we just did today. Yeah.

353
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
You don't have so far in all my void experiences.

354
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,640
I haven't gotten like a score.

355
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,040
But if we get scores, Rick and Ralph, you get us.

356
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,320
Oh, you guys know where we supposed to be emailed scores or get ID cards.

357
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,160
We saw it there at the end.

358
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,280
That's not all that we have to kind of remember it.

359
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
Yeah, I don't think they gave it to us.

360
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,200
Attached to the picture.

361
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,600
I haven't looked at the show email yet.

362
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,360
I guess we can look. I'll bring it up.

363
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,280
But probably I don't feel like it's just a photo.

364
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,360
I think you just got to scan that quickly and we all got a letter grade at the end.

365
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,600
Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,000
To to do a little ways. Yeah.

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,320
We'll reveal it at the end.

368
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
But the void I'll say about the void.

369
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Yeah, like the void is very cool and especially like for how easy it is in general,

370
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,200
like makes me very excited about five years from now or 10 years, because like really,

371
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,480
my only complaints about actually the physical void is like, it's a little heavy.

372
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,280
The heads at home, it's a little heavy and like the vest.

373
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
You're not wearing gloves.

374
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,120
Yes. You know, you only are wearing a backpack and a headset.

375
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,920
Like, I mean, like, which is kind of amazing,

376
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,480
because your hands play a giant part in this game, especially like you are shooting from your hands

377
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,040
and you're not wearing any sensors on your hands whatsoever.

378
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,240
No. And you need like precision aiming.

379
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,520
Yeah. Like you need to do very, very specific things with your hands.

380
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,920
Yeah. It's I guess we can say, though, that our hands scan our hands.

381
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,720
Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy. That is crazy.

382
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,680
It's also like what I've heard the rumor is for the Spider-Man ride in California Venture is that

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
you're shooting webs out of your hand and you don't have gloves.

384
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
You don't have any sort of controller. Wow.

385
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,280
It's just scanning your hands and then reacting like I don't.

386
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,680
I guess you do the actual I think or whatever.

387
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,440
Whatever is in front of the car will register your hands.

388
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,960
Well, this is like I'm just going to throw down a very large idea here and see what you guys think.

389
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:13,600
But I feel like I would have enjoyed and I like Smuggler's Run just I've written it many a time now.

390
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,200
I think if it was an avoid scenario, I think I would even enjoy it more in a weird way because

391
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,680
it is kind of mixing like you're in a tactile thing, which is like the Millennium Falcon,

392
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,240
which is amazing to be in that is great. But you also are interacting with it like a video game.

393
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,920
It's a weird mix. I kind of would almost like to be fully in or fully out.

394
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,000
And I feel like- Is it a ride or is it a video game?

395
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,280
Yeah. Maybe just decide a little bit.

396
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.

397
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,960
And I feel like that like my issue with it is I don't feel I feel like I'm looking at a screen.

398
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,920
I don't know. There's something about it where this when we're flying and we're in part of it,

399
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,560
you're really immersed in it. And there are parts in the Smuggler's Run that I feel like

400
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,520
you are always going to have that distance of the screen a little bit.

401
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,600
Well, I always understood there was like I was definitely confused sometimes in this Avengers

402
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,320
thing. But in general, I'm going to hold my hand out in an Iron Man fashion and think and

403
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
I can see a little point and that's going to do something.

404
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Smuggler's Run, I have these things I'm confused about. I don't know what I don't really understand

405
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,760
automatic firing. Yes.

406
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,160
When you're the gunner, I tried to I didn't want to do it again. I just do or wait,

407
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
I do automatic, not manual. I'm saying. Right. I do manual.

408
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,680
I've tried both. I don't think I get manual. I don't think I know how to go up and down or

409
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:42,000
what? The way that I was told to do it was you keep your hands locked. And so you have your

410
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
buttons on three different the three different buttons and you kind of play it like a piano

411
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,160
like that. And so you're just going up, down, that up, down, down. Like you just kind of like

412
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,960
so basically, I think if you just keep a steady flow of those three, you'll get a better you get

413
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,400
a better firing accuracy. I think there's some crossover with that and some crossover with this

414
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,320
void experience in that there you have to adjust to the rhythm because video games,

415
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,360
you press a button and assuming it's running a top speed, it's almost instantaneous like a blaster

416
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,120
or something. This like you don't really flex your hand or anything. You just aim it and that like

417
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,120
charges for a second and then fires and takes a beat or two to get used to. And then and then

418
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,120
you can kind of be pretty reasonably accurate with it and it is satisfying. I found it to be

419
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,760
incredibly like that and like to feel like you were actually affecting something. And that's why

420
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,840
Secrets of the Empire. I was telling you guys, I wrote it the first time by myself. I just happened

421
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,840
to go there. The void was empty. It was like the Wednesday and they're like, oh, you could just go

422
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,600
in. And it was kind of the best scenario because you could kind of just really explore the space

423
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,240
or someone else with you. But I felt like I didn't have much control over the end game. It was sort

424
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,120
of like I was going to I was going to leave their triumphant no matter what. I think the same way

425
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,400
here you were going to leave traveling, but they gave you a couple more elements that made you feel

426
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,520
like, oh no, I'm actually I am in I am get I am scoring here. I'm getting some points up on the

427
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,520
board. Sure. I mean, I think the big highlight of this was a lot of the spatial stuff like the set

428
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:29,520
pieces of like going from place to place. Yeah, because they use the Doctor Strange like portals

429
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,920
very well. Yes, I was very impressed. The game is long. Yeah, it felt long, which was really nice.

430
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:50,320
Yeah. The big travel you get to do into Doctor Strange is what? Yes. Well, it's located in what

431
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,600
part of New York do we know? It's in the village. Village. Yeah. OK. So yeah, well, so I guess we'll

432
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,600
maybe we'll just walk through it here and we'll get there. Because, yeah, so spoiler alert,

433
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,280
we get to go to Doctor Strange's house. Yeah. Yeah. So basically you get there. You park probably

434
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,560
near the target because some of those lots are a little more. It's a city target. Well, that's not

435
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,320
a city target. That is not. No, that is not at all a city target. It has the shopping cart escalators.

436
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,920
That implies space. Yeah, that's a free floor target, man. And we've got an episode on that.

437
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,120
Oh, that's coming. No, I would love to be here for the city target versus the regular target.

438
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,160
I have a lot of opinions. That does seem in our wheelhouse. Oh, my gosh. Let's get into it.

439
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:41,360
We're at the Glendale Galleria, we should say. And every void is I think every void seems a little

440
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,200
different. The Glendale Galleria, like there's some ones that are in malls that seem like they're just

441
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,560
a box. And I think what's really amazing about it is if you were to look, if you were to stand

442
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:03,040
above the void, I think it is only maybe like 15 by 10 feet, but they wrap you around so much.

443
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,760
And yeah, you I have never taken my mask off because I'm a good boy. Like, of course, I want

444
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,760
to enjoy the space, but it's very small, but they keep on just moving you. You think you're doing a

445
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,880
lot of movement, but you're just in a small space. There's this bizarre thing we talked about. I

446
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
think the first one we talked about the Star Wars one, but where you don't know, like you're actually

447
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,840
curving, but visually you think you're walking a straight line that goes and goes and goes.

448
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,600
And there's one of those in this and I'll wait till we get to that point, but there's an illusion

449
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,440
thing I read about that I still can't really process, but I'll wait till that point. Yeah.

450
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,840
So we start with, of course, a video like all good experiences and rides do. I love that video.

451
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,640
I'm so excited to be in that video room every time. That video, I have to, I want to hear what

452
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,520
you guys think, but I think that was one of the best video introductions by a character in a film.

453
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,040
They often feel like they're phoned in, they don't know the lines, like especially Casiel or

454
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,440
Cassian or Cassian. Andor. He looks like he is reading off a prompt. Like there is,

455
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,760
that is, that is, does not feel like he's in it, but he's not like, he does not have all the tech

456
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,560
jargon down. Oh, sure. Well, and the other, we'd also be comparing it to Wreck-It Ralph,

457
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,560
which John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman participate in. And if they were phoning it in,

458
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,360
you can't tell because with the beauty of animation, you can bring the characters to it.

459
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,400
But they were, it was, I thought they were like as fun as they are in the movie.

460
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,480
But that's kind of great because they don't have to, like this is a, as from an acting standpoint,

461
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,680
a giant non-changing, like no camera changing monologue. Like it's a one shot and you have to

462
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,360
drop a lot of specifics. Like a lot. Jargon legally is that they're trying to make fun,

463
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,600
but that still is really mealy-mouthed. And she did a great, I thought she did a great job.

464
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Shuri is our host. There's also about background. There's Dora Milaje in the background.

465
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,720
There's a Wakandan AI, which I think is a new character, right? Like what kind of like Martin

466
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,680
Freeman doing a Wakandan accent? I know it's not Martin Freeman, but yeah, I think it's like,

467
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,640
it is a Wakandan Jarvis. Yeah. Yeah. I can't remember. I saw Black Panther. I can't remember.

468
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,280
Did he have his own jar? They all have their own Jarvis. They had to have had some sort of

469
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:32,160
Jarvis, but I didn't seem to be as prominent as, like Tony talked to Jarvis all the time.

470
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,960
Right. Black Panther, like Shuri was the Jarvis talking to, I mean, essentially to Black Panther.

471
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,320
I feel like that was the conversation, you know. No, is this thing set in a specific,

472
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,040
it seems like it is like canonically post end game. Am I right? Like, does it, like,

473
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,640
because I don't know what I'm looking at exactly. Does it like account for the events?

474
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,720
It certainly created it like that. I think so, because it's the newer wave of Avengers.

475
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,960
They only have one thing that I noticed that is not post end game with one of the characters,

476
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,400
deformity, which is now a part of the, at the end of, we can get to it, but like the Hulk,

477
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,640
it would have a messed up pan. Oh, good point. Yeah. Cause yeah, so that's a spoiler at the end

478
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,440
of end game or no, and they're towards the middle, I guess. I can't remember. Hulk uses

479
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,360
the infinity gauntlet and he fucks his hand up because it's so powerful. Yeah. I forgot about

480
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,800
that. Yeah. So yeah, I did not, I actually forgot to look at Hulk's hands. Ooh. And there's, oh,

481
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,760
I'll get to it. I saw, I saw an Easter egg in there. Did you see that one? The thing I,

482
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:47,440
Oh, I, mine was more, not a blooper, but I think maybe just they didn't care about the actor who

483
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:55,600
plays Shuri. Has she always had a tattoo on her wrist? Like a tattoo from her hand to her wrist?

484
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,680
Because I saw that in the pre-show. I was like, I don't know if they just covered that up.

485
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,440
Yeah. They might've just covered that up. Or she got it after or what's going on.

486
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,680
I'm going to look at a wire image picture of her right now.

487
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:11,040
Find some premiere photos. Yeah. It looked cool. I was like, it makes sense for the character,

488
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,680
but I had never caught that before. So yeah. So, so Shuri, who is a princess of Wakanda,

489
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,080
who's Black Panther's sister, who was like a tech genius. She is telling us that we are going to be

490
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,160
on a trial. Yeah. We're going to be testing out. Yes. In one of the science centers that they

491
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,400
set up at the end of Black Panther. They run with like, there are Wakanda science centers around

492
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,320
the world. The actress who plays Shuri has a tattoo around her one of her hands, like a bracelet.

493
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,520
It looks like a bracelet. It looks like a bracelet. Yeah. But nothing coming from top to

494
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,600
not going up. So that may be covered. Interesting. So yeah. So can I just say that there's the,

495
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,080
I'm in a mall, I'm in the Galleria and I can walk into a room and watch a video where a character

496
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,280
from a movie says, we're recruiting you. And this is the center for such and such. Yeah. This kind of,

497
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,800
it kind of fulfills some of my like desire for there to be Chuck E. Cheese type things everywhere.

498
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,800
That why don't all malls have some place with the robot you can walk in and see that like in some,

499
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,880
in some boring mall characters talking to me. It's wonderful. Yeah. You can only see like a

500
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,120
handful of other places. Right. It would be nice before you go into a target. If it was like, you

501
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,200
got a pre-show video with Bullseye, the target dog. And we all know that Bullseye's personality

502
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,440
is, is great for that to really welcome you to spending. Welcome you to spending. He's, he's

503
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,400
eager. Yes. Welcome to spend. I have gone to a handful of these parties. They're called the night

504
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,960
before parties. They happened before the Oscars and they happened before the Emmys and is sponsored

505
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,880
by target and Bullseye, the dog is there on a pedestal, the real Bullseye. And you get to take

506
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,520
a picture with him if you like. I believe I have a picture. I believe there's a picture of Nick Kroll

507
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,960
and I with Bullseye, the dog, the real live dog. And it was quite a thrill.

508
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Now that's an Avengers team. In the Schomburg target, which is my mother's favorite place to go.

509
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,600
So when we were back home for the holidays, we went, there are many like Bullseye little

510
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,200
animatronic kind of things in that target. What are you talking about?

511
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,440
You didn't take us. We were there. We were there. I didn't know until a couple of weeks

512
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,680
ago when you weren't there and Bullseye's like, bud is sticking out of like a package

513
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,120
and his little tail is wagging his seat. Bullseye's seat is sticking out of.

514
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,920
Well, do you guys know, I mean, Chicago is the home base for the target VR. Did you hear about this?

515
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:54,000
Like, so basically, so they are testing out this idea. Like I have an Oculus Quest. I also have a

516
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,080
HTC Vive setup, which my wife has made me dismantle. But the Oculus is great.

517
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,480
Where the ideally like so Target has been developing this technology that you would

518
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,280
enter into a virtual target and then you'd be able to walk the aisles and then whatever you

519
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:21,920
touch and put in your cart is sent to your house. So this is like the idea that you would be doing

520
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,840
Amazon style shopping via virtual reality in actual like amazing target store.

521
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,200
And so I've had two friends who have experienced the VR target and it's a genius idea because

522
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,640
it's like being in Amazon. Like you like, I always believe that you can't be in target without

523
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,760
spending like upwards of $60. I feel like you get there, like I need toothpaste and you're like,

524
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,520
well, but I also need these notebooks and then this pen and then I'll get that thing. And then

525
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,880
you walk on your go. What did I get? And I feel like this is what they're trying to create.

526
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,800
So they and so apparently they the testing ground for it because they also have the fake,

527
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,400
the giant fake Target in Chicago, which is where you go and you see like, all right,

528
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,240
hey, this is how we're going to display your items. And we send you bring, they bring in

529
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,080
customers to see like, well, let's sell if it's here. If we put a quiz on it at the end of the

530
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,400
aisle, will that be a thing? So they test out the way the store is like laid out.

531
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,000
This is my mom is about to become a big gamer. She's going to be like a virtual reality obsessed.

532
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,920
She's going to get a whole Oculus. She is going to be on that rig constantly. Well, I'm not. I was

533
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:37,360
thinking that all the time was Chicago. We'll see you again soon. Yeah. Back ASAP. All Target related

534
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,680
trip. Yeah. Oh my God. That's wild. I didn't know anything about that. You run through the aisles

535
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:51,680
in a Toys R Us dash kind of way, just like knock a bunch of shit into a car. And then,

536
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,520
but do you, what if, what if I don't though, can I get to the end then and say,

537
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,600
throw that all away? Yeah, it's just a robot. So he could, he could look, if I was, if I was like

538
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,400
Target, I would be instituting that. I mean, you'd have to have like a supermarket dash kind of an

539
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,720
element to it. I love all those VR stuff. I'm all in on, on VR. And I believe that I still believe

540
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,280
it's going to be the future of like, of like entertainment and stuff like that. It's still,

541
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,800
yeah, it's, it's feeling more that way. And the void makes you feel more that way. Like, like it

542
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,360
is the most successful like application of it. Yeah. I think that we send the most, the most fun.

543
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,840
Yeah. And then that's still because it's still a thing you get together with your friends to do.

544
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,840
But I also think it's because of IP. Like I feel like they're like you're going because it's Star

545
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,240
Wars, it's Ghostbusters, which I really want to do the Ghostbusters one. It's Avengers, it's Wreck

546
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,800
it Ralph. It's not just like, they do have this experience at the void called Nicodemus, which is

547
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,320
like their horror theme one, which is incredibly fun and really cool. But I think it's a harder

548
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,720
sell to say to your friends, you want to go check out the legend of Nicodemus. It's kind of like a

549
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,400
horror VR. It's like a horror, it's a harder seller. I think year three, I think this year,

550
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,360
after three years, Mike will finally have sold Nicodemus to more people to go and see it.

551
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,600
The demon of in vanishment. But I do want to. I went, I did the whole thing. I picked the card

552
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,920
at an amazing, it's super fun. I went with people who are very much into that level of experience,

553
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,000
but I think that the reason why VR has a hard time taking off a lot of the times is because

554
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,600
it, you have to like bring the concept has to be what people want to play. It's like, oh,

555
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,360
it's Terminator or for me, the Oculus Quest, it's at Vader Immortal. Everybody like that I showed

556
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,960
off to wants to play Vader Immortal because it's like, oh, I have a lightsaber. I understand this

557
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,680
world. I understand the world that I'm entering into, which kind of is a positive and negative

558
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,080
because we should have more adventurous senses. But things that aren't IP, but there's something

559
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,920
about like, I get the world. I've been here before in movies and in my dreams. So now when I'm in

560
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:05,280
here in VR, I kind of get it. It would be nice. I don't know if this is possible. I mean, I guess

561
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,480
it's possible. It would be nice if people sort of eventually come to think of like VR places like,

562
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,600
oh, honey, we should see what's playing at the void tonight. So like maybe you would do an original

563
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,240
one. You wouldn't necessarily like, if you can train a generation that this is entertainment.

564
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,720
The cool indie one. Yeah. Yeah. The cool, yeah. The low budget, the uncut gems.

565
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,480
Oh God, that's a horrible VR experience. It's two and a half hours of pure panic.

566
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,040
You're just anxiety inducing the entire year. You can't win. You're naked in a trunk for a part of

567
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,400
it. You look down in the VR and you're nude. It feels so real. That bell ringing. How do I start

568
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,440
it? You raise your hands, get help immediately. Sorry, I can't help with that one. I will say the

569
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,000
one thing that about the void, I don't know how record Ralph was, but I, it still is falling into

570
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,520
that same trap as most rides do, which is like, so glad you're here to test out our new suits.

571
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,600
Uh-oh, we're being under attack. We're going to get you on that field immediately. Like something

572
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,040
has happened and now you need to be there. And what I like about secrets of the empire is no,

573
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,040
no, you are on this mission. You have to recover this thing. Like, let's just go, like, let's just

574
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,800
get into, like, you don't need, you know, something went wrong. Yeah, something went wrong. I feel

575
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,280
like let's get past that part of the, uh, the game. I don't like that anymore. I feel like that's been

576
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,560
done to death. I feel like it's a, it's a hack ride. Justification. Yeah. Yeah. Of like, this is

577
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,960
why you are not captain America, but you are helping you're visiting. Yeah. It's like, it's

578
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,880
so bizarre because it never happened. It's never happened in any narrative function. It's not like,

579
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,440
we'll get these guys from the street too. Like, you know, it's like, they're like worried that if

580
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,640
they go, okay, you are superheroes here and like, like dad is going to go, wait, hold on a second

581
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,920
here. I'm not a superhero. Shut the thing down here. They have the wrong people. Like people.

582
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,760
I sell insurance. I can't help. I have no skills in this. What is going on? Can both my kids be

583
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,600
iron man. It's going to really mess up the day if they have to pick. Yeah. I don't know. They're not

584
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,200
giving anyone any credit for like, everyone gets it. Imagination. You've gone into a virtual reality

585
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,560
thing. Just play the thing. You don't have to be a character that we recognize. I mean, that's why

586
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,600
I think again, star Wars has a great element to it, which is like everyone's a stormtrooper in that

587
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,680
one. Like you're infiltrating. You're part of a bigger gang. This one, it's tough. You're in this

588
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,680
black Panther iron man mashup costume, which is pretty cool looking. Yeah. Yeah. Um, definitely.

589
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,520
But I'm like, I'm also down for, and I guess maybe this is where I've graduated too, as far as like a

590
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,000
person likes rides. Uh, I'm okay if it's all simulation, right? That's what we're doing.

591
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,480
Anyway, I don't need the real world to be at stake. Like that doesn't improve the gameplay.

592
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,440
It's like if they go like, Hey, you welcome to the Avengers facility. Here are three events that have

593
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,080
happened in Marvel history that we are now going to test our suits out to see if they, how we could

594
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,120
have, we will learn from our mistakes. Right. Yeah. Oh, sure. You know, you could be in those movies

595
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,160
and there's no consequences. There's no consequences anyway. Let's just, uh, let me just train.

596
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,600
Wait, there's time travel and magic and everything. Yeah. Like, how do we story justify why you'd be in

597
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,360
this event? Right. Yeah. No, you just do. Uh, you don't know else in this area of like justification

598
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,080
and why are you there? Someone, anyone tell me what, why you're there in pirates of the Caribbean.

599
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,320
I don't know. Right. Right. Right. Right. You know, like, but do we care? Do we go on pirates every

600
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,600
time and love it? Yeah. I don't know. I don't think they know why you're there. You're in a boat that

601
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,360
happens to be going near a lot of chaos, but am I in the past? Well, I don't care. No one needs it

602
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,200
to tell me any. Yeah. I think you're seeing the past. I think you're like an outside absurd. Well,

603
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,600
that's true. That's the narrative of the ride versus what the actual guest is supposed to be.

604
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,800
Yeah. We are ghosts. We are, we are Scrooge in it. Like we are, like, I feel like we are just like,

605
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,120
there's no boat captain, but we're just kind of, we're just, we're, we're simply on a boat ride.

606
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,840
When you leave skeleton world, do you become a skeleton? Like, do you know, you know, there's

607
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,000
that new, that thing they re-added where you're going, there's all, it's all skeletons at the

608
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,400
beginning. And then there's a skeleton split down the middle and it becomes a real person.

609
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,960
Have you seen this? That's really cool. Yeah. Of illustration. Supposedly what I have on,

610
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,440
what I understand is a time, you go back in time. So yes, if, if we were in a void helmet, would I

611
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,560
now be a skeleton and all of the pirates are real instead of vice versa? Oh, good question. No,

612
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,800
I think we would all, no, I think we'd all be skeleton. No, I think on the first part of pirates,

613
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,440
we'd all be skeletons with jewelry on. So you'd look down and you'd have like rings, but skeleton

614
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,560
fingers. And then once you went past that, then you would turn into a drunken pirate.

615
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,120
But now you see, I would quickly say, but you'll never have a ride like pirates against because

616
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,040
it, it's not checking the boxes, but then you think about avatar and you go on that ride,

617
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,480
which is really a bad version of pirates. It's like, uh, you're on that boat ride and you,

618
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,080
you don't do anything nor do you even see anything very interesting. It's sort of like,

619
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,760
except for the shaman of song. Yeah. The shaman of song. Yes. Uh, and then like,

620
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,640
and that is the biggest payoff that is so anticlimactic, but it's such a, uh,

621
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,840
I'll say it. It's a bummer. That ride is a bummer to me. Like I, I, I, it's beautiful.

622
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,960
I think I'm with you though. It might make some people mad. Yeah. I mean, it's beautiful. It's a

623
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,680
beauty. It's a, it's like, um, I don't know. It's like, it's pretty to look at, but it's not like,

624
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,720
not worth that line. That's the key. I think if you can just get on, which some have talked to

625
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,520
people who've just gotten straight on and you're like greatest thing ever, but like even, I mean,

626
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,520
well, no, we'd still love it, but even like Sinbad and Tokyo, which is so wonderful. If you,

627
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,680
if you had to do an hour and a half and then you got on it, still better, right? Still very,

628
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,920
yeah. But you'd be so much better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying there's the,

629
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,400
there'd be the annoyance of the giant line as opposed to so many boat rides. You just walk

630
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,680
straight on. Yeah. And you feel like you should someday. You'll be able to,

631
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,720
that boat ride feels to me, the avatar one, like a real, like the imagineers were shut down by

632
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,640
James Cameron. Like, I feel like James Cameron was like, they're like, this is the idea. I'm

633
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,880
going to do this. He's like, no, the most interesting thing is like the, the plant life

634
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,480
of the planet. That's what we really need to see. Okay. But we'll do this. I've entered. No,

635
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,720
there's no adventure here. It's just like, you're just like on a pretty boat ride. Okay. Yeah. But

636
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,160
maybe like for the ride, no, like I feel like he was like, no, no, no. Cause there's like,

637
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,560
there's nothing, everything that Disney does, there's an element to it. That is way more

638
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,640
exciting than that one ride. It's like if the blue Bayou part of pirates never ended. Yes. You just

639
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,960
like looked around and then did it again. I'd rather be on that blue Bayou watching people eat

640
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,080
dinner and hearing the music. If you were going by an avatar restaurant on the ride. Yeah.

641
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,440
If you went through Saltouli Canteen. Yeah. Into the kitchen. Yeah. By the roasting chicken spit.

642
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,880
I love how quickly Saltouli came out of your mouth. Oh, we're fancying it. I like Saltouli

643
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,320
Canteen more than Nabi River Journey, I think. In terms of if I had to list the experiences.

644
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,880
The bowls are really good. Those little bobas. If I could see the bobas being made on the boat.

645
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,840
Now we're talking. I think the reality of like, you know, when Joe Rody has talked about like

646
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:40,400
trying to achieve a feeling of peace or serenity in the boat ride is the practical reality kind of

647
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,560
cancels that out when it's like, well, the line's too long for flight path. Let's go on the boat.

648
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,040
And, or like, oh God, it's noon. It's lunch. Everyone is in the park now. Like, oh no.

649
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,480
I think everyone's opinion though would be different of it. Yes. If it was 20 minute line

650
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,280
and there were two other big sort of serene scenes. Yes. I think it's very short in addition

651
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,160
to a long line. There's something about like, I mean, look, I've gone on that ride in Disneyland,

652
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,240
the Storybook land and you're on that boat that you could say like pound for pound. It's equally

653
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,240
serene. Right. Like, I mean, it's like, and I enjoy that Storybook land one more. I'm not,

654
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,240
I'm not like give me waterfall drops. I'm not asking for. Not everything has to be Spider-Man

655
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,520
Transformers insanely high tech. Great. Yeah. It just seems like, and maybe, maybe I just wasn't

656
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,040
in that peaceful mode. Maybe it is the peaceful mode. Like I just think it's not, there's, it

657
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,440
needs a couple more moves. I always tell you, think about the ride and like, in like terms of moves.

658
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,120
And really all I remember from the ride is the shaman of song singing that wonderful melody,

659
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,360
and the frog, the technology, the frog kind of jumping above on the lily pads.

660
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,120
And then I remember like there's screens and stuff happening and it's nice and pleasant,

661
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,240
but those are the only two things I remember. So I feel like that's where the problems lie.

662
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,280
There's not five things you remember from the ride. There's two. I would say just convert that

663
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,960
into some sort of a dome that you could go into and use that as like an air conditioned break,

664
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,680
like lay down, relax, like at Disney, like listen to this song. You hear the shaman off in the

665
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:24,400
distance, like make it a little like. Coachella chill out. By the way, I'm, then I'm like,

666
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,520
that's the best idea. Like they've never done that before. Like you're like 15 minutes in like

667
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,720
a chill out tent. Like you'd be like, I'm cool. I'm relaxed. And I go back into the world.

668
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,040
Yeah. Energize. You're like backstage on the side of the stage watching the shaman of song.

669
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,920
Yeah. And you're just chilled out there and you're enjoying the set. They got close.

670
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,480
The shaman is playing at Coachella. Yeah. The shaman sort of playing at the Navi Coachella

671
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,160
with 90,000 people. Yeah. Which I think they will explore in one of these sequels.

672
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,720
The Navi Coachella, whatever that is. There was a Coachella in Star War and Rise of Skywalker.

673
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,640
Yes, that's right. The franchises need their Coachella. Yes. Yeah. There's deleted scenes

674
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,480
where the they have the wrong laminates. So they're like arguing. They're arguing.

675
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,360
Right. Where did you go? Right. I would love it if you saw Lando on his ship there and

676
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,280
and rise a Skywalker with just a bunch of laminates hanging on one of the doorposts,

677
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,560
like, you know, over the years, all the ones that Lando has collected. Yeah.

678
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,640
Which one here? That's for you. And the laminates in Kylo Ren's hand and then Ray opens her eyes

679
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,600
and it's in her hand. But that's how she finds out her name because they're like,

680
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,760
we can't give you the pass if you don't have a last name. Just right. Well, we need a last name.

681
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,280
We need a last name for the past. Now there's a reason. Yeah.

682
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,840
All right. That's the MacGuffin. I need to get the

683
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,800
doctor. Besides random people demanding to know your last name. Hey, no, last name.

684
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,720
What's your last name? Skywalk. Come on, man. It's not Skywalk. Come on. You're like,

685
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,240
stop name dropping. Yeah. Now, if you knew the target dog, maybe I'd let you in here.

686
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,640
An animated version of Bullseye, the target dog, told people before a movie to like silence their

687
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,400
cell phones and please don't talk during the movie. And I'm like, oh, I like that. Like this.

688
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,480
Would any of you guys, you know, obviously you're all writers, performers, and you know,

689
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,080
would you ever go in for a target that dog pitch? Like if they say, hey, look,

690
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,760
target is hearing ideas. Like Eminem's has been a thing that people have been talking about lately.

691
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,000
Like people have gone into pitch ideas to make an Eminem's style Lego movie. Is there, you know,

692
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
not Eminem's and Lego's, but like that style of, hey, we're going to, we're going to launch this.

693
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,600
Could there be a Bullseye movie? 100%. It's got to be real. It can't be like Call of the Wild dog.

694
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,040
It can't be like CGI dog. I feel the audience before cats. I mean, we're all in a weird mood

695
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,040
because we're about to see cats, but like, I feel like the audience kind of clenched up when they're

696
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,520
like, oh, that's CGI dog. CGI is not a real dog or a puppet or something. I mean, I could do a

697
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,560
Bullseye puppet or I would do maybe animated. I mean, animated Bullseye. Yeah. Yeah. Animated

698
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:07,120
is fun, but like a practical, like dark crystal Bullseye type puppet. I don't know that they're

699
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,920
adding dark crystal. Seems like it's going to be sinister now. Oh yeah. Baby Yoda. I now have a

700
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,440
pitch for him. Just, I haven't thought of this more than right now. What if target the Bull,

701
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,520
the Bullseye, the target dog is like a private detective, whatever you want he gets. Like,

702
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:31,360
so like that's the thing. Like he finds your thing. Like a Ray Donovan sort of fixer private

703
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:39,200
detective. And then of course he gets involved in a larger conspiracy. So it's almost like a film

704
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,520
noir take Bullseye the target dog. He is an investigator. Normally he's finding you whatever

705
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,560
you need. Oh, I have bad feet. Here's a foot massager. Oh, I got this other thing. Oh,

706
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,480
you know, I'm going to get you a special pencil holder, but then you ask him for something and

707
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,800
that's the thing he can't find. I think that's great. I think that's ever every kid's cartoon

708
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,560
in the nineties did a film noir takeoff episode or two part episode or something with the way.

709
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,960
I mean, with the way entertainment is going with IP, I mean, we would all be lucky to work on a

710
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,520
Bullseye show. TV show, ancillary web content. Yeah. I just add that the guy assigning the

711
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:22,000
missions that his Charlie essentially is Brian Cornell, the CEO of Target. I love that. I'm a

712
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,160
big fan. I hit, we discuss, he had really good walkout music at D 23 this year and I put lyrics

713
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,840
to the walkout music. He had a walkout. Why was he at D 23? I don't in the middle. Yeah. Disney

714
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,400
store. Like there's many Disney stores now in some targets. I mean, more target innovations.

715
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,200
I can't believe how many there are to talk about. Yeah. There's going to be many Disney stores.

716
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,120
So even it's a presentation that's all about like, what are we going to do to Epcot? There's a lot

717
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,120
of anticipation. Are they going to say what they're doing at tomorrow? And finally, and then instead,

718
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,400
like now, ladies and gentlemen, see Target CEO Brian Cornell. And he walked out to this really

719
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:01,200
jazzy but but but not down at down at down. I wrote lyrics to it too. Yeah. It's online.

720
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,640
I did them. That's the only thing they were missing. All right. So we're in the void.

721
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:16,960
Yeah. So after the pre show, you were you were then sent to you're in one of the Wakanda science

722
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,840
centers. Yes. You're in the suits. Shuri kind of walks you through like here's how you blast.

723
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,120
Here's how you do like a super blast. And here's how you do a shield. Yes. I didn't use the shield

724
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,640
that much. I all these things, I believe you should have two turns on them. I believe smugglers run.

725
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,760
You should have two turns. And I believe you should have two. Yeah, you are like you are getting used

726
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,640
to just the mechanics of it. And I feel like you're so much better like to do it right in

727
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,760
repetition. Because I think what I was having trouble with was knowing when to shield up to

728
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,520
get a bullet like because you have to get the idea is that you when you get hit with a target,

729
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,480
you're powering up. So then you could blast out hard. But it was like finding that rhythm of

730
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,920
shielding to protect and then shooting it back out. I think it's really only they really only

731
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,880
cue you to do it like once or twice, especially at the very end. I think that shields up so you can

732
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,080
do the last push against the bad guy. I was doing a couple shields up when we were in the helicopter

733
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,760
part and firing back out. And I found it to be very effective and fun. But I was also shielding

734
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,720
up too late or too early. And yeah, it's tough. It's tough because it would be nice if it was like

735
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,640
Captain America one hand shield where you kind of have your shield up but also shooting because it

736
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,840
would be like I put the shield up. But I'm like there's I can't my periphery isn't that good.

737
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,080
Yeah. So you can't quite I'm shooting but there's I'm going to make it hit with another.

738
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:51,360
It's like there's not a real good rhythm. Yeah, I feel like it's a I found my arms to be tired at

739
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,840
the end of this because you really are doing I would say like as close to exercise as I can imagine

740
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:05,600
which is like because your arms are always for most of the game outstretched either two hands

741
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:12,720
shooting like Iron Man one hand shooting or two hands up and you're blocking. So you never are

742
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,120
you very rarely are at rest until you're unless you're listening to like dialogue sections.

743
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:25,920
Right. I found throughout it that when I got hit and the haptic stuff was happening I think I got

744
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:31,120
hit less often but when I got hit it was really hard. You guys that happen to you guys I feel like

745
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,080
I heard some other good. Do you tie your suit tight? Maybe not. You see if I think maybe you did maybe I'm thinking

746
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,760
maybe you tied it too tight. Oh so that it was like really hitting my ribs. I might have yeah. Yeah. Okay so be

747
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,720
careful on that. Yeah mine was okay. I hear and there I would just go I would just get surprised

748
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,040
because I didn't think there was like an enemy on my right or something. Right. You really have to use

749
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,280
your 360 perspective. Like the opening is I like the fact that they give you a chance to play with

750
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,280
the tech. I think everything about this void even though we're having some issues with it is a step

751
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,640
better than every other void right. Like they're like oh great you have a moment to test technology.

752
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,920
Like what am I doing? I'm learning the basics of the game. Like it's not like in game grab a

753
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,040
rifle or do this. Yeah. Like you get a moment you understand the concepts you get to play all things.

754
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,480
You have a tutorial essentially and then you get to go in. Yeah and this one is so important for

755
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,960
that too because like on the Star Wars one which I did like that all of a sudden guns showed up in

756
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,640
the Star Wars one. Yeah. Because that is kind of cool of like you pick up you were like holy

757
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,760
shit there is a gun there. Yeah. This one you needed. I think if they did the gun every time you'd get

758
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,040
tired of the trick. So it's cool if there's a new thing. This one the practical things you touch are what?

759
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:50,160
You you you fly a Quinjet. You potentially fly a Quinjet at one point and you touch a rail. I use

760
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,360
the railing. Oh I hung out at the railing. I mean it's really funny because when you meet Dr. Strange

761
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:03,280
he is in the Sanctum Sanctorum but it says if you were visiting him in Colonial Williamsburg

762
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,680
because you're behind a railing that he is in front of like you are not in the same like it's sort of

763
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,840
like how they have those like glass walls. There's like this is a recreation of an old colonial

764
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:18,880
bedroom like he's on the other side of it. So like I was like casually leaning on the on that to

765
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,680
listen to him chat with us but he is on the other side. I was excited Dr. Strange is there but I was

766
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,840
more a little more excited that there was a little like knob on the rail. I was just like playing

767
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,800
with that. Oh yeah. Like I reached out and found a knob. So that's how I'm like such a baby with

768
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,800
these things. I would have just played with the knob for time. I completely agree. I feel like I was

769
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,760
very fascinated by the surface of the railing. So basically what happens is we're in the training

770
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,960
area. They kind of they say like oh there's a real problem and then stuff goes dark and one of Dr.

771
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,480
Strange's trademark portals opens up which honestly the most exciting part of the whole thing for me

772
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,120
personally because I went oh cool we're going to go see Dr. Strange and then we walk down

773
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,280
three like flights. That's what they're simulating. Like a spiral ramp. Yeah that was actually really

774
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,840
fun and great tech but why was there winter coming through one of the windows? Is that

775
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,400
another portal that it opened? I believe so because again in the first Dr. Strange they have

776
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,480
a whole thing where some of those windows are like he's when he's fighting remember he's fighting

777
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,080
what the villain Mads Mikkelsen. Oh yeah. And he's like shooting people into different like

778
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,160
areas of the earth to get them away from him. Yes. So I guess that's just a nod to that. I don't

779
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,080
know why he wouldn't close it. Yes I mean by the way it was a great effect on the thing because you

780
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:37,280
walk by a cold a wintry window you feel that cold chilly air which was great. There's a bunch of

781
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,920
like good sound and smell sensations throughout this game. Yeah and that descending is a really

782
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,840
crazy little sequence and you're on a pretty narrow little path which is a trick they keep doing and

783
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:54,000
that which freaks you out like I better hug that rail. On my HTC vibe there's a game called like

784
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,000
oh like walk the plank or something like that and so what's what kind of great is the way I had it

785
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,480
hooked up was like I stuck up to my television and so but if you're wearing it you like you're in the

786
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,320
VR space but everyone that's in your house can watch what is happening to you and what you're

787
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:18,320
looking at on the tv and it was always so fun to watch people walk a plank because you are

788
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:26,560
you're just in my living room and you're and you are so almost like I'm hands in front of you like

789
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,840
I'm gonna fall and there's nothing there and it's it's a great disposition of like how your mind can

790
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:38,240
really yeah because I was nervous to walk off that the the odd wheelchair ramp that he has in his

791
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,280
house that goes down yeah flights. I think this is the thing that I was bringing at the bizarre

792
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,360
illusion thing and I might be throwing out some bullshit but I think I did read this in like a

793
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:54,480
little behind the scenes before we did it I think in that part you're going up what I think I might

794
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,200
be insane but I feel like I caught that you mean just like there's a little bit downstairs in the

795
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,840
no void so yeah so so yeah basically you're turning three times and I the one thing that

796
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:09,600
kept throwing my brain is that I felt like I'm like your brain knows that we're not going down

797
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,800
but your eyes are telling you yeah that you're going down so I like towards the right it looks

798
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,880
like there's a drop there's not a second railing no you are yeah you could walk off of it yeah yeah

799
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,560
so you're saying that there was a little bit of an elevation there maybe it's a ramp and I think you

800
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,360
were going up interesting I'll look this up yeah look that up well I know the one thing about the

801
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:36,320
void that they do is it like you think of it like um like a Jimbery like a kid's play space they have

802
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:42,000
all these different objects they kind of repurpose so yeah all the objects that you are pretty much

803
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,760
using in secrets of the empire or wreck at Ralph are just repositioned in different ways and that's

804
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,800
kind of the economical way of making this it's sort of yeah yeah yeah we have like these 20 props and

805
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,960
we just put that here and then do that and like you know not they're not always reused in the same

806
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,440
way but I would imagine there's some sort of a ramp system like that that's an easy easy enough to

807
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,160
go up and go down like you know yeah that's got to be so because and like the other little plank

808
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,000
things I definitely there's a little bridge that comes into play in the Star Wars one too yeah that

809
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,720
must be like a primary tool for them this was like because yeah in the Star Wars one there's a

810
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,520
platform that lowers down that's what that's my favorite part of the Star Wars one is the platform

811
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,880
that lowers down to Mustafar yeah uh because that really blew me away you're on a little ride there

812
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,320
and that's a little ride and you like feel a little wobbly because you're like I could fall off and

813
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:34,640
well that's what in Nicodemus you're on a train and it's speeding and you and there's no caboose

814
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,520
around you you're just free hanging on a train and that's a that's a pretty scary moment um but this

815
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:48,000
this uh walking down to the sanctum sanctorum uh I was I was very like I guess just going like

816
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,120
three levels like simulating three stories yeah makes me go like oh we're going into the

817
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,960
were you guys were you guys having that same issue though because what I was doing was I'd

818
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,080
walk down a level then I'd walk through a portal then I'd walk down another it would go black for

819
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,880
a second I don't know it happened once it happened once to me where it kind of went black and then I

820
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,440
was confused I think I see I felt like I was leading the way so I think I may have gone a

821
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,720
little bit ahead of you guys or something because I would get down to the base walk through a portal

822
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,680
it would go black for a second and then I get back to the next level again I think it flickered once

823
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,960
on me like that I think it flickered once for me well I wonder it would be funny if it is glitched

824
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,760
that's the reason we had to go down three stories oh yeah right there we just send you right back

825
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,080
yeah that'd be crazy because the bar is there but yeah there's so the railing yes the railing

826
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,920
and this part is my favorite part of the whole thing I think oh really well just

827
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,720
there's a lot plenty of other things I really liked about it but just uh uh I talk about on

828
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:52,400
the show I like it when optimist prime at the end of the transformers ride says you did a wonderful

829
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,880
job whatever he says it's a great moment you have like this little connection with him and so we're

830
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,440
going down there and I honestly I felt this is the most uh like I felt something where I was like oh

831
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,800
my god we're going into this place that I've read and it was a quieter part because because I do

832
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,680
think like they want a lot of action and all this stuff so they don't always give you like a little

833
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:22,000
moment like that like to literally enjoy connecting with uh a character a character yes you and I feel

834
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,240
like that's what you really want like even though we get to see shuri she's on the video screen she

835
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,240
comes back a couple times but uh I felt like that moment was a nice it was he was giving you like

836
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,920
then like again an information dump is what we're doing yes go back out there which also is funny

837
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,360
enough because like didn't we just get an information yeah why do we need a second information

838
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:47,040
yeah to override that yeah right that being said it doesn't matter I was like if the whole thing

839
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,880
was in the sanctum sanctum and I could just look around at books like that's that's that's like

840
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,960
some of the vr games that are available at right you know where you can really take your time

841
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:03,040
just build blocks like more minecrafty yeah like you can exist in a space draw or paint or or even

842
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,760
just look around right and it's not practical for something that's you know in a mall and has to go

843
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,160
through but have you done sleep no more no oh guys we gotta get you guys to go see no I know I want

844
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:20,080
to do that for years okay no more is exactly so sleep no more is like this giant building you can

845
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:26,640
get lost in it I won't go into all the specifics but if you wanted you could spend the whole night

846
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,680
in one room right done yeah like you don't have to ever leave that room you don't have to get on

847
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,680
the adventure and there's a storyline that's kind of like Macbeth and it's yes it's the 20

848
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:43,120
but and like characters are going from room to room but it's a full old hotel and you can catch

849
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,320
snippets of the storyline but you don't have to follow it from like I've done it three times I've

850
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:54,480
had three vastly different experiences and I've done a couple here in LA too that everyone's

851
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,920
trying to be like no more and there's a great one I just did that was actually written by like I

852
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:04,960
think the guy who did like the grudge or something like that or the purge but yeah the cool thing is

853
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:11,520
is like so basically the show starts Macbeth starts and all the characters in Macbeth are

854
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:18,320
like think of it like if they left the stage they would be going to their office or they'd be going

855
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,280
to their thing so you may just catch one of the main characters off from their story interacting

856
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,760
in their real space until they come back to their the main story so you can follow the main story

857
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,680
or you can just follow one character for the entire story or you could just like exist and

858
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,560
just watch different it's fascinating so it basically is like there's a whole track that's

859
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:41,760
going on right but you don't have to be in any spot and at the very end they find a way to corral you

860
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,400
down to the final scene so you basically get to hang out in the haunted mansion and do it I mean

861
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,880
for lack of a better term and exist in it in any which way you choose that's fun yeah I'll do that

862
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,720
that sounds good um and if there's a yeah if there was a version of this where you could just

863
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,040
like be so Dr. Strange you want to like hang back yeah yes like a little while if you would like a

864
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,920
little about me you got a little magic like a little magic you could do and you could like pull

865
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,560
books out of magic like and just walk around and like look at portals and stuff because that's

866
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:17,040
that's the good stuff I mean you got the second closest like experience to like having something

867
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,240
either with the like a landmark in marvel or the character was like I guess Spider-Man on the ride

868
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,720
he was coming pretty close to us and giving us his quips but everything else was like you saw it

869
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,480
and it was very quick because we have to get to the action on this this was my I like this because

870
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,000
it was a breather a breather an early breather again I still think that the way that this gets

871
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,200
improved is you go it's a hologram we're going to recreate something and then all of a sudden

872
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,760
you're Hulk I'm Iron Man you're you know Captain America like we like we are like embodying

873
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,120
for this game we have their powers we're not we're not upsetting the MCU we're just sort of like

874
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,600
we're playing around with how those powers exist because I think we're interacting with them but we

875
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:05,520
are we never got to do anything we all are equally matched right yeah it's probably having at the end

876
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:11,200
where like we're doing what we can but ultimately all the characters we recognize show up and do

877
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,880
really do the stuff yeah part of the value added proposition of it of like this is still a little

878
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:23,600
more expensive than you would readily pay for like a movie even though movies always get more

879
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,720
expensive hopefully VR gets less expensive to bring the price down to get more people to do it

880
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:34,880
more often I think part of the selling point is that they go like well this is an experience it's

881
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,640
uh you know kind of a sequel to end game and you can't get it anywhere else and the characters you

882
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,240
like are here which I'm surprised because on the website they're like Ant-Man and and the Wasp and

883
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,960
Doctor Strange but they're like oh they got the less yeah they got the newer people who cost less

884
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:57,120
money but then a lot of people show up and but the thing is this is the whole thing that I read

885
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:04,880
um and my facts are probably a little bit wrong on it but after Iron Man was such a success every

886
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:11,680
contract that Disney put together there's a theme park clause in it which means that you are

887
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:19,280
obligated to do these things and there's I think a certain number attached to it so it is the only

888
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:27,760
one who doesn't have that is Robert Denney Jr. uh so everybody else has to perform the duties of

889
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:35,120
their thing now I don't think Thor talked in this no and uh Captain Marvel did she talk yeah she

890
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,160
guess she did talk a little bit oh yeah yeah that's right yeah Thor did not talk kind of growled

891
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,760
but it wasn't like yeah wasn't a ruffle out growl but I feel like they definitely cherry

892
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,120
picked some people for like because I think they're being calculated with who they're using for what

893
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:56,960
and yeah maybe the newer people that have signed have more appearances in their contract yeah I

894
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:03,280
mean I'm sure it's I'm sure it's a very interesting uh yeah how they break it all down I think they

895
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,480
make like Michael Douglas do a bunch of VR shit yeah well I feel like that like I feel like he

896
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,440
doesn't get one because if you go I don't know but there's that there's that Ant-Man and the Wasp

897
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:20,960
ride in Hong Kong that opened is anybody in it and they are Paul Rudd and uh is it Evangeline Lily

898
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:28,320
yeah I guess my thought is and I always go back to this which is like if I am a a character a

899
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,600
beloved character not a beloved actor a beloved playing a beloved character right it's it has

900
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,280
nothing to do with me like like the reason why people are going to Guardians of the Galaxy is

901
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,720
not because they're like I want to see Chris Pratt it's like I love Guardians I want to exist in this

902
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,080
world I want to see the collector I want to see these things if I am a beloved character fuck

903
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,600
yeah I'm gonna do a video like a video game or or uh or a theme park ride like there's no way like

904
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:57,760
what money I want money for this like no it's like it means that you live on yeah as part of this

905
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:04,160
piece of like like it's not it's not like it's not like do a commercial for Cheerios it's like

906
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:10,160
you're in like one of the most like you know established you know the only theme park really

907
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,880
like the only like like the top tier theme park doing something that is like immortalizing you

908
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,360
it's like I don't understand why you would even have to millions of people will see you

909
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:26,000
multiple generations you can take grandchildren there it's me yeah Puggy is still doing Soarin it's like let's do it

910
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,400
it's awesome yeah yeah yeah yeah they didn't change also some of these characters have the

911
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,560
full face mask so maybe they just need your voice like and also they don't want your face because

912
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:42,640
internationally anyone can be under that mask yeah so it's easier to sell iron man or darth vader or

913
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,840
ant man with the helmet on you know and I just think it's like and it seems at least based on

914
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:52,960
everything that I've seen from the harry potter rights all this stuff what is that maybe a day of

915
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,960
shoot a real easy day of shooting it's not like oh I gotta go away for three months to shoot this

916
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,840
theme park right like that guardians ride looks like that was shot and like an afternoon like

917
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,520
after a lunch break you never get different views on them it's never like now a short film a new

918
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,240
film starring these people it's like clearly and it kind of has to be they have to be shot from

919
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,520
their one way where they're facing you and talking to you so that's a green screen shoot that's an

920
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,560
old fod bsa video if that can get you in like you should be able as long as you can get in the park

921
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:29,840
for free if you're in a like if you're on a ride well that's we know that I think from the last

922
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:34,880
conversation we had on this show right that that is an impot like we knew somebody who wanted to

923
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,680
get a free thing because they were the voice of one of the rides I think it was Dave polis talked

924
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:45,120
about that where like he had to like go through a channel to be like I think he did oh he did

925
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,320
Paul Rubens I think has spoken of some problems I think now they've made things good with with

926
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,080
Paul Rubens like they can't he said like they canceled his pass as soon as Rex came off of

927
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:00,560
star tours maybe wow oh my god they might be more cautious with that because they're more cautious

928
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:05,760
about everything and with social media people could go like hey this big company screwed me

929
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,880
like sure yeah millions of people so that's obvious that's a fair trade off so if you're ever in

930
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,000
anything where there is a themed attraction what anything anyone needs I assume you're putting out

931
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,960
there I mean I'm I'm ready to go get me like I think that that's what uh Patton Oswald did

932
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,600
with Ratatouille he was like I think he does like happily does everything that Ratatouille like if

933
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:30,560
it's a toy or whatever it's like because oftentimes the toys don't have the actual right voices and I

934
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,360
just I guess my whole thing is like that's what you're signing up for like you are becoming a

935
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,160
character you're becoming the voice of this thing of this this thing it's like and it's for kids

936
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,920
it's ultimately for kids it's like if I'm Robert Denny Jr. I'm like yeah I want all my iron man's

937
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,760
that sound like me all right I'll say I'll go into the the vo booth for 30 minutes it's like

938
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,920
my pulsars are going get out of the way you know it's not like heavy acting it's not like you know

939
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,200
it's not like they're manipulating you I think you end up looking worse if it's not you I think you

940
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,400
seem lame if there's a bunch of products out there that are some bad impression yeah yeah it doesn't

941
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,720
well it doesn't we've learned Tom Hanks's brother does all the woody stuff Jim Hanks usually Jim

942
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,800
Hanks oh wow I know Eddie Murphy has a guy who does all the Shrek donkey shit huh okay yeah yeah

943
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:23,600
a bunch of uh a bunch of different donkeys at that cart yeah in universal oh my gosh hundreds and

944
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,800
hundreds of them it's so hard to imagine I wonder what the most like in demand of all the is there

945
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:33,680
like so much woody stuff we don't even realize it's just I would think that like Darth Vader would

946
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,360
be the one that you have to like because definitely not doing all of those no no I wouldn't think so

947
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,680
but he does seem to do a lot I guess maybe he's the guy who doesn't care maybe he's a smart guy

948
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:47,040
he's like yeah you want me to just record my things it's not like Darth Vader is like super

949
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,400
talkative either so it's like you know just lay down a bunch also with modern technology and

950
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:59,520
internet you can rig up a decent like a landline and just do it yeah yeah um and again how much

951
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,000
are we really talking about we don't need that much we don't know that much and it's going to be

952
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,800
filtered and fussed with so much in post anyway yeah actors get off your ass get off if you're a

953
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:16,560
major film talent listening I would only want I would only want yes like I can get in the park

954
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,360
for free if I'm like one of the guardians of the galaxy on the ride and I would just want like one

955
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:27,520
of each toy I did like if I'm doing the voice on a toy just give me a toy in addition to a good

956
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,160
amount of money for the actual well like but you're giving up like I mean who cares about the I guess

957
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,720
it's like like Harrison Ford not giving his likeness to the Indiana Jones ride is so

958
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,200
lame to me like it's like really that's what we're drawing the line like it's Indiana like there's

959
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,320
only one Indiana Jones like how much money you want to make on this that feels like a 90s holdover

960
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,120
that that was like the knife like well you just don't do that you didn't expect to be on a

961
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,440
television show Michael J Fox isn't in the back to the future ride I don't know if there was ever

962
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,320
a story where he was supposed to be but those things I think all set and like star tours is

963
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,240
c3pr2d2 but it's not right Luke Leia Haunt so yeah I think 80s 90s you were calibrated because

964
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:14,240
now you have you have everybody in the home I assume yeah I guess yeah those are spoilers I do

965
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:18,640
know hopefully yeah I mean I feel like I just just from the advertising material is it not

966
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:25,840
Adam Driver though I believe that Adam Driver is always the voice like Darth Vader but never the

967
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,640
physical face it's the mayors yeah right oh it's that okay okay basically what we're saying

968
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,520
Hollywood is we're all ready to work we're all willing to work especially if it's a thing to

969
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,640
show up show up 30 minutes early if you want to have breakfast you know we're all ready

970
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:46,640
free breakfast yeah it's just a funny weird holdout like you know it's just like a weird

971
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,960
thing it's like why make that your stand like you become this like and it's not like I guess

972
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,600
at a certain point Disney has proven like well yeah we'll do the Indiana Jones ride and we

973
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,520
will use all the pictures of you because we own that but on the ride it will just be someone who

974
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,840
looks vaguely like you and it won't be your voice fine doesn't stop anyone from coming to the park

975
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:11,120
or using that ride so who cares like you know it's well this is why I praise and congratulate

976
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:16,560
Donald J. Trump for appearing in the hall of president thank you sir for stepping up

977
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:24,400
showing leadership in this area home alone too he's always he somehow finds time to appear in

978
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:30,640
every piece of media it's shocking that he has not appeared cameoed in more things while president

979
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,960
yeah I know yeah he should be inviting them in left and right it's for the best but also kind

980
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:43,280
of surprising hasn't weaseled its way in the put him in more rides yeah for the void this is a star

981
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:48,320
studded event you're getting really is you're getting everybody in there Evangeline Lilly Paul

982
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:56,400
Rudd Tom Holland yeah Tom Holland in a big way yeah and I didn't realize Taika yeah Taika's

983
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:02,720
yeah like a cameo yeah yeah and again for cameos that's that's that's also surprising like like oh

984
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:07,760
did they burn up a maybe because the voiceover it's different like did they burn up a theme park

985
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,640
thing by just him going all right you guys clean up see you later bye now they don't now he's not

986
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,520
going to be in the ride yeah yeah we used our chip yeah but maybe he didn't because he mocapped

987
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,800
that in the movie right so maybe that wasn't his motion capture right yeah so that doesn't count

988
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:29,040
yeah I think a lot of that was I mean but it was interesting that many characters is that much more

989
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:35,840
animation and rendering and yeah man hours war machine in there too war machine falcon war machine

990
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,760
didn't really get to see um well I was gonna tell you this one spoiler that I saw that I thought

991
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:47,760
was very cool was uh Awatu shows up in oh I didn't notice him up in the clouds when you're fighting

992
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:54,560
uh when you're fighting at the very end you look up and there is his face wow you have to look up

993
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:01,200
up into the sky and to your uh to your right uh he was I just happened to turn at one point

994
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,120
and I saw his big face and I was like oh look and then he just disappeared but it was there

995
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:11,600
wow he's a awatu the watcher is the character that like when an important event happens in marvel

996
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:18,320
like history he just observes he's like a giant regal baby yeah he appears when something of

997
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:24,400
significance is happening in the marvel universe to like uh document it essentially so uh we

998
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,880
wouldn't know if this battle was important or not if he didn't show up yes but now we know it was

999
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,320
it was very worth hasn't really appeared in the mcu movies because he has falls under the has he

1000
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,440
yeah he appeared in like one of them guardians of the galaxy 2 it's there's a cameo the stanley cameo

1001
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:45,760
oh the same he's sitting explaining what's going on to a bunch of board watchers it's a funny

1002
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,680
it's a funny comic but it falls under the fantastic four umbrella doesn't he uh well

1003
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:57,360
that's all very unclear i mean because nick fury also killed him there's a lot he's been

1004
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:02,480
assassinated yeah he's been assassinated there are multiple ones yeah we haven't played a very big

1005
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:08,960
part in our uh cosmic ghost rider uh issues we we're very lucky that they let us mess around with

1006
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:15,040
him uh as almost like this because basically in our marvel book comic ghost writer goes back

1007
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,040
through history and he keeps on messing things up and a while too is upset about this and as he kind

1008
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,920
of messes more stuff up he has to stop being passive and and be a little bit more active and

1009
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:31,600
that was a big battle over at the marvel world but we were able to figure out a fun justification

1010
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,480
for how he could be active and passive at the same time and and still we could get revenge and do all

1011
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,640
this sort of stuff that's great that's interesting he's like i feel like they once in a while they

1012
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:47,200
let him do something yeah yeah yeah it has to be a yeah it has to be a thing yeah it has to be yeah

1013
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:53,600
i think we used him we had a lot to using mind control to do something so he didn't do anything

1014
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,360
physically but he did use his mind they just wanted to be quiet and cool at the end of the day i think

1015
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,160
that they because he's in a he's a watcher you can't make him be a doer you know he's a doer

1016
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:08,880
it's yeah he's waving his around that harms around like us and this thing he's like the uh the eyes of

1017
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,080
dr tj eckelberg the billboard and the great catspien that watches all the sins

1018
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:23,920
like the lorax billboards around la yes the lorax billboard the lorax was the watcher of la yeah

1019
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:30,480
yeah so when you leave the sanctum sictorum you are then now you're in this damage control

1020
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:36,800
in quotes junkyard junkyard which seemingly just has a lot of old shield equipment in it nothing

1021
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:43,840
no no real alien tech or that i saw yeah um and then that's another kind of tutorial part two

1022
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,640
you're now you're kind of fighting but fun stuff happens you get shrunk down by ant man that's a

1023
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:56,160
blast uh you meet spider-man that's great you get when you're shrunk you get there's a suddenly a big

1024
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:01,040
piece of popcorn and you smell it smells like popcorn yeah which is kind of a good convenient

1025
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,240
like what's the smell we could do i also was wondering and maybe i'm wrong about this but

1026
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:12,080
like spider-man had no problem hearing wasp and ant man speak when they were also miniaturized as

1027
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,680
well um but maybe they're all connected some some sort of bluetooth yeah probably there's some

1028
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:23,200
avengers line frequency line uh i like spider-man uh saves us i think what there's like somebody

1029
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:29,120
throws a giant vehicle at us and he saves us and that felt like a very fun it gets really close

1030
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,920
again it's like the immersiveness oh yeah it's very much above we're a lot of standing on platforms

1031
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,960
in this game like i mean like there's not a lot of the moving is to basically walk through portals

1032
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,240
get on an airplane uh the quinjet and then but we're we're doing a lot of standing we're doing

1033
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:50,240
a lot of walk walk walk stand for a while walk walk walk stand for a while and why are so many

1034
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:56,080
void things about you're on some platform you're on like a balcony it's always balconies even

1035
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,840
wreck-it-ralf right you're like overlooking some big city scapes it must be like one of those odd

1036
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,080
here's something we can do well so try to back it in i think because you know you can't interact

1037
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:11,680
with the environment per se like you always need to be like doing something into the like i'm

1038
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,920
throwing this into the environment i am you're like and you got to be like you're gonna be

1039
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,920
somewhere with like a rail something stopping you from just like walking forward into a right

1040
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,040
so you have to be limited in what you can do in the environment but you also want to show off the

1041
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,600
technology in the expanse of the world they're making right because you can't explore the space

1042
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,800
like vr you can explore the space like right this is like kind of like vr but it's not like

1043
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,760
it's not like you can't i mean you can like you're in these very small cubicles like the most

1044
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:47,120
space exploration that we got was in the quinjet where we both had we had two people per jet

1045
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,320
and but then they quickly again just bought all the windows of the quinjet and then you're just

1046
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:58,480
again on a platform firing right and one person is doing a tactile uh you know uh piloting

1047
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,480
but it that didn't seem to make a difference it didn't really yeah i was trying to do it to the

1048
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:09,200
extremes and it wasn't really moving no yeah it seemed like we were just i thought i was excited

1049
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:14,080
for some sort of like up down left right but now you're just flying it was like a boat it was just

1050
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:19,600
like nice and steady yeah very uh lovely boat i would like to get on that river and avatar and

1051
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,200
just listen to some beautiful song it's just a boat of serenity not not a crazy boat i mean i

1052
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:31,440
think part of this is uh you are limited by the processing power of a computer in your backpack

1053
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:38,400
right whereas millennium falcon they can have like something like 16 different high-end processors

1054
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:47,360
to process a a totally destroyable world and modular world right this there's more limitation

1055
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:51,760
you're not seeing battle damage in this world you're basically you're just firing you know

1056
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,160
they're all that's not created characters who when you take care of them they're gone

1057
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:01,120
yeah you're not yeah destroying a building in the building yeah you don't see any battle damage

1058
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:08,720
right uh in the world you're just kind of there and that's fine i think what i liked about uh

1059
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:12,560
secrets of the empire is that you're running around you are getting a gun out of a thing you

1060
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,800
are working on like a a puzzly thing like yeah person's community there's a little bit more

1061
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:22,720
interactive this game seemed to be like you're gonna shoot lasers out of your hand and that is

1062
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:29,200
ultimately what we're doing we are shooting lasers and like that's and we're along for the ride but

1063
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:34,320
that's all we're doing like there's no team but if you don't love doing that which maybe i didn't

1064
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,840
if you get a little tired yeah or if you find it a tad confusing then it's it's a little repetitive

1065
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:45,120
it doesn't heighten at all just sort of like and now we're on this platform shooting at the same

1066
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:50,720
things and that's i think if you were if you were a character you'd be oh now i know that i'm with

1067
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:56,480
mike and always hit my thor hammer and that gives a reverse like even just a different action if we

1068
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:02,560
if the four of us were more different besides the colors of our suits yes yeah um we yeah i think

1069
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,520
i mean yeah i agree with what you're saying and i also agree with it because like as a kid i was

1070
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:14,800
never like i want to be like batman sidekick michael i wanted to be robin i also wanted to be

1071
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:20,400
those characters too which i think is sometimes maybe a mistake sometimes when it's like and now

1072
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,400
you're going to be the superhero and i'm like but i want to be one of those superheroes i don't want

1073
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,880
to be me yeah i want to live the life like that's why that there's a batman vr game which is great

1074
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:34,560
where you're just being a detective so you see a crime scene and as batman you have to investigate

1075
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,080
the crime scene but you're in his outfit and you go back to his crime laboratory it's a little bit

1076
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:44,720
more um it's a great it's a great way but you're batman like you want to be

1077
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,080
you want to be batman yeah i want to be batman i don't want to be i mean i like being these

1078
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:55,680
characters which i guess are just us with suits and the suits which we i think we all liked had

1079
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:01,520
our names embroidered essentially on the breast oh yeah we got to wear personalized shirts

1080
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,040
essentially which kept me and they and i think at the end of the day because i was feeling like it

1081
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,960
was a little bit repetitive it was nice to know that they were keeping track of it because we did

1082
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,720
get our letter of scores and there was something feeling like all right well that it meant something

1083
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:18,160
like what we were doing yes yes yeah though i don't in retrospect i don't know how i would improve in

1084
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,160
any of the areas remember it was very surprising if i we should say that i think the best score was

1085
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:29,600
was mike uh though um mike and paul both a's jason i both b's just happy there were no f's sure but

1086
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,880
mike also the highest number of uh friendly fire yes which is why i don't think i didn't feel that

1087
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,880
i don't think you felt it during i think i was shooting at the heroes too much yes i think i

1088
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,840
think i was i wasn't sure who was who i was very confused ant man and the wasp look like the bad

1089
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:48,720
guys from afar yeah i just want to say i don't know we said yet the bad guys are ultron bots

1090
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:55,360
ultron is back yes oh right this is the kind of uh which i i liked i like that they had a recognizable

1091
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:02,000
villain i i want to say it was spader was it spader yeah it might have been yeah um but

1092
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:07,440
ultron kind of a go-to avengers like lowkey always comes back in the comics lowkey always

1093
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:13,760
comes back at some point ultron always comes back and ultron self-replicating so you can always have

1094
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,400
a lot of goons like yes you always have a lot of guys to fight yeah that was and it was a fun way

1095
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:25,520
that they justified it it was good and you kept it simple like again good story like as far as

1096
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,880
you get to see a bunch of different worlds they move you through different worlds you get to see

1097
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,920
places in marvel i would have liked to have seen some more i think the way we saw sanctum

1098
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,200
the sanctum sanctorum like are there other places that we could have gone to

1099
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,880
yeah that would that would have that same feeling of oh i'm in this spot because i think that that's

1100
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,360
the most fun of it is like yes what's the recognizable thing that i'm in i want to be

1101
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:53,040
in like a radically different instead of just like a different sort of cityscape right yeah we were

1102
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:58,000
doing a lot of like i feel we were on a lot of barges like we were in a lot of junkyards and ship

1103
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:04,880
like like a salvaged telecarrier but it wasn't super clear i mean i appreciate it that they use

1104
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:12,320
i think this is like a macguffin of comics that i i think you can always is like always reliable

1105
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:19,200
of like there is a warehouse or a junkyard filled with some fucked up super science and we forgot

1106
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:24,080
about it and uh we're fucked now like something's going on it seems to be the the premise of the

1107
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,800
opening crawl of uh rise of skywalker i mean it's like sure these ships are just been hanging out

1108
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:34,320
there yeah no one uh no one the dead speak yeah that's big we're in we're in done 500 ships have

1109
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:40,640
been under the water yeah no one knew no one knew just like this just like the enterprise also

1110
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,800
hanging on under the water and yeah second film just hanging out we didn't know what to do it

1111
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:52,160
water blocks auto signals there's no way to know it's there yeah the uh i think that probably the

1112
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:59,280
designers err on the idea okay around the side of like teen boy teen boy is going to go in there

1113
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:05,600
and he doesn't like a boring talky thing he wants to shoot lasers out of his fingers or whatever

1114
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:13,520
and i think that like they err on that more often than not but i wonder i wonder if most people feel

1115
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:18,880
like we do or most people just kind of like i like the avengers i want a gamified experience

1116
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,360
versus like if dr strange took us to each of the avengers houses i think maybe i and like there was

1117
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,400
just a little fun thing to do in each one i may have even liked it more and i i honestly i really

1118
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:35,280
liked this i really had a great time these are nitpicky things yeah i'm just sort of the uh

1119
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,440
we're thinking off the top of our head of what we liked and whatever and you just you want to see

1120
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,400
the hawkeye's garage i want to see hawkeye's garage where he's tuning that guitar yeah because

1121
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,320
you know i want to see a little bit of a like maybe we can see when he's working on heaven

1122
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:54,000
don't have a name and he's sort of in the lab in the marvel universe hawkeye wrote the same song

1123
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,640
yeah hawkeye is the most likely to use his fame of saving the world multiple times to put out an

1124
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:06,480
album or at least or an app or at least an app yeah and he's got the hawkeye at the rocks and he's

1125
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:11,360
got the garth brooks thing he's got hawkeye and ronan his alter ego yeah so he can do two different

1126
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:18,160
musical personas yeah like it's chris gaines is his ronan so yeah that makes sense uh i want to go

1127
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:24,720
to spider-man's uh amaze apartment in new york i think what we're talking about is i think home

1128
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:31,680
virtual reality versus whatever this is this is much more of a uh interactive event like i think

1129
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:36,560
like that stuff is fun to explore in the home you don't need you have your space you can kind of

1130
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:42,000
look around you can interact with the space like uh justin roiland has at squanch games and like

1131
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,600
one of the things is like like office work or desk job or whatever and you you just are in an

1132
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,320
office and you get to pick up things and open file cabinets and you know and answer calls and

1133
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,840
then it goes crazier but but like there's something about just exploring a space and

1134
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,160
you're never going to get to do that here like you most you get to do is press some buttons and

1135
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,560
do some stuff because they have to make sure they got a you're on a timer like that the game isn't

1136
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,880
waiting for us to complete a task right if you don't complete the task at a certain point you're

1137
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:13,920
just you're okay we did it move on so do you guys feel then like given the limited time then you

1138
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:21,520
want like bigger blockbuster i am essentially iron man i am hulk well i think if you need to

1139
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:26,640
adjust people to like this is what this experience is because how many people have really done

1140
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:31,600
something with the helmet in the backpack and like that sort of thing you need to like get

1141
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:41,040
get people into it what i'm curious of is when does the um when is the clarity of it

1142
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:47,600
like it's it's the same sort of definite when does it get clearer because i i'm starting to

1143
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,600
notice i'm sure it's been a couple years of fuzzy to me yeah i'm sure it's a lot of messing around

1144
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,440
with and you're wearing your glasses on that i'm wearing my glass i think the void is the best of

1145
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:03,200
the vr stuff i've done is the most accommodating to yes does it fog though no really i feel like

1146
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:09,200
it's a sweaty end i feel you have to figure out a lot of jiggling around with the eye like where

1147
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,600
does it fit the right way and then it really gets but yes you're still gonna have like i think it's

1148
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,360
the processing power it's like yeah you're only like if it's only gonna get you you know it's

1149
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:24,000
gonna be fuzzy on the edges you have a little glaucoma like that's basically every character is

1150
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,640
a little glaucoma and like they probably have the technology to make it like a little clearer now

1151
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:33,200
but like the investment of like opening all these things like they need to probably get another few

1152
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:40,000
years out of the whatever they have currently yeah or it'd be shorter but i kept finding myself

1153
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,280
having to like okay if i hold it if i hold the helmet like this it's much more clear but then

1154
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:50,560
what if one of the guys turns yeah sees me looking like a four eyes they're gonna see this cool iron

1155
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:56,320
suit man holding hands up maybe you guys would make fun of me i was really self-conscious i love

1156
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:02,480
that i i also feel like to answer that question though like i feel like it probably has to do with

1157
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,920
the the everyone going through it a million times like you can't necessarily like make it exactly

1158
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,600
for your head like maybe in the future you go oh i got my own head i bring my own headset into this

1159
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,080
you know or yeah you know my own glasses you know that you have kind of calibrated right like

1160
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:23,280
like bowling you come in with your ball instead of using the alley yeah you don't use the alley

1161
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:27,680
helmet i mean i feel like those 3d glasses sometimes work and sometimes don't work like or

1162
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:32,320
yeah it does feel like i guess i when i was saying earlier like about the future of it it does feel

1163
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,720
like maybe there's just like whatever in 10 years there's like such a there's a sleek version

1164
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:41,840
of that it's not a big bulky headset it's something that like well there's so much easier that fits

1165
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:47,120
c.s now they look like steampunk glasses oh yeah okay they look real i mean they're there i mean

1166
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:52,320
the oculus is tiny it's getting tinier and tinier and tinier and i feel like that's that's a good

1167
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,800
thing so like in 10 years it'll be hopefully like really just be something you barely even notice on

1168
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:02,960
your head yeah and it'll be like scarily clear and you can live there forever you can live there

1169
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,280
forever that's what we all want augmented reality too i mean right because augmented reality is like

1170
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:15,040
another thing that could be they're more interesting it's rumored for mario kart oh wow so

1171
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:20,160
augmented reality basically is like you wear glasses and you can see the world what it looks

1172
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:26,320
like but it's adding like graphics to the world well and they were also saying that like that you

1173
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:31,440
wear that you're going to be wearing glasses in the theme park land itself yeah i'm interested

1174
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,560
in that i was because they there was a big we should probably talk about this on another show

1175
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:41,280
but there's a big mario like news dump or nintendoland news dump there's a music video there was really

1176
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:47,680
i haven't gotten to watch it yet it's fun it's crazy i think it's fun people i saw people saying

1177
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:52,800
maybe it's set the bar too high if the land isn't like this music video it's possible it's too high

1178
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,600
but yeah you're gonna be you're gonna have your own like nintendo magic band and collect coins

1179
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:03,120
but then i also saw this but you can like there's a video on twitter somebody like with a band and

1180
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:09,680
then they go under a box a coin box and then jump and then it makes the cling so that's what i so

1181
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:15,440
immediately they are so weaponized now against like star wars and galaxy's edge and like just that

1182
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:20,560
stupid dumb thing i can walk under a coin box and hit it but i also feel like this is like the kind

1183
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,560
of things that we were promised when star wars land opened up it was like your ride like what

1184
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,800
you do want to run is going to affect how people interact with you in the park that's not a thing

1185
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,720
what were they talking yeah that was never only if you're in the app maybe i've been in the app it

1186
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:39,200
doesn't like it doesn't seem like it doesn't even sync up your ride doesn't sync up with

1187
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,160
the app it's not like you don't scan i mean i always thought you like because that you would

1188
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:49,600
scan it like at the end like now use your app on your way out and scan your code and that would

1189
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:55,600
give you points or no i mean you wanted to have trouble ordering at the bar yeah

1190
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,680
or just someone coming up to you be like you know rough flying today like yes basically as

1191
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:10,000
simple as that but that app is also i love that app but but it's it's all very small i think the

1192
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,200
idea of these things are executable in a very controlled environment and then they go oh now

1193
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:20,160
we have to take this out in a in a major thing we were talking about going to rise of the resistance

1194
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,920
when it opens and i tweeted about something about that and somebody brought up a good point like

1195
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:32,800
if it's even able to stay open for two hours on friday like you know like oh right the chances of

1196
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:39,920
this even working at full blast on day one sure is a question you know people might be listening

1197
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:45,680
to this on day one isn't this one we're putting out this will be out it's day one on day one

1198
01:31:45,680 --> 01:32:01,600
and we might i don't know come say hi yeah if you're listening to it i mean some people probably

1199
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:08,000
right now it's 4 a.m and they're in a line at the disneyland resort so just lean out of the line and

1200
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,920
say hey jason yeah maybe he'll say hi back and he'll or he might be at the labrea bakery line

1201
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:20,800
waiting for the express to open uh for whatever reason my experience on rise of resistance like

1202
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:26,640
okay we need your help go to labrea bakery for a long lunch and then come back in a little while

1203
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:33,040
my man uh yeah that's your dream finn i mean that was another thing that was in the novelizations

1204
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:39,360
but not in the movie finn loves the bray bakery i read that yeah to read the novel why was everything

1205
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:45,760
in the bonus material it's all in the novel you gotta read it poe wears sanuk sandals yes that was

1206
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,840
the twitch stream and the fan the labrea bakery was in the novel poe was confused though because he

1207
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,960
didn't know that basin had become sanuk and then he learned about snook and loved the

1208
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:04,400
changes and ray's full family tree was in the trunk of the uh the suv yeah that was parked next to

1209
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:09,200
star wars there's a lot of things you gotta do you also get especially popcorn box you will find out

1210
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:14,640
some more information about a babu freak oh i would love that you have to be done with the popcorn

1211
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:19,760
it's at the bottom you gotta finish it and then read the fine print there's a series of pogs that

1212
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:25,600
explain how palpatine came back but you have to find those in a specific area this is how sleep

1213
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:36,240
no more affects them yeah yeah yeah uh what closing thoughts yeah i do wait let me really fast i wish

1214
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:42,160
we could have stayed shrunk longer that's what i was gonna be all like weird no dumb popcorn gags

1215
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:48,640
i wish i love this experience i love the void i will continue to bring people to the void and recommend

1216
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:54,720
the void i just wish that they divided this ride into four distinct things one time you're doing

1217
01:33:54,720 --> 01:34:00,320
laser blasters maybe one time you're doing all miniature like you you didn't really get to get

1218
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:04,480
much variety even though they were trying to create that like now you're flying the quinjet

1219
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:11,360
now you're doing this it all was the same it just all felt to me like you're walking you're shooting

1220
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:15,280
you're walking you're shooting like there was nothing that like changed up the gameplay that

1221
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:20,800
drastically i would have liked that a set really different set pieces yeah like where you could at

1222
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:27,280
least be doing different skills or even hey there's four of you you attack his arm you attack his leg

1223
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,640
you attack his head i'll attack this you know yeah or like yeah some thing where you like maybe

1224
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:38,240
peeled who have you peel off and you have to like infiltrate the robot and it's obviously we're like

1225
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:42,080
next to each other but like you're just like climbing a little i don't know there's some way

1226
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:45,360
to like do it where there's two different missions and you both have to do a different thing i would

1227
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:50,000
have like a puzzle a simple puzzle yeah yeah that's kind of like just star wars yeah just give me like

1228
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:55,440
a few different elements of gameplay and especially because they felt like that the quinjet was thrown

1229
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:02,000
in there we had no stakes to it besides just another way to like now we're shooting and flying

1230
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,800
but it wasn't like it wasn't different gameplay like i would have liked it when he described it

1231
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:12,000
before we went in there like oh are we firing the quinjet because that's fun yes all right great so

1232
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,080
now we're just gonna we're just gonna do this it's like money and falcon we're gonna do that now that

1233
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:22,960
would have been at least different but no it was all just hand yeah yeah if you had if somebody had

1234
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:28,160
to peel off and pick a song to put on from the guardians mixtape oh great oh yeah that would have

1235
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:31,760
been great you get to choose so there's like a couple different options great like the rock and

1236
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,400
roll roller coaster in universal studios where you get to pick your own song yeah that's not rock and

1237
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:41,680
roll whatever that is that called not rock and roll it it's rock and roll and not rip ride rocket

1238
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:51,360
not hollywood rocket jackie ogden uh dr augustine these theme parks love their thin slices

1239
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:58,000
yeah updating your avengers identification card it's time to renew going to avengers dmv

1240
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:03,840
being the guild fees yes yeah uh yeah that would have been good again i just wanted to

1241
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,280
hang out in everyone's bedroom or living room i don't know why you're a bit of a no i don't know

1242
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:13,680
i don't need to i'm not gonna watch them do things i'm just saying like i want to live in the world

1243
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:19,280
i want to live there i want to not be in this world i want to live in spider-man's bedroom where

1244
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:25,200
they can't see you he's under age michael no it's not a sex thing we're just buddies i will say

1245
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:30,480
there is something so fulfilling in that batman game and it's so simple and basic but you're

1246
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,120
putting on the batman costume yes putting on the glove you're you know and it's like and you look

1247
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:40,720
at yourself and you're like in the batman outfit it's so fun but what the problem that the void

1248
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:46,080
will always have unfortunately it's a four-person game so whatever you're doing you have to find a

1249
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:51,040
way to make you all equal because essentially we are only one we don't do any teamwork in it

1250
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:57,200
right so we all are having to have the same exact experience but yet have the conceit of it being

1251
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:01,600
four of us because so we couldn't all be batman we couldn't all suit up as batman and i don't

1252
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,560
think it's complex enough to be like you'll suit as batman you'll be hulk you'll be like it just

1253
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,120
sort of i think the game i think there's an element of the game like you all need to be equal you're

1254
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:16,720
all storm troopers right you're all ghostbusters you're all this black panther meets iron man

1255
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,280
right characters and you there's no difference to you besides the color right but does it have to

1256
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:26,000
be that way i think i think the technology probably is at this point where you can't be doing

1257
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:31,200
disparate things sure sure right and it's just obviously yeah it's easier for them to program

1258
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:35,360
that you all shoot in this one way because like if you had one of you had like webs and like we're

1259
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:39,840
shooting pulling things which would be awesome i think like it's just so much more work and so

1260
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,000
many more mechanics and so many more it's like those old video games that used to play like

1261
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,400
with like operation like wolf for like the old terminator game where you all have machine guns

1262
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:52,240
there's four machine guns on like a console and everyone has one it's like that's what we are

1263
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:57,280
doing we are essentially doing the the avengers version of that we all have a machine gun we're

1264
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:02,000
all firing at our at our distinct time crisis right it's all that you know it's like there's

1265
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,560
nothing different to do in time crisis and again practically an easy way to get everyone up to

1266
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,920
speed exactly you know what this is yeah in 30 seconds yeah the only thing that you need to do

1267
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:18,000
is you know for sure so is there anything else any other ips that work in terms of like everyone's

1268
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,760
equals like you're all the you're all the ants from ants or your uh that's the first one you

1269
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,520
thought of yeah i don't know why yeah what's where's there just a field of identical i'm

1270
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,480
always thinking about ants uh if we were if we were all i mean i think of star wars that's

1271
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,400
i was gonna say if we were all like battle droids but the same thing as stormtroopers that's stupid

1272
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,520
uh what else we're all jabawockeys

1273
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:43,040
um

1274
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:52,160
i love that that's pretty good uh there's a problem with the solving problems around the childhood

1275
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:56,480
factory i think i'm talking agustas i i also think we have to think about masks because

1276
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:00,960
umpa lumpas we'd have to we have a size issue oh yeah we'd have to you know we'd have and we

1277
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:06,080
and our faces would be seen i think a lot of these games they are you're some they're figuring out a

1278
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:12,480
way to what is your face in uh rocket realm you do speak a little bit yeah you have like sort of

1279
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:17,200
you're like oh you're like people you're different citizens of the internet yeah okay yeah but you

1280
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:21,920
are like a cartoon character and when you talk the mouth moves so that is something they can do

1281
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:28,160
yeah what about agent smith's from matrix that's a fun one that's not a bad idea sure um that would

1282
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:34,880
be also very good but you know what it would be it would be like hey i'm neo i've deputized you to

1283
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:41,040
all be as strong as me you're always fight uh agent smith thanks for rising up with me now i

1284
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:47,040
go to the rave the original inventor of the rave the matrix too uh the coachella the coachella

1285
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,880
that's true they had a coachella before any of the franchise yeah exactly yeah we gotta give them

1286
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:56,720
credit there well you know avatar will definitely be the next void yeah one you would imagine yeah

1287
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:02,720
because it's already what it is you're already going into a body and suiting up i also think

1288
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:06,560
they would never do it because probably too violent but a john wick void would be perfect

1289
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:11,600
oh you know you all have to be like firing a john wick or something like that you know there's these

1290
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:15,440
other other companies that are popping up too they're doing this so i wonder if they'll be

1291
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:22,560
like an r-rated company yeah that'll do like a more violent one probably has to be there there's

1292
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:28,560
so many great vr uh bullet games and like beat saber and all this sort of stuff that i think

1293
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,640
you're never gonna get the you're never gonna get a game where you're firing a gun

1294
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:37,680
in disneyland for good reason i think uh but i think there will be definitely the outliers

1295
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:43,280
sure um and then i was the last thing i was gonna say is that it seems like we're getting some crazy

1296
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:49,200
simulators avengers ride into california adventure yes and this i was like when we were in the

1297
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:54,400
battles i was like i was very antsy because i was like i want to like fly and do something

1298
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,040
yeah because we heard what we think that stuff that ride might be no i have not heard this my

1299
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,720
speculation is there's two two or three pictures that came out where you start in a quinjet and

1300
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:07,840
you're going to some sort of battle in wakanda and then there's a picture of a giant crazy avengers

1301
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:13,840
battle and there's like the the guests are in little seats with their legs dangling which to

1302
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,960
me seems like a soren type of a thing i don't know that it's probably i don't know that everyone

1303
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:23,280
will have like their own individual thing but maybe groups maybe a little like harry potter

1304
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:28,720
maybe that um but you can imagine what like whatever the ride system is like a very like

1305
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:33,680
high impact version of that would be great if you actually were strapped in it was like a high

1306
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:38,080
impact soren so like you're on the quinjet so you're flying fast then you're like bombing or

1307
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:43,760
whatever my my fantasy version of it is like the bottom drops out of the quinjet and ejects everybody

1308
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:49,280
into the battle see that's great because they don't do show you in like the same kind of things

1309
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,720
in the jet so something has to happen to get you out of the jet it's not i don't think you're going

1310
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:57,600
to leave the jet and get a different thing that's a comic book go-to like best case scenario everyone

1311
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:03,680
jumps out the back and joins battle worst case scenario what often happens is uh the blackbird

1312
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:09,040
or the quinjet gets blown up and you get tossed into the battle which would be amazing if they

1313
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:15,120
did that sure so like yeah i mean i think it all is going to be about topping the rise of the

1314
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,880
resistance style of ride where it's like four rides in one it's like you're going to have a

1315
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:23,840
little bit of this a little bit of that like what was kind of like the smart track meets this meets

1316
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,680
of that meets of this like you know because i think that's the only way to kind of upgrade the ride

1317
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:33,360
it can't go backwards from that and the only way and i i think big insurance that uh would help

1318
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,800
top that is if you were lowered down finally into spider-man's bedroom

1319
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:42,640
a dream of it and then he tells me he's proud of me that would be so nice you're like great

1320
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:48,240
dude and then you crawl back out the window you came in through fine i'll go in out the window

1321
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:54,000
don't care you've moved the desk three inches like a creepy crawl it's not a family

1337
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:22,000

1338
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:28,960
i have the belief that because it is already open in orlando they could be ahead of the smoother

1339
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:34,160
yeah hopefully fingers crossed yeah that the whole ride doesn't just uh sink yeah but as you're
