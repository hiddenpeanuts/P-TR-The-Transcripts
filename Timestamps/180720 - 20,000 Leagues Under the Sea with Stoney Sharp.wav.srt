00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
Aloha, Podcast the Riot is doing its first live show August 9th in Sherman Oaks, California

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,720
in a beautiful, abandoned sports authority with special guest Tony Baxter.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,040
Can you believe, I still kind of can't believe it, you two.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Yeah, I can't believe it.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,240
It's our hero who we've talked about on most episodes and a guy I've been obsessed with

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,000
since I was 10 years old and he did all my favorite things and we're going to talk to

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,400
him in front of people.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,920
Yeah, and it's going to be embarrassing for us, but also hopefully sweet.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,200
So like, please come out, like this is going to be fun.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,240
It's 10 bucks, I mean, come on.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Gotta do it.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,520
And you'll get to see this amazing gallery, the collection of Richard Kraft, who we're

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,840
also going to talk to, as all this, you get to take photos with Dumbo cars and monorail

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,520
innards and gears, gears probably too.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,760
Yeah, you know, with severed limbs from sea serpents from the submarine voyage.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,040
I don't know exactly what's there, things like that.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,760
The exhibition is free and is running for most of the month of August tickets for separate

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,280
events like our show again, $10 or there's a signing with the artist Shag.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,640
Paul Scheer is doing a show.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,180
Alan Menken is doing a show at the end of the month.

21
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,440
This is starting to sound desperate.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,120
I think we should ease off the throttle and just let people enjoy going to our site.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,880
Good look in the show description.

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,360
You're going to come, it's going to be chill.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
You're going to have a great time.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
And now you're going to have a great time listening to our regular episode.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Warning.

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,120
The following podcast may include monkeys performing dangerous stunts, an eye popping

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,440
3D spectacular starring Judge Lance Ito and four competing Peter Laurie impressions.

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,080
We travel 20,000 leagues under the sea with director Stoney Sharp.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:59,960
Here's a whale of a podcast on today's podcast, The Ride.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:10,320
Hello.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,800
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks hosted by three guys who promised

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,960
to one day learn some Spanish besides permanecer sentados por favor.

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Yo soy Scott Gardner.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,480
Estoy aquÃ­ con Jason Sheridan.

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Hi.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Hi.

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Drive back to English.

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Mike Carlson.

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Muchas gracias.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Hey.

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,520
And that's as far as we needed to go.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
I guess.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,400
So only one park where you're going to hear French.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Yeah.

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Well, I guess I also know P.A.C. Piernas from the safety instructions.

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,400
And other than that, I'm I'm shot and joining us today.

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Very excited to have a great director from Comedy Bang Bang from the Who Was Show on Netflix

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,560
and the director of one of my favorite Funny or Die videos of all time, Ticklish Cage.

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
It's Stoney Sharp.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Hey, that's awesome.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Thank you.

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
I really want to give you that superlative.

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Oh, man.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Thanks.

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
I love that video too.

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,520
I still I still mention it often.

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Oh, great.

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Hey, as you should.

63
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
John Daly.

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,200
John Daly is amazing.

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Yes.

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Some incredible scream work on his part.

67
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,800
Do you know I heard I heard a story that Bob Odenkirk saw that and halfway through he

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,720
had a straight face and halfway through he just like started laughing and he goes, look

69
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
at him wasting everybody's time.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Oh, man.

71
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Wow.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
That's very exciting.

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,040
You know, I did when I worked at Conan, the best like praise you could get on something

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,520
like with the sketches that would make Conan turn like beet red were where he would then

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:55,120
comment what a waste of everyone's time made me always made me incredibly happy to recognize

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,520
it had to be the right kind of as a bad sketch is a waste of time to but not in that delirious

77
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,240
wonderful way that some crazy sketch can be.

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,160
I mean, like on Bang Bang, we did we did two sketches that were like that.

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,000
I mean, still, like just thinking about one of them was don't look a gift horse in the

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,760
mouth where they it was a game show where they would give a farmer a horse as long as

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,180
he didn't look in the horse's mouth.

82
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,160
But for some reason, these farmers couldn't resist the urge to look in their mouth.

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,060
They would lose the horse and would go to the glue factory.

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,460
And the other one was oh my God, this one is you made your bed now lie in it where you

85
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,960
had to make a bed, get into a bed, tell a lie.

86
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,240
And then a seasoned detective would sell you if you were lying or not.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,400
This variety of thing like breaking apart odd phrases and little spins of wordplay.

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,360
It's my favorite thing in the world.

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
We got one more season.

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,240
I was like, what's it going to be like?

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,340
Don't put the car before the horse is going to be like the pot calling the kettle black.

92
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,000
Do you know not to jump ahead and straight into our topic without doing our requisite

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,360
40 minutes of bullshit besides the topic, but there was a it's related to there was

94
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
a SNL sketch about 20,000 leagues under the sea.

95
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,160
That's kind of this manner of sketch where it's just picking apart the phrase.

96
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
It was in the 90s.

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,280
It was with Kelsey Grammer as Captain Nemo and Phil Hartman was Kirk Douglas.

98
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,240
And it was all about like everyone not understanding the that 20 going 20,000 leagues into the

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,700
sea is not depth.

100
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:38,840
That's that's mileage that's going forward, going forward 20,000 leagues as opposed to

101
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,200
that they kept like in the Peter used to not voice and stuff like.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,160
So we're going 20,000 leagues under the sea.

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,720
And he had to captain you must to make a graph explaining if that's not true.

104
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,960
And they think that the squid when he shows up is 20,000 leagues long.

105
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Is this one of those like the last sketch of the night?

106
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
I forget.

107
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
It might be familiar.

108
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,280
It feels like it could be that slot.

109
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,060
It's like I'm laughing a lot and you're getting Kirk Douglas.

110
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,200
You're getting this amazing Kirk Douglas impression.

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,560
Hartman so crazy and great.

112
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,580
And then like but the audience, it's just eating shit.

113
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,800
And it's really bizarre to watch this clip now because like SNL so often is like, here's

114
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
a famous person.

115
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Everyone scream.

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,520
And then like this old sketch is like is just silence for seven minutes.

117
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Yeah, absolutely.

118
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,120
And so it's the best and the worst of Saturday Night Live because it's like, oh, these industry

119
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
professionals that are doing these amazing impressions and the set looks cool.

120
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,420
And it's actually something I like.

121
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,920
And it is like you say seven minutes of exactly the same joke.

122
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,280
It's a little if there I think it's a kind of thing that you take that sketch and you

124
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,720
do it in like a tighter pre films way.

125
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,480
And maybe it's not as patients trying.

126
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,260
But you can tell the audience is worn down and they're probably staring at the squid

127
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,640
getting set up and just wondering like, how's that going to work?

128
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,720
But it's like then it's a squid that's like worthy of the film.

129
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
It's really amazing.

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,080
It's a full Nautilus set.

131
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,440
The whole thing is really remarkable.

132
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
And the only people not buying it are the 150 people in that room.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,040
That reminds me like less in terms of like scope and execution.

134
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,480
But the in terms of like a comics, comics sort of sketches, though, is it I will probably

135
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
get it wrong.

136
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,280
It's a lot in malfeasance in the railroad industry.

137
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,560
Oh, yes, that's a jack.

138
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,280
I think George Clooney.

139
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,360
And it's just about like a a con on a railroad.

140
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,120
I don't even remember if you find it's easy to find.

141
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,120
It was this weird pointless scene seemingly.

142
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,320
But a guy like applying for a job as a as an engineer on a train.

143
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
And then somebody walks in and who are you?

144
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,920
And George Clooney jumps out the window and then four minutes in, they announced that

145
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,120
the sketch is called Tales of Fraud and Malfeasance in the railroad industry.

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,720
I think if I'm recalling it correctly.

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Yeah.

148
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,840
Well, we clearly have soft spots in our hearts for these the driest of comedy sketches.

149
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,960
What was the St. Patrick's Day one with Bill Hader this year?

150
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
It was my favorite.

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,800
It turns out to be a Liam Neeson.

152
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,320
He turns out to be doing Liam Neeson.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,680
But it's just him talking in an ominous voice and then Beck Bennett is just like a disgusting

154
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
like pig person.

155
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,520
But it's just non sequiturs.

156
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,160
I mean, I kind of figured out why they did when I'm sitting there watching it and I'm

157
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,720
just dying when he goes, that's pretty good for a Mick.

158
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:42,280
Like what a weird antiquated Irish slur for my fine Irish heritage.

159
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Not long ago, they're doing sketches where like, you know, like Will Ferrell is Robert

160
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Goulet and he's singing rap songs and he sings the N word loud and proud.

161
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,440
And the audience loves it.

162
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,240
They're so on, but they they know it's a little weird.

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
They laugh and laugh.

164
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,600
This one was noticeable because, yeah, it was another one where it's like three quarters

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,080
of the sketch goes by and then the premises told you at the end.

166
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,480
And it just seems like nonsense before.

167
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,880
But it's all funny nonsense because you can just make Bill Hader say anything funny.

168
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Right, right.

169
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Sure.

170
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Wow.

171
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,160
Well, we ended up became a little comedy analysis podcast for a particular strand of it.

172
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,720
Our version of it.

173
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,960
Tom Shales, oral retrospective on Saturday Night Live told like podcast the ride hosts.

174
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,800
But look, let's get back on track.

175
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,080
We're talking about rides and we're talking about the rides that you grew up with Stoney

176
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
and you grew up in Florida, correct?

177
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
That's right.

178
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,640
I grew up in, this is not an exaggeration.

179
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,240
I grew up in the weirdest part of Florida, which is saying something.

180
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,000
And I will throw this gauntlet down.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
Is that a is that a phrase?

182
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,920
I can out Florida anyone that you talk to.

183
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
And I guarantee it.

184
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,520
I guarantee I can out Florida anyone.

185
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,040
I've seen the strangest things you could ever possibly imagine.

186
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm slightly older than you guys.

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,840
So I remember probably a version of of Disney that you were sold when you were really little

188
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,520
and you thought of like, oh, this is the I mean, it is one of the greatest places.

189
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,400
But I grew up in the I was sentient in the early 80s.

190
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,680
So I remember like all all of, you know, that that stuff.

191
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
I don't know where to go from this.

192
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Should I let's let me rewind back and tell you how I why I'm why I'm the most Floridian

193
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
person.

194
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,280
So I grew up in a small town called Macintosh.

195
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:40,200
It's a one square mile town named after a Scottish guy who became chief of a small Seminole

196
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,160
Indian tribe, Chief Macintosh.

197
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,400
Macintosh was was built around a small lake called Orange Lake, which was known for two

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
things.

199
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,000
One, it's world's famous floating islands that moved around.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,680
And two, at least once every 20 years, it drains overnight into a sinkhole, the entire

201
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,640
lake, and then it will slowly fill back up again.

202
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,720
Where where does it go?

203
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,880
The aquifer.

204
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,520
Things just disappear in Florida.

205
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
Wow.

206
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Yeah.

207
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,320
So my next door neighbors, I met if I was on a podcast and I talked about this a little

208
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,120
bit, but my next door neighbors made their money.

209
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,360
They made their living off of a circus act called the world's famous high flying aquamules

210
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:28,000
where they trained donkeys to walk up a 30 foot tower, jump through a flaming loop into

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
an above ground swimming pool.

212
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Wow.

213
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Do this twice.

214
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
They would do first donkey comes up.

215
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,640
Super sad donkey walks up the plank because he knows he's going to get the cattle prod

216
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,360
if he doesn't jumps off a 30 foot tower into an above ground swimming pool.

217
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,560
Second donkey comes out flaming loop erupts on the top of the on the top of the tower,

218
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,760
walks up the tower, jumps off a 30 foot tower into an above ground swimming pool.

219
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,720
Third donkey comes out of the trailer.

220
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
What's on his back?

221
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
A little saddle.

222
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,040
What's in the saddle?

223
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,600
A tiny monkey dressed as a cowboy strapped into the side screaming.

224
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
But from a distance, it looks like he's trying to get his guns ready.

225
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,640
What he's trying to do is untie himself.

226
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,800
So he goes up the tower with the music playing.

227
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,000
The monkey and the donkey jump through the flaming loop, going against every instinct

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,060
that an animal could possibly have doing a belly flop into above ground swimming pool.

229
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,880
And then they reward the monkey with a lit cigarette.

230
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,720
Oh, a delicious treat.

231
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,800
A big finish at the end there.

232
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,520
This is what like this is an old I've seen video of just the donkey in the swimming pool.

233
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,760
I think that's a classic attraction.

234
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,000
But these people are innovators, obviously, by adding the fire and the monkey to it, because

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,160
I've never seen that.

236
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
They're still doing it in Texas.

237
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
You can see it on YouTube.

238
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Yes, that has to be that should be illegal.

239
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,600
It's illegal in Florida now, which is saying something.

240
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,400
Atlantic City Boardwalk had high diving horses.

241
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Really?

242
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
You've seen?

243
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
No, I didn't see.

244
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,240
But I think like early 90s is when they finally stopped.

245
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,600
I could be wrong.

246
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,840
They went from what I've read about, it's longer than you think that it kept going.

247
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,600
And they're still at you.

248
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
They're still at it.

249
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
The same family in Texas.

250
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,160
Well, I mean, Patty and Tim, if you're listening, I haven't talked to you in a while.

251
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,880
I hope this doesn't offend you.

252
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,720
Tim went to prison for a little while for illegally trading Jaguars.

253
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,920
They had every kind of zoo animal you could imagine in in horse behind horse fences.

254
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,580
So they had when I was really little, they had the primate barn.

255
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,720
These by the way, are simple folk.

256
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,340
This is, you know, this is simple folk in the back in the country.

257
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,040
These are not wealthy people with large fit.

258
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,080
This is not Jurassic Park.

259
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,760
This is like the way you think of Florida.

260
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,540
So they're easily the escapeable.

261
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,160
These are not high tech facilities for these animals.

262
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,200
I mean, it happened often, it would be like my mom's name is Jane and my brother's name

263
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
is Ben.

264
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,040
It'd like bring bring Jane, a big stony baby inside the house.

265
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Monkeys loose again.

266
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,680
And then looking out the back window and just monkeys running around, flipping around, doing

267
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,040
flips on our like, you know, like our above ground swimming pool and stuff like that.

268
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,080
And then but the thing about them is that they were like locked on.

269
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,500
Their eyes were locked on to us.

270
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,600
So they were very serious faces while they were doing whimsical things.

271
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
So scary, very scary.

272
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Staring you down.

273
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Yes.

274
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Those were chimps.

275
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,240
Those were not the spider monkeys and the capuchins that did the donkey show.

276
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Those were scary.

277
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,840
So how many total animals did these people have roughly?

278
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:37,540
They had they had the bear that used to do bear wrestling at county fairs until he figured

279
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,080
out how to undo his muzzle.

280
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,920
They had they had when I was really little, they had five chimpanzees.

281
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Then that they didn't do that anymore.

282
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,320
They had spider monkeys.

283
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,040
They had let's see, they had two camels.

284
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
They always had camels.

285
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,280
They had a canoe.

286
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,520
They had a Brahma bull.

287
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,200
They had two ostriches, two zebras.

288
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,920
They had oh, this part's this part's sad.

289
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Oh, okay.

290
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,520
This other part is so happy.

291
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,680
They had a white horse that had a surgical procedure.

292
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
So he had it.

293
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Yeah, he had a horn coming out of his head.

294
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
So yeah, a unicorn.

295
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,660
I don't think that they were allowed to show that in public.

296
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
So the so here I was this.

297
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
Then who was it for?

298
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
It was for them.

299
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,440
It was the pleasure of having a unicorn.

300
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Oh my God.

301
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
What is the doctor?

302
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,200
Which doctor installs a horn on a horse?

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,520
Just as a side note, just so you guys don't think I'm a psychopath, my father is an equine

304
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,480
reproductive physiologist and he taught at the University of Florida and my mom is a

305
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
violinist.

306
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,400
So so we lived far out in the swamp so he could be near the near the research farm.

307
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,640
But I was surrounded by I was like a swamp child.

308
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
I grew up a swamp child.

309
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,600
I can take a moment to correct myself, the diving horse at the Atlantic City Steel Pier

310
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,680
only went to the 1970s, not the 90s.

311
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,000
I would like to apologize to the diving horse.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,400
Jason's mistake.

313
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,840
The still on your iPad is quite upsetting.

314
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,320
Hey, I would need it to be horse diving straight down.

315
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,960
In this case, I'll say don't go to our Twitter to see a picture of a horse being forcibly

316
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
dropped.

317
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,760
They eventually replaced by casinos, which were then replaced by empty casinos and now

318
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,760
replaced by casinos yet again.

319
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,720
So you were a swamp child surrounded by animals.

320
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,180
So but but it was also the height of magical tourist Florida, right?

321
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,160
So if I geographically if I started my house where the nearest attractions would be, it

322
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,220
would go like this next door neighbors flying, flying meal, Aqua meals, right?

323
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,240
Then eight miles away was a high lie.

324
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,620
Oh, cool.

325
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,000
Then then, you know, 16 to 20 miles away was showbiz pizza.

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh yeah.

327
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
With the rocket fire explosion.

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
16 miles though.

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What a rough.

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,440
That's why we didn't go that often.

331
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,360
Silver Springs, Six Gun Territory, Wild Waters, Wiki Wachee.

332
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,440
Wait, you're blasting through those though.

333
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
I don't know.

334
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,160
Silver Springs now.

335
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,080
Silver Springs is home of the Glass Bottom boats.

336
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,200
It's like it's sort of a sort of more of a Victorian attraction.

337
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,120
So it's you know, at the turn of the century, that was the that's what Florida was.

338
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,440
It was a place where you'd go for attractions, but generally it was to see these crystal

339
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,040
clear rivers and springs and these sort of like jungle cruises.

340
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
So, right.

341
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,320
So these Glass Bottom boats, which are still operating today, you would get in them and

342
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,760
you'd cruise this crystal clear river.

343
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,040
And you've seen this river that they like anytime you've seen a underwater fight scene

344
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,000
in a natural setting, like every one of the 1930s Tarzan series or James Bond when he's

345
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,440
fighting a, you know, boa constrictor underwater or creature from the Black Lagoon.

346
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,400
They filmed all that at Silver Springs.

347
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Wow.

348
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,920
And when they were when they were filming the Tarzan series in the 30s, they released

349
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,320
just so many of these small monkeys that are still to this day in the Ocala National Forest.

350
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
And you'll hear them coming.

351
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,880
And it sounds scary, like like a what is it called when locusts come out like a swarm

352
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,440
of small monkeys and they'll they'll come in the treetops and then they start throwing

353
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,000
rocks and seeds at you.

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Wow.

355
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,880
I think I forget I should take a second and mention that like I think of Disney and Universal.

356
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,040
I think I fly into there.

357
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
It's in Orlando.

358
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:48,400
I fly into Orlando, fly into MCO and go to these parks to use the I-4 like corridor.

359
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Yeah.

360
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,640
I just sometimes forget like, oh, this is smack dab and what is potentially the weirdest

361
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,920
state in the nation.

362
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Oh, easily.

363
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,760
I mean, I I've never seen any place stranger than Florida.

364
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
No, no.

365
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,760
I mean, because like I say, it's like the dark side of freedom.

366
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,400
If the great American experiment is to say that we as individuals are free, the people

367
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,920
in Florida go, oh, I'm free to do what I like to do.

368
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Perfect.

369
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,120
That's everyone in Florida.

370
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,560
Let's see how much she believes in this whole American dream thing.

371
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,800
What was your process then of realizing this was all strange?

372
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
I mean, you must have known.

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,760
I mean, there's no world in which the diving mule exhibit next door is not bizarre.

374
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,120
But like, how did you like on Florida fire self or have you?

375
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
It's a duality.

376
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,260
You know, like I said, my parents are academics and I went to I went to a school in Gainesville

377
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,120
a couple of 20 miles north, but I also spent every summer in Boston.

378
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,640
So so I never spent a summer in the worst of Florida.

379
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
You know what I mean?

380
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,600
So I was you know, and I would travel with my parents to places.

381
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,080
So I was worldly and also very swampy.

382
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,260
So and he was your dad was there for work.

383
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,480
So so he like it was a specific reason in mind.

384
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,040
He knew it was odd and he taught you it was odd.

385
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,600
However, I mean, this is another whole thing.

386
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,080
He also is he considers himself a sort of and rightly so as sort of an Indiana Jones

387
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
type.

388
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,240
He was he was the quick draw champion of the southeast hike, you know, seven years ago.

389
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,640
And he's and he's like, you know, he's 65.

390
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
He's one of the best larionettes in the state of Florida.

391
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
Sounds like he is Indiana Jones.

392
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,640
Yeah, he Florida.

393
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Yeah, this this he's I mean, I'm not going to get to this.

394
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,600
I think he might I think he might be a spy because he worked for the Vienna International

395
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,880
Center sometimes.

396
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,720
And we would go like on trips to like Yugoslavia right before it turned right before the war.

397
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,280
And places like why are you going here?

398
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Yeah.

399
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,400
It's just a family trip to Yugoslavia.

400
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,000
They just want me to lasso some things in Yugoslavia.

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,760
So so yes, I grew up in an unusual, very Florida and very Indiana Jones sort of wild.

402
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,560
I also don't think I realized that there was a history of bizarre attractions in Florida

403
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,200
preceding Disney World and that that helped influence.

404
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,480
You know, I think I thought Disney World is there because there's a ton of land there.

405
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,360
And I don't think I knew there was this, you know, there was a place for oddities already.

406
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Absolutely.

407
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,920
There was like I said, there was Silver Springs.

408
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Cypress Gardens is famous.

409
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,360
You've seen Cypress Gardens before because it's the what's that?

410
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,600
What's the what's the projection process at the Arclight?

411
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
The Cinerama process.

412
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,560
You know, when people are like water skiing and there's like a there's a tower of oh,

413
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,200
yeah, people on top of each other.

414
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Water screens.

415
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,320
That's Cypress Gardens.

416
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:00,080
So that was you used to just the Disneyland of the 1920s was going to Cypress Gardens

417
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,760
and seeing like ladies dressed up as southern bells walking amongst the flowers.

418
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Sure.

419
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Sure.

420
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,680
There's also gardens kind of stuff.

421
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Sure.

422
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
OK.

423
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,120
And there's Wiki Watchy, which is that's still active today.

424
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,960
And next time you guys go to Florida, I highly recommend checking it out because it can't

425
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
last.

426
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,800
It's it's ladies that dress up as mermaids and they go and they do like routines.

427
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
So, yeah.

428
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Oh, yeah.

429
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah.

430
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,160
And you're looking at the aquarium and they get a tell.

431
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,360
Like it's a yeah, they used to have.

432
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Well, they did.

433
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,960
They had the mermaids in Disneyland, but they didn't have any sort of way.

434
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,600
You can see them under the air tanks.

435
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,480
It's like you have to train how to swim with the tails and like, is there a restaurant

436
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,960
attached to the region?

437
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
It must be.

438
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
There should be.

439
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,520
And that manatees will just come into that area.

440
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,000
So it's, you know, manatees and mermaids.

441
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And this is all like, too.

442
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,600
I forget that there's like a whole genre of like books that I've read.

443
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,720
So of like weird southern mystery like Carl Heisen and John D.

444
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,320
McDonough, the Travis McGee books and some of the Elmer Leonard books are set like in

445
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
that.

446
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,400
And and it's like it's it's very easy to find interesting backgrounds to put like heists

447
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,240
or small crime that add character.

448
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Oh, yeah.

449
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Absolutely.

450
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,960
I mean, you know, there's a lot of serial killers.

451
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
There's a lot of like crazy crimes.

452
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,880
There's a lot of like you can what my my buddy Arnie and I, what we used to do for fun is

453
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:36,120
we would explore this cave in Newbury that I mean, you would you would walk in through

454
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,000
the back of I guess in the 50s, some farmer didn't want beatniks going into the cave anymore.

455
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,920
So he crashed a tractor into the hole.

456
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,560
And then he that somehow didn't keep the beatniks out.

457
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,160
So he crashed a school bus into the hole.

458
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,760
And a tree ripped the back of the school bus open.

459
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,480
So the way to get into this cave was to walk into the back of a 1950s school bus past the

460
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
tractor, which is now 20 feet underground.

461
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,520
Keep climbing down through a nightmarish crawl space, which then opens up into a 30 foot

462
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:17,280
domed cave with an underground lake with albino crayfish and shackles on the wall, which looked

463
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,960
like they're from pirate time and just these passageways that you could just crawl for

464
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
hours.

465
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
My God.

466
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Incredible.

467
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,440
So wild Disney world.

468
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,880
Did you spend any time at Church Street Station?

469
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Terror on Church Street.

470
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,320
It was the first year round haunted house that I'd ever seen.

471
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Wow.

472
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Rosy O'Grady's.

473
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Yes, I did.

474
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
I did.

475
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,200
I think I had like a Shirley Temple there.

476
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Sure.

477
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Yeah.

478
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,400
The balloon one, the Phineas Fogs hot air balloon.

479
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,800
Something like that.

480
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Yeah.

481
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,560
Was it Jules Verne themed or?

482
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Yeah.

483
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Yeah.

484
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,560
It was a balloon.

485
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
I could look it up at Phineas.

486
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
It was a balloon.

487
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Are you in a balloon or?

488
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
I already.

489
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Phineas.

490
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
I already forget.

491
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Again, people are screaming.

492
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,160
We're pining for Church Street Station, although we have not been.

493
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Is it still there?

494
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
It's kind of decayed.

495
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,200
We got into it in our Pleasure Island episode.

496
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
Phineas Fogs.

497
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Yes.

498
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Yes.

499
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Yeah.

500
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,320
Which I only know because there's this bizarre opening of a I don't know the real around

501
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
the world in 80 days.

502
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,840
I know this cartoon one where there's a lion and there's a you guys just watched the intro

503
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,720
on YouTube.

504
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,200
It's a really bizarre song where he's this lion marching along in clothes, sings fog.

505
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,160
I'm the one who made the bet.

506
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,240
He like his own name at the top.

507
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,520
It's a really strange Gertner.

508
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,240
I'm talking I'm going to tell you about myself and that's how I start recommended around

509
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
the world.

510
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,640
I believe there was an animated 20,000 leagues in the 90s.

511
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,280
I feel like I saw that in the suggested videos column doing research for this episode.

512
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
It seems like one of these properties that has like the League of Fantastic Extraordinary

513
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Gentlemen.

514
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,400
You're trying and they never quite.

515
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
They never quite get it.

516
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,440
All of this type of HG Wells and and Jules were in both.

517
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,880
It seems like they yeah they'll they'll be attempts at making these movies but see us

518
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,480
sometimes with kind of an unpleasant 2001 type gene not the film but the year.

519
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,600
You know like the extraordinary gentleman is that sort of like an unpleasant early 2000s

520
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
movie.

521
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Yeah and it's so interesting because I've read a lot of those comics and they're so

522
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,440
like there's such a striving to have like period appropriate storytelling and like scratchy

523
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,400
almost woodcut looking art.

524
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,920
This wonderful comics artist Kevin O'Neill doing the art and then the movies are just

525
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,840
like Alan quarter made like pulling up like lock and load like Tom Sawyer with a gun.

526
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:07,000
So intense although one of the few portrayals of Captain Nemo where he is Indian.

527
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,840
That's true in the novels.

528
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,160
There was an Omar Sharif Captain Nemo movie or mini series too.

529
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,360
I don't think I realize that he's a he's a whitewashed character in.

530
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,200
I think in the books they get into like he was a Indian prince who fled his country after

531
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,280
a failed uprising and stuff.

532
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,320
But usually portrayed by like a James Mason.

533
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:38,480
Yeah getting proper British gentleman well I guess we could start moving into this neck

534
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
of the woods.

535
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,840
Yeah anyway is this too crazy.

536
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,920
Am I all too all over the place with this Florida stuff.

537
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,320
No no no no no.

538
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm worried I'm skipping so feel free to go backwards.

539
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,560
I think you're our first Florida resident on the show.

540
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:00,260
So were you well we in before we get in like 1977 when when it or no excuse me 72 when

541
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,360
Disney opens were you there.

542
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
No one.

543
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh my god.

544
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
82 for Epcot.

545
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Real German.

546
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
That's what I'm thinking of myself.

547
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Jurassic Park move there.

548
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Wrong year.

549
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,320
My parents my parents moved there before I was conceived.

550
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,560
Of course.

551
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,160
I think in 1970 I want to say maybe 1971.

552
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,120
And the reason I know this is because my mom got this thing in the mail that said Disney

553
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,120
World is opening and for two hundred dollars will give you this like license with your

554
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,160
with your picture on it and it will be a lifetime pass to Walt Disney World.

555
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Oh wow.

556
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
200 bucks.

557
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
So incredible.

558
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,640
It was just it was like it was one of those.

559
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,160
Wait would they honor that today.

560
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,560
How do they not.

561
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,400
I mean unless unless they just go like we're just not anymore.

562
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Which is possible.

563
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
They'll do those things.

564
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
What about that.

565
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:59,680
Wasn't there that airline that like had that that frequent flyer deal where you just buy

566
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,280
you get like one hundred thousand dollars and you get two seats forever.

567
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,160
And that one guy took such advantage of it.

568
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Yeah.

569
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,440
Like there's a million of dollars.

570
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Right.

571
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Right.

572
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Yeah.

573
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
To do it.

574
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Yeah.

575
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
I'm sure.

576
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Yeah.

577
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
There's all these.

578
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,080
Where no one thought like early on I just got an thing for the Warner Brothers Dubai

579
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,280
Land that says that if you pay the price right now that it'll still be like locked in forever.

580
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,120
Of course chances are that's going to close in two years.

581
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,520
So it's not going to be so worth it.

582
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,920
But who knows maybe it'll be the greatest theme park on earth and we're making a big

583
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
mistake not doing it.

584
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,280
This is could be the best investment you could make.

585
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Yeah.

586
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,760
And all you have to do is fly to Dubai often.

587
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Yeah.

588
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Yeah.

589
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
That's easy.

590
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
No problem.

591
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,640
So you're so you're aware it looms large as it's how.

592
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Wait how far.

593
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,200
How far are you.

594
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I'm two hours north.

595
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,720
We would go once or twice a year.

596
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,560
Yes I you know I grew up going to Disney obviously when I was little and then I pretty much I

597
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,200
I went to Epcot on the opening like week maybe really fourth day.

598
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,980
I take the monorail to Epcot and just to watch the we're getting ready for you video which

599
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,560
I suggest you guys check out which is pretty awesome.

600
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,600
And is it in some like preview center kind of spot.

601
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,200
The monorail would take you to spaceship earth or basically to the monorail stop and you

602
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,560
could see this construction.

603
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Wow.

604
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,280
And then they would just get everybody and just show you this video.

605
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
We're getting ready for you.

606
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Wow.

607
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Oh my god.

608
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Very psyched.

609
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,240
And I feel like once Epcot opened I don't think I I don't think I went to Disney for

610
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
a very long.

611
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,160
I was highly obsessed with Epcot and then full time Epcot when you get down there.

612
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Understandably it's new.

613
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
You've done all the other stuff.

614
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Yeah.

615
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,120
I mean I do stuff happening in the Magic Kingdom I guess.

616
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,880
And those like I'm trying to think what would have gone in in the early 80s.

617
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,040
Not until like 90s Tomorrowland.

618
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
You know.

619
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Yeah.

620
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
90s is kind of the big resurgence.

621
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,920
And I guess when I think of like exciting 80s 90s Disney stuff it's Disney MGM Studios

622
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,240
and Pleasure Island and things.

623
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,280
But like Magic Kingdom's sort of just what it is for a long time.

624
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,960
So also obsessed with MGM Studios.

625
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Yeah.

626
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,120
Which goes back to what we were talking about earlier where they you know the Spielberg

627
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,520
and Lucas concept of selling filmmaking as an adventure.

628
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Yeah.

629
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
Oh yeah.

630
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
You were saying well this is before we started recording.

631
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Oh right.

632
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,120
Then you like yeah your theory that wait that filmmakers are like the last like at some

633
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,160
point in the 80s filmmakers became the adventurers that we idealize instead of who Lucas and

634
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,280
Spielberg growing up by grew up idealizing.

635
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Yeah.

636
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,840
Because Lucas didn't you have the over the hill theory where you needed to have a you

637
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,720
needed to set an adventure where your subject like goes over that hill in the distance and

638
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
goes on an adventure.

639
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
But.

640
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Oh OK sure.

641
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
But so we I feel like we ran out of hills.

642
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,280
You know there's no true adventures left in the world.

643
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,480
So they started marketing being a filmmaker as an adventure which is I mean ridiculous

644
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
but it worked.

645
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
We all bought it.

646
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Yeah.

647
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Yeah.

648
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,280
We also have that other great adventure what it's like to be a stand up comedian.

649
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
It's true.

650
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,280
The greatest tale that can be told.

651
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
The 70 things.

652
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Funness and.

653
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Yeah the set went bad.

654
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
What's going to happen now.

655
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
You've got to pay dues.

656
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Oh man.

657
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Sorry kid you got bumped.

658
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Oh no.

659
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Not again.

660
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
The red light.

661
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
What's that?

662
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Oh boy.

663
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:37,920
Yeah hey who's to say there's not adventure left in the world.

664
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:44,680
But but you know yeah you're there in the early 80s and when the future is now the future

665
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,440
was born on October 1st 1982 as a shirt I wear says and you're like oh god you're right

666
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,240
there for when it's like glistening and new.

667
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
I'm very jealous of that.

668
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
I feel like I.

669
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,040
Oh my old show was kind of like my cartoon was sort of like like if you could do like

670
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,120
me idealizing what it was probably like in the early 80s.

671
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,960
So yeah what do you what do you know.

672
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
What was it like.

673
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,600
It was just like I mean it just had a sort of a sheen to it.

674
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,600
You know everything was sparkling and new and anything that was sort of like grayish

675
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,920
but kicked rainbows when the light hit it.

676
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,320
I had rainbows now it's like you know dull and chipping and so this whole place was like

677
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,920
and there was there were tons of like that you know did you guys see that video of the

678
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,360
the what's his name.

679
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,520
He's got figment the imagination dream dream dream finder.

680
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,520
He was walking around you know and you'd talk to him and really was so many different kinds

681
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,880
of like weird robots that would talk to you because that was sort of new you know the

682
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,120
ability to like remote control a big shiny new robot they would be like you know do you

683
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,880
know you can get your reservations to eat at Japan.

684
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Who is the smart one is a smart one.

685
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,000
He's on communicator with the big eyes right.

686
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The huge eyes.

687
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

688
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The dress.

689
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

690
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,920
Boxy old robots favorite thing.

691
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,200
And just I mean yeah it was wonderful it was wonderful it was also very it felt very academic

692
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,480
I was like oh the future is going to be great because this seems like a place of learning.

693
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,800
I mean I was very young but it seemed like it seemed like wow we're all everybody all

694
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,680
we're all on the same page and the future is going to be people that are excited about

695
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,760
learning and now it's it doesn't feel like that so much.

696
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,800
You were but you were into the educational aspect very much.

697
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,520
Well totally I feel like I've never heard this perspective because even I as a kid was

698
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,760
like I like my rap God enjoyment is kind of in retrospect like I didn't like going there

699
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:49,180
as a kid too much and I started really that became my my spot probably in the 2000s.

700
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,360
But yeah what would you like.

701
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,620
What was your I mean I know you guys were your pavilions.

702
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,440
We're talking I mean I don't even know if I can rank it.

703
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,440
I guess I guess what I'll say is if I immediately think about it of course I'm going to start

704
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,800
with the universe of energy because the line is going to be shorter and I like the way

705
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,400
it smells it's got that weird smells like barbecue the dinosaur ride.

706
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Oh did it.

707
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,760
I mean like the burn like it's the volcano or the ash or something.

708
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,360
This weird smell it was very very pungent and then then Horizons which was my favorite

709
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,920
ride Horizons is that's a whole you guys need to do a whole episode.

710
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,240
I mean that's talked Horizons much that I think that's one of the big one.

711
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,360
That's a major that is a big one that is in around twenty twenty three.

712
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,520
I'm not going to say yeah that's that's very what if we did it where you could at the end

713
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,720
you could choose a different path into what episode.

714
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,360
That's what I love this I love choosing and I but I don't remember which was my favorite.

715
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:57,000
I probably space space or underwater like I've never I guess I like the desert a little

716
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,200
more now because it's kind of like a popular one you know two hour drive as a vacation

717
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
destination in California.

718
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,200
But as a kid I was like no deserts are that's where it's just cactuses and people die there.

719
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,400
Don't forget don't forget the desert had I feel like I'm starting to step on Horizons

720
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,720
here the desert had a much like Soren it shot the smell of oranges in your face because

721
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,320
it was a terraformed desert that's covered in orange groves.

722
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Wow.

723
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Oh right.

724
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
OK.

725
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,840
This is why you know I've been meaning to bring this up on the show.

726
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,880
Doug Jones who was a guest on the show and a Horizons expert wrote a big article about

727
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,480
it.

728
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,320
He had a big complaint about our show and maybe other listeners have been stewing on

729
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
this as well.

730
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,420
He told it to me very feasibly almost in the way you know when the tweets have the claps

731
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:51,080
between the words it was almost like that and he spelled it out like watching a ride

732
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,040
through is not the same as going on the ride.

733
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
Sure.

734
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,520
You know in some cases we have no choice.

735
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Right.

736
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,920
In other cases we have wimped out of rides and the only alternative is to watch the ride

737
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
throughs.

738
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,600
But thinking about you've just listed several examples of smells and rides that I had not

739
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,280
heard of and this is why it's I mean I went on both of those as a kid but I wasn't taking

740
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
notes.

741
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,680
I didn't know there was a podcast coming 30 years down the line.

742
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,000
I mentioned this on our text chain.

743
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,160
My family found a video of me at like 12 age 12 goofing on the universe of energy after

744
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,440
I had I was making fun of it because I said well I like I like there we saw some dinosaurs

745
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,560
and then we watched a movie for a while.

746
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,560
I was like whoa I don't remember that because I don't even remember I don't I said probably

747
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,840
on the episode universe manager I didn't have such a great memory of going on the ride but

748
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,000
there I am goofing on it.

749
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,760
I'll get this I'll upload this eventually but because that because because actually

750
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,480
the universe of energy starts with a movie.

751
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Yes starts right.

752
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,920
I mean I don't know if I was confused at the time.

753
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,520
There's two there's two movies really and then cue the dinos.

754
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,760
Oh because who does it now.

755
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Is it Ellen.

756
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Now it's over.

757
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Oh is it really.

758
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,360
It's going to be Guardians of the Galaxy.

759
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,720
Well I mean I guess it was basically promoting Exxon so I should know.

760
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Oh yeah.

761
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
It's still.

762
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
It's so odd.

763
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,960
Mickey about it and an out of very hideously out of date.

764
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Bill Nye.

765
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,000
Like version of Ellen and the and the or the animatronic which she when the riot closed

766
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,520
she brought it out on the show and was like so horrified by her own like non-visage she

767
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,440
like even she like can't she's like can we get this out of here.

768
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,160
I don't even want to do this as a bit.

769
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
This is this is gone.

770
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Uncanny Valley.

771
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
Yeah.

772
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Yeah.

773
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,400
Oh they wish if they were thinking sculpts that uncanny valley levels.

774
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
So then.

775
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,040
So let's see if I if I'm if I'm going.

776
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,520
You're ideal day.

777
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,400
I've got is new if we transport to eighty two eighty three.

778
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,920
So we pretty much I feel like we always want clockwise although I can't imagine a world

779
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,200
where I would have let my dad bring us to the World Showcase before seeing the land

780
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
and imagination.

781
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,080
But I'm just going to say I'm going to say we're doing a clockwise.

782
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,320
Just because that's the way I think.

783
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
So.

784
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,720
So then Mexico which I still think is the most successful immersive non-ride experience

785
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,640
in all of the parks that I have seen.

786
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Huh.

787
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Just that that interior that.

788
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:26,680
And then just like oh I'm outside and there's volcanoes and it's it does still look great.

789
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,200
You can't see the ceiling dark enough.

790
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
You can't see the ceiling.

791
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Yeah.

792
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
That's important.

793
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Like your small world.

794
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,520
Although I realized I besides passing through it because it was never really my family's

795
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,360
thing the pictures I've seen of the German beer hall look pretty cool.

796
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,000
Not on the level of Mexico but I'm like oh I should see what that's like sometime.

797
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Do you have any memories.

798
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So fun.

799
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah.

800
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,660
So fun because my uncle was obsessed with Germany because he liked Porsche.

801
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,080
So we would go my uncle Howard.

802
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,560
So we would go when he was in town we go to Germany and it was super fun.

803
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,400
They do all kinds of dancing and singing and like dads are chugging beer and like it's

804
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,440
got a very like very boisterous environment where everything else is a little bit more

805
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
chill.

806
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,240
That place was like people are screaming and going crazy.

807
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:17,200
So also after Mexico for five years maybe more there was a sign saying coming soon Africa.

808
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Africa.

809
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Yeah.

810
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,200
So sight really.

811
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Yeah.

812
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,240
I think it's Haley right.

813
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:31,480
The roots author Alex Haley in one of the Epcot TV specials they like interviewed him

814
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,120
about like yes we're working with you know this pavilion is going to be great.

815
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,800
Like this is yeah it's going to be really good and just never happened.

816
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Yeah.

817
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,560
Because I want to say it was like maybe Zimbabwe because you know it's got to be usually it's

818
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
one country that spawns.

819
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,600
They were going to try and do a whole content that feels like a very like American.

820
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Yeah that's problematic.

821
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,720
Lots of countries in Africa.

822
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,360
You got all you got this.

823
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,720
All of you need to fit in this.

824
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,480
I think that would have been a little problematic and complicated to if they still had it is

825
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,720
the was that is that where Norway ended up being Norway.

826
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,600
No because then it was Japan or China.

827
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
That was China China.

828
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,040
And it was Japan where I saw Pat Marita.

829
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Whoa.

830
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,000
My dad said Mr. Marita it would be our honor if you would let me and my sons dine with

831
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
you and he said no.

832
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,560
I thought that was going to be a picture.

833
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,400
But that's what happens when you get famous people and you have just sort of everyday

834
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,320
people like you're my friend because you know we love the credit kids.

835
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
We're familiar.

836
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Boy wax off.

837
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,120
So let's actually I'm going to make this a specific day because let's say that we then

838
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,680
ate in Japan which we did.

839
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,560
That's where my dad always go my dad.

840
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,240
Then Norway which didn't have the ride yet.

841
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
The Maelstrom.

842
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Is that what it's called.

843
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
Yeah.

844
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Yeah.

845
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
Yeah.

846
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
There without the ride.

847
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,440
It was called it was without the ride and then it was without trolls.

848
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,640
I think maybe did have trolls and now it's something.

849
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
Yeah.

850
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
The ride never really changed that much.

851
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
I love the ride.

852
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,240
Oh I've never seen the frozen one.

853
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Yeah no it's frozen.

854
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,200
So then Germany and America and Italy and France you know you just sort of like let's

855
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
go let's go.

856
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Come on.

857
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
You walk there you know Morocco's.

858
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
What a dis of the American adventure.

859
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
They're wonder they're wonderful.

860
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,560
We would see that if as long as we had seen imagination in the land then we would see

861
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
America.

862
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
If the clock's ticking.

863
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Let's go.

864
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Let's go.

865
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,640
As you're saying this I'm realizing I don't know if I've ever been in World Showcase in

866
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
the morning.

867
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,360
I feel like that was always like well we got to do some future world stuff and then we'll

868
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360
go to World Showcase.

869
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Right.

870
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
And like the sun setting it's beautiful.

871
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Yes.

872
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
It looks very nice.

873
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,920
Although I did find out at some point I don't know if this is still the case but you can

874
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,800
go in because World Showcase always open second.

875
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,560
Future World always open first in the morning.

876
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:55,120
But you can go in the back entrance of the park the International Gateway.

877
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,680
You can go in a little before opening because the bakeries like the French bakery I think

878
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,260
is open for breakfast.

879
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,260
And you've never been there in the morning.

880
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,260
And I've never been there.

881
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,260
I could like just I found out.

882
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,260
Treats in the morning and you haven't been there.

883
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,260
I know.

884
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,260
What's wrong with you.

885
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,260
I know.

886
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,260
You're a fraud.

887
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,840
I just found out that there was another entrance.

888
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
I think from you guys.

889
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Oh really.

890
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,560
Yeah like the International Gateway.

891
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,560
It's amazing.

892
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Yeah.

893
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
It's near Italy or something.

894
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
It's where is it.

895
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
It's between the UK.

896
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,560
It's kind of a UK zone.

897
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,640
And then you go to Yacht and Beach Club and Boardwalk back there.

898
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,240
Those hotels and it's a lovely little walk.

899
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,280
And as I've said many times now you go have a drink at the Abracadabra.

900
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,160
My favorite bar in Disney World.

901
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Wow.

902
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
This is a newer establishment.

903
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Can anyone go there or is he a guest of the.

904
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Anyone can use the International Gateway.

905
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
You're being magicians only.

906
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
I think maybe.

907
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Hey.

908
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Presto.

909
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,760
You're doing magic right now.

910
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,360
The audience can't see it.

911
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
I'm a magician.

912
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,760
I think a point of clarification.

913
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,880
I think we blew through International Gateway talk in the past because someone had messaged

914
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,720
us and said anyone can use that.

915
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,160
It's not just for hotel guests.

916
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,000
I think what we were saying was that like yeah if you're staying at the hotels by that

917
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,560
entrance it's very convenient.

918
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Right.

919
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,680
And then I think I said that there was a boat from Hollywood Studios to Epcot and you said

920
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:20,160
no it was to the hotels but then someone clarified that yes indeed you could take a transfer

921
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,240
boat.

922
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
So we were both correct.

923
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,440
You guys got in a little like snippy fight.

924
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
We did get into a fight.

925
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,400
I guess yeah also some of those policies may have changed in between 1995 and 2018.

926
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,040
But you have to keep up on the policies especially an aspiring Disney politician as yourself.

927
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,040
Well.

928
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,040
That's not your jurisdiction.

929
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,040
That's not my jurisdiction at all.

930
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,480
Be aware of the sister parks.

931
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Sure.

932
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,480
I think that interrupted your day.

933
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,680
No no I feel like I'm doing too much.

934
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
But I love it very much.

935
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,680
I very I like the idea.

936
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,520
You also by the way are mentioning things that we do.

937
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,800
We have not we have not really talked about Mexico.

938
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
We have not.

939
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
We were heading to things we haven't.

940
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,520
We haven't talked a lot about Canada or a lot of these.

941
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,720
If on this podcast you do full episodes on all these rides think of this brief.

942
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,760
Think of this brief overview as the map to looking at the map.

943
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,240
So it's like the preview center.

944
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
We're all.

945
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
What was this.

946
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,080
In the preview center video.

947
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
We're waiting for you.

948
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,960
We're getting ready for you.

949
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,680
Oh my God.

950
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,360
You went to go see that multiple times just that and then leave.

951
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,000
I say that I absolutely would have done.

952
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,960
Because it's a large chunk of your day.

953
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Getting all the way over there.

954
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
To make that whole ride.

955
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
Absolutely.

956
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,320
I mean just imagine seeing the dome with you know half of it is this weird stucco and half

957
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,800
of it is the silvery.

958
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
This is so.

959
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,360
You're mocking me how much I want to.

960
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,760
We're doing it now.

961
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,760
We go to start.

962
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,760
We go to Disneyland and look at the fake rocks at Star Wars land.

963
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,000
That's a thing we like to do.

964
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,800
So I can imagine hypothetically especially now that I have kind of so iconic and beloved

965
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,520
thinking to go in to see it being constructed is just we are we are so excited thinking

966
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,520
about it I think.

967
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,040
The way you guys feel is how I feel about seeing like the Columbia exhibit in Chicago.

968
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,200
You know the Chicago World's Fair that.

969
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
Oh yeah.

970
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,040
That inspired Walt Disney to make a.

971
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,040
Of course.

972
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
That inspired H.H. Holmes to.

973
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,040
To submit it to complete his work.

974
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,560
And both are my heroes for two different reasons.

975
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,080
Both very driven men.

976
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,120
Both built very distinct castles.

977
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,120
They had visions.

978
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
They had visions.

979
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,040
They built immersive environments that generate emotion.

980
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
So.

981
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,840
So then we'd go.

982
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,520
Always we'd go to the Canada Circle Theater.

983
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,920
Because we love the song.

984
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,320
And this was before Martin Short.

985
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,160
And on the day that we saw Pat Morita and Aidan Japan.

986
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,800
Then we went to the Circle Theater and I threw up in the middle of the.

987
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,160
Middle of the place.

988
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,160
I'm very shy.

989
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
I was very shy.

990
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,960
I would never like throw up in public and I threw up right in the middle of like all

991
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,480
of the Circle Theater.

992
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,480
It was just too much.

993
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
Whoa.

994
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,320
Did you get the like people recoiling and backing up.

995
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Yes.

996
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
Luckily it was at the very end.

997
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,520
I'm like I think I did it.

998
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,520
I made it.

999
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,840
I made it through the whole thing.

1000
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840
I feel really.

1001
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,800
And then the doors opened.

1002
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,240
Did it surprise you?

1003
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
Total surprise.

1004
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,240
That's never.

1005
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,680
I don't think that's happened since where I didn't think I was going to throw up and

1006
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,840
then I did.

1007
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,440
And this is in the.

1008
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,280
It's in it's in the Circle Vision Theater and they do if you haven't been to a Disney

1009
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,680
Circle Vision movie in a while there are rails that you hold.

1010
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,800
And I was like in case you were gripping.

1011
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
I was holding onto the rail.

1012
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,560
And I remember looking down.

1013
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,600
I mean like I still feel bad.

1014
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,200
And then so.

1015
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Nice.

1016
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,360
Those things are there's something weird about those things for sure.

1017
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,000
And just imagine that because they're shot on 70 millimeters.

1018
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So just the equipment to film those things must be beautiful.

1019
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

1020
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Yeah.

1021
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah.

1022
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,840
Like real technical feats for sure.

1023
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:02,880
But also yeah like those things because there's no like digital stitch up points really.

1024
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,080
So probably some of those cameras would get kind of out of.

1025
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,960
I do remember like odd odd lines and stuff.

1026
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Yeah.

1027
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,480
They overlap and feel ghosty and.

1028
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,480
Yeah.

1029
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
Yeah.

1030
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Yeah.

1031
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,060
I could see why it would like bug you out is what I'm saying.

1032
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,740
But I guess like in the 80s if I think back if I could you know with being able to look

1033
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:26,840
back in the 80s the thing that there was different then was you could be completely earnest about

1034
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,160
something you know what I mean.

1035
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,200
Like there was no a crowd in the Circle Theater of Canada wouldn't be like a movie.

1036
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
What is this one?

1037
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
You know what I mean.

1038
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Like it was just like oh shit.

1039
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Well all right great.

1040
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,640
We're going to learn about Canada and like the whole audience would be on board like

1041
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,160
taking notes like you could be like a muscle guy in the 80s with like a sleeveless shirt

1042
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,260
and like sunglasses and you could make like flex your bicep and kiss your bicep and look

1043
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,560
at somebody and not be joking.

1044
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,160
Like it was like that's the difference of the 80s.

1045
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,360
You can be completely the sincerity earnest and sincere.

1046
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,360
Yeah.

1047
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
It's better now.

1048
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
It's better now than it was then.

1049
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,920
But that's that was the difference culturally.

1050
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,520
Well but maybe like I think what I like trying in a supremely snarky time and when commercials

1051
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,120
are all like they're all little rifty joke machines and stuff.

1052
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,480
Would it be funny if we ate at Connell's Jr. or whatever?

1053
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,480
Oh yeah yeah.

1054
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,960
Even brands present themselves ironically.

1055
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:24,320
It's also strange but like that that deeply earnest way that ads used to be the Epcot

1056
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,600
movie you're talking about the Church Street Station ad that we talked about in the Pleasure

1057
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,600
Island episode.

1058
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:36,960
Yeah so like so so deeply earnest and that that I think that might be a lot of what you

1059
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,080
know excites me about old Epcot.

1060
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,880
It seems like you know like that I understand why they would do let's get a comedian in

1061
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,360
this ride and never kind of make fun of the dinosaurs.

1062
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,900
Totally makes sense as a 90s turn but oh my god the 80s where you didn't need that.

1063
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,300
People would just like it's a beautiful score.

1064
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,280
These robots are very well rendered.

1065
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,560
Yeah it is the swing in the 90s is so hard too because I mean Eric Idle's on Figment,

1066
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,360
Martin Short goes into Canada, Ellen goes on Univer... like everyone was reacting to

1067
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,800
it like well no one wants to be sincere anymore.

1068
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,680
Everyone wants snark, everyone wants funny.

1069
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,600
We'll get the funniest people and they'll make the funniest jokes on our rides from

1070
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,600
now on.

1071
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
A swarm of comedians.

1072
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Yeah like.

1073
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Blink the park.

1074
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Blink the park.

1075
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
Yeah.

1076
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Like the monkeys.

1077
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,320
Invaded Epcot Center and a few of them are still in there.

1078
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,240
And in the last great adventurers of our time.

1079
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,240
Yeah.

1080
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,040
Just slandered comedians.

1081
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,180
So let's see so then I think Canada ends it also Canada those when you're in that little

1082
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,040
area with the waterfalls and the cliffs and you're looking up at the Quebec building.

1083
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,040
Very cool.

1084
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,040
Very beautiful.

1085
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,040
Very very beautiful.

1086
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,200
And the Morocco Pavilion across from it.

1087
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,200
Also beautiful.

1088
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,200
Delicious food.

1089
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
Really incredible architecture.

1090
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,640
The tile work it's just a masterpiece.

1091
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,960
Look how earnest we're being.

1092
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,560
We got the Epcot spirit.

1093
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,960
I'm worried coming on here because I have no snark towards these places.

1094
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,880
I love them so much.

1095
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,560
You know sometimes we do and sometimes we don't.

1096
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:16,080
Like you know I think we like ragging on some weird bad thing or like food rocks is silly

1097
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,120
but I think it is a fear we have sometimes.

1098
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,480
It's like do we just love this?

1099
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,640
There's not a lot to...

1100
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,520
People just I mean we don't talk we don't talk too much about I guess we always talk

1101
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,200
about ourselves but I mean we don't talk we're not analyzing ourselves but when I hear people

1102
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,320
talk about the show that we do they do talk about our sincerity which I don't know that

1103
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,520
I necessarily know that I'm doing it.

1104
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,640
I also feel like I'm really being flippant about this stuff but apparently I'm just like

1105
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,760
I love this stuff so much.

1106
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,760
I love it.

1107
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,080
Like that's really what it's coming off as.

1108
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,760
Well those moments every one of those moments is worth ten little jabs I think.

1109
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,880
They shine brighter I think.

1110
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,680
Maybe it's because these things are precious to you and so they're worthy of criticism.

1111
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Interesting maybe.

1112
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:07,160
I think well also like just what it's just what you like and what you believe.

1113
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,160
Like I mean I think a lot of people if you corner someone and go like what do you believe?

1114
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,720
What do you what's your whole what are you all about?

1115
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,920
Like people will often clam up and shut down or like.

1116
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,920
Sure.

1117
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,960
I don't believe that you would point your finger at them like that.

1118
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,960
They would clam up.

1119
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,680
What do you why do you believe in God?

1120
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,680
You know like.

1121
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,280
Here's a walk around character I don't want to say.

1122
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Yeah this is.

1123
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,280
Atheist accuser.

1124
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,080
What is Epcot's new character like a new atheist guy?

1125
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,480
I guess he sells books.

1126
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,720
Sincere man.

1127
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:50,360
But you know you come up to me on the street point at me ask what you believe.

1128
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,280
I think I would spit back as fast as I could upon getting my bearings.

1129
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,800
I believe that the future began on October 1st 1982.

1130
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,520
Well that's what your full back tattoo says.

1131
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,240
Let me flex it for you guys.

1132
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,240
Very good.

1133
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,240
Everybody get a view.

1134
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
All right great.

1135
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,320
Wait but we've looped back around.

1136
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,960
So then just quickly just doing the circle of I mean I'm not going to spend time on imagination

1137
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,880
that was probably the most important thing to me at the park.

1138
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,560
The land which was a close second.

1139
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:23,120
I come see my garden guys and Eagle Rock because it's all inspired by the land.

1140
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
Oh wow hydroponics.

1141
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,120
It's got hydroponics.

1142
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,120
That's wild.

1143
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,120
Wait wait wait.

1144
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,320
Wait this is another level.

1145
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,160
This is I love the land.

1146
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
I love it very much.

1147
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,000
We've heard of many you know Michael Jackson old singer Bobby Sherman they make their main

1148
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,160
street in their backyard.

1149
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,240
They recreate the famous Disney mainstream but I have yet to hear anyone recreate the

1150
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,240
land.

1151
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,240
Wow.

1152
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,040
The one I'm trying to which I will someday do when I retire from this industry when I'm

1153
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,760
70 I hope.

1154
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,760
Sure.

1155
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,520
Will be the one where the fish live under the water and the fish fertilizes the plants

1156
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,560
but then the plant plants drop stuff and it feeds the fish and it's sort of like this

1157
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,400
cycle that goes forever.

1158
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,840
So you can buy very low key like tabletop versions of that.

1159
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,840
Yeah I'm into that.

1160
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,340
I want to try that.

1161
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
And then the eels anyway.

1162
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,340
So yeah.

1163
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,340
Wow.

1164
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:16,440
Well wasn't it you guys you just did the one about the cabaret the kitchen.

1165
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,240
That's an example of one that even when I was little my dad would be like you guys don't

1166
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
want to do that one day.

1167
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,240
It was like no don't worry about it.

1168
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
Don't worry.

1169
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,560
So we did not do you could not feel it.

1170
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Yeah.

1171
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,640
So you don't mind that we snarked about that one.

1172
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,960
That's outside the purview.

1173
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,160
I was like that's that's that's talking down to me.

1174
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,720
Yeah sure sure.

1175
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,520
Yeah they know how much me a kid likes the 40s vaudeville music.

1176
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,560
And food culture.

1177
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,840
But even as we're saying this now like this stuff of like yeah we made some jokes about

1178
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
it.

1179
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,120
If someone said like hey do you want to get in a car and go to that right now.

1180
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,120
I go like yes absolutely.

1181
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,120
Oh yeah.

1182
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,880
I'd rather be doing that than pretty much anything else.

1183
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,760
So you're sultry what tomato.

1184
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,880
Who is the going like there are a couple boys you want to learn about some sort of whatever

1185
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,280
they.

1186
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,280
I forget already.

1187
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,000
It depends on what your tastes are.

1188
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,200
I mean anything that show could really be.

1189
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,640
I was going to say there's a couple of sexy characters.

1190
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,560
I mean I think is the safe choice.

1191
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,240
People probably found that milk carton kind of handsome.

1192
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,240
Yeah.

1193
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,880
As a reason he stuck around it was in Food Rocks 2.

1194
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,520
But he was called Dairy Man.

1195
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,000
What was it called.

1196
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,920
Mr. Dairy Goods I believe was his name.

1197
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,400
Just a normal human saying.

1198
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
No.

1199
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Just a regular.

1200
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
I'm a seer about this podcast.

1201
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
It's all snark.

1202
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,760
The other thing that I would also be snarky about back then would be something seemed

1203
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,280
like pandering to me about oftentimes about parades or like spectaculars unless it was

1204
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,280
a night spectacular.

1205
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,720
So during the day they would do this spectacular that was like lots of purple smoke and explosions

1206
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:56,040
and air boats and like the evil dragon men have come to steal our imagination cube.

1207
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,240
You know like that literally parachute into the show with smoke on their parachutes and

1208
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,920
be like this is a little silly.

1209
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,920
So like that.

1210
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,720
I don't know about this one.

1211
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,720
Was that an earlier thing.

1212
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,600
Yes it's called like just look up what it's I mean all I can think of is like phantasmagic

1213
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,600
but that's not it.

1214
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,840
Obviously something like it was kind it was done by like in inventions right.

1215
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,320
Like sort of by the fountain and all.

1216
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,040
It was right in the center of the lake.

1217
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
It was multiple boats.

1218
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,040
I think this is.

1219
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,840
Oh wait no this is different.

1220
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,840
Oh OK.

1221
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,120
High speed boats going all around the lake fighting each other.

1222
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,120
We got to see this.

1223
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,120
Because this is this other one where Mickey is learning to harness the power of water

1224
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,120
right.

1225
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,560
And he like summons an army of people on stilts and they're so they're all very tall and they're

1226
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:46,600
all wearing metallic Mickey shaped armor on their chests.

1227
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,840
He's like and then and then like a like a robot dragon appears and shoots fire.

1228
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
It might have been.

1229
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,840
I don't think so.

1230
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,640
I think this was a 90s thing though.

1231
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,220
Well the boats were dragon heads.

1232
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,640
So whatever you find the boats are dragons heads and they're going very fast.

1233
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,600
This was like a dragon head like poking out of a planter.

1234
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:14,080
So like it hid in just in a big planner in that Epcot you know garden area.

1235
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,640
So it could have been a reprise a repeated dragon head.

1236
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,820
But finding out that there are multiple dragon related shows in Epcot history.

1237
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,820
What a delight.

1238
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,520
That was big in that when the Epcot opening was the whole colorful smoke.

1239
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,080
I remember that being purple.

1240
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,900
Oh green smoke.

1241
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,400
So that was also I didn't like daytime fireworks.

1242
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,160
You just saw a quick flash and then it was mostly the smoke after.

1243
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,560
I was.

1244
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,400
And then the last thing that opened at Epcot that I was excited about and felt really rewarded

1245
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,960
was the Living Sea.

1246
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Oh that's right.

1247
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,960
It was a little later.

1248
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,960
Seas 86 I think.

1249
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,000
That was the last thing that I was like a little while.

1250
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,600
I can't believe this is going to open and when it did I was like I can't believe how

1251
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
great it is.

1252
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Oh sure.

1253
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,600
See like those sea cabs.

1254
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,600
I was so into it.

1255
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,760
That was the first thing that why my wife thought she didn't like Epcot because the

1256
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,400
one time she went they were laid the first thing they went on were the sea cabs and her

1257
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,600
dad was like this place sucks.

1258
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,380
Sea cabs and they left immediately.

1259
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,520
And until we met she assumed Epcot was bad and I was like no but there's this whole thing

1260
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,120
where it's the future but it's from the 80s and you just you got to check it out.

1261
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,760
So the sea cabs spoiled her experience.

1262
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,760
But I don't know.

1263
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,720
That was before they turned it into Nemo.

1264
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,680
Now Nemo are in the sea cabs.

1265
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,960
See that's my family had the opposite in that like the restaurant in that pavilion.

1266
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,520
We were all jazzed every trip we would eat at the Living Seas restaurant.

1267
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,400
I think that is the first and one of the few places I've ever eaten turtle at.

1268
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,400
No.

1269
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,680
They had turtle soup as you could look at turtles.

1270
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,680
You were like the shredder.

1271
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,080
You finally dined on turtle soup.

1272
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:02,040
This is that is a story I think I've told to some people are surprised by like how many

1273
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,440
first food experiences I remember having at Disney World.

1274
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,960
I remember being the first place I ever had hummus balsamic vinegar.

1275
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,960
Fakes.

1276
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Keep going.

1277
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,320
Like I think that's mostly it.

1278
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,480
But just these weird oddities like of like yeah was that Spoodles.

1279
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,480
You remember Spoodles?

1280
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,480
You guys ever eat at Spoodles?

1281
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,480
Where was Spoodles?

1282
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,120
Spoodles is at the Boardwalk Hotel.

1283
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,120
I think I did eat at Spoodles.

1284
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:33,600
Yeah they would give you bread with hummus even though it was an Italian restaurant.

1285
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,120
That was like what their bread service was and my family was all kind of like what is

1286
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,120
this?

1287
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,120
I'm like oh this is good.

1288
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,440
Were they did they all try it or what because my dad still.

1289
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,400
Yeah everyone tried it and everyone liked it.

1290
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,400
Little suspicious of hummus.

1291
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
Won't have hummus.

1292
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
I go you know it's just chickpeas.

1293
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
It's not any hummus.

1294
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,520
I still think it was very unique back then.

1295
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,680
I don't know that it was like available at supermarkets as much and then we were in the

1296
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:06,720
Millennial Village I think it was called like the sort of World's Fair in the sound stage

1297
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,480
at the back entrance of Epcot.

1298
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,280
Like there was a pavilion where a man like we sat on pillows and he told us about his

1299
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,080
country and his culture and poured us tea and gave us plates of figs and it was like

1300
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,600
that felt like the most like hands on because it wasn't like super crowded.

1301
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:29,000
It was like wow this is like an Epcot pavilion like just for us.

1302
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,800
Like it was a very neat like personalized.

1303
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,960
It's a great way to describe an unpopular attraction.

1304
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,640
I guess it was also huge so I feel like it ate up people.

1305
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:46,240
But yeah it was turned towards the millennium was coming and everything was exciting.

1306
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:53,840
The world's going to be a utopia or the world's going to end in 2000.

1307
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,040
That was kind of one of two ways.

1308
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:04,800
You know it turned out it was ending just very slowly.

1309
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:10,440
Just now I'm picturing kind of like a yearbook type photo of you looking very studious and

1310
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,840
proud with the quote under it and they would give you bread with hummus.

1311
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,880
I just want that to be very associated with you.

1312
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,840
It's funny the park stuff like I did not have a lot of friends.

1313
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:27,440
I mean I had friends who would go certainly but like no one I ever really like geeked

1314
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,400
out with even like the friends that I would like nerd out about like comics or like movies

1315
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,920
or comedy or stuff like theme parks was never in this.

1316
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,120
So it felt very personal to me and like to my family and like we were all kind of on

1317
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,120
the same page.

1318
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,040
It was the most intense clearly.

1319
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,240
You would go up to kids at school and be like I tried hummus.

1320
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,840
I tried hummus for the free one and talk about it.

1321
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:58,760
Did you guys know there's more than one vinegar?

1322
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,760
Anyway to get back on track.

1323
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,120
Go to a world showcase and get cultured.

1324
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,120
Get cultured yeah.

1325
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,120
And shnoodles.

1326
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,280
Drink a turtle.

1327
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,400
From the living seas to a different seas.

1328
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,400
Oh yeah.

1329
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,880
We figured it out.

1330
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,080
Descending 20,000 leagues.

1331
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,600
20,000 leagues.

1332
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,440
All the way 20,000 leagues deep under the sea.

1333
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,920
Well so let's talk about this.

1334
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,200
You have a person you have an attachment not just to this ride but to this film it seems

1335
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
like.

1336
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
Very much.

1337
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,200
Yeah.

1338
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,640
So I and I try to remember why and how that happened because when you watch it now I think

1339
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,200
it's like three hours long.

1340
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,200
Yeah.

1341
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
And it's dry.

1342
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Sure.

1343
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Yeah.

1344
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,600
It's like the wonderful world of Disney.

1345
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,600
Okay.

1346
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,600
Possibly.

1347
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,080
I think that is statistically very likely.

1348
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:51,040
Yeah so that it might be that or I might have seen it possibly projected someplace because

1349
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,800
in the early 80s they would have movies would come back to the theater.

1350
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,400
So it's like oh you didn't see Indiana Jones.

1351
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,400
It'll be back.

1352
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,400
It'll be back next fall.

1353
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:08,080
So anyway it was something about the combination of my sort of like pre-goth tendencies mixed

1354
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:14,200
with the idea of like humanity is dumb and I'm going to escape and like enter a magical

1355
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:20,680
world on my own mixed with Kirk Douglas was cool and I love Peter Laurie and James Mason

1356
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,680
love the way he sounded.

1357
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,120
I was obsessed with pipe organs for some reason.

1358
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:29,600
I always like like I was very into learning the pipe organ and 20,000 leagues under the

1359
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:35,520
sea like inspired me to self teach my to to be self whatever.

1360
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,920
I thought I taught myself to cut and Fugue and D minor because I was so obsessed with

1361
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,200
being Captain Nemo and that complicated song.

1362
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,840
Oh and it's difficult to figure it out.

1363
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
It's tough.

1364
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,840
Yeah.

1365
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,520
I didn't the end part a little rusty but the beginning.

1366
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,040
Does it get really like yeah it gets really.

1367
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,780
That plays in this ride and in the movie.

1368
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:03,440
That's what Captain Nemo plays in his pipe or that's what he plays in the in the movie

1369
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,160
but in the ride they they play the theme like an extended version of the theme.

1370
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,880
Yeah I think they play an extended version of the and it pretty much never stops.

1371
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,320
No no through the entire ride.

1372
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,800
Also I was reading about it.

1373
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:21,120
It was also it was like a bed so if there was a delay that could keep playing but they

1374
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,280
could cue the narration parts like as needed.

1375
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,320
Yeah we just chill for a while and you would just hear the organ music very pleasant for

1376
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,320
me.

1377
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,760
I was I was very into orchestral music when I was a young child.

1378
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:37,320
But when you're waiting in the line they would play Whale of a Tale without lyrics which

1379
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,920
is Kirk Douglas's song.

1380
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,160
Until I watched it in preparation for this I was not familiar with maybe not any of it

1381
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
embarrassingly.

1382
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,280
I don't think I knew the organ thing and I didn't know the song.

1383
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,280
The song's a lot of fun.

1384
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,280
Yeah it's a good song.

1385
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,680
I swear by my tattoo.

1386
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,600
Kirk Douglas had to go we had to stretch outside of himself to sing.

1387
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,880
I don't think he's known as a singer.

1388
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,960
No but he knocked it out of the park.

1389
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,880
Yeah he's super charismatic.

1390
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,360
Also just I gotta tell you it makes me feel great knowing that he is still alive.

1391
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,360
Right yeah yeah yeah.

1392
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,360
Doing okay.

1393
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,240
Yes yeah can still like speak.

1394
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,760
It seems like the odds are against it but he does he'll speak at things.

1395
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,920
Yeah he did the Oscars a couple years ago.

1396
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,160
So you would be walking through it just seemed like a perfectly Disney thing because back

1397
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,820
then it wasn't like oh have you guys heard about steampunk.

1398
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,920
It's like you wear an Abraham Lincoln hat but it's made of copper.

1399
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,920
It wasn't like that.

1400
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,920
It was like.

1401
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,400
It didn't really have a name when this movie was out.

1402
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Right.

1403
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,680
Even like for a while after this movie was out.

1404
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,680
It was just like.

1405
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,600
Like a design aesthetic more like what the ship looks like what the submarine looks like.

1406
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,240
Yeah yeah it was it was well I mean it was like.

1407
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,240
Jules Verne shit.

1408
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Jules Verne HG Wells shit.

1409
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,760
Public domain science early science fiction.

1410
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,960
And it just looked so beautiful.

1411
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,440
It looks so perfect where you like there was something about where it was and I don't remember

1412
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:05,840
exactly where it was placed but something around the lines of like it was near frontier

1413
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,800
land but it was also near fantasy land.

1414
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,360
It was like a really nice merge.

1415
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,360
It also merged.

1416
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,000
No it was Tomorrowland right.

1417
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,520
So it was fantasy.

1418
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,560
It was fantasy land technically.

1419
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:21,240
That was an interesting thing I came across across sort of relearning about this ride

1420
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:26,040
is is you know of course in Disneyland and Anaheim they had the submarine voyage but

1421
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:33,840
it was much more like 50s kind of Cold War like you know the submarines America's first

1422
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,680
line of underwater defense and it was very novel.

1423
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,280
Eventually it became more research submarines as that became very popular and they wanted

1424
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,360
to put it in Florida.

1425
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:48,560
But they're like oh we're kind of running out of room in Tomorrowland but if we like

1426
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:53,520
put a theme over it we can get it in somewhere else like fantasy land.

1427
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,560
Where like oh well we the 20,000 Leagues movie is still looms large in people's mind and

1428
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,040
the ride itself seemed kind of similar.

1429
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:07,320
It had a lot of similarities to the Anaheim version but this except Captain Nemo is there

1430
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,680
and you are in the Nautilus.

1431
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:13,340
And it was one of these sort of like these seamless transitions that I'm so into at Disney

1432
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:18,320
where you don't see where you sort of seamlessly entered into another world right.

1433
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:23,880
So because it was a perfect connector between fantasy and future is retro future and it

1434
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,840
was also fantasy and.

1435
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:33,720
But it makes sense it ties into Frontierland and stuff too because it's it is past technology.

1436
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,880
And I also grew up in like near all these weird waterways and I thought it would be

1437
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,240
really cool if I had my own submarine and I would like see people's boats and like go

1438
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,000
to boat communities and sink them with my own.

1439
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,960
Go to war with war as some have described Nemo.

1440
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:58,880
So I thought when I was growing up that it was the most successful immersive experience

1441
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,080
at Disney right because because pirates is awesome but there's a part of pirates where

1442
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,840
it just feels like it feels like a little bit of a ride.

1443
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:10,800
It's very immersive but I would say the Haunted Mansion is the most successful immersive experience

1444
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,440
for me at Disney.

1445
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:17,000
There's no point when I go like just a ride like I would actually get sucked in when I

1446
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,360
was little completely to Haunted Mansion.

1447
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,360
Sure.

1448
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:28,120
But 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was so perfectly effective because you get into an actual once

1449
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:34,000
you go through the very long line you get into an actual submarine that is clearly below

1450
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,480
water and if those those portals broke you're gonna die.

1451
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,400
I mean you're underwater you know what I mean.

1452
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:44,800
It's not like they're not projecting it on a screen you are in a submarine underwater.

1453
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,240
If you're freaked out by that then you're probably not gonna go on this ride.

1454
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,360
It would like when they'd close the hatch your ears would pop a little bit so that you

1455
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,360
know that there's some sort of suction related thing going on.

1456
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:02,240
So Scott says this so here's my quick story about this and I don't know what's true and

1457
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,120
what's not because I was very little.

1458
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:09,040
We were in line I forget it's probably like 89 or something we were in line for this ride

1459
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,560
and it was a it's always a long line because it's a very hard to get in and out to load

1460
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,800
people in and out for these subs it still is in Disneyland.

1461
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,560
It takes so the line gets very long.

1462
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,200
There was no fast pass my parents didn't have any idea they didn't have a guide to tell

1463
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,720
which so we were there probably for like what felt like an hour and a half I think in line

1464
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,540
my parents were exhausted and I'm like four or five years old and we get to the front

1465
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:41,200
of the line and I say to my mom I have to go to the bathroom and my mom's like we we

1466
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:48,200
just got here and she's like I'm like no I have to go so we got out of line I never went

1467
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
on this ride.

1468
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,200
Oh no.

1469
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:56,600
I now here's the interesting thing I think in hindsight I might have been lying because

1470
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,600
I was afraid of the ride.

1471
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,600
Because you were scared?

1472
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,240
I don't know for sure.

1473
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,640
My memories betray me I'm not sure what the deal is I think though I was using it so I

1474
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,560
could get off I was too scared too as you're saying this thing went under the water I didn't

1475
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,240
like it I'm a little claustrophobic in general I'm also a little phobic about everything

1476
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:21,440
in general so I'm pretty sure I used peeing as an excuse to not go on this ride and I've

1477
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,920
never been on this ride.

1478
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:30,120
Erotic childhood trauma which we all share like usually trauma caused by our own minds

1479
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,120
yes.

1480
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,040
Which is fitting because I don't want to be the one to break news I mean it'll be old

1481
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:40,160
news by the time this release but I got a news alert that the novelist Philip Roth just

1482
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,160
died at 85.

1483
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,160
Oh my.

1484
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:49,160
The great chronicler of neurotic Jewish protagonists.

1485
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,160
What a tie in.

1486
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,160
What a tie in.

1487
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,160
Yeah.

1488
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,160
The first Walter Cronkite moment.

1489
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,120
This seems like the sort of mania from a Portnoy's complaint.

1490
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:03,120
I guess I got a news alert that said that we have the dates or the dates when Star Wars

1491
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,840
land opens on my phone and I didn't break that news for this.

1492
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,840
Oh really.

1493
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,840
You're breaking the number of the great American novelist.

1494
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,840
What Steph.

1495
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,840
Wait give us the dates Mike.

1496
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:17,440
Well I shouldn't say dates but it's summer 2019 for Disneyland fall 2019 for Disney World

1497
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,440
for Star Wars land.

1498
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,440
We're beating them.

1499
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,440
We're beating them yeah.

1500
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,440
Yeah.

1501
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,280
So that's what we got and I didn't even report that.

1502
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,600
So now I know we can report anything.

1503
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,560
Will it be worth it for the lights?

1504
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,560
Star Wars land.

1505
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,640
Well that's a whole other thing like if we're getting into rumors here they're they're doing

1506
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,640
a whole Pixar.

1507
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,640
This is not a rumor.

1508
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,360
They're doing a whole three hundred dollar day before Pixar peer event.

1509
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,360
Interesting.

1510
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:43,520
So there's speculation that for months there will be a an additional upcharge Star Wars

1511
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,440
event to get into the land and you will have your you will you won't be like you'll be

1512
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,440
able to go on the rides.

1513
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,040
It'll probably actually be more comfortable but it'll be like an insane upcharge maybe

1514
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,840
in addition to your ticket or annual pass.

1515
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,320
That's why you won't regret it.

1516
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,320
Oh I agree.

1517
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,320
I'll 300 bucks easy.

1518
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320
Done.

1519
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
I'm out of my mind.

1520
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,320
You get a boy's band too thrown in right?

1521
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,320
Yeah.

1522
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,320
I want to see what I want.

1523
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,960
Yeah I want before anybody else I'm going to see Watto's.

1524
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,760
Well and we gotta get away the land before our band starts playing there on a permanent

1525
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,760
basis.

1526
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,760
Before Halyx 2.0.

1527
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,760
Sure.

1528
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,800
You guys just gonna do like a flash mob of a band or?

1529
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,840
In that we won't have permission and it'll just start happening.

1530
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,840
Oh good.

1531
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,920
We were hoping someone from Disney would have heard that one episode where we pitched ourselves

1532
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,920
as the revival of their old 70s band?

1533
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
80s band.

1534
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
80s.

1535
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,400
80s band Halyx.

1536
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,360
But yet we have not been contacted by the Disney people so we'll see.

1537
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,960
They have a year though.

1538
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:37,960
Yeah.

1539
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:38,960
They've got some time.

1540
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,960
To invite us.

1541
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,960
But as you all know we love breaking rules.

1542
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,960
Sort of what we're known for being the bad boys of Thee Park Podcasting.

1543
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,680
We might be the baddest boys.

1544
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,680
We might be the baddest boys.

1545
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,680
And we're not bad boys.

1546
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,680
Not remotely.

1547
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,680
The other podcast hosts they all seem like real good boys.

1548
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,680
I could be wrong but.

1549
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:03,640
They are uncomfortable saying like the word alcohol.

1550
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:11,080
Like I had a bit of a libation that was of the adult variety and like yeah.

1551
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,240
We drank alcohol together the other night.

1552
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,840
We got boozed up.

1553
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,840
Oh yeah.

1554
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,840
Holiday.

1555
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,440
If you're another Thee Park Podcast host and you think you were a tougher, cooler, more

1556
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,040
bad boy or girl than we are.

1557
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,440
Let us know because I bet you're wrong.

1558
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,440
Yeah.

1559
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,840
Can you compete with us having a night where we closed out the rooftop bar at the Burbank

1560
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,840
Holiday Inn.

1561
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,840
Yeah.

1562
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,400
Then went to the Carl Strauss or Gordon Beers.

1563
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,400
Gordon Beers.

1564
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,400
Gordon Beers.

1565
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,400
They're almost the same.

1566
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,560
And I got a glass of white wine and Jason got a brownie.

1567
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,720
With ice cream on it.

1568
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,720
And no drink.

1569
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:47,720
And no drink.

1570
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:51,920
And they brought me a plate with four spoons and I went well this won't be necessary.

1571
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,960
Are you like me?

1572
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,960
Very accurate.

1573
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,640
And you didn't have an ID when you went to Florida so you had your friends illegally

1574
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,280
buy you drinks for five days.

1575
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,640
Are you tougher than that?

1576
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,640
I don't think so.

1577
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,400
Are you like me?

1578
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,400
As you were doing research.

1579
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,200
I was also by the way 33 years old when I was going down.

1580
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:14,680
As you were doing research for this episode tried one of Trader Joe's new cans of wine

1581
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,040
and then woke up in the morning with a splitting headache.

1582
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,520
Well I think that says it all.

1583
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,520
We're starting it's about time we started feuds with all these other podcasts.

1584
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,520
Come at us.

1585
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,520
This is our heel turn.

1586
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,520
Yeah.

1587
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:36,280
Or my fellow Gainesvillians who picked up Mickey Mouse at grad night and threw him over

1588
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,720
the moat and got kicked out of Disneyland forever.

1589
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,720
Whoa.

1590
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,720
Too far.

1591
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,720
Too far.

1592
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,720
I'm doing the opposite thing.

1593
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,720
I'm doing the opposite thing.

1594
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,720
I'm offended sir.

1595
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,720
Get out of here.

1596
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,720
Whoa is that real?

1597
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:47,720
Yes that's real.

1598
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,720
That's wild.

1599
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,680
I've seen him around once or twice but even that's too far.

1600
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,560
What if he hurt himself?

1601
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,000
That was Gainesville High School.

1602
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
That was not P.K. Young.

1603
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Wow.

1604
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,480
And they are still banned from Disney.

1605
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,480
Really?

1606
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,480
Yes.

1607
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,480
The school in general?

1608
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,480
Yes.

1609
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,480
That's wild.

1610
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,480
Wow.

1611
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,480
Man as they should be.

1612
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,480
Yes.

1613
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,480
That's horrible.

1614
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,480
Keep it up.

1615
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,480
That is horrible.

1616
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,480
Save it for Silver Springs folks.

1617
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:16,440
Gainesville Eye go dive off a go dive through a flaming hoop into a tiny pool of water.

1618
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,440
How about that?

1619
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,440
Yeah.

1620
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,840
So what was your first memory?

1621
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,120
Do you like your first time going?

1622
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,520
How old were you when you first went on this?

1623
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,520
Do you remember?

1624
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,520
Great question.

1625
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,520
That specific time?

1626
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,360
You know what I remember?

1627
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:33,640
I remember more strongly is coming back from there and being like I'm going to recreate

1628
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,480
this entire experience in my living room.

1629
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:42,440
And so I would insist that my mom find refrigerator boxes and small cardboard boxes and I would

1630
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:47,160
spend I mean I would the living room would be taken over by me building the Nautilus

1631
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:51,720
in our living room and then cutting portholes out and putting like gelled you know gelled

1632
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,960
cellophane over them.

1633
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,960
Sure.

1634
01:15:53,960 --> 01:16:00,520
And then me going to my bathroom and being like this is your captain Nemo.

1635
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,880
And I'd be like full ahead.

1636
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,760
She turned on the sink and then like diving diving ding ding and I would do my impression

1637
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,260
of the entire ride and then I would force my little brother to sit there and listen

1638
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,260
to it.

1639
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:20,640
And that would probably be when I was oh let's say nine.

1640
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,640
Let's say nine.

1641
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,640
Even though I know I went before that.

1642
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,320
This is what my obsession became.

1643
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,800
Creating the Nautilus in my living room.

1644
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,800
Wow.

1645
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,960
Cut to the future when I started being a bad kid in Florida.

1646
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,520
I brought my death metal friend Sam Kessel and he saw it and he goes be cool if we broke

1647
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
that right.

1648
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,200
I'm like yeah totally that'd be cool.

1649
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,400
He smashed my Nautilus and my childhood.

1650
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,600
That was when my childhood ended.

1651
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,600
And the lead singer the junkie Necrophiliac smashed the Nautilus in my living room.

1652
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,400
Shout out to the junkie Necrophiliac.

1653
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,240
He didn't even do it at a concert.

1654
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,240
Thanks.

1655
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,240
He did it in my living room.

1656
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:59,360
So yeah you'd get you'd go down into the bowels of the Nautilus and the organ music would

1657
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,480
be playing and you'd hear Captain Nemo up there.

1658
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,360
I don't think you heard Ned Land or Peter Laurie whatever his character's name is.

1659
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,360
No.

1660
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,400
He might have said like but captain like but I don't think so.

1661
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:17,680
There's like a first mate who chimes in sometimes but the person doing Nemo is doing an impersonation

1662
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,000
of James Mason.

1663
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,840
He is an actor named Peter Rennaday doing a James Mason impression.

1664
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,600
Very ominous James Mason impression.

1665
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,840
It wasn't terrible but I went back and watched a ride through today and I was like oh that's

1666
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,840
not James Mason.

1667
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,840
No.

1668
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,480
Although this guy I do want to read more about him because I looked up his like filmography

1669
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,520
and like he's still alive.

1670
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,640
Like he did something for he did voices in like Nausicaa the Valley of the Wind I think

1671
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:54,840
like just a few years ago for the dubbed version and like just has an insane voice acting.

1672
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:00,160
The sort of career that is surely dying in the current new media landscape where it's

1673
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,820
like oh clear this guy did a lot of additional voices or small characters but clearly this

1674
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:08,000
is how he made his living for years and years.

1675
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,800
And we would probably never be able to have those careers now.

1676
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,840
You don't think so?

1677
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,160
You don't think this VO is having problems?

1678
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:21,480
Well I think it'll always be needed but I feel like every now and then I read articles

1679
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:28,720
about like you know Brad Pitt does lead voice of like movie stars doing like the main.

1680
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,720
Character actors are gone.

1681
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,440
Yeah like Ches McNeals are like fallen.

1682
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,040
There's less and less of them sort of thing.

1683
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:39,440
That might be true but there's also there's still video games and oh that's true yeah

1684
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:44,600
so I guess like new opportunities arise so but yeah this guy seemed like he had a very

1685
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,200
cool career a very long storied career.

1686
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,200
Fooled me I thought it was Captain Nemo.

1687
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:56,800
So you see you would you know you the submarine was going straight it never actually submerged

1688
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,880
but it was but what they would do is they would shoot bubbles at a at a at a diagonal

1689
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,520
angle so it felt like you were going down diagonally and it would happen at a convenient

1690
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,960
time right when you'd pass by a you know a reef or something and then you would it would

1691
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,440
get like a little darker and and you know what's funny is that I never I never realized

1692
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,880
this until this was another sort of end of childhood moment when I this is the first

1693
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,240
snark in my life when somebody goes that right it's pretty fake I'm like what are you talking

1694
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,600
about no it's not it's enormous and there's like fish and all kinds of stuff and you can

1695
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:29,600
see all the way into the horizon they go yeah just look up like six inches you can see the

1696
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,560
surface of the water and I was like oh no and from that point on I couldn't help but

1697
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,200
to look up and you would see the surface of the water a foot above you but when I was

1698
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,320
little I did not have that feeling and you would just you look and there'd be like tons

1699
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,200
of amazing animatronics there's an animatronic grouper and and then as you as you would go

1700
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:53,560
into the waterfall which where you dive again into the abyss they would have like those

1701
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:59,120
light up glowing you know creatures from the bottom of the ocean and then you discovered

1702
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:05,200
Atlantis which I always thought was exciting that we did we did it what's in the Atlantis

1703
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:12,960
part it's just like really cool looking statues like huge statues of like people's faces and

1704
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,800
but they're all crumbled but what's cool is is that there's like lava all around it so

1705
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:21,520
like the ground is lit up and glowing red and there's bubbles coming out of it so there's

1706
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,240
like these ruins that are inside an underwater volcano and but there's also it's like rumbling

1707
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:30,880
and it seems like the rumbles is coming from outside then then a volcano starts to erupt

1708
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,720
so they're like let's get out of here and then you get out of there and then you see

1709
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:39,680
another one of another nautilus which is nice because I was like oh good they're calling

1710
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,560
out the fact that there are multiple of these because I saw multiple right right outside

1711
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:50,360
so there's a lot of these things so like oh no it's one of ours been crushed like an egg

1712
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:55,160
shell and I thought that that was like a very disturbing descriptive yeah yeah and so I

1713
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:59,480
had bubbles coming out of it and like it's like electricity is making the windows shock

1714
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,680
and you can hear it's sort of like sinking and you can hear like metal twisting and like

1715
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:09,560
oh shit right then reveal the squid which then attacks your nautilus right and there's

1716
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:13,440
like electricity that shoots out and then the squid gets away and then you barely make

1717
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:18,900
it out and then they they come up to the surface and they're like wow we did it congratulations

1718
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:25,080
crew yeah you escaped I guess yeah you made it also at some point you see

1719
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:33,600
mermaids and a sea serpent and like the the first mate like calls it out and so like Atlantis

1720
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:40,080
all of this stuff going on Nemo's fine with that but then he goes like sea serpents mermaids

1721
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:47,520
you must be losing your mind Mr. Baxter of course for the real heads out there for the

1722
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,520
real theme park heads out there Mr. Baxter is the name of the first mate or the crew

1723
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:57,800
member reference to Tony Baxter this was one of his first jobs he designed this right do

1724
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,800
you know that well they they used a lot of the original submarine voyage but then he

1725
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:12,240
was like one of the lead imagineers on like 20,000 to find it for Florida and from what

1726
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:18,480
I could tell seemed you know we've we've speculated in the past about like he didn't seem very

1727
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:24,040
happy about like certain decision and it seemed like this was a thing that really wrangled

1728
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:29,720
some imagineers the what happened with this ride in the Anaheim version in terms of closures

1729
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:36,360
and like in Anaheim's case laying dormant for so long both of them yeah yeah yeah long

1730
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:41,400
stretches I have in my note on my notes on my phone that like to make sure to mention

1731
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:46,560
the sea serpent mermaid part because I always felt that that joke fell flat because it was

1732
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:52,000
like they'd spell all you're you're in a situation where this captain is high status and he's

1733
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,240
like pointing stuff out and then all of a sudden he's like what there's no such thing

1734
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,120
as a sea serpent or mermaid and they're right in front of you and the sea serpents eyes

1735
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:06,920
like like googly and it's a mermaid to have this on a leash I'm like a pearl so they have

1736
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,960
like a hierarchy they have like smiling and everybody's having a good time and then it's

1737
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:16,600
like this long pause it's sort of like this is a snarky thing to say it's sort of like

1738
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,760
when you know you go to an improv show and somebody's wearing a funny t-shirt you know

1739
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,880
what I mean yeah no you know it's sort of like it's a hat on a hat or it's like a thing

1740
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:30,280
it's like you will do anything for a laugh like it just seems like such like a slow comedy

1741
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:36,880
you want to play shirt or my opinion gentlemen put a collared shirt on a polo nice put on

1742
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,160
at oxford roll up your sleeves to make a little bit of an effort were you going out for a

1743
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:44,880
nice show were you mad the years we've done improv together that I never wore a collared

1744
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:50,960
shirt on stage not really no I guess it was more a goal I had for myself more of like

1745
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:56,360
okay were you upset that he wore shirts that I've had too many martinis no because I mean

1746
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:00,880
that's universally funny yeah I mean it's gonna you just point to it if this initial

1747
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,840
laugh and it breaks the ice and then the show is gonna be very good maybe it's more for

1748
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,160
someone with me with my odd body type where I'm like put in an effort I feel like your

1749
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:14,400
shirts always fit better on you so I care less well there's nothing odd about my 6'3

1750
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:24,120
gangly body type no do you seems nice to me but you you because you coach teams or then

1751
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:29,440
you do you give this advice or will you start to gentlemen put in an effort ladies wear

1752
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:39,160
a gown no well I think ladies have at heart I think like a lot of women I know who said

1753
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,200
like when improvising they usually just wear pants because you never know if you're gonna

1754
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:47,560
be flopping around we were told in the 101 the ladies were told like do not wear a dress

1755
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,960
or a skirt ever so that is the thing they say I they never yelled at anyone about their

1756
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:59,400
I think it's very odd when like college groups where like business casual like who are like

1757
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:05,120
sure dresses and khakis with tucked in shirt like look very you know like they're at a

1758
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:10,120
mixer like a networking event for whatever industry ales improv team right they do they

1759
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:15,600
do a whole thing yeah that or like other colleges do like matching t-shirts and I think I mean

1760
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:25,720
they that's just dorky I mean I mean like come on what I'm doing mine had mine yeah

1761
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:30,720
we were matching and it was like a really was a very busy logos for so for like 17 of

1762
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:37,240
those to be darting around the stage it was it was far too much yeah so no matching sure

1763
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:42,600
we're laying down improv it's also like well people are coming right from work or have

1764
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,520
like other stuff to do I don't really care but if it's like especially if it's like a

1765
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:51,120
sold out shut like show show like then we're so nice for something nice put a little effort

1766
01:25:51,120 --> 01:26:01,400
tucks in your car yeah theater so so I you probably you probably researched this as well

1767
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:07,840
but I just found out what happened to the Nautilus is these things that were so important

1768
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:13,480
to me kind of scattered to the wind yeah they just chopped them all up except for three

1769
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:17,520
to you they just chopped them up they sold them for scrap they just didn't do anything

1770
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:23,640
with them yeah two of them they sunk off the coast of one of Disney's Bermuda resorts the

1771
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:30,000
castaway cave island that is the island the Disney owns an island and one of them according

1772
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,160
to this the bit we probably watched the same video hurricane took it away yeah might be

1773
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:39,080
gone gone forever it seems like one is still in this northling area and then another used

1774
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:47,080
to live in Hollywood studios MGM studios in the like the graveyard sort of where they

1775
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:51,760
say like this is how you do miniature ship waves yes yeah there was a Nautilus he would

1776
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,920
just walk by submerged in the water there oh but with that thing where you would put

1777
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:02,200
on a like the guy in a yellow rain jumper and they'd film a scene like he's caught in

1778
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,840
the high seas or kind of would love to see that yeah or like a full video or if like

1779
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,120
if your dad had done that and you could get video of it or something yeah you're gonna

1780
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:16,440
write on the honey I shrunk the kids be oh yeah we just were talking about how I hate

1781
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:21,480
that be that is another thing I'm scared of is that be from that movie it's an intense

1782
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:27,360
be I was very scared of the idea of being picked out of a crowd to do that stuff yeah

1783
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,920
that was my neurotic thing of like I can't I don't want to please please please please

1784
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,360
don't make me shake hands with SMO even though they would never do it for the kid who doesn't

1785
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:40,320
want it because there's a zillion kids who do they know it'll like flail and bomb out

1786
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:46,720
if the kids not into it yeah did anybody ever did you do one of those things ever any volunteer

1787
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,200
my brother would volunteer for all of them and be picked for all of them I would hide

1788
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:56,520
I would just take a step behind someone I was so scared of the idea I did what oh which

1789
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:04,840
do you do Hercules and Zina Universal Studios oh yeah yeah so it was all green screen showing

1790
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:12,420
how they would do it and it was like they needed like a tall like it was because they

1791
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,880
wanted different sized heights so they needed a tall man an average-sized woman and like

1792
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,560
a child especially like a shorter child so it could be like kind of different heights

1793
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:30,960
and then they gave us like a wig and like a chest pea and we were like what is it called

1794
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:36,880
when it's a man up top and a creature down below and Centaur yeah Centaur we were Centaur

1795
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:43,240
so like like they would show foot and it was like we were putting pretty much just like

1796
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:51,560
put in this and put in these outfits and left that and then taken backstage and then like

1797
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,680
put in front of a green screen and like they're like all right you're just gonna just wave

1798
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:00,100
just wait hold up these crossbows and wave and like and then at the end they combined

1799
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:05,400
it all together and send us back out and it's like Hercules fighting or Zina fighting and

1800
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:11,360
then like someone sneaks up behind them and then like that bad guy gets like a bunch of

1801
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:17,320
arrows in them and then it cuts to us like as Centaur's waving like hello we did that

1802
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:24,640
we murdered that creature and I think that was it they like said thank you for doing

1803
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:29,640
it and sent us back to our families and loved ones we didn't get any perks like I don't

1804
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:35,480
remember any DVD or no tape yeah didn't get a tape like an offer to buy a tape no I'm

1805
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,120
sure we would have done that okay and this I think like I felt like I probably would

1806
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:43,420
have been in like fifth or sixth grade and had done a couple school plays and I was like

1807
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:50,560
okay I can do this now that's when you learn that's when you got the bug that's what I

1808
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,960
got yeah that's what I got this is one of the many diseases that affect our body yeah

1809
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:59,880
well so there's no there's no video this is no unfortunately well there's only one way

1810
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:06,120
to see it which is fan art if anyone would like to draw Jason is a friendly Centaur I

1811
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:13,200
love to see it sure sure and we're wearing a nice shirt how about that yeah the buff

1812
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:22,280
no nice shirt at least just like a polo shirt if nothing else yeah alright we haven't had

1813
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:27,240
a request in a while the the so I'm looking yeah so like the Nautilus you're talking because

1814
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:31,000
they don't the original Nautilus are not in these other parks but they are they do have

1815
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:38,840
a presence in Japan and Paris there's a Nautilus parked in Tokyo Disney Sea and there is a

1816
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:43,780
a ride yeah but it's very different right it's like 20,000 leagues under the sea I

1817
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:48,280
watch it I will not watch it because I will not be spoiled by Japan can I talk about the

1818
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:52,800
mechanics of it it's different ok well this happens because I don't want anything spoiled

1819
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:57,940
for me okay alright hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold

1820
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:04,080
on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold

1821
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:08,280
I'll refrain from one thing, but I'll talk about one or two other things.

1822
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,680
Use very coded language, okay?

1823
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,680
Okay.

1824
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:15,440
So, there's a certain control element.

1825
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,080
I'm not going to get into that.

1826
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,080
Okay.

1827
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,360
But the track is above you.

1828
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:21,360
Okay.

1829
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,360
I like where this is going.

1830
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,000
This is not in specific yet.

1831
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
The window panes.

1832
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,360
Oh, this is going to be a spoiler, I think.

1833
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,320
I don't know how to say this.

1834
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,320
It's not a submersible.

1835
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:36,320
I mean, like the others, the Nautilus is technically where not summer is.

1836
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,240
They were just modified glass bottom.

1837
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,160
I'm not going to talk about it.

1838
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:45,560
If anyone wants to know, there's a million ride throughs of the journey.

1839
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:49,320
The 20,000 leagues ride in Disney Sea.

1840
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,480
It's very neat.

1841
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:55,640
Clearly, there's a reason this one has stuck around longer.

1842
01:31:55,640 --> 01:32:04,480
Let's just say millions of gallons of water, a lot less water than 11.5 million gallons

1843
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,800
of water are used every day on this ride.

1844
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,160
I guess we'll just leave it there, right?

1845
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:13,600
Is there any other ways you guys can describe this without spoiling it for Mike?

1846
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,200
I want to say this, and this is not a spoiler, and this might not even be anything anyone

1847
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,840
agrees with, but after watching the ride through, I wrote down in my notes, I think this ride's

1848
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,880
a little like the ET adventure.

1849
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,160
I think there's a little bit of magic, and there's critters.

1850
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,200
I don't want to say much beyond that, but I think you're going to be delighted by this

1851
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,200
thing.

1852
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,000
I've been avoiding spoilers about the journey to the center of the Earth ride.

1853
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Me too.

1854
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,760
I've never seen the creature in that.

1855
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:41,120
I had no idea there was a 20,000 leagues ride there, and it looks so great.

1856
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,360
I really wish we had it here.

1857
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,240
Did you watch a video this year?

1858
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,720
I actually held back on watching the journey to the center of the Earth because I'm like,

1859
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:51,480
maybe I'll go and I want to see what it's like, but I immediately watched the 20,000

1860
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:54,120
leagues I'm going to see today, and it looks fantastic.

1861
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,160
Isn't this a near ride?

1862
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:01,440
All of that mysterious island part of that park, which that's an interesting Jules Verne

1863
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,480
thing that I don't think I realized.

1864
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,960
Nemo shows up.

1865
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,400
The mysterious island is the name of where he docks the knot.

1866
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,360
That's his island.

1867
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:17,080
That was a sequel to 20,000 leagues when it was originally serialized in French literary

1868
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,620
magazines.

1869
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:22,320
I believe that there's a Harryhausen movie about the mysterious island.

1870
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,320
I think you're right.

1871
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,320
Yeah.

1872
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,320
Oh, oh, very cool.

1873
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:30,640
Which would be another take on Nemo.

1874
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:35,880
As I grew, as I went from a boy and became a man, and I moved out here to Los Angeles,

1875
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,920
and I started working in the entertainment industry, eventually I got to a point where

1876
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:46,280
I was a production supervisor on a Coca-Cola commercial shooting at Disneyland.

1877
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:51,880
That's the first time I'd ever been backstage at Disneyland, which there's a lot of... That's

1878
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,240
another whole thing I could tell you guys about, but I won't.

1879
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:59,620
At the end of the day, after the end of a very long day, we went into what is now Star

1880
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:02,400
Wars, what will be Star Wars land.

1881
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,400
Is that what they call it?

1882
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,400
They call it-

1883
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,840
Well, Galaxy's Edge is what they call it.

1884
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,960
Which is now, which just will be Galaxy's Edge, but what used to be a place where there

1885
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:14,720
are a million potted plants, because that's where they would put the plants that they

1886
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,640
would replace the dying plants with.

1887
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:21,920
It was a big, like a big green rental shop, like a Hollywood green rental shop is what

1888
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,080
it looked like back there.

1889
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:34,120
Up on a trailer, which was clearly designed to move it away, was a full Nautilus ride

1890
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,120
cart.

1891
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,120
Wow.

1892
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:40,880
I got out of my truck, and I walked over to it by myself, everyone had left, and I put

1893
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,040
my hand on it.

1894
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,960
I just sat there, and I said goodbye.

1895
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:45,960
Oh, man.

1896
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:46,960
Wow.

1897
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,280
Oh, I didn't know there'd be such an arc to this episode.

1898
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,280
There really is.

1899
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,280
Wow, that's nice.

1900
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:57,320
And that's fitting, because that was the section of land that was once earmarked to be Discovery

1901
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,320
Bay.

1902
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,320
Oh, that's right.

1903
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:04,160
Tony Baxter's idea for a full Jules Verne kind of land.

1904
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,160
Right.

1905
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:11,360
And a lot of those ideas, if I understand correctly, were altered and became current.

1906
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:17,520
In Paris, yeah, a lot of the designs used in Paris, of course, scaled back because of

1907
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,680
money reasons, and then used in different forms in Tokyo Disney Sea.

1908
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:23,680
Yeah.

1909
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,640
Which is, some people say, the best amusement park in the world currently.

1910
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:27,640
Is that right?

1911
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,640
That's what we hear.

1912
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,640
Yeah, that's what people say.

1913
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,080
We've tried to avoid even doing all this.

1914
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:36,240
We've tried to not hear a ton, and we're all trying to make it soon in various guises,

1915
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,640
and we'll find out.

1916
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,640
Wow.

1917
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,640
Yeah.

1918
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:46,640
So it is cool that that area, probably of all the unbuilt Disney things, Discovery Bay

1919
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:52,080
has this particular allure, and it's cool that some of it was implemented there.

1920
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:58,040
It's... I've done a lot of shitting on Disneyland Paris, but I'd say the most successful part

1921
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,980
of it is Discoveryland, which takes cues from this.

1922
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:06,320
It's got this, the big airship, which is from one of these books.

1923
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:10,400
It's from an HG Wells or a Jules Verne, and it's not coming to me, and I apologize.

1924
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,400
But that would have been a big... It's not a fog balloon.

1925
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,400
Does it do anything?

1926
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,400
It moves a little bit, doesn't it?

1927
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,180
Or is it just sitting there sticking out of the building?

1928
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:25,560
It just sits there, but it's this big dynamic showpiece that lures you into the building,

1929
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:30,680
and Discovery Bay, or I'm sorry, Discoveryland at Disneyland Paris, has a nautilus walkthrough,

1930
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,240
which is very neat.

1931
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:38,560
And there's a clever thing happening there where there's a little body of water, a tiny

1932
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:43,280
little lake, and the nautilus is sticking out of it, and cool rock work all around,

1933
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,920
Disney rock work.

1934
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,680
And then you... So you go into the actual nautilus, but it leads you into this show

1935
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:53,800
building that is somewhere else, because unlike the vehicles on this 20,000 Leagues ride,

1936
01:36:53,800 --> 01:37:00,160
it has room for the organ room and a porthole with the squid, and it's a really well done

1937
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,160
squid.

1938
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,480
So it's very neat to walk through.

1939
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,000
There's an odd amount of walkthroughs at Disneyland Paris, and some of them are very cool, and

1940
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,120
this one's very successful.

1941
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:16,540
I think that too was inspired by... Right after the movie came out, they needed a way

1942
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:23,080
to add some life to the original Tomorrowland in Anaheim, so they put in a lot of the sets

1943
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:27,240
and stuff from 20,000 Leagues, and just an immediate hit.

1944
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,880
Just like even though it was just a walkthrough, the movie was a big hit.

1945
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,960
So people were psyched to see all that stuff, and the organ that was in that walkthrough

1946
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:39,200
was repurposed for the Haunted Mansion in Anaheim.

1947
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,200
That's right.

1948
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,200
I just learned that too the other day.

1949
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,880
So that's the organ in Anaheim, right?

1950
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,880
In the ballroom.

1951
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:45,880
Which is Captain America's dining room.

1952
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:46,880
But in the movie.

1953
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,680
It's the one James Mason plays in the movie.

1954
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,960
And then they put it in the Haunted Mansion afterwards?

1955
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,960
Yeah.

1956
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,960
I think that seems to be the path.

1957
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:59,720
Because the walkthrough in Tomorrowland opened in 55, closed in 66, where you could see the

1958
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:05,680
20,000 League sets, and Haunted Mansion opened in 69, or was being built in that whole window.

1959
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,320
So yeah, they moved the organ over.

1960
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,440
It's not the pipes.

1961
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,640
Those big fanned out pipes that are the main...

1962
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,640
The ghost commander.

1963
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:14,640
Yeah.

1964
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,880
The pipes are new to the Haunted Mansion, but the organ itself is from the 20,000 Leagues

1965
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,880
movie.

1966
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,960
If you ever want to see something funny and weird on a product of its time, there's this

1967
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:29,880
black and white sort of behind the scenes interview with Peter Lorry and James Mason,

1968
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,720
about 20,000 Leagues on the scene.

1969
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:36,120
It's like, well, let's go see if we can interview Peter, Mr. Lorry.

1970
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,120
Mr. Lorry, knock, knock, knock.

1971
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:38,120
Oh, hello.

1972
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,120
I didn't see you there.

1973
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:42,120
He comes out with a towel and he's smoking a cigarette.

1974
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,320
And he's just like, well, I had a great time working with Mr. Douglas.

1975
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,160
So it's him being Peter Lorry, but talking about this great movie that they're about

1976
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,160
to release.

1977
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,160
Wow.

1978
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:52,160
Also, can you hold these documents, Rick?

1979
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,960
Can you just hold on to this for a little while?

1980
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:00,560
You know, that is my, not to skip too far ahead, but that's one of my shortcomings of

1981
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,560
this ride.

1982
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:02,560
I want more Peter Lorry.

1983
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,560
Oh yeah.

1984
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,560
I'm a Lorry head.

1985
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:12,280
I wish Lorry had said one of my favorite lines from this ride is when Nemo describes the

1986
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:17,680
turtles that the Nautilus is going by and calls them the reptilian patriarchs of the

1987
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,680
deep.

1988
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,960
Well, when you go by those turtles, you just get hungry now.

1989
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,960
Oh yeah.

1990
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:22,960
You just think about that.

1991
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:28,760
I just call up lunch.

1992
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:37,800
My favorite part watching the film was this zone where Nemo is offered Peter Lorry and

1993
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:41,100
Kirk Douglas food and it's all, and then they're like, delicious.

1994
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,100
What is it?

1995
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:44,560
And it's all like sea items.

1996
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,280
Like that's squid ink.

1997
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:50,280
That's the sauce of sperm whale.

1998
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,960
What you are eating is sperm whale teeth.

1999
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,200
Or these cigars quite delicious.

2000
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,200
These are kelp.

2001
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,200
Yeah.

2002
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,200
Yeah.

2003
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:04,960
Lollita, we need more kelp cigars in here.

2004
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,720
It's weird when he just slips in in the ride, in the middle of the ride.

2005
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,520
It's like, you're all my precious lovelies.

2006
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,320
Like my little Lollita.

2007
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:16,920
You know, there's a kind of a cool, from like a, from like a filmmaker perspective, there's

2008
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,920
a cool suspenseful moment.

2009
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,760
When they first get in the Nautilus and they're like, whoa, this thing is crazy.

2010
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,760
This is amazing.

2011
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:28,200
And they look out the giant window and they see this underwater funeral, right?

2012
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,200
Happening.

2013
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:34,960
And then one of the scuba, Captain Nemo's scuba people looks up in like points and there's

2014
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:39,240
a special sort of suspense reserved for you're in a submarine and these people are slowly

2015
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,920
moving towards you and they see you, but there's no place for you to go.

2016
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,920
So they're just watching.

2017
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:43,920
Yeah.

2018
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,920
Yeah.

2019
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:45,920
Yeah.

2020
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,440
Which I watched, there's a really great making of this movie that's on YouTube and I assume

2021
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:56,360
it was from a DVD or something, but that was one of the big, I didn't know the book particularly,

2022
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:02,000
but supposedly the book is more a series of disconnected adventures and they, and it's

2023
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,280
very broken up by chapter and the concern turning it into a film was how do you make

2024
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,360
it a, how do you tell a bigger story?

2025
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,820
And it became like a prison escape movie.

2026
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,920
That was the big take that they had.

2027
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,920
It took like a year to serialized the novel.

2028
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,400
The release of the book.

2029
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,400
Yeah.

2030
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,400
It really was.

2031
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,400
It didn't come out as one.

2032
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,400
Yeah.

2033
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:27,320
I mean like a lot of Dickens works and, and Jules, Jules Verne's works.

2034
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,600
I think some H.E. Wells too.

2035
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,040
It was like in magazines.

2036
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,720
Oh, it came out in like newspapers or?

2037
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:33,720
Yeah.

2038
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,720
Oh wow.

2039
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:35,720
That's a fan.

2040
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:36,720
Yeah.

2041
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,720
Didn't know that.

2042
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,720
I was, I was a big fan of the book.

2043
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:42,120
I went through a big Jules Verne face and then I went through a big trying to write in the

2044
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,960
style of Jules Verne face.

2045
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:44,960
Oh boy.

2046
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,360
The English teacher was not impressed.

2047
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,440
Which what did that mean?

2048
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,800
Just very flowery descriptions.

2049
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:57,600
Oh, I was like, oh, this is the tale of the puffin, a small craft that can burrow in sand

2050
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,200
and fly, you know, whatever dumb shit.

2051
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,440
And she's like, nobody cares about that.

2052
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:04,160
We're reading, you know, I know why a cage bird sings.

2053
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:09,840
That just reminded me that I wrote a little short story in a class where I just jammed

2054
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:15,960
two of my main interests together, back to the future and sea world where I had just

2055
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:16,960
been.

2056
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:22,760
And for some reason it was a story where Shamu splashes the audience, but the water makes

2057
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,200
you travel through time.

2058
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,200
Wow.

2059
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:34,160
Why would that, so you, and you, so I guess you go back to like a, it's the sea world,

2060
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:38,920
but it's the fifties and then you need to get a new, a different Shamu to splash you

2061
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:39,920
back.

2062
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,760
Is it because of the spice that Shamu creates?

2063
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,760
I don't know about the spice.

2064
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,000
Like a worm, like a worm from dune.

2065
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,800
Is this a wait?

2066
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,160
Wait, someone fill me in.

2067
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,080
I only know the bare boat.

2068
01:42:54,080 --> 01:43:00,320
So if you know the worms of the worms of dune are these creatures that, that, I mean, I'm,

2069
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:04,560
I'm not a super dune guy, but I know that they're, they're mined for their spice, which

2070
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,960
enables you to have certain powers.

2071
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,680
And I think travel through time if you're like your mind can.

2072
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:17,880
It seems like a catch all the Captain America formula kind of where you get powers and you

2073
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:19,280
may be able to travel through time.

2074
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:25,680
And also you get super high and the whole universe is like built around like the spice.

2075
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:27,080
And don't they reveal later on though?

2076
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:30,280
Like it's, it's just, it's just worm shit.

2077
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,280
Like what?

2078
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,280
That's what the spice is?

2079
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,280
Yeah.

2080
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,520
Oh wait, the whole, wait, I've only seen the trailer.

2081
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,480
It's all about the pursuit of spice.

2082
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,480
Correct?

2083
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,280
So dune is about trying to get worm shit.

2084
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,880
I don't think they call that out in the movie.

2085
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:49,960
And there's a, the, the one it said there's a Messiah like character that Kyle McLaughlin

2086
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,720
plays that character.

2087
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:54,840
And then there's so many dune books.

2088
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,000
I don't even know.

2089
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:02,120
I have only like seen little bits of the movie and like read some, I've never read this book,

2090
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,720
but like my dad and brother have read a lot of the dude books.

2091
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:10,160
And I'm like, cause his son took it over at some point and like, they just kept going.

2092
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,400
It's sort of like the Ender's game series where it's like, Oh yeah.

2093
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:19,800
And then Ender is an adult and his evil sibling is the president of the universe.

2094
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:20,800
And it's like, what the fuck?

2095
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:21,800
What?

2096
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:26,720
I think when his son is writing it, and again, my, my wife has read all these and I haven't.

2097
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:31,240
So, but I think when his son is writing it, the one worm is like a God worm and it has

2098
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,400
the face of a human all of a sudden.

2099
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,400
Oh yeah.

2100
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,880
I see that like art.

2101
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,360
I see some horrifying like paperback art.

2102
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,760
Anyway, so there should be a dune ride.

2103
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:47,040
My Shamu, my Shamu time trial movies, the book was way better than dune.

2104
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,160
Do you have it still?

2105
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,840
I'll try to find it.

2106
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,720
That's a, there's some Patreon material.

2107
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,720
Oh yeah.

2108
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,720
Reading on the air.

2109
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:58,880
If you bring that, I will bring my, what I think is an Austin Powers parody called monkeys

2110
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,680
are forever that I wrote in seventh grade.

2111
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:10,000
And the character's name is Jack Powers as if that's even a, it's a de-hypening if you

2112
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
ask me.

2113
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,320
And he's not even that fun, but he does have a monkey as a sidekick.

2114
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:18,280
I would just make complicated lists for like alternate X-Men lineups.

2115
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,760
Oh, I have those too.

2116
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,760
Alternate teams.

2117
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:21,760
Oh, I have those too.

2118
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,760
I made X-Men lists too.

2119
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:23,760
Oh sure.

2120
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:24,760
Yeah.

2121
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:31,960
I made in fourth or fifth grade an entire, like a guide book of a parody theme park called

2122
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:32,960
OJ land.

2123
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:33,960
What the hell?

2124
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:38,960
How have we sat on this for this long?

2125
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,280
Yeah, this many hours of theme park podcast entertainment.

2126
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,280
Yeah.

2127
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:46,360
That's how obsessed I was with Disneyland even at the time.

2128
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:54,480
And also I was into the OJ trail and I like, I was really into, I thought Jay Leno was

2129
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:59,360
good and cool at the time and he did all the OJ material and it was like my attempt to

2130
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:03,600
do kind of like topical Leno type comedy.

2131
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:09,720
So and it was like, it was for a project and it was, I got an A and it was super fleshed

2132
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:10,720
out.

2133
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,240
Like I covered every ride.

2134
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:17,880
It was like as detailed as any of this shit is now that we do.

2135
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,400
And I don't remember a lot of them other than that I was very, very proud to introduce the

2136
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:26,520
3d movie spectacular captain Edo.

2137
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:31,560
Do you have this too?

2138
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,520
Oh, that one I for sure have.

2139
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,000
Finally, the shoe is on the other foot.

2140
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:45,760
Folks, artists, if you can draw captain Edo, which just for the, again, to extrapolate

2141
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:52,320
it out is a captain EO judge Lance Eto mashup.

2142
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,120
Thought of by a nine year old.

2143
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:59,080
Please for the love of God, I want to see this more than anything.

2144
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,000
Um, we did, you have to figure, I want to take it.

2145
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:09,680
I mean, for sure I want to see Edo in the costume with the rainbow shirt, uh, uh, uh,

2146
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:12,840
doing a moonwalk, but I also, and you'd have to incorporate it.

2147
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:16,800
It's also kind of a judge robe, but with like spangles all over it.

2148
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,600
But I'd also, you got to figure out which character is which, like, were there people

2149
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:26,320
who were kind of a pair who would be ID and Odie, uh, um, in, in the OJ trial.

2150
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,320
Who was a pair?

2151
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:36,600
Marsha Clark and the other guys who not Christopher Darden.

2152
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:40,000
I'm just trying to think of the cast of the mini series.

2153
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:46,920
So like Robert Kardashian, David Schwimmer and John Travolta's character could be a duo.

2154
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,400
Is OJ the witch?

2155
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:53,680
He's a, you know, makes him beautiful with dancing.

2156
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:54,680
Okay.

2157
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,800
I guess that tracks.

2158
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,800
It might not.

2159
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,800
This might not be one to one.

2160
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:05,240
A lot of this, if you follow it to its logical end, just gets horrifying.

2161
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,360
But Cato is just for certain Hooter.

2162
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,680
Oh, he's the dumb one who messes everything up.

2163
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:13,680
Captain Edo.

2164
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,200
That is clean fun right there.

2165
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,560
I'll bring it in as soon as I can.

2166
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,560
Fuzzy with the butterfly wings.

2167
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,560
What's his name?

2168
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,560
Fuzzball.

2169
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,560
Yeah.

2170
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,560
Fuzzball is a little Bronco probably.

2171
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,040
They're in the Bronco, aren't they in the spaceship?

2172
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:31,040
The Bronco?

2173
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,040
Oh, the spaceship is the Bronco.

2174
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:33,040
Yes.

2175
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:34,040
Yeah.

2176
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:35,040
So silly.

2177
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,040
We're going to have to get back to you guys on all these.

2178
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,040
We'll sort out all the math of this.

2179
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,320
This is tough to do.

2180
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:50,280
Anyway, let's take it back to from futurist author Scott Garner to futurist author Jules

2181
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,280
Moore.

2182
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,280
What have we missed?

2183
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:55,400
I mean, there's we talked the original.

2184
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:00,040
You know what I think is cool is that the original walkthrough attraction was the first,

2185
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:04,720
I believe the first attraction added to Disneyland after opening day.

2186
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:08,640
I think that's right, because there really wasn't much in Tomorrowland.

2187
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:14,640
Really nothing that we think of like the intense level of immersion that like attractions give

2188
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:15,640
you now.

2189
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:16,640
Yeah.

2190
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:20,760
Well, and I think like I don't really know the details from what I gleaned pretty quickly.

2191
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,520
OK, if you're walking into Disneyland Tomorrowland, like from the castle area on the left now

2192
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,960
is Buzz Lightyear used to be Circle Vision.

2193
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,680
On the right now is Star Tours.

2194
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:33,440
And that building was this 20,000 Leagues thing and in between Adventures Through Inner

2195
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,440
Space.

2196
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:41,320
And it seems like Walt built that build, it's still those original two buildings from 55,

2197
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:43,120
but various things have cycled in and out.

2198
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:48,620
And it seems like Walt had those buildings set up and but didn't know what was going

2199
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:49,620
to go in there.

2200
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:51,760
And it was like, I don't know, it'll be a sponsored thing.

2201
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,920
There was a lot of sponsored like exhibits and stuff that kind of rotated and stuff.

2202
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,200
Lots of like quick fix kind of stuff.

2203
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:02,240
But I think the biggest space went unfilled or something pulled out.

2204
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:06,880
And he was and somebody had the idea to swing in all of the 20,000 Leagues stuff.

2205
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,640
But the movie was a little old by that point.

2206
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,720
And I mean, just a couple of years.

2207
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:15,040
So but they had to like freshen everything up and give it all new coats of paint and

2208
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,740
the squid is falling apart.

2209
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:22,360
And supposedly the day before Disneyland opened, Walt skipped a big party to help out painting

2210
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,960
the squid to get it ready.

2211
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:25,960
That's funny.

2212
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,440
But it didn't take you at the opening.

2213
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:30,880
Until yeah, the story is confusing.

2214
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,480
And probably details of this.

2215
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:36,160
Yeah, some of this stuff can be hard to track down.

2216
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:41,880
But I think it's interesting that like all so many Jules Verne type things in the parks

2217
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:44,800
have spread out over so many decades.

2218
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:50,000
And it seemed like especially when they were closing this or they would like they they,

2219
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,180
you know, didn't end up pulling the trigger on some of the other Jules Verne based attractions

2220
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:56,720
at various parks.

2221
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:59,920
They're like, well, will people care about Jules Verne?

2222
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,240
Like do people care?

2223
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,440
And any time they do it, it's like a hit.

2224
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:05,440
People love it.

2225
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:13,080
I mean, I remember my family being like pretty disappointed when this like the Florida, you

2226
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:17,680
know, ride closed in 94 and they closed in 94.

2227
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:19,940
They're like, this is a temporary refurbishment.

2228
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:23,080
And then it just kind of sat dormant for like two years.

2229
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,100
And then they're like, yeah, it's close.

2230
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:26,100
It's done.

2231
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:27,100
It's that's it.

2232
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:32,680
And don't you feel that this is like the eternal struggle between art and commerce, I guess

2233
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:39,200
you could say, because because Jules Verne aesthetic is fits perfectly into the Disney,

2234
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:43,240
like the original Disney of my understanding, which is a sort of cartoonish darkness.

2235
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,240
Right.

2236
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:48,040
So it very perfectly hits like something that Disney generates.

2237
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:52,860
But there's no property that that latches on to that.

2238
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:57,360
So it's so you you kind of have to Disney has to have a property, especially now in

2239
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:58,880
order to to build a land.

2240
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,880
Right.

2241
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:00,880
I mean, there's no original lands anymore.

2242
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,880
Are they?

2243
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:05,360
I mean, really, every now and then there's an attraction.

2244
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:10,920
Mystic Manor comes to mind or like, yeah, some of the other towers once in a while.

2245
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:14,880
But like if you're building a new park, you can get away with something that's not a property.

2246
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,880
Although, of course, this is a property.

2247
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:22,840
But yeah, it's like it does feel like, yeah, with like as they move change, obviously change

2248
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,440
changed to Nemo out here.

2249
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:26,960
But I've heard like I think it's two parts.

2250
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:31,800
I think this is a very expensive ride to keep keep up.

2251
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:32,800
Oh, yeah.

2252
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,440
How many millions and millions of gallons of fresh water?

2253
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:40,480
Yeah, they say Tony Baxter famously saved the one out here from from going away because

2254
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,320
they made it Nemo so they could justify it by adding the property to it.

2255
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:47,240
So yeah, I feel like, yeah, it's it doesn't have a current property.

2256
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:50,480
And in addition, it's like the most expensive ride to run in the park.

2257
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:54,080
So they're like, yeah, this is an easy one we can say, no, let's get rid of it.

2258
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:59,520
It's crazy looking back on recent history that like because the Florida one was even

2259
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,520
bigger.

2260
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:04,480
So that one I read was eleven point five gallons a day.

2261
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,200
The one out here is like nine million gallons a day.

2262
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:11,640
And that was operating during California's multi year drought.

2263
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:19,180
I mean, I think they had to pay a ton of extra money to use that much water.

2264
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:23,120
And then also like the state and the city cut Disney a lot of breaks.

2265
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:26,840
They also I mean, they tried so many weird things to keep it going.

2266
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,720
You can't blame them for because they did try.

2267
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:34,000
They had human beings that they made dressed in mermaid suits that would sit on a rock

2268
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,240
in the sun for hours.

2269
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,840
They tried real fish at one point.

2270
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,840
They tried.

2271
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,020
They tried a lot of different things.

2272
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,280
So I'll hand it to them.

2273
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:44,280
I'm not furious with them for tearing it out.

2274
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:48,100
It sounds like if they had done the Tokyo Disney version, which again, thank you for

2275
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:52,000
being very general when you describe it, it feels like that one would last because everyone

2276
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,600
it seems like it's much even like more immersive and crazy and like and they got to build it

2277
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:03,560
in the 2000s as opposed to its clunky, weird fifties or seventies technology that's already

2278
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:06,680
not trustworthy and pumping water through it.

2279
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:10,880
And they figured out a way to put a lot more people per hour into it.

2280
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,520
Just a lot more people.

2281
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,960
This doesn't eat up a lot of people.

2282
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:19,120
So not at all handicap accessible.

2283
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,480
Like you have to go down a narrow stairway.

2284
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,640
They said a family member has to carry you down.

2285
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,600
That was the only option.

2286
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:30,520
I think one either Anaheim or Florida, one of them had like a video room where you would

2287
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:34,440
see a video of like what they would be seeing.

2288
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:41,520
So like it was so an alternate experience that inspired a joke in the fake ride opening

2289
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:46,480
that I made at Funny or Die, where if you couldn't go on this, if you weren't, if you

2290
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:51,200
were handicapped, that you'd go into a tent and a Navajo storyteller would describe the

2291
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:52,200
ride to you.

2292
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:58,600
Because I was like, what a lay you watch like a fake version of it in a little room and

2293
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,600
you're not underwater.

2294
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,640
I appreciate the effort.

2295
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:03,520
I like that they tried.

2296
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,460
There's also the wild card experience.

2297
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:10,520
Like what happened to my, I won't name any names, but a friend of mine, his son was,

2298
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:16,480
let's say eight, and his son was like, I'm so, he was a very, he was a very nervous kid.

2299
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,120
And he's like, dad, I don't want to go on this thing.

2300
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,120
I'm so scared.

2301
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:21,240
And you know, it's hard being a parent.

2302
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:24,640
You just try to be successful more often than you make mistakes.

2303
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:25,840
And he's like, you know what?

2304
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:29,760
I'm just going to force my kid to go and he's going to see that everything is fine.

2305
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:33,600
He's going to see that it wasn't that bad and in life and you worried about things and

2306
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,200
you, and you just, you commit anyway, you're going to realize that you're stronger for

2307
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,200
it.

2308
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,840
And he went down into the Disneyland submarine ride with his son.

2309
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:47,560
And as soon as the ride started moving, his son threw up and diarrhea all over himself

2310
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:52,040
and screamed and had a panic attack and they were trapped in it for the entire ride.

2311
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:53,840
Oh wait, yeah, there's no way to go backwards.

2312
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,240
So that sort of situation happens what?

2313
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:57,240
Once every month.

2314
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,160
Cause everything happens just by rule of numbers.

2315
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,160
Yeah.

2316
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,160
Yeah.

2317
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:04,160
Also clumsy children must've fallen down these narrow stairways.

2318
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:07,360
Just a straight, because you had to climb down a ladder.

2319
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,360
Yeah.

2320
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,360
Yeah.

2321
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,920
And this thin little child sized openings where you could just fall straight to the

2322
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:13,920
bottom.

2323
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:14,920
Yeah.

2324
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:18,640
But most of, wait, you probably know what one out of 10 friends that would be incredibly

2325
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:19,720
claustrophobic, right?

2326
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:26,120
This is you in a tin can with that very distinctive Disney motor sound that has that weird Disney

2327
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:27,320
motor smell.

2328
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,720
And then there's, there's water with chlorine.

2329
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:35,320
Even if they didn't know they were claustrophobic, they might find out they were on this ride.

2330
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,320
Yeah.

2331
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,600
And then there's this discovery of Jules Verne.

2332
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:43,240
It sounds like I dodged a bullet by lying and saying I had to pee.

2333
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:46,680
I think this kid is a window into Mike's future.

2334
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,680
Oh my God.

2335
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:48,680
My past, my potential past.

2336
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:52,680
And once they had a young me, it was like, yeah, this ride rules.

2337
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,680
I was going, yeah.

2338
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:54,680
The coolest kid.

2339
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:55,680
The coolest kid.

2340
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,680
Jason was the coolest of the three of us.

2341
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:58,680
We're very impressed.

2342
01:56:58,680 --> 01:56:59,680
Going up.

2343
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,680
Alright, alright.

2344
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,680
Roller coasters.

2345
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:04,680
And trying hummus before, by a decade, trying it before me.

2346
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:05,680
Yeah, I was on the hummus tip.

2347
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:06,680
It was culturally acceptable.

2348
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:12,800
A fun thing I read, I didn't even realize this, is that in the queue of the Little Mermaid

2349
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:17,040
in Florida, they play an instrumental whale of a tail as tribute because that's where

2350
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,040
the ride was.

2351
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,040
Oh yeah.

2352
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,040
So that's a nice little thing.

2353
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,040
That's nice.

2354
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:25,280
I heard that there's, they put some of the water from 20,000 leagues into that, into

2355
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:26,780
the line or something.

2356
01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:30,560
So when you see that water, no, some of it was, I don't know.

2357
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:31,560
Okay.

2358
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:32,560
That's not quite as obvious.

2359
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:37,120
It's like when the kids of the world poured their respective waters into the small world.

2360
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,120
Right?

2361
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:39,120
Oh, that's right.

2362
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,120
Yeah, yeah.

2363
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,120
There's always things like that.

2364
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,320
Children, do you have the waters?

2365
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:44,320
Yes.

2366
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:50,640
You travel, you've brought glass jugs full of raw water from their respective countries.

2367
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:53,960
Or when Kiss put their blood in the ink of their comic book.

2368
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:54,960
Oh yeah.

2369
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,960
Or Mark.

2370
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:56,960
That's true.

2371
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,720
And don't forget Mark Grunwald.

2372
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:00,720
His Ashes.

2373
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:04,120
Grunwald was a Cat in America writer and editor.

2374
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:08,120
And when he died, he was cremated and they mixed his ashes in with the comic.

2375
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:09,120
They reprinted.

2376
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,120
Yeah.

2377
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:11,120
So there you go.

2378
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:12,400
It's all the same thing.

2379
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,880
Micah, did you hold on to any of your pee as an eight year old?

2380
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:18,520
Is there anything you could include it in?

2381
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,600
No, I don't have any of my pee.

2382
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:21,600
That's too bad.

2383
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:26,040
There's no way to harden it and turn it into furniture.

2384
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:29,320
Some funny details about what happened to this.

2385
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:34,840
Yeah, a new fantasy land, I think, between the Little Mermaid Ride and the Seven Dwarfs

2386
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:38,920
Mine coaster, I think, lies on top of this now.

2387
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:42,480
For a little while, they just kind of made a character meet and greet called Ariel's

2388
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:43,480
Grotto.

2389
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:44,480
Yeah.

2390
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:51,360
And then also some of the property was turned into a playground called Pooh's Playful Corner.

2391
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:52,360
Is that right?

2392
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,360
Yes.

2393
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:54,360
No, Pooh's Playful Spot.

2394
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,360
Oh.

2395
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,360
Pooh's Playful Spot.

2396
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:58,240
And it was for kids two to five.

2397
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,240
Right.

2398
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:03,920
So yeah, just kind of like a pretty barren part of the park for a long time.

2399
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,920
Embarrassed.

2400
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:08,080
Let us know if you went and enjoyed Pooh's Playful Spot.

2401
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:12,120
Look for our upcoming Pooh's Playful Spot episode.

2402
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:16,280
Two and a half hours of Pooh's Playful Spot.

2403
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:19,280
What did you touch in Pooh's Playful Spot 3?

2404
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:20,280
Horizons, Pawnee Mansion, Pooh's Playful Spot.

2405
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:24,520
Of course, Scott and I, as eight year olds, are too afraid of Pooh's Playful Spot, so

2406
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,080
we did not play there.

2407
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,480
We were too afraid.

2408
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:28,480
We made the right call.

2409
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:33,560
I would put on a leather jacket and chew candy cigarettes and hit the jukebox in Pooh's Playful

2410
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:34,560
Spot.

2411
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,560
And much like that monkey, you would get a cigarette after learn.

2412
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,560
Yeah, that was a good boy.

2413
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:38,560
I got a cigarette.

2414
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:46,460
You know, I went to Disney World for the first time in 20 years last year, and I didn't realize

2415
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:49,920
that that whole new area used to be 20,000 leagues under the sea, right?

2416
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:50,920
With the Snow White.

2417
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:51,920
Snow White.

2418
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:52,920
Right.

2419
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:53,920
Which looks cool.

2420
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,720
And then Pooh's Playful Spot.

2421
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:57,200
And then the circus area.

2422
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,200
Yes.

2423
01:59:58,200 --> 01:59:59,200
That Dumbo Circus.

2424
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:00,200
Dumbo Circus area.

2425
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:01,200
Sure.

2426
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:04,680
When I sort of stumbled into that in Ariel's Grotto, so it's there, but there's nothing

2427
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:05,680
to do.

2428
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,240
There's just like a fountain, I think, that's there.

2429
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,680
Well, they built a big little mermaid ride.

2430
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:11,280
Oh, it just arrived there.

2431
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,840
Because I saw it at the end of the day as we were going with my kids.

2432
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:19,160
And it was then that I realized walking through that area, I was like, okay, so Disney World

2433
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:22,520
is now officially too big to do in a day.

2434
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,200
You can't even see everything in a day.

2435
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,920
Because I happened on that area and I was like, oh, shit.

2436
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:27,920
Oh, yeah.

2437
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:28,920
It's a highland.

2438
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:29,920
Highlands.

2439
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:30,920
And they're like, it's far away.

2440
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:31,920
It's up in the north end of the park.

2441
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,400
So you can miss it entirely.

2442
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:34,400
Yeah.

2443
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:38,720
That's a big, big difference between the Magic Kingdom and Florida and the Magic Kingdom.

2444
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:44,320
Disney classic Disneyland Park out here is like, two, the pathways are a lot wider in

2445
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:47,760
Florida and everything is farther away.

2446
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,000
Like here it's pretty easy to crisscross Disneyland.

2447
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,200
I mean, you're still going to walk a lot, but in Florida, man, stuff is really far away

2448
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,200
comparably.

2449
02:00:56,200 --> 02:01:01,440
We used to always say, never having gone to Disneyland, you know, Disneyland could fit

2450
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,360
in the parking lot of Disney World.

2451
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:05,720
That doesn't make any sense.

2452
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,320
Disney World's parking lot is enormous.

2453
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,840
It's bigger than the LA County tear job.

2454
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,160
And transportation center?

2455
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:12,160
Are you kidding me?

2456
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:14,920
What a huge footprint that is.

2457
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:16,560
As a side note, you guys may appreciate this.

2458
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,360
When we went to Disney World last year, we stayed in Fort Wilderness where I had stayed

2459
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:22,560
when I was a little kid in a tent.

2460
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,120
That's where you used to be able to do that.

2461
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:29,040
I think you still can, but back then it was like a wilderness, you know, campfire and

2462
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:32,480
you pitch your tent and it's like the wilderness.

2463
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:41,080
And then we took a bus to a very small boat and the boat went through three lakes before

2464
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:43,480
we got to the main lake, which got us to Disney World.

2465
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:44,480
It was incredible.

2466
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,280
That place is so insanely huge.

2467
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:49,080
All that stuff, all the water sports and everything.

2468
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,440
You forget about all that.

2469
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:51,720
There's so much going on.

2470
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:54,680
It is really fun.

2471
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:59,680
The Polynesian, the contemporary, Grand Floridia, I think everyone thinks of, but Fort Wilderness

2472
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:00,680
and the Wilderness Lodge.

2473
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:06,400
It is cool to stay there and just take the boat over because the boats are definitely

2474
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:11,200
more efficient than the buses and a lot of times a lot more efficient than the monorails.

2475
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:12,200
It's super fun.

2476
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,280
They give you one of those bracelets.

2477
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:17,800
So your cabin, you just put your bracelet in there and the cabin opens, which is cool.

2478
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:23,400
And then you take the boat by, I think at least two islands that used to be attractions

2479
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,120
and now are overrun and abandoned.

2480
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:29,400
So you're just going by what is obviously an abandoned attraction and now is sort of

2481
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:34,040
a spooky looking island on your way to the, you don't see the Grand Floridian.

2482
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,840
You don't go that far because that's on the total other side of the.

2483
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:37,840
No, yeah.

2484
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,480
You would hit the Magic Kingdom before you got there.

2485
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:40,480
So yeah.

2486
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:42,740
Oh, another random factoid.

2487
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:48,160
When I was very little, when we were in the ferry to get to Disney World, we got in a

2488
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:49,160
crash.

2489
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,840
The ferry hit the dock.

2490
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,240
It was a major crash.

2491
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:54,840
Every person was thrown to the floor.

2492
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,800
I was a, my brother was an infant and he was tossed in the flu in the air.

2493
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,280
I mean, it was like a major crash.

2494
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:01,280
Wow.

2495
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,960
You didn't land in the lake, right?

2496
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,460
There's gators in that lake.

2497
02:03:04,460 --> 02:03:08,720
One of my brothers did and he's not with us anymore because once you land in that, once

2498
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:11,280
you set foot in that water, you're gone.

2499
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:12,280
You just like evaporate?

2500
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:14,320
I was so teeming with alligators that like.

2501
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:16,200
You were just every square foot.

2502
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,200
Boiling the reptiles.

2503
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:20,200
I'm so dedicated to this podcast.

2504
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:21,200
It's memory.

2505
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:23,520
It's crazy to look at.

2506
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:24,840
There's so much of it online.

2507
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:31,320
The original like promotional materials of like the resort, resort part of the Florida

2508
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:36,680
parks and there's so many pictures of people swimming in that water, sunbathing in that

2509
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:37,680
water.

2510
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:38,920
It's just like, well, what's it called?

2511
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:41,840
What's the, the, the water park near Fort Wilderness?

2512
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,600
I used to go river country.

2513
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:49,280
USA used to be, if memory serves, it used to be like lake water.

2514
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,280
Fresh water.

2515
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:51,280
Yeah.

2516
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:52,280
I remember.

2517
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,280
I remember being like, fresh.

2518
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:54,520
Now this is a water slide.

2519
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:56,280
If the water is brown, you know, it's good.

2520
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:58,400
I remember the water being brown.

2521
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:02,400
We're all getting ear aches today, fellas.

2522
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:07,480
Well, speaking of disgusting water, let's, let's go back around to this ride and we,

2523
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:08,720
and it's, you know, it's gone.

2524
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:13,760
So there's no way to plus it up, but almost was burnt to the ground for insurance money.

2525
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:19,600
But is there anything we, anything that could have been done to save this thing?

2526
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,760
Any, any great ideas that you think would have made it worth it for them to keep it

2527
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:24,760
around?

2528
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:25,760
Hmm.

2529
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:26,760
Yeah.

2530
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,360
I mean, at the time it was done in what 94.

2531
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:29,360
It was just sitting there.

2532
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:33,340
It just kind of, yeah, we haven't really said it just kind of like, did they close it for

2533
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:36,120
refurbishment and like, it'll open back up and it just never did.

2534
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:39,000
It sat there and I remember going during that time and being confused.

2535
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Like, is that open or closed or not?

2536
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
And I don't think they knew.

2537
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
And then it was a language.

2538
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Yeah.

2539
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,600
That used to happen when you couldn't just double check stuff on your phone immediately.

2540
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,480
Oh wait, is it open?

2541
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:50,480
Is it closed?

2542
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:51,480
Is something new coming?

2543
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:53,080
This was also, I'm sorry.

2544
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:57,760
They posted a like, you know, clothes for refurbishment sign with a very adorable octopus

2545
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:02,080
with like a, a like painting with a little paint brush, like fixing it up.

2546
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,080
That's cute.

2547
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:04,080
We'll post that to the trip.

2548
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,080
Sad.

2549
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:06,480
Because he, he never finished.

2550
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,000
They fired the octopus.

2551
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
This is also the era.

2552
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,240
I feel like this is the beginning of the era of fan outrage.

2553
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:17,900
I don't mean that sounds condescending and I don't mean it too, but people being mad

2554
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:24,200
about some major decision because Toad closed in Florida soon after or around within the

2555
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:25,200
same window.

2556
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:27,320
And that's the craziest thing that they've ever done.

2557
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:28,320
I don't know.

2558
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,320
We're mad.

2559
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:31,400
And I like, that was an early, like people made shirts.

2560
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:34,520
People were there on the last huge crowds, that sort of thing.

2561
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:38,800
That really didn't happen with Nemo cause it just slowly almost faded to dust.

2562
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:42,200
Like I don't feel good, Captain Nemo.

2563
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,120
I don't want to go.

2564
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:48,400
This is like an existential question, but has there ever been a ride at the parks that

2565
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:51,800
has been plussed up and it made it better for you guys?

2566
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:52,800
Made it better.

2567
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,800
Yeah.

2568
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:54,800
Hmm.

2569
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:58,800
Which, well, would you, would you say guardians is that you don't know?

2570
02:05:58,800 --> 02:05:59,880
I don't think you say it's better.

2571
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:01,480
I don't know if it's, well, it's cool.

2572
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:03,560
I mean, it feels fresh and I always want to go on it.

2573
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:08,440
So I guess I would say maybe better as long, again, as long as Florida stays around the

2574
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:12,840
tower of terror being turned to guardians, I kind of feel like it's, I feel like I, it's

2575
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,560
more fun and I go there more frequently.

2576
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,120
Now will it fade in a few years?

2577
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:18,960
I don't know, but I do always want to go on it now.

2578
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,200
Whereas tower you'd go, ah, we could skip tower here and there.

2579
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:29,040
I think the, uh, all the fantasy land, um, uh, plus ups, adding the little lighting effects

2580
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,040
and making the characters a little more complex.

2581
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:32,480
I think those are all really well done.

2582
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:33,760
I had boxed ghost.

2583
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:36,760
I love him in Disneyland and a star tours.

2584
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,760
I think it's better now.

2585
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:38,760
Yeah, I like it.

2586
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:39,760
Yeah, it is.

2587
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:40,760
It is better probably.

2588
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:46,320
What if, but the random, every once in a while you could go on the old, of course that would

2589
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,320
be fantastic.

2590
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:50,000
That's my pre that we're not in the wrong episode.

2591
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,400
Was it Paul Rubens or was it a Paul Rubens?

2592
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,400
It was Paul Rubens.

2593
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:54,400
Yeah, sure.

2594
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:55,400
It was.

2595
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:58,240
I mean, the miss, the rec snapping, the pilot is maybe the only, that's why you could, we'll

2596
02:06:58,240 --> 02:06:59,240
talk about it.

2597
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:04,080
I'd be fine with C3PO taking you to the, through the original movie.

2598
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,080
Sure.

2599
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:07,360
I'd just be excited to see the movie in that cabin again.

2600
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:08,560
That would have been a fun throwback.

2601
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:13,120
They could probably easily program one of these like throwback.

2602
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:14,120
That's a good idea.

2603
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:18,080
I don't know if the timing is right and there'd be no holograms in it.

2604
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:19,680
Cause there have been three versions, right?

2605
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:24,240
Because there's a one, is the current one where Darth Vader grabs you and chases you?

2606
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:25,240
Well, it depends.

2607
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:28,240
There's, there's stormtrooper version, Darth Vader version.

2608
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:29,400
It's customizable.

2609
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,840
So like the order of scenes can change.

2610
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,640
The person who talks to you can change.

2611
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,640
Oh yeah.

2612
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:35,640
I didn't know that.

2613
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:37,320
There's like three different scenes at the start and there could be three, like three

2614
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,800
you land places you go to at the start and then three at the end.

2615
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:40,800
Wow.

2616
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,400
But then they've added two because of the two movies as well.

2617
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:46,160
And a lot of those new characters are saying hi to you.

2618
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,840
Finn, Poe, Dameron, uh, BBA.

2619
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:49,840
Maz Kanata.

2620
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:53,240
Maz Kanata's now on, I saw Maz the other day.

2621
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:54,240
Yeah.

2622
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:55,240
Can you believe it?

2623
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:56,240
Maz points at you.

2624
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:58,360
Maz gives you the old point too.

2625
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:01,320
I've gotten a little too much Maz Kanata lately.

2626
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,520
I like Maz Kanata.

2627
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:06,600
I feel like I get Maz Kanata on that ride a lot recently.

2628
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:09,600
Well, she's very thirsty, you know?

2629
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:10,960
Well, yes, that's true.

2630
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,640
I do like her jet pack.

2631
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:13,640
That's fun.

2632
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:18,360
So I don't, I don't think that there will ever be at least not in the next 10 years

2633
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:20,520
cause we know the slate or even 20 years.

2634
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:25,000
There's not going to be a movie that would fit the 20,000 leagues under the sea ride.

2635
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:32,800
Well, it's funny that you say that because, uh, so there's been multiple attempts at remakes

2636
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:37,080
for, uh, uh, 20,000 leagues under the sea.

2637
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:41,120
Uh, Mick G was once attached to do a 20,000 leagues movie that fell through.

2638
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:43,360
David Fincher was attached.

2639
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:44,360
That fell through.

2640
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,960
He did Gone Girl instead.

2641
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:53,880
Uh, James Mangold is currently attached to a, uh, uh, as of recently, according to Wikipedia,

2642
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:56,480
a Disney movie called Captain Nemo.

2643
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,480
Wow.

2644
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:59,280
So should I say if I want to?

2645
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,280
Yeah, sure.

2646
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,280
Yeah.

2647
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:04,400
If there's anything, what could have salvaged it or, uh, would you, do you think that there's

2648
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:12,200
any merit in, uh, in more sort of like high end, uh, hotel or restaurant experiences in

2649
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:13,200
the park?

2650
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,200
Yeah.

2651
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,200
Make it a restaurant.

2652
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:16,200
Yeah.

2653
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,200
That's what I was thinking.

2654
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:19,760
I was thinking like, could you, could you do that?

2655
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,160
It would cost a little bit more.

2656
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,160
A lot.

2657
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:23,160
It would have to be a lot.

2658
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:26,760
I think three times because it was 12 minutes per spin.

2659
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:27,760
Yeah.

2660
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,760
I, yeah.

2661
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:29,760
Oh, I love the, yeah.

2662
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:30,760
That's what I was thinking too.

2663
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:31,760
That's pretty cool.

2664
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:35,080
I think that actually was going to be a feature of the Discovery Bay Tony Baxter.

2665
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,880
I think you could have had a meal in the Nautilus.

2666
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:42,680
Uh, and by the way, we missed this, a Captain Nemo, a simulator ride, which they were going

2667
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:46,800
to try to do in the seventies, which I don't know how they would have been ready by then,

2668
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:47,800
but they were pre starters.

2669
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:52,720
There was going to be that, but yes, uh, a Nautilus restaurant was discussed.

2670
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:53,720
That's a pretty good idea.

2671
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:56,720
You would eat sperm whale and you would eat, yeah, you would have all of it.

2672
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:59,720
You finally get all those, you get your Captain Nemo food.

2673
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:01,120
Turtle, sir.

2674
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:02,120
We've got a bunch left over.

2675
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:03,120
Shark fin.

2676
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:04,120
Canned turtle.

2677
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:05,120
Shark fin.

2678
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,120
Shark fin soup.

2679
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:07,120
Real shark fin soup.

2680
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:08,120
It's not a joke.

2681
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:09,120
It's not a simulation.

2682
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:10,120
It's the actual thing.

2683
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:11,120
This is high end.

2684
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:17,120
This would have been the original Disney World Club 33 maybe.

2685
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:18,120
Yeah.

2686
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:19,120
Before they added the new ones.

2687
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:20,880
Sir, here is our farm to table menu.

2688
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:26,600
Here is our local menu and here is our endangered menu.

2689
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:30,880
Scrambled Shamu eggs from an actual Shamu.

2690
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:39,080
We will need a proof that you have a safety deposit box to access this menu.

2691
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:43,660
You know, I, if I could go back, I think there were two words that could have really say

2692
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:47,800
this ride and inspired from eight to 80.

2693
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:49,640
And those two words are Peter Laurie.

2694
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:51,240
Oh yeah.

2695
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:56,000
If he lured this ride up a little, no way they could have torn this down, baby.

2696
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Little Laurie narration.

2697
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,200
If you put a Laurie animatronic.

2698
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:04,560
I know I've also recently discussed a Vincent D'Onofrio bug animatronic.

2699
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,640
Bug alien animatronic.

2700
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:12,880
I just want interesting looking character actors turned into animatronics everywhere.

2701
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:13,880
That's what I want.

2702
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:14,880
What a great idea.

2703
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,520
So instead it's Peter Laurie is like, oh no, I'm in control of the Nautilus.

2704
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,200
Like he does know what he's doing.

2705
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:26,720
Or if like Nemo narration is like, I need to step away for a moment.

2706
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:30,160
Don't ask why I'll take it from here, boss.

2707
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:32,200
I've got to talk to Baxter.

2708
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:33,200
What does this say?

2709
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:34,200
Yes.

2710
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,640
Turtles patriarchs of the deep.

2711
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:37,640
Okay.

2712
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:43,520
Your, uh, your Lori started getting into the Vincent Price territory at all kinds of

2713
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:50,520
floods.

2714
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:51,520
Yeah.

2715
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,520
It's okay.

2716
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:53,520
Who's the rapper who says, okay.

2717
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:54,520
Yeah.

2718
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:55,520
It's a little bit.

2719
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,520
Yeah.

2720
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:57,520
He's swimming around in there.

2721
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:58,400
One of the seats, if they had a Lori animatronic like Rex and C3PO are practical robots.

2722
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:01,720
If they had one inside the ride too, not just the narration.

2723
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:04,560
But then you would have to, because you're facing out the portholes, so you'd have to

2724
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,360
like turn around to look at them.

2725
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:08,320
Well, yeah, like real life, it would be so realistic.

2726
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:12,680
So if you get the bonus seat, you're sitting next to the robot.

2727
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:13,680
Excuse me, sir.

2728
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:20,160
And the imagineers even put a little chalk M on his shoulder as like a little nod, a

2729
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:25,920
little Easter egg for the film buffs.

2730
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:26,920
What's this?

2731
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:31,360
A kid just came in here and vomited and diarrhea all over the cockpit.

2732
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,360
They're diarrhea all over.

2733
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:36,160
A child has thrown up again.

2734
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:39,160
Oh, she's just hideous.

2735
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:40,960
That would be great.

2736
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:43,360
And there's like a guy doing Lori like remotely.

2737
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:44,360
Yeah.

2738
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:47,760
Like, like I see it's your birthday from the button.

2739
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:48,760
Oh, hello.

2740
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:49,760
J little Jason.

2741
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,760
Hello.

2742
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,760
Hey, thanks, Peter.

2743
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:57,360
Lori, Connell or whatever your parents name is.

2744
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:00,000
You're the only child who knows who I am.

2745
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I love you, Peter.

2746
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I thought I could.

2747
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,320
I never thought I could like the parks more.

2748
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:09,600
But with you here, Peter.

2749
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:10,600
Oh yeah.

2750
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:15,440
I think Jason does the voice and you do it just from a webcam from your bed.

2751
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:21,440
You just as a job you have all day, and they have to reinstall the submarines to make this

2752
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:22,440
happen.

2753
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:25,440
Congratulations on your nuptials.

2754
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:30,320
Tear up, who was it called?

2755
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:33,680
Rip it all up, put it exactly the way it was.

2756
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:35,720
Only change the narration.

2757
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:43,440
Do you want a picture with your crew and Kanga or Peter Lori?

2758
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:45,760
Late character actor Peter Lori.

2759
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,760
It's in price.

2760
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:54,280
It's always coming from.

2761
02:13:54,280 --> 02:14:02,080
With this run of obscure actors and children, diarrhea, with all this stuffy sharp, you've

2762
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:03,080
survived.

2763
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:11,560
Thank you for just like 20,000 Leagues is a bunch of disconnected stories that got turned

2764
02:14:11,560 --> 02:14:13,800
into a story of a big arc.

2765
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:16,160
I think that's what you did for this podcast.

2766
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:20,680
Your 20,000 Leagues journey was beautiful and I'm glad you got closure.

2767
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:21,680
Yeah, thank you.

2768
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:23,040
Wonderful to hear it.

2769
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:24,040
I did.

2770
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:25,320
Can I hit you with one factoid?

2771
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:26,320
Yeah.

2772
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,320
Yeah.

2773
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:29,840
They have to constantly stop people from spreading their ashes in the Haunted Mansion.

2774
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:30,840
Oh yeah.

2775
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:33,440
I've heard that to be the thousandth ghost.

2776
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:35,600
To stop it and clean it up then when it happens.

2777
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,600
Biohazard, baby.

2778
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:38,600
Thank you for having me.

2779
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:40,000
It means a lot to me.

2780
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Thanks for coming.

2781
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
So keep those ashes.

2782
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,200
When this ride's reopened with Peter Lori.

2783
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:45,520
Save them for what they're for.

2784
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:48,840
Putting in a bunch of ink that'll be printed as a comic book.

2785
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:53,960
Like that's what ashes are for.

2786
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:56,520
Starting anything you'd like to plug while you're here.

2787
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:01,720
Well, I mean, I guess you could look up the Defunct Highland Park TV.

2788
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:06,000
You could see the Who Was Show on Netflix.

2789
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,380
You could see Hooded Jason.

2790
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:10,680
You could see Stony Sharp at everything.

2791
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:15,080
Twitter, Instagram and everything you guys do because you're fantastic.

2792
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:16,080
Thank you.

2793
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:17,080
Oh, thank you.

2794
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:18,080
That's so nice.

2795
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:19,080
Hey.

2796
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:23,240
Well, I guess what you're talking about is Podcast the Ride on Twitter and on Instagram

2797
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:29,760
and on Facebook and Raiden review us on iTunes and send us an email at podcasttheride.gmail.com.

2798
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:30,760
Yeah, and Facebook.

2799
02:15:30,760 --> 02:15:32,760
We got a Facebook now.

2800
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:33,760
Facebook group.

2801
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:37,840
Hey, how about old Peter Lori do a plug?

2802
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:40,840
Oh, well.

2803
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:48,600
If you could see a lot of my movies on Netflix, if you're the disco service.

2804
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:53,880
Some of them are on like hoopla or a canopy if you have a library card.

2805
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:56,880
Your local library mainly.

2806
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:00,040
I'm probably buried in war in Hollywood forever.

2807
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:01,040
Forest lawn.

2808
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,040
Dig up my ashes.

2809
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,040
Dig up my ashes.

2810
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:04,040
Do with them with your will.

2811
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:10,560
Hold on to these papers while I run.

2812
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,080
I'll be back for them.

2813
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,720
Also, but you guys kids look up Peter Lori.

2814
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:16,720
Look up Peter Lori.

2815
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:17,720
He's actually great.

2816
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:18,720
Great.

2817
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:20,000
And check out his grave.

2818
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
And thanks for listening.

2819
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
And so long.

2820
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Check out my grave.

2821
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,469
Good night.
