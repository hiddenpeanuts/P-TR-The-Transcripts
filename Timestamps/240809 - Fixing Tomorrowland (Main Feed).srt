1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The year, 2024.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Disneyland's Tomorrowland is in shambles.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
People mover tracks its unused, clogging up an already narrow walkway.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
An arcade once vibrant and full of beeps and boops is now a space where you can sometimes get a free button.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Toward the back is an old rotating theater that rotates no longer,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
where a man named John once told us about his new oven.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Can this land be salvaged?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Can the future be saved?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We roll up our sleeves and get to work.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Fixing Tomorrowland on Podcast The Ride.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, where today we roll up our sleeves

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and do what the Disney Corporation hasn't for over 30 years.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm Scott Garner, joined by Mike Carlson.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm here.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's the burden we've got.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I feel the weight of what we're doing today.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, and you know, besides the weight of literal shovels and dirt and construction equipment,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
there's no real weight, but the mental weight.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The weight in trying to figure out how to fix this problem,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which I'm sure nobody in the building has even attempted.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Never.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Never.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Never.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Jason, Sharon, and I.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You know, it was a land that we've encountered and talked a lot about.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Like, a lot of essays, a lot of writing videos talk about Tomorrowland,

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
almost forgotten about, you know?

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, and Disneyland first opened.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like, very underpowered, and it took a long time to add some real meaty attractions.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, that's, yes.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, yes.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, as we've covered this, you know, slowly, sporadically,

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
barely over the course of the last two years, the Tomorrowland problem,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
we have discovered it is a problem from the root, from the get-go.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They just jammed a bunch of stuff in there because they didn't know what else to do.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Things that were exciting at the time got out of date very fast.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There have been successful redo's, overlays, successful entire other Tomorrowlands

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and other parks, but we, of course, are focused on the Disneyland Tomorrowland,

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
which has pretty much sucked shit since the failed redo in 1998,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the redo that made everything worse.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And it now takes us to this point where we try to figure out how to do it ourselves,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
how to fix Tomorrowland, at Disneyland specifically.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah, and we've decided to do it in a unique way.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This was a thing I've concocted a while ago,

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and hopefully it turns out that this was the best way to do it,

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
but we're going to take different approaches.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Each of us has a different assignment.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We've been, we've randomly chosen these assignments on a previous episode,

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and basically what the deal is is we're going to try to cover all the different ways

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Disneyland could fix Tomorrowland with no budget at all

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
or barely a budget with sort of a good, healthy budget

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and in their normal, synergistic corporate thinking.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And then we're also going to give one of us, or Scott, of course,

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
is going to get a blue sky, heavy, big budget to do cool stuff.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who knows what he's concocted? We don't know anything.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We don't know anything. We haven't told each other what we're doing yet.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So each of us are coming at it from a different budget and a different philosophy.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And different, these are very like different thought exercises, I would say.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You know, like there's these varying degrees of realism versus science fiction,

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
much like Tomorrowland itself.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, so yeah, so when we're all done here,

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I mean, I'm not saying we have to combine these three ideas at the end or anything,

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but there will be, we can probably get good stuff from all these pitches

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and we can really assess in all the different ways

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you could possibly assess how to fix Tomorrowland.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We will now have a full picture of it.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And this is, look, will Disney listen

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and will they take any of the things we say and apply them?

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't think so, but we'll see.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Maybe they don't say anything about Tomorrowland at the upcoming D23 conference.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And they do learn from us. I don't know.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, that's, you know, and we are kind of in the middle of a block of episodes

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
related to the upcoming, I think tomorrow as of the day this is released,

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the D23 Horizons Disney Experiences Showcase.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Which rolls off the tongue, which we all have been saying

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
as naturally as the names of our partners and children.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, you know, here on Horizons Disney Experiences Showcase Eve,

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
this is an interesting juncture point, I think, to determine, you know,

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
what if some of the stuff we say gets done?

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then we'll know that they didn't steal it from us

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
because a day is frankly too much time, too little time to turn that around.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Probably, yeah.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Or will they say nothing at all,

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
which is something that I literally bet money on

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
if you didn't hear the episode about betting on D23,

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
which just happened on the second gate.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I recommend that one.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can see if you agree with our assessments,

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
if you think our money place was foolish.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then once again on Sunday,

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
we're going to do an early episode for that week on the main feed

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
where we go through all of the news we actually do get

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and see if it is exciting.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Is it as exciting as a blue sky version,

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
or does it have the hollow ring of a low budget version?

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, it's going to be very interesting.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We're doing two episodes essentially where we are making predictions

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
or like casting our hopes and dreams onto the Disney company.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So we're really going to get to see if anything we said comes true.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And that's exciting for me personally.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's coming. We don't usually have something like this.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This scenario is sort of unique.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, when an event as unique as D23 Horizon's Disney Experience

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Showcase comes up, you have to be as unique along with it.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's going to, boy, I hope it blows the rafters,

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
blows the roof off the Honda Center.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean, hopefully they retire Josh Demaro's suit or casual shirt,

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
casual tie-less shirt.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In the rafters.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In the rafters, yeah, yeah.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is that a way usually reserved for athletes or for Billy Joel

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in Madison Square Garden?

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So anyways, yes, as you said, via a randomized order,

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we figured out who was going to do low, mid, and big.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Actually, let me also say really quickly that we are recording this

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
on a day where earlier today I set foot on Disney property

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
for the first time in a little over six months.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Wow.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have not been down there nearly at all,

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and I ended up down there for a, I mean,

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
it was a day of fun in Anaheim, not Disneyland,

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
but that ended up with a delightful father-son lunch

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
with my four-year-old boy at Trader Sam's.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wow.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This was, like, he'd never been there before.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This was such a success and such a delight.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Like, not inside, we were out on the patio,

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
but getting some island vibes just, like,

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
put me in a good place to ideate here.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It reminded me of how crucial it is

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
that we pass these places down to the next generation,

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
that we and Disney and all of us together make it so

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that we have a vibrant Disneyland,

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and that depends on a vibrant Tomorrowland.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I think so.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And it was very, this was just resonating in my head.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Another thing this reminded me of is how much I like hazy IPAs.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, wow.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, one single one.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Wow, you're loose for this episode.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No, no, that was hours ago.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There was a nap in the intervening time.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh, wow, Jason, you can appreciate that.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I know, I'm living it up.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Beer, nap, podcasting with the boys on a Sunday.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wow, what a chilled-out day.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I napped because the heat was making me lightheaded,

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
so I chugged some ice water.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think that was probably in there for me, too.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's been crazy in LA recently.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But anyways, so that said, when we kind of digitally drew straws,

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Jason had the assignment of coming up with the lowest budget version.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's still, it's an interesting thing because that does,

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
it's still called fixing Tomorrowland.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There still is the burden of like, you have to consider it somehow.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Something has to be fixed despite,

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and I don't know how low you mentally put your budget,

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and I'm excited to hear.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh, jeez, oh, jeez.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, I tried my best.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We're going to try.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Somehow I started getting emails that the budget was being,

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the imaginary budget was being slashed.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It kept happening.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think you put yourself through the right mental exercise, absolutely.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you want me to get started?

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I suppose so, let's do it.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Jason, fix Tomorrowland.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I should just real quick say before,

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
part of our job will be sort of saying,

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
okay, what you just proposed maybe that seems like out of budget

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
or that seems out of character maybe for the Disney.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So we'll be doing a little of sort of judging as we go or toward the end,

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and then we'll have a discussion about it.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's what I was going to say is that I think the role of the others

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
in the individual presentations I think should be to push it further

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
in the direction that it's supposed to be in.

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If we feel like the low budget broke the rules a little bit,

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
we can nudge it.

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Mike, yours as the realism I think probably needs the most curtailing,

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and if mine doesn't use enough imagination,

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I need your help with that.

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So it'll be sort of, and I think it's up to all of us individually.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do we want to just monologue for a while?

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Do we want feedback from the Peanut Gallery?

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's really up to you.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, we'll feel it out.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Jason seems stressed.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, jeez.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You do, I know.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm trying my best.

202
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
All right.

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, I'm going to go ahead and go start.

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay.

205
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
All right.

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Budget Tomorrowland.

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, Budget Tomorrowland.

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And just fair warning, I'm going low to high.

209
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So if it seems a little not up to your speed, just bear with me, okay?

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
All right, go ahead.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
All right.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
First things first, you know all those planters in Tomorrowland?

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The ones, where are they located?

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They're all around.

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They're all around.

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They've got like cabbages and they've got different bushes.

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The idea in 98 at some point was that it's all edible stuff.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And I don't remember how much they committed to that anyway.

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is it over by Star Tours and stuff?

220
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
All around, you're saying.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All around.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Everywhere, okay.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, planners.

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, yes.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Good news, those planners are all getting new sod.

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Wow.

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, great.

228
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yay.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
All right.

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The crowd's freaking.

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If you're Tomorrow right now, the audience is about to faint.

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
AG Sod Farms is coming through.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They're giving us a sponsorship.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No money.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, great.

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No money, but up to 14 bags of sod.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So that's coming through.

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Very good, yes.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Star Tours, unchanged.

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's right.

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wait, no, I'm so sorry.

242
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The Stanchions outside.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know that really brutal extended queue in the sunlight?

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Right, yeah.

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That area's getting new ropes on the Stanchions.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Good, good.

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay, what kind of ropes?

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The same nylon, but it's just a little less, you know.

249
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Just new.

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Clawed at by like heat-stroked children.

251
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, kids will wear that down.

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's smart, that's good.

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You need that.

254
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Right.

255
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, really good news.

257
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We're turning the Orbitron back on.

258
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The kinetic sculpture that used to go off every few minutes.

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Right.

260
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's coming back.

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Is it the Observatron?

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, jeez.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We're thinking of Orbiton from E.T. Adventure, the character.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We're always thinking of Orbiton.

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is that his name, Orbiton?

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No, look, I'm asking that to myself too because it said in my presentation as well, so I'm

267
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
not totally, but the point is...

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's back.

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wow.

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's coming back.

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They're flipping the on switch.

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Soon you'll be able to stand there and go like, what is that?

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Interesting.

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And people around you will go, sir, this is the middle of a wall.

275
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Could you keep moving?

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Wow.

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Please.

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It'll confuse new generations.

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's right.

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And that will cost a little money.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So just want to keep it in mind.

283
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm not saying it's out of bounds, but I think it will cost a little money to turn that back

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
on.

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It needs some work.

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And we got to switch out the CD player for like a Pono or something, like an MP3 player.

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Neil Young's Pono is what you're saying.

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
High quality audio.

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Right.

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It costs $500 per player, I believe.

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Exactly.

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah.

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So that's going to be powering that.

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's the highest ticket item, I think, the whole time.

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So far, yeah.

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So far.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay.

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How about this?

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Space Mountain.

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The giant crosshairs outside of Space Mountain are getting a fresh coat of paint.

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wow.

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is kind of a throwback to Tomorrowland 98 where much of the budget went to paint.

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes.

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Got it.

306
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Still crosshairs.

307
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah.

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's still unsettling crosshairs that you can't get anywhere near and it's taking up a lot

309
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
of room.

310
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Some might say it's supposed to be like, oh, this is for a rocket.

311
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's where a rocket would land.

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Got it.

313
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But it does look like crosshairs.

315
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But a rocket has never, nothing interesting has ever happened.

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No, the rocket was removed.

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So maybe one day it'll come back.

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Not for this budget.

319
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Not this.

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, no.

321
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Got it.

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay.

323
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Very good news.

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Star Wars Launch Bay is glowing away forever.

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Wow.

326
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Wow.

327
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's glowing away.

328
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And that building has a brand new sponsor.

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And this is a big one.

330
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Google.

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The old interventions.

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They got a lot of money.

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Is now becoming the Chromebook Clubhouse.

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You know Chromebooks, the computers that are made so cheaply.

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They just give them away to schools.

338
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, they're here.

339
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And you'll be able to test out Chromebooks from any number of manufacturers.

340
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But that's not all.

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You'll be able to meet new original characters.

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The Chrome Critters.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Ooh.

344
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Now this is good.

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And this is paid for by Google.

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Google's covering it.

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So Disney doesn't have to spend any money.

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Google.

349
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No more money than Pono.

350
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They are saving.

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's it called?

352
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Pono, yeah.

353
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They're saving our ass.

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You get to meet Google Chrome characters.

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Like we see you're using a different browser.

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Google recommends using Chrome.

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Switch now.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And your Google Drive is filling up.

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Buy more space.

361
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And everyone's favorite character.

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Green Text Balloon.

363
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Hey, it's Green Text Balloon.

364
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He's walking around.

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He's got arms and legs.

366
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay.

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Can I ask a couple questions?

368
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How will you meet them?

370
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are they in animatronic form?

371
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Are they like a mascot type character?

372
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They have a costume.

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They walk around.

374
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They're like little bubbles.

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They look like the little pop-ups we all love.

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Right.

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Got it.

378
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And you see all the time if you're using Safari or Firefox on a laptop.

379
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Right, right.

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But the other good thing about this carousel building,

381
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
if you're looking for a place to warm up on those chilly Southern California evenings.

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Of course.

383
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, yeah.

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Famously, yes.

385
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Southern California does get a little chilly much of the year.

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You've got to bring a light sweater.

387
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You really do.

388
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Especially in winter.

389
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, you're going to want to head for Chromebook Clubhouse

390
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
because just like using Chrome browser on a laptop,

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
this building gets very hot.

392
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And that's for accuracy's sake.

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Google demanded that.

394
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So that will be, Google will pay for it,

395
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
but you're going to have to change the building to make it hot.

396
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There will be some technological upgrades.

397
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's going to naturally get hot.

398
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
All those Chromebooks in there,

399
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and then people are going to be trying the Chromebook browser,

400
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
checking their email, presumably.

401
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay, okay.

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah, okay.

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's going to be hot.

404
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
All right, so you've got to think about air conditioning here.

405
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're going to need a solid system.

406
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay, so keep going around the horn.

408
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Finding Nemo subs, unchanged.

409
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Autopia, unchanged.

410
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Electric versions on hold for now,

411
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
but hopefully getting back on track soon.

412
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Your version put them on hold.

413
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, your version is not.

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's not me.

415
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm doing my best.

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is a blue sky situation.

417
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So the thing they said that was canceled in your world.

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

419
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I mean, I get, yeah.

420
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm just clarifying.

421
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I agree with you.

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm just, you know,

423
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm being loyal to the spirit of Tomorrowland 98.

424
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
For better or worse.

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But hey, how about something more optimistic?

426
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's talk food in Tomorrowland.

427
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay?

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay, great, yes.

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay.

430
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Tomorrowland Terrace is about to become

431
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
the dining destination of Disneyland.

432
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
All right?

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Get ready for the food of tomorrow.

434
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And by tomorrow, I mean roughly 10 years ago, like 2014.

435
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So we're talking cronuts.

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We're talking the Kroy Sparkling Water.

437
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Whoa.

438
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And you better believe we're talking Sriracha mayo.

439
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Wow.

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

441
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That sounds good.

442
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The most Sriracha mayo you can add for a dollar

443
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
to your burgers and fries, your dipping cups.

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, yeah.

445
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And you might get a lot,

446
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
because often if that's an ingredient in something

447
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and it shows up,

448
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
it's been squirted out in a very uncareful manner.

449
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Scott, you might get a lot.

450
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You might get like an eyedropper's worth.

451
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay?

452
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's part of the unpredictability.

453
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We don't really know what the future's gonna hold.

454
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You know, the story, and we thought a lot about story.

455
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah.

456
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The story is that the future is untold.

457
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The future is unwritten.

458
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah, that's true.

459
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So it could really be anything.

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm so glad you focused on story,

461
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
because I've been worried about all of our,

462
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
that we would all lose sight of that it's all about story.

463
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It is all about story.

464
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And hey, speaking of story,

465
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
for all you Easter egg fans out there, keep an eye out.

466
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Can I, real quick,

467
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
because I just remember this is something

468
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that really makes me laugh,

469
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
is that I was listening to a Tony Baxter interview recently

470
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
where he was a little grumpy,

471
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
but he was talking about Mark Davis talking about,

472
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
he goes,

473
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
people keep talking about these rides are stories.

474
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They're not stories.

475
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Really?

476
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's what he says.

477
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Whoa.

478
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He's like, Mark Davis is just like,

479
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
why do they keep saying they're stories?

480
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
They're not stories.

481
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Wow.

482
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He's on a ride and you look at,

483
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
he really simplified it.

484
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Like you're on a ride,

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
you look at fun stuff or whatever,

486
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but his whole philosophy was not.

487
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I love that.

488
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I did too.

489
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I thought it was great.

490
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh man.

491
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I love that cut through the clutter.

492
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's funny.

493
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Wow.

494
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Cool.

495
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Maybe it's not a direct quote,

496
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
but it seemed,

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm pretty sure I'm like 90% right.

498
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Sorry, sorry.

499
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But today,

500
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Disney Company is about story.

501
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I thought that was good to interrupt.

502
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I apologize.

503
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's about story and Easter eggs.

504
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Great, great, great.

505
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So keep an eye out

506
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
because you might have a chance to see

507
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Milo from Treasure Planet's silhouette

508
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
on one of the ordering windows.

509
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Whoa.

510
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Wow.

511
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Wow.

512
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Huh?

513
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
How about that?

514
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He's got presumably zigzaggy hair.

515
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
His hair,

516
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
he's got kind of the big,

517
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
he's got the middle part

518
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that I always had growing up.

519
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Wow.

520
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And the glasses,

521
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
we've got glasses in there.

522
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And by the way,

523
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
don't think we've forgotten

524
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
about Alien Pizza Planet.

525
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Alien Pizza Planet

526
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
is gonna have flatbreads

527
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
instead of slices.

528
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Damn, damn.

529
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How about that?

530
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
In the future,

531
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
that does sound good.

532
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We'll all get to eat

533
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
our own little pizza.

534
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah.

535
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We'll all get to eat

536
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
our own little pizza.

537
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A flatbread pizza.

538
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A flatbread pizza.

539
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Right.

540
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

541
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Well, that certainly brings the spirit

542
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
of some of the rest of the resort,

543
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
which all,

544
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think every location

545
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
at California Adventure

546
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
particularly has flatbreads.

547
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Right.

548
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So,

549
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm glad Tomorrowland

550
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
is finally caught up

551
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
to, yeah, again,

552
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
to the food of 10 years ago.

553
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah.

554
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Tomorrow is today.

555
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Wow.

556
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Wow.

557
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay.

558
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So,

559
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm glad Tomorrowland

560
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
is finally caught up

561
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
to, yeah, again,

562
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
to the food of 10 years ago.

563
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah.

564
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Tomorrow is today.

565
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Wow.

566
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay.

567
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay.

568
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh, my God.

569
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Jason's perspiring.

570
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You're literally wiping your fit.

572
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You brought a towel.

573
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know why he's out of breath.

574
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You brought a towel.

575
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Jason's sort of embodied.

576
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
When he was writing this up,

577
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
he was imagining like an executive

578
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
of like breathing down his neck

579
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
or something, I think.

580
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It was stressing him out.

581
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He's really lived it.

582
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah.

583
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
He's gone method for this.

584
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This was supposed to be

585
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
a fun exercise,

586
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
but it's really taken a toll on him.

587
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We got word,

588
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
even in this imaginary version.

589
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Who's we?

590
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What do you mean,

591
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
we got word?

592
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We.

593
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The crew, the gang.

594
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The team, the storytellers,

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the dreamers.

596
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
A lot of this is dependent

597
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
on the success of ESPN bets,

598
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and we're moving somebody around.

599
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This would be great.

600
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If they don't announce anything

601
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
at D23 that we like,

602
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
if there was just like

603
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
a very like tired guy on stage,

604
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I guess tomorrow would have to be them.

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If he was just like,

606
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
kind of his suit was rumpled

607
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and hair was messy,

608
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and he's like,

609
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
look, this is all dependent

610
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
on ESPN bets,

611
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and we can't do any of this

612
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
if we don't announce anything

613
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
at D23.

614
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I mean,

615
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I mean,

616
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean,

617
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I mean,

618
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean,

619
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I mean,

620
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I mean,

621
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
we don't know.

622
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We know,

623
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
we know about it.

624
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We know about these bets,

625
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and we can't do any of this

626
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
if this betting app

627
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
doesn't work out.

628
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, God.

629
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm really sorry,

630
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
you guys.

631
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Someone made a crazy

632
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
multi-parlay bet

633
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
on Simone Bile's

634
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Olympic performance

635
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and she killed it.

636
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We owe that person

637
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
a lot of money.

638
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's.

639
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, go ahead, yeah.

640
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I want to get to the big,

641
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the big, like.

642
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The big stuff.

643
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The big stuff.

644
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Great.

645
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Right.

646
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This is kind of where

647
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,720
25% of the budget went, okay?

648
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,080
Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters will be glowing away forever.

649
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,320
Wow, really?

650
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,160
Yes.

651
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,520
You know, but this is where we spent a lot of the budget,

652
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,060
like I said, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters

653
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,620
is becoming Ant-Man and the Wasp Nano Battle.

654
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,460
Oh, wow.

655
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,200
You know Ant-Man and the Wasp Nano Battle,

656
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,100
the Hong Kong Disneyland attraction that opened in 2019

657
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,680
and none of us ever talk about.

658
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,320
I've never even been curious enough to watch a ride.

659
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,160
Right, right, right.

660
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,320
Now get curious.

661
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
Wow.

662
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,140
Because it's coming to Anaheim right at the front

663
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,440
and you're gonna thrill to all the original footage

664
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,360
featuring Paul Rudd himself

665
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,840
and the finest Robert Downey Jr. impersonator

666
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,960
Fiverr has to offer.

667
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,680
This is not a joke.

668
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,080
Look up this ride.

669
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,920
The joke is, yeah.

670
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,200
Oh, they're gonna tell us to look up this guy on Fiverr

671
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,520
who's really good.

672
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,800
Are there impressionists on Fiverr?

673
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,640
That is a good, yeah.

674
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,280
Oh, there's voice people, yeah.

675
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,640
There's definitely voice people,

676
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,240
but oh man, like specifically, like yeah,

677
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,480
do you need a Scarlett Johansson?

678
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,200
Gotcha covered, five bucks.

679
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,960
Don't worry, by the way,

680
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,080
the original manufacturer, Sansei Technologies,

681
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,080
formerly Sansei Yusoki is on board.

682
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,120
Great.

683
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,600
Okay, so we got Sansei.

684
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,000
A surely not nefarious Chinese company.

685
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
It's actually a Japanese manufacturing firm.

686
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
I double checked that.

687
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,160
Okay, okay, all right, all right, got it.

688
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,840
So you're gonna be able to go on this ride.

689
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,920
Well, see, I don't love that

690
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,480
because I would like more nefariousness, honestly.

691
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,640
Okay, yeah, you would like the nefariousness

692
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,320
of like Arnim Zola, the computer presence

693
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,400
who shows up as the adversary in the ride.

694
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,240
Oh, is that true?

695
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,080
You know Arnim Zola.

696
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
Yes, Zola shows up.

697
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,440
I am a big Zola guy.

698
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,920
You and I are both big Zola guys.

699
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
Big Zola guys.

700
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,920
No, but I guess I'm gonna learn to be.

701
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,760
Yeah, you guys are.

702
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,600
Arnim Yusoki.

703
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,720
Yeah, Arnim Zola.

704
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,840
And going on this ride, you're gonna get to experience

705
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,960
shades of yellow in gray

706
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,920
that you've never seen or thought of before

707
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,920
because this ride is mostly gray and yellow.

708
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,160
And I do have to say,

709
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,440
this ride was going to be an original story.

710
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,360
Unfortunately, Ant-Man and the Wasp,

711
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,720
Kangalanga Ding Dong has Jonathan Majors all over it.

712
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,520
So it's going straight to the vault.

713
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,520
So we just cloned the great ride from Hong Kong

714
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,600
and it's the same ride as Hong Kong.

715
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,440
The same ride.

716
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,280
Same ride.

717
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,440
Same money, I guess they shot some of it, you're saying.

718
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, it's mostly in English

719
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,040
and we're gonna try to get the part that's not translated.

720
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,880
Sure, sure.

721
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,720
We're trying.

722
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,560
And so that's my presentation.

723
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,440
We've gone all the way around back to the entrance.

724
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,280
Great.

725
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,520
So that's budget tomorrow, Lance.

726
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,840
So we got some marveling there.

727
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,680
We got a new ride.

728
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,520
We got a new ride.

729
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,360
We got a new corporate.

730
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,640
We got a new corporate.

731
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,000
Debuting in the United States for the first time.

732
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,440
That's how you dress that up.

733
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,920
For the first time for American visitors.

734
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,760
For the first time.

735
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
Can enjoy a nano battle.

736
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,800
We've got a huge sponsor.

737
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,840
We've got a slightly smaller, solid sponsor.

738
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,040
The ropes and paint, we do have to pay out of pocket.

739
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't love that.

740
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,600
They got word it was Disney buying it.

741
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,280
So they kind of got us over a barrel.

742
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,000
So that's budget Tomorrowland redo.

743
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,320
Well, you have questions?

744
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,960
Well, I have thought my first thoughts, you know,

745
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,200
and is that this, what all this stuff Jason said

746
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,600
would make Tomorrowland better.

747
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,520
Like the better, like if there was better food

748
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,480
in Tomorrowland, which is one of my biggest gripes

749
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,760
about Tomorrowland is it's just like very boring pizza

750
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,600
and bad hamburgers.

751
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
Those are bad food locations.

752
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,840
That's the worst place for food in the park.

753
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Just improving the food would give me a little bit

754
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,720
of a better feeling about going to Tomorrowland.

755
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,280
We thought we were gonna get that back in like 2015

756
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,560
when they're like Star Wars, Seasons of the Force.

757
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,960
I think that was the first one.

758
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,960
And they had Star Wars themed food and it was not it.

759
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,160
It was not it, right.

760
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,360
So what I'm saying is all of the things I think you said

761
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,800
are a net positive for Tomorrowland.

762
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,640
Ultimately.

763
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,480
Wait, when you put it that way, I know.

764
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,480
It's like the beleaguered tone and the apologetic tone

765
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,800
does kind of like belied that you're right.

766
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,480
These are all like achievable improvements that are right.

767
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,600
Yeah, I don't know.

768
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
I mean, the biggest question is if you can,

769
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,480
yeah, they are all a net positive.

770
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,640
The biggest question is if they could actually call that

771
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,000
a fully new Tomorrowland.

772
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Right, does that fix the problem?

773
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,680
I think they would.

774
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,200
But you feel comfortable fully calling that

775
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,040
a new Tomorrowland?

776
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,600
I think so, yeah.

777
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,080
Do you think, how much paint?

778
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,320
Because clearly if we're going 98 style,

779
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,600
at the very least you gotta paint.

780
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,440
Right.

781
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
I think so.

782
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,880
I think like one U-Haul cargo,

783
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,800
like however much we fit in there, you know.

784
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
Tony's talked about like doing a lot of this himself

785
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,640
and there's gonna be a real hands-on,

786
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
everyone on board kind of endeavor.

787
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,280
Don't make him do it again.

788
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,280
They admire him as a painter,

789
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
not really pay him because it's like,

790
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,120
well look, you wouldn't, look, the money,

791
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,080
don't you have enough money that we gave you before?

792
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,920
Yeah, right.

793
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,480
I mean, would you have any of that if not for us?

794
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
So, get painted.

795
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,840
We might need to borrow some of those Mary Poppins

796
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,840
two lights and props he has in his backyard.

797
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
He made a Mary Poppins two backyard.

798
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,080
Yeah, yeah, that was in the paper, I think.

799
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,680
Yeah, that's not, I think he said that in public,

800
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,520
so that's not like.

801
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,520
I think there was a photo spread.

802
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,840
That's not something we know from looking at

803
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,240
his house on Google Maps.

804
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,560
Or through binoculars.

805
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,320
That's not from that.

806
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,680
We didn't do that, by the way, either.

807
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,600
We've not looked at his house.

808
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,560
Did not.

809
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
No.

810
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,220
Either of those things.

811
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,600
Nope.

812
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,120
You know what, not, do you get like a,

813
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,560
you know what else would be a good trick is just like,

814
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,520
new, just like the logo,

815
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,200
because logos don't really cost money.

816
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,160
Yeah, logo would be good.

817
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, logo would be great.

818
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,600
That doesn't, you could throw that on

819
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,160
and I think, I think people buy that.

820
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,000
Right.

821
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,840
You just like reveal the name at D23 and that's a lot.

822
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,680
Sure.

823
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,640
You put it at enough places in the land,

824
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,560
you put it on t-shirts and coffee mugs,

825
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,160
and just kind of cement it in people's minds.

826
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,800
You've done like half the work.

827
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,320
What's really funny about everything you said

828
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
and in the manner in which you said it,

829
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,160
well it was obviously funny in the way you said it,

830
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,400
but I can imagine the way that Josh Demaro

831
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,200
would say all of that to like thunderous applause.

832
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,920
And then end with like, there's an Ant-Man ride coming

833
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,280
and you'd be like, yeah, okay, Paul Rudd's a funny guy.

834
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,120
Yeah, Paul Rudd's great.

835
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,680
You can see just the way in which you deliver the message.

836
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,520
He's like.

837
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,720
They kind of like, oh, and I did forget one thing.

838
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,120
Then the iconic Ant-Man score plays

839
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,320
that the people in that room know and I don't.

840
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
I just hear like.

841
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,320
Like it's not anything to me,

842
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,000
but like I think just that would get a big pop and.

843
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,840
Right.

844
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,400
It's not known enough that Nano Battle

845
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,040
is sort of nothing to write home about.

846
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,560
So like they might not know.

847
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,520
Sure.

848
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,160
And then like if he does,

849
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,480
if he frames it as kind of like,

850
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,120
we have revitalized the plant life all around.

851
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,320
Yes, right.

852
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,480
To build to a sustainable future.

853
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,840
I would say you don't use the word sod public facing.

854
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
God, I wish I would have thought of this.

855
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,800
I should have called you guys.

856
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,600
Oh boy.

857
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,440
Yeah.

858
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,240
Look, your honesty was the,

859
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,240
like this, but what you have done is exactly

860
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
how it's presented to tomorrow.

861
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,200
And then he has to like take a deep breath,

862
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,040
psych himself up in the mirror.

863
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,880
You can do this.

864
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,080
You can do this, you handsome devil.

865
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,360
You can sell a fast one on him again.

866
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,440
You've done it before.

867
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,600
You'll do it again.

868
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,920
Like some sort of Boogie Nights-esque movie monologue.

869
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,760
Oh yeah, of course.

870
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,600
And then he steams the bomber jacket

871
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
and then he goes out there.

872
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,880
We use a hand steamer.

873
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,840
Yeah, a hand steamer.

874
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,680
We have one at home.

875
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,800
It's great.

876
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,280
So convenient.

877
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,200
Depends on the material, but yeah, they work pretty well.

878
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,640
Yeah, so if you have mixed materials,

879
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,400
you don't want to use a steamer

880
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,560
because they dry at different rates.

881
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,040
So you don't want to use a steamer on like a men's suit coat.

882
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,720
There's too many layers.

883
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,560
I got it.

884
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,440
That's, you got to dry clean.

885
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,880
But DiMauro knows that.

886
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,720
Of course.

887
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,560
You get that in executive school.

888
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,800
That's like 70% of his job, yeah.

889
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,640
Yeah, that's executive school 101.

890
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,040
Any executive's job is just, yeah, yeah.

891
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,400
You can deliver any message while looking sharp

892
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,720
and it'll sail.

893
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,960
Right.

894
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,920
So get your steam around Josh

895
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,920
and get people excited about that sod.

896
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,120
I think that was pretty good.

897
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,960
That was pretty good.

898
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,320
It was very funny and also like,

899
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,920
that God, it kind of is just enough, isn't it?

900
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,040
It's kind of just enough.

901
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
It really is just enough.

902
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,640
Yeah, yeah.

903
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,840
You got some Easter eggs.

904
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,640
You got new food alone.

905
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,400
I feel like people come out for it.

906
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,240
That's what I'm saying.

907
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,720
I would feel like, oh cool,

908
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,840
I would go try like the better Tomorrowland food.

909
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,120
I'd be interested in that.

910
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,280
You just call it like, it's just,

911
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,200
now it's Tomorrowland bistro.

912
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,320
And now we're, that's all you got to do.

913
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,120
Yeah, it'd be like, we got to go down to the bistro,

914
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,960
the Tomorrowland bistro.

915
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,360
Let's make a trip to Anaheim.

916
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,240
They really want it to be risky

917
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,720
and get a little futuristic.

918
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,000
The S could be a two and the O could be a zero.

919
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,080
And now like, ooh, futuristic.

920
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,280
I guess it'd probably be,

921
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,400
I was trying to figure out like,

922
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,040
what would a digital bistro be?

923
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,760
And then that would be distro.

924
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,320
I think that'd be too confusing.

925
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,160
Distro.

926
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,920
But distro, it seems like it's popping for you.

927
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
Wait a minute.

928
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,600
I do like the sound of that.

929
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,880
That's not bad.

930
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,120
It's not the, what's the character?

931
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,160
Is Destro the character?

932
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,080
DC character?

933
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,400
That's a G.I. Joe villain?

934
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,440
Well, I'll check it.

935
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,440
I'll check it and see which villain I'm trying to think of.

936
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Look, I got a lot of villains running around in my head

937
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,040
for my youth, so I don't, I can't keep them straight.

938
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,880
Okay.

939
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,720
That was excellent.

940
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,560
That was excellent.

941
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,840
Yeah, I think perfectly, yeah.

942
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,040
Followed the rules, great.

943
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,000
Got the job done.

944
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,920
Thank you so much.

945
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,760
Oh, thank God.

946
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,600
Yeah, yeah.

947
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440
Thank God.

948
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,260
Take off.

949
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,100
It's over.

950
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,940
Yeah, it's over.

951
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,880
Get that towel on you.

952
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,360
Towel off for a couple days.

953
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,200
Oh, Jason, wait.

954
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,280
And it's Josh's problem now.

955
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,800
Wait, it didn't, we're not recording, Jason.

956
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,640
Oh, no.

957
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,480
Oh, jeez.

958
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,560
You gotta do the whole thing again.

959
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,480
Oh, jeez.

960
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,600
By memory.

961
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,840
All right, just let me hit the urgent care

962
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,280
and then I'll come back around.

963
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,120
Oh, okay, all right.

964
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,000
It takes you an hour or two to boot that thing up, right?

965
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,080
Yeah, it takes a couple hours.

966
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,920
Okay.

967
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,320
All right, just kidding, J.K.

968
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,640
All right, so I really tried my best

969
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,840
to imagine what realistically would happen

970
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,040
in this year of Our Lord 2024.

971
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,760
There's a couple things I think, it's a gray area,

972
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,720
and there's one big thing

973
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,840
that I'll probably talk about at the end

974
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,920
that I struggled with.

975
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,760
Okay.

976
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,720
That I was like, this doesn't feel right happening,

977
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,200
but maybe it does happen.

978
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,320
So check me.

979
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,160
Everybody check me.

980
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,880
You're allowed to have a little dessert.

981
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Sure, I try, yes.

982
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,480
Not one drop of whipped cream for Jason,

983
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,600
but you get to, so it might very well be.

984
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,320
Oh, yeah, please don't make me deal

985
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,920
with the dairy distributors,

986
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,320
because they are cut through.

987
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,360
They're worse than the sod people.

988
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,720
So, yeah, so I really,

989
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,400
so just to give you my philosophy before I start here,

990
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
and this, I guess, yeah, tomorrow wouldn't do this,

991
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,320
but this is how I'm choosing to present this,

992
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,320
is I was trying to keep most of the existing infrastructure

993
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,960
because that would save a lot of money.

994
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,120
I would have loved to demolish everything and start fresh,

995
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,280
but that's not probably what I think they would do in 2024.

996
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,080
So we gotta kinda keep the bones of Tomorrowland.

997
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,000
So I've tried to find fun stuff

998
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,080
that I don't think is gonna break the bank

999
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,200
for my proposal here.

1000
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,520
So I think Tomorrowland needs some sort of a new tagline,

1001
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,360
a new thing,

1002
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,680
because that's the way Disney does everything now.

1003
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,280
They add more words.

1004
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,160
So I would call it Tomorrowland Spaceport Infinity.

1005
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,480
That would be, and you could call it SPI, I guess,

1006
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,160
for short, SPI, called SPI or whatever.

1007
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,240
And the loose premise,

1008
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,120
which we've talked about this before,

1009
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,360
is it's sort of a port of entry.

1010
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,200
It's a place where, you know, spaceships land

1011
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,940
and they take off and aliens congregate

1012
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,560
and all the different IP congregate as well.

1013
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,560
So I was thinking, I want stuff that feels like

1014
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,520
nods to Disney history and sort of original stuff,

1015
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,160
but that's not gonna happen in the modern company.

1016
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,000
So let's see if we can cram it somewhere else.

1017
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,360
So I thought, well, why not go with Buzz Lightyear

1018
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,480
and change the name

1019
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,540
and change a little bit of what's inside.

1020
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,240
Call it Buzz Lightyear Adventures Alien Encounter.

1021
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,680
With an exclamation mark.

1022
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,120
So we talked about this a while ago,

1023
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,680
the whole hype of Guardians of the Galaxy,

1024
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,160
oh, they're gonna reference Epcot stuff,

1025
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
is loosely referenced.

1026
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,880
But I feel like in this Buzz Lightyear Adventures

1027
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,040
Alien Encounter, you keep the ride system,

1028
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,460
you keep it to shoot a ride,

1029
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,600
but you change sort of the narrative of the ride

1030
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,580
and you change every room to maybe be a different reference

1031
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,920
to old Tomorrowland stuff.

1032
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,920
So you shrink down in one, like, inner space

1033
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,700
and you do, you know, you can have your references

1034
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,080
to Alien Encounter itself with the excess tech and stuff.

1035
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,960
Zerg can still be involved, he's still kind of the bad guy,

1036
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,840
but maybe he's the one who kind of is torturing

1037
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,720
the alien from Alien Encounter.

1038
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,860
Then you kind of end up having to save that alien

1039
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,700
by the end.

1040
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,160
Which then there's that heart,

1041
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,920
then you're rooting for that character.

1042
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,680
Because like that character was sort of mistreated,

1043
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,380
the alien from Alien Encounter,

1044
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,600
but you can still have it be a little lightly scary.

1045
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,320
Everything's still gonna be kind of cartoonish

1046
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,000
to keep kind of in the same theme,

1047
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,520
Buzz Lightyear, the way it is now.

1048
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
Whatever, Space Rangers spin,

1049
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,400
is that what it's called in Disneyland?

1050
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,920
No, it's Astro Blaster,

1051
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,920
it's Disneyland, Space Rangers spin in Florida.

1052
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,000
I had to look this up yesterday too,

1053
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,360
and I did remember we went through this on the episode.

1054
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,280
But yeah, you can do like, if you had Wing's room,

1055
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,000
you can do Captain EO Evil Queen room here,

1056
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,880
and you can do it in like a cartoon Buzz Lightyear style.

1057
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,280
Oh, her rendered as the-

1058
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,680
Which would be fun.

1059
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,020
So you can give,

1060
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,820
because this is what they've been doing lately,

1061
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,320
I feel like, and this is what Country Bear BBQ Jamboree,

1062
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,120
the people in Imagineering do want to give us what we want,

1063
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,160
but they have to sneak it in.

1064
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,760
So this is my attempt to sneak it in here

1065
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,480
with an overlay, or not overlay,

1066
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,160
a redo that wouldn't be so expensive

1067
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
and would keep the ride system there.

1068
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,040
And would improve Buzz Lightyear,

1069
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,720
which I think is a good, it has room for improvement.

1070
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,480
I'm curious what an if you had Wing's room means.

1071
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,300
I don't really know,

1072
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,960
I should have fleshed that out a little more.

1073
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,080
It could just be a little like one of the hallways

1074
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,280
that take you from one room to the other.

1075
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,440
Like kind of like a burnt,

1076
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,240
maybe a burnt, like crumbling Eastern Airways sign.

1077
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,680
Sure, that could be a short little reference.

1078
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,560
That doesn't necessarily have to have its own room.

1079
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,680
They're just watching Buzz Lightyear

1080
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,520
take a comfortable flight.

1081
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
Sure, that's fine too.

1082
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
Seven and seven, please.

1083
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,680
Right, so yeah.

1084
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,720
He deserves a break.

1085
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,320
You can shoot Chairman Clench at the end of the ride,

1086
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,960
maybe a cartoon Chairman Clench.

1087
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,920
Zerg and Clench teaming up makes sense.

1088
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,280
That's fun. I like that.

1089
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,120
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1090
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,040
You could do like some like,

1091
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,400
you could kind of like America,

1092
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,080
you could have a little like America Sings references

1093
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,160
with like the characters in like little space outfits

1094
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,000
or something flying around.

1095
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,560
Like the eagle, the burlives eagle.

1096
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,480
Can I with lasers blow the head off that eagle?

1097
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,440
Only if you, there's a secret target.

1098
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,520
Okay, okay, you gotta be good.

1099
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
I was gonna say no out of goes to get it.

1100
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,600
Yeah, you have to be such a precise shot

1101
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,520
to actually have the head fly off,

1102
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,160
which they don't want normal park goers to see.

1103
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,040
It's a little violent.

1104
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,200
But like there's a techno version

1105
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,120
of like way down upon the Swanee River.

1106
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,960
The songs of that attraction.

1107
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,480
You already have one of those on your iPhone, right?

1108
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Yeah, well, my Bandcamp app, my Bandcamp creator app.

1109
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,120
You could just load that right in.

1110
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,520
That's announced at Honda Center

1111
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,840
and there's just one shriek from Jason.

1112
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,680
Right. Yeah.

1113
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,160
Baffled audience.

1114
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,680
Let's go.

1115
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,600
Yes.

1116
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,480
So that is, yes,

1117
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,880
that is not the most expensive thing in the world,

1118
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,280
but it is a nice little refresh.

1119
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,120
That's cool.

1120
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,680
With the references that we like.

1121
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,520
Great.

1122
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,360
And we will feel take,

1123
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,200
because we, us Disneyland weirdos,

1124
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,760
wanna feel taken care of.

1125
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,040
And this is the type of thing

1126
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,680
that makes us feel taken care of.

1127
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,480
I don't think I even need to say this

1128
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,680
because they're gonna do it.

1129
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,520
Yeah.

1130
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,680
But if it's a ride full of Easter eggs,

1131
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,240
you gotta get an A113 in there.

1132
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,080
Oh, okay.

1133
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,920
Yeah, so that we can,

1134
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,880
and that's code on some spaceship or something.

1135
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,280
But that way you can get,

1136
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,080
every hundredth car is a car with nerds going,

1137
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,040
A113, that's the classroom that's a college

1138
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,200
where a lot of the animators, Tim Burton is,

1139
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,320
so it's kind of a message to each other

1140
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,560
that they put in the movies.

1141
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah.

1142
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
So yeah, that'll be in there.

1143
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,320
And there'll be maybe a target

1144
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,680
that will illuminate it or something too

1145
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,080
to really make sure nerds point it out.

1146
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,480
So it gets bigger when,

1147
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,840
if you know the right target to make it bigger and appear,

1148
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,200
then you can even loudly or even more loudly say

1149
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,040
to the person next to you.

1150
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,200
It kind of gives you implicit permission

1151
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,520
to stop whispering that.

1152
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,600
I think that stuff's important to point out,

1153
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,240
especially if you're on a date or something at Disneyland

1154
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
because pointing it out can help facilitate

1155
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,640
the end of a relationship that's not meant to be.

1156
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,480
Right.

1157
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,300
Which is nice, yeah.

1158
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,140
It really gives the girl an out.

1159
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,840
I'm saying girl, it's probably gonna be a girl,

1160
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,800
probably, more likely.

1161
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Yeah.

1162
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,480
Probably, yeah.

1163
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,320
Yeah, it's a good test.

1164
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,160
Probably.

1165
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,320
And A113 is a CalArts classroom

1166
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,240
for an Imagineering.

1167
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,720
Well, now I have to just say the real,

1168
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,880
no, that's a CalArts thing, yeah.

1169
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,720
Okay.

1170
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,880
Because a lot of the, now I don't remember.

1171
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,960
It's like, it's Brad Bird and it's Lasseter

1172
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,780
and it's Tim Burton.

1173
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,620
Tim Burton.

1174
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,600
It's a room they all would have known.

1175
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,440
Like a studio.

1176
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,280
It's wild.

1177
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,120
Yeah, so every 10th car.

1178
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,520
It is actually interesting.

1179
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,640
I'm just, I said it facetiously.

1180
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,200
Every 10th car is into it,

1181
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,680
but every 9th car is complaining about the prevalence

1182
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,000
of the CalArts style,

1183
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,040
which I've seen online before

1184
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,080
and I don't understand what they're talking about.

1185
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,920
No, yeah, I don't know.

1186
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
That's lost on me.

1187
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,760
I think it's something about animation,

1188
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,160
specifically animation, television animation style.

1189
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,000
Hmm.

1190
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,600
Okay, well, we'll look into that.

1191
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,640
No, I don't know.

1192
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,480
No, it's not.

1193
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,320
You don't think we should look into it?

1194
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,360
I'd say let's not.

1195
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,200
Yeah, yeah.

1196
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,020
Let's not look into it.

1197
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,040
Yeah, I'm sorry all these guys made a bunch

1198
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,680
of good movies and shows.

1199
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,520
Mm-hmm.

1200
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,540
Oh, well, yeah.

1201
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,080
Star Tours, the adventures continue.

1202
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,840
The adventures continue.

1203
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,520
That's what it is.

1204
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,560
I can't think of any of the names of these rides.

1205
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,160
The ride that names no one calls it?

1206
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah.

1207
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,840
Right, basically the same,

1208
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,440
but we're adding BB-8 to the queue.

1209
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,600
BB-8's gonna be with R2-3PO.

1210
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,360
That's gonna get a big cheer in the room.

1211
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,920
Doesn't seem the most expensive thing.

1212
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,400
And then we're gonna just get a couple new scenes.

1213
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Canto Bight from Last Jedi.

1214
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,640
We're gonna do.

1215
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,160
Oh, Canto Bight's good for a, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1216
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,640
Yeah, that would work in a Star Tours.

1217
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,600
And more of like a Bespin-like scene too,

1218
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,160
a Cloud City scene.

1219
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah.

1220
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,820
A big Cloud City guy.

1221
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,960
And let's even flirt with the idea

1222
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,360
that it's like more of a calm scene.

1223
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,400
It's a pleasant scene,

1224
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,680
because I always talk about.

1225
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,520
That it's a what?

1226
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,360
It's like a calming.

1227
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,200
Oh, more of a calm.

1228
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,020
It's a calm scene.

1229
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,860
It would have to be the first one

1230
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,700
because you want to end on a big climax.

1231
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,280
I thought you said like Morpha Calm.

1232
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,820
I'm like, I don't know that planet.

1233
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,660
That's cool.

1234
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,880
We can make up our own planets too.

1235
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,400
And you go to Morpha Calm.

1236
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,240
Morpha Calm.

1237
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,880
And then just more characters that can

1238
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,440
like send their transmission.

1239
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,200
Max Rebo.

1240
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,040
Give us a Max Rebo.

1241
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,680
Give us, I guess, Figuring Dan and the Modal Nodes.

1242
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,400
Three of them, or how many?

1243
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,240
There's six of them.

1244
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,060
There's a lot to fit in there,

1245
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,400
but you can do it. Yeah, but.

1246
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,000
Just really like, let's open it up

1247
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
as far as like all the different characters.

1248
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,580
All the pod racers could contact you.

1249
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,340
And again, this isn't the most expensive thing

1250
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,680
in the world, and it's a nice thing

1251
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,880
that Star Tours already does this stuff.

1252
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,240
And I think if you just give us,

1253
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,800
throw us a couple more things,

1254
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,840
we'll feel like, okay, yes,

1255
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,320
Star Tours is a little refreshed.

1256
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,800
I like the idea enough to give you permission

1257
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,480
to say one of the names of the pod racers

1258
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,320
I know you want to say.

1259
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,780
No, I don't want to, no.

1260
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,620
No, really.

1261
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,440
I don't need to.

1262
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,280
I want you to.

1263
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,240
Can I say it?

1264
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,080
All right, let's Jason do it.

1265
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,920
Jason can say it, yeah.

1266
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,880
Okay.

1267
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,680
Team Toppa Gaileys.

1268
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,520
All right, thank you.

1269
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,360
Very good.

1270
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,200
Team Toppa Gaileys.

1271
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,040
All right, everybody earned that

1272
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,880
with their good effort. I don't want to say

1273
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,320
Juan Sandage or

1274
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,040
Odie Randrell.

1275
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,960
I don't want to say any of the names.

1276
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,800
I don't like it anymore.

1277
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,760
And I shouldn't make you.

1278
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,600
I shouldn't make you say.

1279
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,920
I don't like to say the names.

1280
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,680
Astral Orbiter, gone.

1281
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,760
Taking that thing.

1282
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,600
It's almost like that.

1283
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,640
It's like if they only did that.

1284
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,360
Yes, that would be a big step.

1285
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,200
That thing is gone.

1286
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,400
Right now, if you don't know,

1287
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,520
it's right at the front of Tomorrowland

1288
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,760
and it is so inconvenient.

1289
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,840
You got to walk around it.

1290
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,400
There's always bottlenecks happening.

1291
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,960
We've talked about it before.

1292
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,360
Great idea in theory,

1293
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,120
but with how crowded Disneyland is,

1294
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,040
it just, it's not worth it being there.

1295
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,060
It would only work

1296
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,660
if everything had like 20% more,

1297
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,500
if you were building a Tomorrowland from the ground up

1298
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,420
and that was your entry point, great.

1299
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,020
But it's a pretty narrow,

1300
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,500
the main avenue, whatever you want to call it,

1301
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,980
Tomorrow Avenue.

1302
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,900
Right.

1303
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,860
Just, yeah, it's tough.

1304
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:05,580
And we're ripping out people mover track

1305
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,060
that goes down the walkway there.

1306
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,900
Okay, okay.

1307
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,100
Because that also is in the way

1308
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,380
and just inconvenient

1309
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,780
and obviously they haven't done anything within a while,

1310
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,900
but that's got to go for traffic reasons.

1311
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,580
And you think about other Tomorrow Avenues

1312
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,940
in other parks and they don't have that overhang

1313
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,660
and it feels more open and free.

1314
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,500
Yes.

1315
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,460
And then the, now that we've questioned what it's called,

1316
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,260
I'm just thinking Orvidon.

1317
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,100
That thing's gone.

1318
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,220
I'm pulling that thing out too.

1319
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,060
Orvidon's out.

1320
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,900
I'm pulling that whole stretch of stuff out

1321
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,020
to open that walkway up

1322
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,860
because that's just, it's all inconvenient at this point

1323
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,700
and it's got to go.

1324
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,540
And there's nothing in there.

1325
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,900
And there's nothing in there.

1326
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,860
This is somewhat expensive,

1327
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,060
but okay, it's got to go, I think.

1328
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,900
And I do that,

1329
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,940
feels like they would do that

1330
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,020
with a modern day, decent budget.

1331
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,220
But it's just nothing.

1332
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,580
That's not even replaced by, there's no tower.

1333
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,100
No.

1334
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,580
No, I don't want to put anything there.

1335
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,740
I don't want to put anything there.

1336
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,140
Some more planters?

1337
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,180
With fresh sod?

1338
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,380
Keep in mind, yeah, if you had 12 bags,

1339
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,020
Mike's getting at least 15.

1340
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,540
Yeah, that's, hmm, okay.

1341
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,020
Matt, we'll think about the planters.

1342
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,020
I'm not sure.

1343
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,500
I'm iffy on the planters.

1344
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,180
Okay, fair enough.

1345
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,420
Space Mountain basically stays the same, I think,

1346
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,580
with this, Space Mountain's still a great ride.

1347
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,460
Would I like them to do what Tokyo's doing

1348
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
is rip it out and put in the coolest thing ever?

1349
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,900
Yes, doesn't seem likely.

1350
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,660
They're not even doing that in Florida.

1351
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,980
So there's no way they're gonna do it here.

1352
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,100
Well, if you had to, look, if you had to rocket launch

1353
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,140
or blow one up, you would choose Florida.

1354
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,980
Yeah, of course.

1355
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,820
It's pretty rough.

1356
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,900
It doesn't have the fun score and smoothness of Anaheim.

1357
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,420
It doesn't have any music, right?

1358
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,260
Huh?

1359
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,100
It doesn't have any music?

1360
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,920
It's just eerily.

1361
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,760
It's like kind of quiet.

1362
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,580
I think it's a lot of click-clacking.

1363
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,100
And someone out there is listening and saying,

1364
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,660
but all that stuff you said is what's good about that.

1365
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,860
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1366
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,700
I understand.

1367
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,740
You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1368
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,860
I really like the Christmas party version

1369
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,060
where they blast you with really loud Christmas music

1370
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,700
and yellow and green lights.

1371
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,820
Right.

1372
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,660
That is fun.

1373
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,500
I wish they would do that out here.

1374
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,260
Well, let's put that in yours.

1375
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,100
That's part of mine too.

1376
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,940
Good, yeah, yeah.

1377
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,780
Nice, nice.

1378
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,500
But I think they can, I swear they've done this

1379
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,100
and I've seen no one confirm this online,

1380
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,260
but when Space Mountain had a redo a couple months ago,

1381
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,420
a year ago or something,

1382
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,260
it did feel like the effects with the stars were brighter

1383
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,180
and I don't know if that any,

1384
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,060
I don't know what the technology is behind

1385
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,900
making the stars brighter but not showing the track.

1386
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,120
And somebody, I'm probably sounding like an idiot,

1387
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,300
but there's probably little stuff like that they could do

1388
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,340
or whatever tricks they've learned on Guardians

1389
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,620
to make that thing feel so bright but still not feel like.

1390
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,940
It's a very high contrast experience, isn't it?

1391
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,780
Yeah.

1392
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,860
The whites are very white and the blacks are very black.

1393
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,060
And that's trickier because the track is, I think,

1394
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,420
a lot closer together on Space Mountain.

1395
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,020
It's like this big cylinder in my mind.

1396
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,980
And really, yeah, you've probably got room to project

1397
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,380
and separate in that new Guardians building.

1398
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,660
So I know you can't do something so incredible,

1399
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,380
but I don't know, I kinda like the Star Wars overlay they do

1400
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,780
so more of that stuff.

1401
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,100
So you could announce little things like that.

1402
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,460
There's some improvements coming to the Star Wars

1403
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,700
Space Mountain overlay or whatever, but.

1404
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,460
I'm mostly not a fan of the Star Wars overlay

1405
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,860
but there's a move in it where you kind of,

1406
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:31,860
there is a real surprise jump scare of a blast.

1407
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,540
Some ship blows up. Yes, yeah.

1408
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,700
And you kinda duck under, you're heading right for it

1409
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,060
and then you duck under it with barely any time.

1410
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,780
And I would say some equivalent move that's always there

1411
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,460
in a non-Star Wars version.

1412
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,060
Oh yeah, that would be cool.

1413
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,820
Like a meteor shower or blast or like a meteor.

1414
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,420
Or just some, I don't know, supernova.

1415
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, two comets collide.

1416
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,860
Oh yeah, that's cool.

1417
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,020
Yeah, something like that would be cool.

1418
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,300
Because yeah, the way they have it, it feels like.

1419
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,940
Or just an astronaut's head explodes without it.

1420
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,580
Which is what happens when an astronaut

1421
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,580
doesn't have his helmet on.

1422
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,460
His head gradually expands and then bursts like a balloon.

1423
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,340
Like that Simpsons joke.

1424
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,020
It feels like a lot of the Star Wars effects on that overlay

1425
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,180
is just they've put like a long neon strip

1426
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,980
of like green and red to simulate the fire

1427
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,100
from the X-Wing or the TIE Fighters.

1428
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,420
And then they just play the noise and then do it.

1429
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,460
And it kinda works.

1430
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,300
Very effective.

1431
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,140
It does.

1432
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,340
Well, some of that shit's simple in the first movie.

1433
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,500
So it's like that, it's very, yeah, just basic.

1434
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,900
The opening score, going up the hill and stuff,

1435
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,940
that really.

1436
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,220
I like that, yeah.

1437
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,780
I guess as we add it up, I don't know, yeah.

1438
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,820
There's value to it.

1439
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,380
But I'm saying like that's what we're gonna do

1440
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,220
with this overlay.

1441
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,420
There's gonna be light little effects changes,

1442
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,520
but it's not gonna be, we're not putting a lot of money

1443
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,700
into a new space mountain in this pitch.

1444
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,820
It's not, I don't think a required piece of.

1445
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,460
No, it's not, again, I wish they were,

1446
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,140
I said this before, if they would replace it with Guardians,

1447
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,620
I would actually be fine with it, like in Florida.

1448
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,020
No space mountain.

1449
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,500
Oh, in Florida, oh, okay.

1450
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,300
Like the Guardians' coaster, I'm saying, in Florida.

1451
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1452
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,260
I'm like, oh, that's, that's.

1453
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,860
I thought you were saying replace space mountain

1454
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,220
in Florida with Guardians,

1455
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,740
which I would also be fine with, second Guardians.

1456
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,580
Sure, yeah, too.

1457
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,580
In two parks, that's great.

1458
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,220
Oh, yeah, that would be great.

1459
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,060
It's cheaper, yeah, you don't have to build

1460
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,020
a new space mountain.

1461
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,020
But what I am excited about in regards to space mountain

1462
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,540
is next to space mountain, the Star Wars launch,

1463
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,940
current Star Wars launch bay.

1464
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,860
What are we gonna do with this thing?

1465
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,020
This thing has been sitting,

1466
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,020
this is maybe the most offensive part of Tomorrowland

1467
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,180
in a lot of ways.

1468
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,020
Yeah, I've said it for a long time.

1469
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,860
Yeah, I am.

1470
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,500
And it's just sitting there, it's had the house

1471
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,300
of the future, or whatever they called it.

1472
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,460
Was it called the house of the future

1473
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,320
when it was just the weird, like.

1474
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,500
Oh, the intervention.

1475
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,820
It was just a part of intervention.

1476
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,660
Sorry, yes.

1477
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,500
Yeah.

1478
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,700
Nobody liked that, and then it's,

1479
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,740
now it's like meet and greets for Star Wars characters,

1480
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,820
which there's fun stuff in there,

1481
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,900
but it's just, it's so much space and whatever.

1482
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,100
I think what you gotta do with this

1483
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,940
is turn it into a big restaurant.

1484
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,860
Yeah.

1485
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,980
I think that. Oh, good.

1486
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,380
Now, you can do it a couple ways.

1487
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,940
You could keep the building as it is.

1488
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,460
I mean, it rotates, but you don't have to do that.

1489
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,500
Or you could just demolish it

1490
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,060
and build a new two-story restaurant.

1491
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,900
Yeah.

1492
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,660
And have the top part be a bar lounge

1493
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,780
with a nice terrace out there.

1494
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,620
Yeah.

1495
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,140
And this thing is gonna be packed every night.

1496
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,740
There's no one who wouldn't wanna do it.

1497
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,580
Make it Blue Bayou level, make,

1498
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,900
I mean, that's for Disney, that's high level,

1499
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,900
but it's, you know, be a be, depending on what you get.

1500
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,020
But you can have a cocktail up there.

1501
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,340
You can have a nice meal.

1502
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,180
You can have different rooms

1503
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,420
because there's a lot of real estate.

1504
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,220
So you can do some of the space restaurant

1505
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,980
and up-cott stuff in here, too.

1506
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,860
So you could have different, like, be our guest.

1507
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,300
You could have different rooms that are, you know,

1508
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,260
simulating different parts of a spaceship.

1509
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,500
One thing is you're actually in space.

1510
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,420
One, you're, I don't know, dining in the capsule.

1511
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,940
It's a smaller room or whatever.

1512
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,780
Sure.

1513
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,620
Or, yeah.

1514
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,940
Oh, yeah, yeah, like a big round table

1515
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,660
and kind of a centrifugal room, yeah, yeah.

1516
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,660
So, like, I just think this makes a lot of sense

1517
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,100
because there's, like, Blue Bayou, I guess,

1518
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,660
is technically the best restaurant in Disneyland

1519
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,540
other than Club 33.

1520
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,700
Yeah.

1521
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,540
Right?

1522
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,380
Yeah.

1523
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,220
It feels like I'm wondering why they haven't done more

1524
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,060
of this is what I'm saying.

1525
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,220
And they've never done, Disneyland has never done

1526
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,780
a be our guest, not that I have no idea

1527
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,060
of the actual quality of that place.

1528
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,820
I think it's gone down since it opened.

1529
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,660
Okay, okay.

1530
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,100
If it became a pre-fixed menu, it used to be like,

1531
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,180
oh, go with breakfast, it's counter-serve,

1532
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,540
and it's like, you can see it all for really cheap,

1533
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,460
and they're like, pre-fixed lunch and dinner.

1534
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,300
Yeah.

1535
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,660
I think it might be still okay, but I think it was,

1536
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,900
I went pretty, no, I guess not soon, a couple years after,

1537
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,500
and I thought it was really good,

1538
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
and the next time I went, it was fine.

1539
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,620
It was okay to find.

1540
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,140
Yeah, we definitely don't have, like,

1541
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,220
there's not like a skipper's canteen or anything.

1542
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,060
Yeah, exactly.

1543
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:23,880
Yeah.

1544
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,260
Yeah, Disneyland is pretty weak

1545
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,380
with the sit-down restaurants.

1546
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,220
Right.

1547
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,860
What I like about this is you're sneaking in original ideas,

1548
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,760
original stuff in here, but it's covered by like,

1549
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,060
oh, the food and beverage offerings

1550
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,380
will pay it off in a year.

1551
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,720
Right, this is something we would be excited about,

1552
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,900
but this is just a money-generating thing.

1553
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,220
That will be cool and be like, attraction-adjacent.

1554
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,060
Yes.

1555
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,300
You know, it's okay that it's not a revolving

1556
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,140
theatrical show.

1557
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,900
Now, if they're getting very ambitious,

1558
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,740
you demolish the building, and you build

1559
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,060
a new two-story building, and you put the Astro Orbiter

1560
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,500
on top of it.

1561
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,340
Oh.

1562
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,160
Oh, jeez.

1563
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,900
Which now they can, now it can't support it.

1564
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,580
Yes, because you would have to destroy it.

1565
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,220
I'm sure it can't hold it as it is.

1566
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,040
That's cool.

1567
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,620
But then, yeah, so then you could be like,

1568
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,820
you could really even bring out the terraces,

1569
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,460
and you could have it so you can kind of see

1570
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,420
the Astro Orbiter above you.

1571
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,180
You could do it in a different, cool way,

1572
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,860
where there were a lot of just opportunities

1573
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:29,740
for interesting seating and interesting vantage points.

1574
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,300
I guess you could load people.

1575
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,100
They would have to take an elevator up to get it,

1576
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,660
but it would be kind of like, I guess,

1577
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,620
you could do it like the PeopleMover in Florida,

1578
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,660
where there's a moving.

1579
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,260
That's how rocket jets work in Florida.

1580
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,100
Yes.

1581
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,980
And you could say you could have a queue

1582
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,820
within that big new structure,

1583
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,620
which could kind of come out a little bit.

1584
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,300
It could sort of go west because you've demolished

1585
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,540
the waste of space of the Orbidon Tower.

1586
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,240
Right, and then there could be a little VIP entrance

1587
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,740
up to the Astro Orbiters.

1588
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,240
After you go to a drink at the bar,

1589
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,460
you go up and you get a little rocket ride

1590
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,180
around Tomorrowland.

1591
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,980
And then that sounds like heaven to me.

1592
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,900
Yeah.

1593
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,620
Are you saying you get a special entrance

1594
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,900
because you're?

1595
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,740
Maybe there's a special entrance, yeah.

1596
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,460
A little perk, a little fast pass perk.

1597
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,020
A little fast pass perk, yes.

1598
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,180
Because you ate at the new, at one of the, at the grill.

1599
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,140
And there's like a special little entrance

1600
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,060
or elevator that you take.

1601
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,060
That's like the elevator at the restaurant in Epcot.

1602
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,980
It's nothing like eating a full-size lamb chop

1603
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,980
and then going on the Astro Orbiter immediately.

1604
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,220
Yes, being around for a while.

1605
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,100
Just a quick seven and seven and pork chop

1606
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,020
and then get right on the Astro Orbiter.

1607
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,060
Hey, if you can't handle that,

1608
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,100
you should not be in space, you know?

1609
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,180
That's a good point.

1610
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,460
If you can't, being with a big pork chop in your stomach.

1611
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,020
It's kind of a test.

1612
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,700
Get to Adventureland, pal.

1613
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,300
Get to Frontierland.

1614
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,760
You can't cut it in space with the rest of us.

1615
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,380
I got some pitches for the name.

1616
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,220
Oh, great.

1617
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,780
Space Mountain Station.

1618
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,420
It would have to be called Space Mountain Station Restaurant.

1619
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,340
Spaceship Eat is another one of my pitches.

1620
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,820
Oh, that's really good.

1621
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,140
So you get your Disney reference there.

1622
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,900
Somewhere in mine, this isn't better than that,

1623
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,340
but I was toying with an idea in mind

1624
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:24,140
with the phrase Space Mountain Summit.

1625
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,980
Okay.

1626
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,820
Like that.

1627
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,860
Or Base Camp or something.

1628
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,340
Something that uses the mountain aspect of it.

1629
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,340
But I think Spaceship Eat's probably the one.

1630
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,660
Spaceship Eat is funny.

1631
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,860
Yeah.

1632
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,740
I have some other ones down where I would Google it

1633
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,340
and I'd be like, is anything called that?

1634
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,380
I was like, call the bar Bar Orbit.

1635
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,020
I don't know if it's just a name

1636
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,300
or there's actually a restaurant or something called that.

1637
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,700
What was the name of, you know how Disney did have

1638
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,500
a restaurant in the theme building at LAX,

1639
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,180
which is the big 60s mod.

1640
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,020
No, the Encounter?

1641
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,220
The Z-Structure.

1642
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,060
Is that what it was called?

1643
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,420
I think it was called The Encounter.

1644
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,800
Oh, okay, okay.

1645
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,640
Yeah.

1646
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,460
Bring it on back.

1647
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,300
That's what we gotta look into.

1648
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,740
There's a lot of interesting stuff.

1649
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,620
Closed now, but a lot of interesting history.

1650
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,340
I felt like it was only barely open.

1651
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,860
Yeah, and really sporadically.

1652
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,700
All right.

1653
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,760
So yeah, we could name it different things.

1654
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,680
Some little things, Magic Eye Theater,

1655
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,900
which just is usually like a preview of a movie.

1656
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,820
I feel like what you could do is turn it

1657
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,540
into a meet and greet walkthrough,

1658
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,740
like the way they do Chewbacca,

1659
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,140
where you kind of go through a tiny little section

1660
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,220
of a rebel base or something,

1661
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,740
and then you meet Chewbacca and it's in a themed room

1662
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,060
and the photographer's obviously already there,

1663
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,300
but we could do a full retro Mickey and Friends

1664
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:50,300
spaceship outfit, kind of space station meet and greet,

1665
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,820
and then it would be a pretty good people eater

1666
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,580
because you would line up the same way

1667
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,260
you would line up for Captain EO or Honey,

1668
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,060
I Shrunk, the audience, and then they would go in

1669
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,900
and they just kind of go in,

1670
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,260
because you could, it's a couple hundred seats theater

1671
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,860
or something, you could probably change that

1672
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,220
into just a little bit of like a windy maze

1673
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,900
that looks kind of Space Mountain Q-ish,

1674
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,380
and then you get to the end and it's like a little like,

1675
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,260
you could use this, probably use the same screen,

1676
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,020
it's just like a screen that has,

1677
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,780
I guess you couldn't, it would have to be a video screen,

1678
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,820
not a projection screen like it is in there,

1679
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,980
so that doesn't make sense,

1680
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,820
but it would be like a big space window or whatever,

1681
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,860
and Mickey, Minnie, everybody,

1682
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,440
but wearing the retro outfits,

1683
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,020
which is another thing that's gonna get a big pop

1684
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,060
if you go, oh, we're bringing back the Disney characters

1685
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,180
in those old space outfits.

1686
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,300
Which I don't think I've ever heard

1687
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,160
officially acknowledged by the company,

1688
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,780
but I feel like everybody would know,

1689
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,940
at least if you're at that. I think so.

1690
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,660
Yeah, yeah, the little space outfits.

1691
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,500
The little space outfits. We want the little space outfits.

1692
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,820
They're in that photo spread of like,

1693
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,060
was it Vogue from 91 or something,

1694
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,420
or it was a high fashion magazine photo spread

1695
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,140
of people in different outfits around Disney World,

1696
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:07,420
and they were with the space Mickey and Minnie in Epcot.

1697
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,340
Wow. Yeah.

1698
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,940
Good enough for Vogue.

1699
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,820
Yeah, so they can show that at the presentation

1700
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,240
if they're doing my ideas,

1701
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,300
but yeah, that's, you basically keep the building the same,

1702
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,540
and then that's just- And now they've gained

1703
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,980
a committed meet and greet of characters,

1704
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:23,580
but in this different new way.

1705
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,220
And then flexible,

1706
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,360
so you can do different characters in there,

1707
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,980
depending, to keep it fresh,

1708
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,220
if everybody has already had their pictures

1709
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,900
with the little space suit Disney characters.

1710
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,460
Perhaps, perhaps.

1711
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,460
A Disneyland place and presence for Figment.

1712
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,460
Well, that's an interesting idea.

1713
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,940
Very interesting. I never thought of that.

1714
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,780
That sounded like I have it coming up.

1715
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,980
There's no reason to not have Figment also.

1716
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,820
That's an interesting-

1717
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,140
In some small way here.

1718
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,580
I kind of don't know if I agree with it.

1719
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,020
You like making- I've never thought about it before.

1720
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:58,180
Figment a special, only Epcot.

1721
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,780
Truly, I've never thought about that before.

1722
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,660
Jason, have you ever thought about that before?

1723
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,620
I haven't thought about it before,

1724
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,700
but I think enough time has passed

1725
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,620
of him being an original Epcot.

1726
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,980
It's been like 50 years now, or 40 years.

1727
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,680
I can be sold on that.

1728
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,520
Yeah.

1729
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,360
But it is interesting,

1730
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,180
because it's almost like it felt shocking to me.

1731
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,020
I didn't consider it.

1732
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,100
Wow, you just said.

1733
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,940
So strange that he went,

1734
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,300
well, as strange as Mickey Mouse appearing

1735
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,500
at the end of a show of Star Wars characters at-

1736
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,020
Well, that's just exciting.

1737
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,140
Disney, at a Disney park.

1738
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,180
Curious to see if anyone's doing that.

1739
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,020
Oh, man.

1740
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,260
In our, oh, a permanent hyperspace hoopla.

1741
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,300
Oh, man.

1742
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:41,200
I unfortunately picked stuff that I think they would do.

1743
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,780
But I'd love to see that.

1744
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,620
Figment could-

1745
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,460
Time to rewrite, then.

1746
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,540
What about Figment having like a brother or something?

1747
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,700
A West Coast brother?

1748
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,860
A West Coast brother.

1749
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,940
Eric.

1750
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,980
Eric.

1751
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,820
Eric.

1752
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,660
Figment.

1753
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,100
He doesn't have a whimsical name.

1754
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:56,940
Right, right.

1755
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,780
It's Figment's brother, Eric.

1756
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,620
Parents got tired at number two.

1757
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,500
Ironically ran out of imagination.

1758
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,980
Your grandfather is Eric, right?

1759
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,820
Right.

1760
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,660
Let's come with that.

1761
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,480
Family name.

1762
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,940
He's a great guy.

1763
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,220
Okay, little stuff.

1764
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,460
Autopia stays the same.

1765
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,580
We're doing the electric cars in whatever, four years.

1766
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,500
It's a lot of real estate.

1767
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,700
I'd love to demolish it.

1768
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,900
Doesn't seem like it's gonna happen.

1769
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,980
Maybe within your, you can't.

1770
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,820
That's what I felt.

1771
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,900
That's how I felt.

1772
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,980
Especially now I'm trying to keep them,

1773
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,220
I know they're going to do electric cars,

1774
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,580
they say they are, but we'll see.

1775
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,500
Sub's staying the same.

1776
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,660
And with Tomorrowland Terrace and stuff for the food there,

1777
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,300
I just have, make the food better.

1778
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,980
Just make the food better.

1779
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,820
Yeah.

1780
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,660
Just like have it 25% better.

1781
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,540
It doesn't even have to be different items.

1782
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,380
No.

1783
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,820
It's done better.

1784
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,840
And I love the stage it comes out from underground.

1785
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,400
That stays the same.

1786
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,580
I just want more live entertainment.

1787
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,580
And it doesn't have to be like a rockabilly band

1788
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,140
playing in Tomorrowland at night, but it wouldn't hurt.

1789
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:55,980
I wouldn't mind it.

1790
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,860
Because I always like when you go over to Tomorrowland

1791
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,180
and there's a band playing at night.

1792
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,620
Even if you don't stop and watch it,

1793
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,860
it just feels like something's happening here tonight.

1794
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,700
So yeah, more of that.

1795
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,180
We had fun talking about Pride Night with Henry,

1796
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,620
and I'm like leather stitched all the time.

1797
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,660
Why not?

1798
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,660
Let's just deploy all of that.

1799
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,940
I mean, the biggest risk is that some right-wing crank

1800
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,300
talks about it for nine days,

1801
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,740
and then it never is thought about or controversial again.

1802
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,580
Right.

1803
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:35,820
It's gonna ride out exactly one cycle of Libs of TikTok,

1804
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,420
and then they can do whatever.

1805
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,820
Then Stitch could dance for years to come.

1806
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,460
That is, I would love to go back,

1807
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,540
teach a media literacy class at Ithaca,

1808
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:50,380
and go like, okay, first things first, no comment.

1809
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,200
Second thing, wait it out.

1810
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,540
Those nine days are gonna fly by

1811
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:58,140
if you focus on other things.

1812
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,660
This is you teaching kids,

1813
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,300
well, you're teaching kids how to ride out a scandal

1814
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,140
that's a class you're gonna do at Ithaca.

1815
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,620
Not an actual scandal.

1816
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:10,620
No, I don't encourage like Logan Paul's in this forest.

1817
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,540
I don't want something like that.

1818
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,220
So he's Logan Paul's on a talk show,

1819
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,060
and they're like, well,

1820
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,660
how did you get over that scandal last year?

1821
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,100
And he goes, well, my teacher Jason Sheridan,

1822
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,980
when I took his class at Ithaca,

1823
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,700
he taught me how to ride out anything bad

1824
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,540
that I've ever done.

1825
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,860
Now, I don't know that I'm ready to be the scapegoat.

1826
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,420
That might be lesson number three.

1827
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,900
Pick a well-placed scapegoat

1828
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:39,340
that if you get caught in something, you can blame them.

1829
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:42,100
Well, this seems like a different philosophy

1830
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,580
than what you said in the first two bits.

1831
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,860
No, no, no, well, the first one is for manufactured

1832
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,820
bullshit right-wing outrage.

1833
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,660
Yeah, okay.

1834
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,480
Okay.

1835
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,660
But this is, now you're,

1836
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,740
but you are getting into the territory, I assume,

1837
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,700
of the show Scandal.

1838
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,660
You are kind of, and I don't, I can't,

1839
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,500
I have no further details about the show Scandal.

1840
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,500
I have only seen like one or two of Scandal.

1841
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,060
I like Kerry Washington a lot.

1842
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,020
Jason, you're turning into a regular Olivia Pope.

1843
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,860
Oh yeah.

1844
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,660
I did know the name Olivia Pope.

1845
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,660
I didn't, I haven't had to look up.

1846
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,180
You were all nervous when you were presenting,

1847
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,340
but now you're very confident when you're telling people

1848
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,180
just to ride out a scandal.

1849
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,420
To the pressures off, I did my project,

1850
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,740
and now I just chilling.

1851
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,740
Just saying you're very comfortable

1852
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,180
with this part of presenting and teaching.

1853
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,700
Because you're in the hot seat now.

1854
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,780
I am in the hot seat, yeah.

1855
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,620
You're in the tank.

1856
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,980
Because the sod concern is off his back.

1857
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,540
The sod people don't have sniper's dots on his.

1858
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,340
I've blocked all those numbers.

1859
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,100
We have delivery date and payment date, okay?

1860
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:42,100
It's accounts, payable, and receivables problem now.

1861
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:48,000
So there's one final question mark on my presentation,

1862
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,760
because I do think what I just presented,

1863
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,760
if presented in the sexy, demoral way,

1864
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,280
would be pretty popular, and people would be excited.

1865
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,120
I think Carousel is like an amended space.

1866
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,960
Yeah.

1867
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,920
That's great, I think that's huge.

1868
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,840
Just that.

1869
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,560
Just that would work.

1870
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,400
Now, on our Patreon, on our second gate episode,

1871
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,280
I predicted that Tomorrowland is gonna close D23.

1872
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,520
That there's going to be an announcement

1873
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,840
about New Tomorrowland.

1874
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,720
And I also made an even riskier prediction

1875
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,800
about some kind of people mover coming back.

1876
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,640
Okay.

1877
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,680
And this has been weighing on me now for days,

1878
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,540
because I start, I'm really doubting myself now.

1879
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,960
If it fits in your budget range.

1880
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,100
Because, yes, and part of it is because I was just like,

1881
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,800
to me it feels like they don't have anything big

1882
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,320
for Disneyland, and they always wanna close

1883
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,400
on a hometown announcement.

1884
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,440
Now, I was thinking about how you said that

1885
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,480
in that episode, and then I was like,

1886
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,780
has that ever actually happened?

1887
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,540
I feel like it has.

1888
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,360
Just not in a while.

1889
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,420
But not in a while.

1890
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,260
Because lately it's just like.

1891
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,060
You know, it's like beyond big,

1892
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,060
the last two years ago it was just, there was nothing.

1893
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,060
It was like, we're thinking about what would happen

1894
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,380
in Florida, whatever.

1895
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:02,940
If your hometown likes the word maybe.

1896
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,700
We could, I know you like that, Anaheim.

1897
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:10,700
Destination D23 maybe has a more localized conclusion.

1898
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,100
Also, sometimes what I might be thinking of too

1899
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,540
is that they'll be like, and we're giving everybody

1900
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,700
a free something fast pass to go,

1901
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,740
if you're in the park today, you can go.

1902
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,580
Whatever.

1903
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,420
If you have a reservation on your ticket, you can use this.

1904
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,700
Also, my logic was, there just doesn't feel like

1905
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,860
a lot of stuff they're gonna fully announce

1906
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,460
where it's going for Disneyland that's gonna open

1907
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,620
in the next five to six years.

1908
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,100
And to me, it's like, there's a couple things,

1909
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,580
and then Tomorrowland has to happen now

1910
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:41,140
before Disneyland, Florida, or else it's not happening.

1911
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,800
So that's sort of part of my logic for like,

1912
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,980
I feel like it's gonna close with Tomorrowland.

1913
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,020
That's a guess, I don't know,

1914
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,820
I don't have any insider information, but I said.

1915
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,500
You've programmed a great show.

1916
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,140
I just don't know if it's realistic.

1917
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,260
And I understand, I understand.

1918
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:54,840
We'll see how accurate I am.

1919
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,820
But I said, I think this is gonna be maybe

1920
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,460
like a new people mover.

1921
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:02,060
And I am starting to doubt my prediction.

1922
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,020
I'll keep my bet, I'm not gonna go back on my bet.

1923
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,100
A man of your word and your money.

1924
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,440
But I'm looking at this Google map.

1925
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,020
I'm studying this Google map overhead view.

1926
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,420
I did a lot of this too, yeah.

1927
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,220
Trying to figure out where we could comfortably

1928
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:19,060
make a new Tomorrowland, not Trans,

1929
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:19,980
that's the Florida version,

1930
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,060
but just people mover track in general

1931
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:23,900
that wouldn't cost a bunch of money

1932
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,140
because you'd have to demolish existing buildings.

1933
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,380
And boy does it seem tough.

1934
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,060
I don't know other than really changing some stuff

1935
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,060
around there where you're going to get the space.

1936
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,980
You can kind of go around the back,

1937
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,220
like you could kind of maybe go around

1938
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,260
the back of Space Mountain and go around

1939
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,420
sort of toward Launch Bay.

1940
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,260
I just don't know what's happening over there.

1941
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:48,500
I don't know the state of any of those tunnels.

1942
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,940
You would have to think that if they were gonna shut down,

1943
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,860
if they were gonna like, if Autopia's gonna be down

1944
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,420
for a while, can we just, can we like fix those tracks

1945
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,060
over there while as part of that,

1946
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,740
that's just part of the same project.

1947
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,100
Right, so I'm looking at this and I'm just,

1948
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,060
I'm stressing out, I'm not an engineer of any kind.

1949
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,940
I don't know what I'm doing other than I'm just eyeballing

1950
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:12,420
what looks like there's room to expand

1951
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,300
and expand in a way that won't interfere

1952
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,500
with the existing infrastructure there.

1953
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,540
And it seems pretty impossible to do it.

1954
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:25,860
So I start to really doubt my prediction

1955
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,840
about there being a people mover.

1956
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:32,200
But maybe Disney gives a little more money

1957
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:37,200
for this presentation or this redo of Tomorrowland.

1958
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,360
And they rebuild, they don't put,

1959
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,320
I think they should not put the people mover track

1960
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,160
in the middle anymore.

1961
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,520
I still think that's a bad idea there.

1962
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,360
But maybe.

1963
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,880
I watched somebody kinda ideate on some of this stuff.

1964
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,280
I think offhand Disney is the YouTube.

1965
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,960
Yes, he's really excited about.

1966
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,920
Yeah, yeah, I like some of his ideas.

1967
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,920
And I, he had the proposal of doing it like Disney World

1968
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,400
where there's no middle track and it goes

1969
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,480
along the sides of the show buildings down Tomorrow Avenue.

1970
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,500
Yes, I think that's basically what I came

1971
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,000
to the conclusion that it would have to be.

1972
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,240
It still feels like they're gonna have to do

1973
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,600
some adjusting existing building to existing buildings.

1974
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,660
And it's not the easiest thing in the world.

1975
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:23,400
But what I would do then in keeping with modern Disney

1976
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,300
is theme the people mover to Tron.

1977
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,140
Great, great.

1978
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,600
And it's not gonna go fast,

1979
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,460
but it's gonna have neon when you're in the tunnels.

1980
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,900
It's gonna go around and you can call it,

1981
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,840
there's two names.

1982
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,500
Tronple movers.

1983
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,020
Well, that's good too.

1984
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,460
Call it the transportation center.

1985
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,300
Cool, yeah.

1986
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,480
You could also call it the Tron Transit Authority,

1987
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,820
but that's not as fun, I don't think.

1988
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:49,660
Transit.

1989
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,180
But the, yeah, transportation center.

1990
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,900
You could call it the Ticket and Transportation Center,

1991
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,020
I guess if you really wanted to be the complete

1992
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,160
accurate reference to Disney World.

1993
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,740
But yes, it would have to go sort of around

1994
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,780
the outskirts of Tomorrowland.

1995
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:04,700
It gets tricky, and this is where I really should have

1996
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,380
really done my homework and figured out

1997
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:11,260
how it can loop around the area by Autopia and the subs.

1998
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:12,100
Because that's tricky,

1999
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,740
because you got Monorail track there,

2000
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:18,580
you got the cars, obviously we got the streets for Autopia.

2001
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,700
But there's gotta be some way to kind of loop it around there

2002
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,540
and have it come back.

2003
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,460
You could just do less, it just doesn't do as much.

2004
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,700
Which would be unfortunate, but that's the way it gets done

2005
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,300
in your mid-budget version.

2006
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,740
I think you'd also have to just close attractions in phases.

2007
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,220
You close Star Tours for three months,

2008
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,860
Space Pound for three months, Autopia for three months.

2009
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,580
And you just, the track gets built,

2010
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,860
like people know, like, oh, it's coming,

2011
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:46,100
it's getting closer, they started here, now they're here.

2012
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,700
And I think the pitch then for where you load,

2013
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,180
if you're gonna build a new restaurant from the ground up,

2014
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,540
I think it loads sort of in that general area.

2015
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,180
It's like that, because that sort of feels like

2016
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:58,580
it's got the most space, and then especially

2017
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,660
if you're gonna demolish that building anyway,

2018
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,300
you can add, you're, excuse me,

2019
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,140
I'm getting indigestion from talking so much.

2020
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,820
You could add your, like whatever, moving walkway

2021
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,220
or your elevator, and sort of have that whole restaurant

2022
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,060
just be like a big transportation hub, a big port,

2023
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,620
a big spaceport for all the different places

2024
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,540
you wanna go in the galaxy.

2025
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,700
Yeah, yeah.

2026
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:24,020
You know, it's maybe a, somewhere some of that stuff

2027
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,620
could happen is like Starcade,

2028
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,900
Starcades like becomes loading for something.

2029
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,940
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

2030
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,780
I'm trying to think of the geography of that.

2031
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:33,700
Star Traders goes or something.

2032
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,780
If it's not there, I also would pitch,

2033
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:38,140
just fill that up with arcades, please.

2034
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,180
Like, fill that up like the old days.

2035
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,540
It was very fun when it was like,

2036
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,780
I guess it was on Flynn's arcade

2037
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,540
that was in California Adventure,

2038
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,660
but Wreck-It Ralph around that time,

2039
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,500
before that it was just Generic Arcade,

2040
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,420
then it was Wreck-It Ralph kinda themed,

2041
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,300
and then it just shut down.

2042
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,980
I was remembering they had the short-lived

2043
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:02,660
Magic Key Holder Lounge,

2044
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,940
which was mostly tiny digital advertisements

2045
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:09,860
for West Side Story, and one photo opportunity

2046
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:13,540
step and repeat, and then after I checked that out,

2047
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,060
we went to Tomorrowland Terrace,

2048
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:21,060
and I got food that was so bad, and it was my birthday.

2049
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:24,620
It was my birthday, that lounge was terrible,

2050
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,260
the food was off, it was something like

2051
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:29,300
waffle fries with pulled pork on it,

2052
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,460
two of my favorite foods, and it was so bad,

2053
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,380
and every wait was like over an hour, like 90 minutes,

2054
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:39,500
and tears were kinda welling up in my eyes,

2055
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,820
because I was like, this day sucks so much.

2056
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:47,060
And on my birthday, that food sounds terrible.

2057
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,980
How many times have you been back since?

2058
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,780
Ah, even I have my limits.

2059
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,540
That was how crowded it was.

2060
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,380
I usually avoid Tomorrowland Terrace,

2061
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:04,660
but I was like, that's got a reasonable line.

2062
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,580
I think it's cool, I think you kinda got a way

2063
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,580
to attack PeopleMover, and the Tron thing maybe

2064
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,220
gives it the extra money it needs.

2065
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,060
That's my thought.

2066
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,660
New movie coming, synergy.

2067
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,660
They seem to keep wanting to try.

2068
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:25,540
Yeah, great, new bad movie coming,

2069
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,940
new disappointing, turgid, boring movie coming.

2070
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,260
But again, I don't care, I do not care

2071
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,940
about the quality of these films,

2072
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,900
I just want some, if it finances some lights

2073
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:36,740
in these theme parks.

2074
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,380
Some blue glowing lights, you'll put up with,

2075
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:43,900
I'm guessing a reunion of Jared Leto and Skrillex

2076
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,180
back together again, not since Suicide Squad,

2077
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,020
the first one.

2078
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,580
Are they in it together?

2079
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:53,420
No, I'm just guessing, it's like the downgrade

2080
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:55,900
from the original Daft Punk album,

2081
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,900
the soundtrack for the second one

2082
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,820
that everyone liked so much, and it's like,

2083
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,860
Skrillex is back, 10 years after his prime.

2084
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,860
Because Daft Punk broke up.

2085
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,700
Is that right?

2086
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,020
I didn't hear that.

2087
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,780
Helmets finally cracked?

2088
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,580
Yeah, they only had one set of helmets.

2089
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,460
Fuck.

2090
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,300
Yeah, it's over.

2091
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,140
That was all it took.

2092
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:21,380
Well, once there was a crack in the helmets,

2093
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:24,260
then that allowed oxygen in, and they're aliens,

2094
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,580
so their heads expanded and blew up,

2095
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:27,660
like Jared described earlier.

2096
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:28,700
They're robots.

2097
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:29,540
Okay.

2098
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,420
Well, robots who also can't be exposed.

2099
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,260
They could be like humanoid robots.

2100
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,100
But they're wearing helmets,

2101
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,260
it's gotta be for some reason.

2102
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:40,820
Vacuum is being sucked out of the circuits and wires.

2103
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:43,620
The only reason I, I really like watching interviews

2104
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,060
with Nile Rodgers talking about

2105
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,660
when he worked on that last Daft Punk album,

2106
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,900
and he calls them the robots and stuff very casually.

2107
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,420
I guess Paul Williams in the speech.

2108
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,260
Yes, yeah, yeah.

2109
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,100
The robots.

2110
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,940
I'm here with a bunch of robots.

2111
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:58,260
I liked the original cartoon,

2112
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:01,980
anime footage from the one album,

2113
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,740
like the music videos,

2114
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:07,460
where they were animated as blue aliens,

2115
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,420
and that aired on Adult Swim once

2116
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,900
at one or two in the morning,

2117
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,140
and it was summer in high school,

2118
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,820
and I was like, I don't know what the hell is going on,

2119
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,180
but I like that.

2120
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,820
I had no idea.

2121
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,540
I didn't know about the mythology.

2122
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,300
I didn't know about the albums.

2123
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,380
Sure.

2124
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,980
And you were in the window of time

2125
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,500
where you were noting new music.

2126
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,740
It was still in that zone.

2127
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,580
Oh yeah.

2128
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,420
Soon to conclude.

2129
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,340
I was trying to note.

2130
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,380
I was trying to note,

2131
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:34,820
but Adult Swim in the local TV guide,

2132
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,340
it wasn't explaining it enough.

2133
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,180
Right.

2134
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,300
Before you wrapped it up

2135
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:42,180
and stuck to the soundtrack of Mame.

2136
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,580
Mame, where Mike was driving us home the other night

2137
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,500
from Jane's birthday,

2138
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,340
he was making fun of me,

2139
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:51,620
because December's song came on a shuffle.

2140
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,460
Oh, I had shuffle on.

2141
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,300
He had shuffle on December's,

2142
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,140
and I go, hey, something for Jason.

2143
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:56,900
Jason likes his nerd shit.

2144
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,540
I was like, these guys are so smart.

2145
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,380
You hear these lyrics?

2146
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,220
And I'm like, yeah.

2147
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,500
But it was on your shuffle.

2148
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,980
They sing sea shanties.

2149
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:03,820
I like them.

2150
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,380
They sing sea shanties.

2151
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,740
Me being able to make fun of Jason

2152
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:08,940
doesn't mean I'm not being a hypocrite.

2153
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,700
You're not all say, sure, sure.

2154
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,740
You were right.

2155
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,580
Yeah.

2156
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,740
Well, same goes for me.

2157
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,860
Listen to the queen wife a lot.

2158
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,300
Of course.

2159
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,140
I like them.

2160
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,300
Well, I dig it.

2161
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,660
I don't think either of these

2162
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,380
have needed a lot of course correction

2163
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,180
in terms of understanding the assignment.

2164
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,980
I think you're on to something.

2165
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,980
And that whole, well, look, here's the thing.

2166
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,380
I think you will find some crossover with mine.

2167
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,220
Sure.

2168
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,620
And this was some of the,

2169
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,740
if we all go off and think separately,

2170
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,380
maybe it really illuminates some areas

2171
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:46,380
that are, I don't know, key areas, I guess,

2172
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,180
that they could and should do.

2173
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,020
Right.

2174
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,540
So I guess with that, we can get into mine.

2175
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,020
I'm trying to think any caveats.

2176
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:56,740
I mean, I feel like maybe this assignment

2177
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:01,580
gives you the most, at least I took it to be,

2178
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,500
there's the most room for putting

2179
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:08,300
your own narrative voice and opinions and taste into.

2180
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,140
Right.

2181
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,380
So I think you'll find that.

2182
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:11,900
There are some things that are very much

2183
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,460
the things I want, but I don't think entirely.

2184
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,980
I think it's a crowd pleaser too.

2185
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:22,580
And I, you know, feel free to interrupt

2186
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:27,580
because I think I am gonna try to go a little bit tomorrow.

2187
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,460
Oh, please, yeah.

2188
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,860
Let's, not that I'm even in the same league,

2189
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:34,260
but let's see what I can,

2190
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:39,260
if I can get steaming and make everybody else get steamy.

2191
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,500
Okay, yeah.

2192
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,020
Let me, I'll try to, okay, okay.

2193
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,540
Remember when we dreamed of a better tomorrow?

2194
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,500
A tomorrow without limits.

2195
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,460
A tomorrow that acknowledges and celebrates yesterday,

2196
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,940
but isn't stuck in it.

2197
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,980
A tomorrow that doesn't merely imagine the near future,

2198
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,760
but rather millennia beyond.

2199
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,780
Welcome to Tomorrowland 3055.

2200
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,620
Oh, wow.

2201
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,940
That clears it, that's fine, 30 Tomorrowland 3055.

2202
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,620
A visionary hub of innovation,

2203
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,420
transportation, and imagination.

2204
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:18,500
Tomorrowland 35, in an unprecedented decision,

2205
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,620
certainly not said half an hour ago,

2206
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:24,340
will deliver on the promise of an intergalactic port

2207
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:28,180
where mind-blowing vehicles and astounding technology

2208
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,620
let you rocket to the stars and beyond

2209
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,860
and unforgettable visits to our planet

2210
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:35,700
by astounding beings from across the cosmos.

2211
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,960
The experience begins before you even set foot

2212
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,400
on an attraction where, during the day,

2213
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,440
a refurbished, repainted, white-chrome,

2214
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,880
and crystal-color scheme has finally unified

2215
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,160
the land aesthetically, and at night,

2216
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,760
eye-popping LED screens turn the land aquamarine,

2217
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,600
purple, blue, and magenta in a light show

2218
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,280
that rivals New Spaceship Earth's sphere

2219
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,440
or the streets of Tokyo.

2220
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,560
I mean, isn't that the way, like, just brighten it up,

2221
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,840
you know? Of course.

2222
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,920
They can at least get to L.A. Live.

2223
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,720
Can we not get to L.A. Live?

2224
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,400
Of course. Can we not get to L.A. Live?

2225
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,640
Can we not get to L.A. Live?

2226
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,720
Mike, just imagine this is the Aaron Sorkin,

2227
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,960
Danny Boyle movie, Steve Jobs,

2228
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,560
and you and I are standing on the side of the stage,

2229
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,440
and he's Steve Jobs, and we're just there going, like,

2230
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,480
he's doing it, he's really doing it.

2231
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,040
Wow. That's what I felt.

2232
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:27,880
I was wrong.

2233
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,040
You put it into a movie reference, yeah.

2234
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,120
The structure of this has been split into three,

2235
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,240
much like that film.

2236
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,080
Nice.

2237
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,120
That's, by the way, that's,

2238
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,560
what you said is expensive.

2239
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,400
Yeah, sure.

2240
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,320
I guess that's the reason it hasn't been done,

2241
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,320
but let's fuck it.

2242
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,160
Yeah, let's go.

2243
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,240
If some fucking crappy mall can do it.

2244
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,600
I and they. They can do it.

2245
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,440
Okay.

2246
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,960
Guests will immediately note the wide open space,

2247
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,680
thanks to the absence of the Astro Orbiter

2248
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,040
in the entryway. Of course, of course.

2249
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,600
Did it go back atop the central tower,

2250
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,320
replacing the observatron, not,

2251
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,880
or I'm sorry, the orb-a-don.

2252
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,600
Orb-a-don. Not quite.

2253
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,400
The highest point in Tomorrowland

2254
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,960
now belongs to a brand new attraction concept,

2255
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,640
Abduction Point.

2256
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,480
Wow.

2257
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,000
Inspired by a never-built Tokyo attraction,

2258
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,560
this high-in-the-sky drop tower

2259
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,360
beams guests up toward a hovering alien craft,

2260
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,360
only to plummet back towards Earth,

2261
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,080
offering stunning views of the entire park along the way

2262
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:26,840
and a dazzling light show from the UFO's beams.

2263
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,680
We touched on this,

2264
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,800
but this was not fleshed out to that extent.

2265
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,360
I mentioned it really quick at the end

2266
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,520
of the Tomorrowland 2055.

2267
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,200
I thought that's such a fucking cool,

2268
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,080
like a tower of terror.

2269
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,000
And this would be kind of like a mini version,

2270
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,240
like more of like a, not carnival-ish,

2271
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,760
but closer to whatever that California Adventure One

2272
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,680
was called.

2273
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,720
But like elevate, you know?

2274
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,560
Yeah, yeah.

2275
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,880
We don't need a circular, we don't need another Dumbo.

2276
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,000
Let's do something new.

2277
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,200
Well, in a way, yeah, you're also looking at something

2278
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:00,080
that actually then becomes a decoration

2279
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,520
in the way that other things in Tomorrowland would be.

2280
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,080
So it is a ride, but primarily it's for kinetic energy.

2281
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,560
It's primarily for the lights

2282
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,520
and to really add to the atmosphere.

2283
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,120
A thousand percent, absolutely.

2284
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,880
If these, and I think you'll find that throughout,

2285
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,520
if the rides as light shows

2286
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,360
and depictions of transportation technology.

2287
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,680
It's a weenie.

2288
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,520
Yes.

2289
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,360
It's like the way.

2290
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,840
You know what, I think this is,

2291
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,720
I think there's like more centerpiece attractions,

2292
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,920
but this is the weenie.

2293
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,160
This is the weenie in the way that MGM Studios,

2294
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,240
then Hollywood Studios kept changing.

2295
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:37,840
Like, oh, the Earful Tower is the weenie.

2296
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,080
The Big Sorcerer's Hat.

2297
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,720
No, it's actually Terror Tower.

2298
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2299
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,200
And much like Disney Studios,

2300
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,320
I am keeping Star Wars Launch Bay.

2301
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,680
I'm the only one who's. Wow, really?

2302
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,800
No, no, I'm not doing that.

2303
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,640
Absolutely not.

2304
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,200
That would have been a bold choice.

2305
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,040
It would have been good, yeah.

2306
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,400
I'll find a way to make it work.

2307
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,720
We're blowing up Galaxy's Edge

2308
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,000
and keeping only the Launch Bay,

2309
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,080
boiling it down to its essential.

2310
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,400
Wow, yeah.

2311
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,520
Okay, perhaps while caught in that UFO beam,

2312
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,480
you looked over and noticed the nearby lagoon.

2313
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,600
The water seems cleaner and also more active.

2314
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,600
That's because the submarines have made way

2315
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,960
for a Tokyo Disney Sea audience favorite, Aquatopia.

2316
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,240
Oh, wow. No more

2317
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,760
slow-loading claustrophobic tubes.

2318
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,040
Now guests will travel open air

2319
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,520
in personal trackless hovercraft,

2320
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,200
whizzing and splashing above the water.

2321
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,160
Jason, you're aware of this.

2322
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,440
Mike, you've seen this attraction.

2323
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,520
Doesn't that seem like. I did, yeah.

2324
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,960
Let's keep it, let's keep water,

2325
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,400
but that's a futuristic water attraction

2326
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,600
that's more fun than any of the stuff around here.

2327
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,440
Let's do it.

2328
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,280
Yes.

2329
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,080
Is there a thin amount of water,

2330
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,720
like a shallow amount of water at Aquatopia?

2331
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,800
There's a TikTok of a cast member

2332
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,760
walking out onto the water

2333
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,880
that the ground is very close.

2334
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,320
So you're gonna have to develop new technology, perhaps,

2335
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,440
to have full Wi-Fi boats.

2336
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,200
Well, I think it's like you redo the lagoon.

2337
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,400
Oh, okay, fill up the lagoon.

2338
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,920
Yeah, yeah, you just keep the lagoon atmosphere and vibe

2339
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,560
because as I think you'll find throughout,

2340
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,800
I'm not necessarily blowing it all up and starting over

2341
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,520
because I do love Tomorrowland.

2342
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,000
There's a lot that I love about the bones of Tomorrowland.

2343
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,800
So that's another version,

2344
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,600
and I might be curious to hear when all's said and done,

2345
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,920
what would be good ideas if we were blowing it all up,

2346
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,120
but I'm not the person to do that

2347
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,520
because I love Tomorrowland.

2348
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,080
I think there was a lot that was great about Tomorrowland.

2349
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,200
The first time I ever went to the place in 1988,

2350
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,920
and I think it's a matter of restoring and building back.

2351
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:42,960
Because if I had your assignment,

2352
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,800
I think I would have said,

2353
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,720
first things first, we're leveling all of it to the ground.

2354
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,160
Well, this is what, let's play that out after I'm done.

2355
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,000
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2356
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,840
Because that's probably the one thing, yeah,

2357
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,640
that is different between how you and I would have done it.

2358
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:59,120
Okay, so, Aquatopia will delight guests

2359
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,080
with its showcase of clean energy so thoroughly

2360
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,000
that they aren't upset that we have eliminated Autopia,

2361
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,440
don't care if it's electric, it's going away, land canceled.

2362
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,640
A lot of real estate.

2363
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,480
It is a lot of real estate,

2364
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,720
and I have been very gracious

2365
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,960
despite this being a Tomorrowland project.

2366
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,920
I have donated the top half of the Autopia property

2367
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,080
to Fantasyland in order to build,

2368
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,640
and this was a tough choice,

2369
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:31,000
but I ended up landing on Beauty and the Beast Tokyo ride.

2370
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,840
That's what we're getting.

2371
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,760
So you've added to Fantasyland.

2372
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,480
I have taken, yes.

2373
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,280
I mean, if you consider all of Autopia to be Tomorrowland,

2374
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,000
yeah, I think this is worth an annex.

2375
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,680
I think it makes, there's not room

2376
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,760
for full new Fantasyland up there.

2377
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,160
So I was like, let me pick the best of the best

2378
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:52,160
and something that I don't think needs

2379
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,600
the full real estate of Disneyland forward,

2380
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,640
because I like the frozen stuff aesthetically.

2381
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,880
There's another fairy tale.

2382
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,640
I mean, there's Tangled, all that Fantasy Springs stuff,

2383
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,800
but I'd rather just take all that new land,

2384
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,280
do all of Fantasy Springs over there,

2385
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,840
and let's just take the best of the best

2386
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,480
that could work in Fantasyland.

2387
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,400
I think that's Beauty and the Beast.

2388
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,440
The Beast's castle will blend perfectly into Aquatopia

2389
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,360
with a new backdrop of forests and waterfalls.

2390
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,440
I think that'll all blend and look nice next to Matterhorn.

2391
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,560
Elsewhere, cherished classics remain,

2392
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,760
but with fan favorite enhancements.

2393
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,160
Star Tours is still bustling,

2394
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,920
but one cabin has been permanently converted

2395
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,160
to a restored, enhanced version

2396
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,200
of the original Star Tours journey,

2397
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,160
complete with our old pal Captain Rex.

2398
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,400
Yeah, good, very good.

2399
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,120
Just one, and then the rest are still interactive,

2400
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,360
and you don't know if you're gonna end up in that,

2401
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:50,160
even though certain guests, you might be looking at one,

2402
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,200
will demand to always go on the Rex one.

2403
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,880
They'll have to figure out how they'll handle

2404
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,480
the amount of requests to go on the old one.

2405
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,040
Well, I think the biggest thing in their corner

2406
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,200
will be that everybody who, like,

2407
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,040
excuse me, could I do, all of the Rex demanders

2408
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,160
will be such pushovers that they'll wait wherever

2409
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,000
they have to wait as long as they need to wait.

2410
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,840
And you'll be able to spot them.

2411
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,160
You'll be able to spot them in line.

2412
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:16,040
Well, it will become a contest between cast members of like,

2413
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,600
all right, whichever one of them

2414
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,240
is crying the hardest gets to go.

2415
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,080
Mm-hmm.

2416
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:24,160
You know, you know what actually would be good,

2417
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:29,160
is every car had a different person piloting it.

2418
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,680
Like, C-3PO's in one.

2419
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,520
Ooh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2420
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,920
And then there's a different Forlom,

2421
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,880
the bounty hunter is in one or something.

2422
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,480
Forlom, the bounty hunter.

2423
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,000
Forlom, yeah.

2424
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,440
I mean, seems like a fun place for Grogu.

2425
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,280
Sure.

2426
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,480
Let's figure out how to make him pilot.

2427
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,320
Right, great.

2428
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,000
If he's gotta sit on a couple of crates.

2429
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,840
Yeah.

2430
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,680
Let's do it.

2431
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,520
Sit on some crates and go to a crate.

2432
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,360
Yeah, if he's a little clumsy piloting,

2433
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,120
but he keeps moving stuff out of the way with force

2434
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,400
so it works, you know.

2435
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:01,400
If you sorta go, like, it's original trilogy,

2436
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,160
one cabin is original, one is prequel,

2437
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,240
one is new, one is, or TV, whatever.

2438
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,000
Like post 2015, essentially,

2439
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,320
and then one is old school Disneyland with race.

2440
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,960
That's a good, and now we're covering everything.

2441
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,760
Babu Frick in one of them.

2442
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,600
Cool.

2443
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,420
Yes.

2444
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,260
Oh, man.

2445
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2446
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:20,920
Very good pilot.

2447
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,760
Hell yeah.

2448
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,600
Or just give him a seat.

2449
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,240
Just like, he just gets to sit and enjoy it like us

2450
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,760
and you just gotta really make sure

2451
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,280
people don't squish him.

2452
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,880
Can I say real quick about this D23 Starspeeder toy

2453
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,120
that's coming out that's exclusive,

2454
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,280
they're linking 3,000 of them,

2455
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,680
that actually plays the original Star Tours movie

2456
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,800
and the little LED screen inside of it.

2457
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,960
It's a toy that plays the ride film.

2458
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,600
Do we know how much, do we know with what technology?

2459
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,920
Oh, oh, how much it costs?

2460
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,480
No, how much of the-

2461
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,020
I think it's all of the ride.

2462
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:50,360
It plays the entire- I believe.

2463
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,520
It's like a toy re-release of a restored ride film.

2464
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,360
Yes.

2465
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,920
It's an LCD, it's got little seat belts.

2466
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,920
It's got, you can click the seat belts.

2467
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,100
I don't know if it's each one or it just might be a row.

2468
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,160
You can just click the seatbelt in the row.

2469
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:07,960
I don't know if there's a tiny dirty little yellow strap.

2470
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,120
I don't know about that either,

2471
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,440
but I know it's an original,

2472
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,720
it's not like a redo of one of the old Starspeeder toys.

2473
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:16,860
And I think this is, of all the toy chats I have,

2474
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:19,880
this is the one that almost is universally being purchased

2475
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,320
by all these toy people I know.

2476
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,960
They say it will be on sale in person,

2477
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,640
but also online Monday,

2478
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,040
but who knows how many will be left.

2479
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:29,880
That's gotta go so fast.

2480
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,280
That's $300, but-

2481
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,120
That's $300?

2482
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,640
That's actually not so-

2483
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,240
It's not so, I know, I know.

2484
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,080
It's not.

2485
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,920
This is one of those purchases where I go,

2486
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,520
and I go, I'll buy it and keep it in the box,

2487
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:44,280
and if I need to pay for a medical bill,

2488
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,120
I guess I'll just sell it, but I need-

2489
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,920
If the dog gets sick.

2490
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,000
Yes, I need to have it.

2491
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,560
That'll do, that'll go a third of the way.

2492
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,520
Yeah, that's basically, that's maybe my philosophy going in.

2493
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,760
That's smart, that's smart.

2494
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,620
Okay, Space Mountain.

2495
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:00,960
I am not blowing it up.

2496
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,200
I like the current Space Mountain.

2497
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:07,080
There's plenty, I think, even in a blue sky version,

2498
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,880
there's a lot that I'm too addicted to,

2499
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,320
but I have made a crucial change.

2500
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:17,800
If a visitor named Mike Carlson asks a cast member nicely,

2501
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,520
they will turn on the goddamn Red Hot Chili Peppers.

2502
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,560
Thank you, wow, that's really nice.

2503
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,560
It's back, only if you ask for it,

2504
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,280
much like the robots at Chuck E. Cheese in Northridge,

2505
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,560
and mostly it will not be asked for.

2506
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,440
Any song, can I choose a song, too,

2507
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,280
or does it have to be one of the old ones that played?

2508
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,920
Don't push your luck, it's whatever it was before.

2509
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,320
It's, yeah, it was the higher ground cover, yeah.

2510
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,200
Yeah, yeah, all right, so that.

2511
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,560
Okay.

2512
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,720
So here already, we now have a thriving land of UFOs,

2513
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,120
hovercraft, rockets, star speeders,

2514
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,600
and of course, monorails.

2515
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,040
Hey, let's redo that, I didn't think about it,

2516
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,120
let's redo that station, that signage is dumb,

2517
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,360
it's like a little bit steampunky, don't make it.

2518
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,000
It's all, everything's, look, it's white, it's white,

2519
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,360
it's silver, it's chrome, we're going simple here.

2520
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,640
Right.

2521
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,480
With a lot of LED, of course.

2522
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,680
But, we have missed one big vehicle,

2523
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:13,360
probably the centerpiece of the whole thing, light cycles.

2524
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:18,000
An entire mini land within Tomorrowland 3055

2525
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,280
will be the Tron game grid.

2526
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,040
The centerpiece of this, of course,

2527
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:28,040
will be Tron light cycle run 2.0, that's right.

2528
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,680
It is elevated, it is lifted up,

2529
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,680
it is no mere carbon copy of Magic Kingdom

2530
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,480
and Shanghai's Tron light cycle run.

2531
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,120
This is a brand new experience tailor made

2532
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,520
for the Tomorrowland Disneyland space.

2533
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:45,520
So, the former Carousel Theater will be raised to the ground,

2534
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:48,440
much like Mike's version, in order to build

2535
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,840
a new towering Q building and launch site,

2536
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,240
combining the neon aesthetics of Tron

2537
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:58,320
and the never built crystal cubism of Lucasport.

2538
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,160
Oh, wow.

2539
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:03,080
A little bit of flavor of that cool Lucasport concept.

2540
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,080
Talked about it on the second gate,

2541
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,560
if you haven't heard it, look it up.

2542
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,440
Slash Ventureport, I had a couple names,

2543
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,520
but like big cool crystal building,

2544
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,760
almost like journey into imagination building, but better.

2545
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,960
Yeah, you know what, I completely,

2546
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,920
I had that thought for the restaurant in my pitch,

2547
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,360
with that aesthetic, but I completely forgot

2548
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,400
to write it down.

2549
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,320
We were, I think we're thinking,

2550
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,400
this is where the parallel thinking I think is great.

2551
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,160
I hadn't even, I felt like you maybe keep that,

2552
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,680
because I like aesthetically the Carousel building.

2553
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,440
I think there's a way to, but also,

2554
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:35,280
just the land it sits on, and like,

2555
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,040
as they found with parking structures,

2556
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,280
when you don't have a lot of space,

2557
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,120
what do you do, you build up.

2558
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,520
And I think Tomorrowland is a great place

2559
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,360
to build up, for sure.

2560
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,160
I think there's been a lot of advances, too,

2561
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:51,400
in compact roller, like getting a lot of thrill

2562
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,320
out of a compact coaster.

2563
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,160
Sure, sure.

2564
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:55,400
Well, that is my question,

2565
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,960
unless you're about to go there.

2566
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,400
Yeah, yeah, I'll explain, I'll take it there.

2567
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,720
But poke holes in this,

2568
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:04,040
because this one might have the biggest logic holes.

2569
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,760
So, on the top floor of the Tron Game Grid building,

2570
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,520
a permanent end-of-line club,

2571
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:13,760
straight out of the Electronica event,

2572
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,440
where you can dance to electronic beats,

2573
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,040
drink Glohitos, as well as actual drinks for grownups,

2574
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,600
and take in the highest in-park view

2575
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,440
of fireworks available.

2576
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,320
The end-of-line club will be amazing,

2577
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,840
and open, and available to all guests,

2578
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,360
not some DVC bullshit.

2579
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,440
That's for everybody.

2580
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,280
Nice, amen.

2581
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,120
Yeah, great.

2582
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:34,960
For the people.

2583
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,320
Oh, and also part of this, in this new land,

2584
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:44,040
the little UFO booth that's kind of, as you get it,

2585
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,800
like next to the unused people mover tower,

2586
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,960
there's a UFO, and like an umbrella,

2587
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:52,640
where you learn about DVC pricing,

2588
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,720
and this will be personally put

2589
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,520
into a shredding machine by me.

2590
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,400
I will insist on myself getting rid

2591
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,400
of this stupid fucking tacky booth.

2592
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,600
You know, that is the first mention

2593
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,040
of umbrellas, or awnings, or shade,

2594
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,760
that I'm hoping any one of these Tomorrowlands

2595
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,280
might address down the line, is like,

2596
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:19,240
oh, this is a little too brutalist heat-wise,

2597
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,320
you know, it's a lot of cement.

2598
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,680
I guess so. And metal.

2599
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, you lose that

2600
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,680
with the people mover track.

2601
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,520
Yeah. But I don't know,

2602
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,360
maybe some of the other,

2603
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,920
maybe the other track I'm talking about.

2604
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,120
Okay, before I get to the light cycles,

2605
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,080
another part of the game grid is Alien Pizza Planet

2606
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,200
becomes Flynn's Barcade,

2607
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,440
an amended concept, like Jason referred to earlier.

2608
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,440
This is an indoor-outdoor space

2609
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,720
where the whole family can eat, drink,

2610
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,760
well, not the whole family can drink,

2611
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,600
you know what I'm saying,

2612
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,520
and play both modern and old-school video games,

2613
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,240
often, hopefully, customized games

2614
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,080
from within the Disney universe.

2615
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:02,240
Tron, Fix-It Felix, a Toy Story alien claw game,

2616
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,880
acknowledging the Toy Story history of that space.

2617
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,360
You can do the Zerg game from the cold open

2618
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,160
of Toy Story 2. Oh, yeah.

2619
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,400
Maybe you always lose, you always get blasted,

2620
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,400
and then your little legs drop to the ground,

2621
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:18,080
and Zerg laughs, there's no way to win the game.

2622
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,280
But putting all the Disney video games in one place,

2623
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,120
and this is the thing,

2624
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,560
I'm not trying to just please myself

2625
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:24,760
with some of these things,

2626
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,920
I'm trying to think country bear style,

2627
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:32,920
and how do we fold Disney IP into itself.

2628
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,120
So, oh, and also, they do still serve pizza,

2629
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,680
but it is no longer trash.

2630
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,720
Oh, okay, so it's good.

2631
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,520
They do good pizza, yes. That's an upgrade, yeah.

2632
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,160
Yes, by reaching out to Acclaimed Chef Anyone,

2633
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,360
we can finally get some good pizza.

2634
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,800
By Acclaimed Chef, your stepmom got a pizza stone

2635
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,240
for Christmas, and wants to try it out

2636
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:01,080
with some Trader Joe's dough,

2637
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,880
and there's a bottle of Francesca Rinaldi in the pantry.

2638
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,500
Absolutely, done, your stepmom, she's in.

2639
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,620
So, now let's talk light cycles.

2640
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:17,900
Inspired by the original route of the people mover,

2641
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:21,100
Tron light cycles will take a winding path

2642
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:23,060
that traverses all of Tomorrowland.

2643
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:26,540
Once aboard, your light cycle will launch

2644
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:30,660
past Space Mountain, out of Disneyland,

2645
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:34,380
out of the park, into a glowing canopy,

2646
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:37,020
much like what is in Shanghai in Magic Kingdom,

2647
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,380
but this is built in the former

2648
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:42,860
bus and transportation zone off Harbor.

2649
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:45,760
That sequence, that big launch and loop,

2650
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,820
and the glowing light show all happens in the,

2651
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:51,780
not the hub, the Esplanade.

2652
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,820
It takes over part of the Esplanade,

2653
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:56,460
which I think frankly makes more sense for this zone,

2654
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:58,660
and is cooler than a Pandora expansion.

2655
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:00,820
I want Pandora over in Disneyland Forward.

2656
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,020
I don't want Pandora to be cramped at all.

2657
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:05,940
I don't really get that coming out of that part of the park.

2658
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,740
Now, this portion of the ride

2659
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:10,420
doubles as a stunning free light show

2660
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,460
for guests arriving from Harbor Boulevard,

2661
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:16,940
and even non-paying guests on their way to downtown Disney.

2662
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:20,340
You are using some of your blue sky to make public art.

2663
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,180
That's right.

2664
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:22,020
Civic engaging.

2665
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,240
Giving back, yes.

2666
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,940
What does that do to a zone that is kind of like,

2667
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,420
look, we haven't done the Harbor Hoedown yet.

2668
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:32,260
We may never do the Harbor Hoedown.

2669
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:34,140
Is one possibility.

2670
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:35,540
That's one blue sky.

2671
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:41,060
But aesthetics are not always the best around that place.

2672
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:45,340
And especially now, in a way, I'm sad to see the bus zone.

2673
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,260
I do think that bus zone's gonna go,

2674
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,420
and I've had nice memories there

2675
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,620
because that's why I've been doing it.

2676
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,820
I've been doing a hotel that's a little ways away,

2677
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:55,340
and I take a shuttle, but the shuttle drops you right there.

2678
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:57,420
And I kinda don't like that the bus is going across.

2679
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,940
It's gonna add to hassle a little bit,

2680
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,420
but I do want it for park,

2681
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:03,640
and the idea of a light show that the public gets

2682
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,860
that also lures you in,

2683
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:07,140
that's a weenie that's outside Disneyland.

2684
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:09,340
It's like, well, what's the rest of this thing do?

2685
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:10,180
That's interesting.

2686
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:13,500
Yeah, I wonder what the vibe of that area,

2687
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,860
like, is it gonna be like when you're in different parts

2688
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,860
of Tokyo or Vegas or something,

2689
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,980
where it's like a neon sign, essentially,

2690
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,020
for Disneyland, I guess?

2691
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:22,860
I think so.

2692
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:23,680
Well, you know what it is,

2693
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,420
is it's a big advertisement

2694
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:27,660
that Tomorrowland is back in business.

2695
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,940
I mean, it's definitely like, well, here's the thing.

2696
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:32,740
I think there'd be enough separation between that

2697
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:36,500
and then where you have to get train station Mickey Mouse

2698
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:39,140
to get, there's space between those.

2699
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,860
So it's not like, if it's kind of a different vibe

2700
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:43,980
than the rest of Esplanade, I think it's okay.

2701
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,060
I think it's cool.

2702
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:50,060
Well, the way that the parking situation is described

2703
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,900
is that there's gonna be a big parking garage,

2704
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,260
and this is the thing, the Eastern Gateway Project,

2705
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,100
that was called?

2706
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:55,920
Yeah.

2707
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,260
It was gonna be on the other side of Harbor,

2708
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:59,780
and they were gonna build a big parking garage there,

2709
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,580
and then you were gonna have all your security over there,

2710
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,060
and then you were gonna walk across a bridge

2711
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,980
just right into the Esplanade, no security,

2712
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:10,780
so you can make that walkway a lot more narrow

2713
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:12,180
all of a sudden. Yeah, yeah.

2714
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,020
So you have more room.

2715
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:14,620
It doesn't need like a row after row

2716
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:16,100
of metal detectors, right?

2717
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,060
Right, it needs nothing.

2718
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,220
So it obviously needs to be big enough

2719
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:19,900
for people to walk to and fro,

2720
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:24,900
but you can have a lot of room on both sides to do stuff.

2721
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,100
I think maybe with this plan,

2722
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:29,420
you still get a little room for California Adventure

2723
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,340
to expand, too.

2724
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:31,500
So you could get a little, yeah,

2725
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:34,180
but it could be 75, 25, even.

2726
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:36,140
Yeah, yeah, yes, I like that,

2727
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:39,060
and maybe some, you know, like I think we talked about

2728
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,020
if Zootopia is a rumor over there, that's cool,

2729
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,780
you get a little extra Zootopia.

2730
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:44,620
What if they did something we neglected

2731
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:45,600
in the bedding episode?

2732
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,220
There's people who think and want

2733
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:51,700
that maybe we get a Monsters, Inc. door coaster.

2734
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:54,340
That's been for, I think it's been 20 years

2735
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,620
we've not heard about that door coaster.

2736
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,900
I don't see any reason other than it'd be fun

2737
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,960
to think about that it would be now,

2738
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,760
but like imagine if you sort of,

2739
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,360
what if you did a better, bigger Monstropolis

2740
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,840
over there in DCA?

2741
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,680
That's fine.

2742
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,680
I just want, I don't want Avatar,

2743
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,840
I don't want Pandora to be stifled.

2744
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,040
We already said this. We need room to breathe.

2745
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,880
Why would that go there?

2746
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,840
That doesn't make any sense.

2747
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:19,520
We might find out tomorrow that it is there.

2748
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,200
I will be shocked if that happens.

2749
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,040
It doesn't feel right.

2750
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,920
That feels very online rumor that it's not really.

2751
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,640
Jason liked it, but I thought that was wild.

2752
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,320
No, I don't like it.

2753
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:31,040
It's the fact that he kept calling it an experience

2754
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,720
and not an attraction.

2755
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,880
Well, there is an attraction.

2756
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,200
But we're getting, no, we've got concept.

2757
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2758
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:38,880
Okay.

2759
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:39,720
A boat ride.

2760
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,720
I want a lot of room for that thing.

2761
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,440
That needs to be where it has room to breathe.

2762
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:47,400
Well, it's gotta be the sea, not the, you know.

2763
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:51,160
Yes, they need room to splash and swim free

2764
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,360
and experience all the wonders of life

2765
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,920
with the great mighty Tolkien.

2766
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,440
We need some Tolkien animatronics.

2767
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:03,120
Oh, if we get a physical, a real Pyacon.

2768
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,160
I'll be happy to visit any Pyacon,

2769
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:09,560
but the ability to hug Pyacon would certainly.

2770
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,400
Oh.

2771
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,960
Well, this isn't blue-skying Avatar, sadly.

2772
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,800
I know, I know.

2773
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2774
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,120
I could change plans.

2775
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,080
No more Beauty and the Beast.

2776
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,400
It goes over there.

2777
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,360
That's technically in my confines.

2778
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,320
You could go like a nod to Disneyland,

2779
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,240
like the storybook boats.

2780
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:25,400
Storybook canal boats.

2781
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,760
You could go into a Tolkien's mouth, Pyacon's mouth,

2782
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,840
or you could take inspiration from Islands of Adventure

2783
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,640
when you used to be able to meet the Triceratops

2784
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:38,320
and you could pet.

2785
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:42,240
Like, ah, Pyacon is coming for his daily hello.

2786
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,520
He's coming for his little pets.

2787
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,920
He's coming for his little pets.

2788
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,480
That relaxes me so much,

2789
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:50,720
thinking about being able to go and love Pyacon.

2790
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,880
To do a Pyacon encounter.

2791
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,960
Tell him my darkest secrets.

2792
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,520
I can trust you with this.

2793
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,520
Isn't that right, boy?

2794
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,920
It's like you're the little girl in Once Upon a Time

2795
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,920
in Hollywood and you like whisper,

2796
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,440
you're the best Pyacon I've ever seen.

2797
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:08,440
Pyacon starts sobbing like DiCaprio.

2798
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:11,960
Okay, so where was I?

2799
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:14,160
Oh, okay, so yeah, that's that big initial.

2800
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,440
That's the big exciting start.

2801
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,960
It gets you, we get extra space.

2802
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:18,920
It takes you out of the park,

2803
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,480
but from there, the ride turns back into Tomorrowland

2804
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,320
speeds all through Disneyland's eastern half

2805
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,160
over the two main show buildings in Tomorrowland,

2806
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,400
on Tomorrow Avenue.

2807
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,760
A dramatic curve across the hub

2808
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:35,760
that serves as the entry arch for Tomorrowland 3055.

2809
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,160
Show scene tunnels that revitalize long unused spaces

2810
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,880
like the second floor of the Starcade.

2811
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,640
You'll crisscross around the monorail tracks

2812
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:48,080
and even take in a dizzying loop

2813
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,640
all the way around the Matterhorn.

2814
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,480
Wow.

2815
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,800
Yeah, imagine that big loop.

2816
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,800
You feel like inches away from it.

2817
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,640
How about that?

2818
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,680
So you'll see that from Main Street, obviously.

2819
01:40:58,680 --> 01:40:59,520
Oh, I guess you could.

2820
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,360
Yeah, sure.

2821
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,200
Yeah, why not?

2822
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:03,280
You could see the Astro Orbiter from Main Street

2823
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,120
and it stinks.

2824
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:04,960
True.

2825
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,600
Let's get something cool.

2826
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,120
It doesn't make any sense to see,

2827
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,760
that's the spirit to me is like,

2828
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,120
doesn't make any sense to see a mountain from Main Street,

2829
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:12,960
but why not?

2830
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:16,120
Hey, doesn't make any sense to see a castle from Main Street,

2831
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,360
but we're making it all happen.

2832
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,280
Is there any way you could theme the outside of it

2833
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:24,800
to look more Matterhorn, like it belongs,

2834
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,000
when you're seeing the Matterhorn from a certain angle.

2835
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,480
Like a slalom tunnel of some kind.

2836
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:30,760
Yes, a tunnel of some kind.

2837
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,520
Like, you're worried about a clash.

2838
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,360
I am worried about a clash.

2839
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,440
Over there, that's a fair note.

2840
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:38,360
Well, then I'm glad I didn't take it all the way.

2841
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:41,160
I was thinking, here's, you wanna get a really blue sky?

2842
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,000
Yeah.

2843
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Matterhorn rebuilt from the ground up.

2844
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,440
I was thinking about it.

2845
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,600
I don't know if that counts, it's kind of fantasy land,

2846
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,120
but yeah, you've mentioned it,

2847
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:51,800
it's one of those structural things.

2848
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,400
What if we do it now?

2849
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,400
What if it's the sturdiest building ever built?

2850
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:59,760
It's got room for a properly working Yeti.

2851
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,640
We get the Yeti in there.

2852
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,640
And, you know, abominable-ified, whatever.

2853
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,200
But I was thinking,

2854
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,360
Lufthron light cycles go through the Matterhorn.

2855
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,200
Yeah, it'd be awesome.

2856
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:11,480
Yeah, okay, well, if you're in favor of it,

2857
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:12,560
let's do it. Well, with this version

2858
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:13,920
where it's been rebuilt,

2859
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:15,960
then you can really kind of hide it

2860
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,120
in the way I'm thinking.

2861
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:22,640
So it won't be so, like, why is there a space motorcycle

2862
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,840
going in front of the Matterhorn

2863
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,560
when I'm looking at it from Main Street?

2864
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,640
I agree with you, except that's another,

2865
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,840
as I was starting to say, I think that's, you know,

2866
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,840
why is there a train going through a dinosaur world?

2867
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,600
Why was there, I mean, Skyway is kind of like Swiss chalet.

2868
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,840
I think, actually, the spirit of light cycles

2869
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,400
go through the Matterhorn is what's missing.

2870
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,480
I think that is, like, original Disneyland thinking

2871
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:47,320
and your wedding, flashy things.

2872
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,880
Yeah, Skyway went through it, yeah.

2873
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,080
You know what you're saying.

2874
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,680
And if you're really that concerned,

2875
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,000
you put, like, a video wall,

2876
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
you make it look like a video wall

2877
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,400
for, like, a Grand Budapest hotel-style funicular

2878
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,680
going up the Matterhorn,

2879
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,960
but it's really the light cycles going inside the tunnel,

2880
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,040
you know? Oh, okay.

2881
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,840
Yeah, I don't know the pitch on, like, how to mask it at all,

2882
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,600
but the more I think about it,

2883
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,960
the more I'm like, I just wanna proudly have things

2884
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,120
that don't quite match,

2885
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,280
because I think there's great moments

2886
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:22,400
in Disneyland attraction combining

2887
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,800
that don't quite line up, and I think it's great.

2888
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,720
It's like a child's imagination

2889
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:30,920
when the X-Men meet the G.I. Joe and they meet the turtles.

2890
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:31,760
That's right.

2891
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,840
When a cowboy plays with a spaceman

2892
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,560
and a Mr. Potato Head and a dinosaur.

2893
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:38,400
Well, there we are.

2894
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,240
And it's the most magical combining

2895
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,200
of all these universes altogether.

2896
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,840
I'm trying to think what light you would expect,

2897
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,840
like a red flare light.

2898
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:49,480
So it's almost like when the bike goes around

2899
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,480
and hits into the Matterhorn, it almost turns red.

2900
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,760
So it's almost like you see a flare

2901
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,480
coming off the mountain in the distance.

2902
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,320
Oh, sure.

2903
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,880
Like somebody is seeking rescue?

2904
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,960
Yeah, maybe.

2905
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:00,800
Yeah.

2906
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:01,800
Something like that.

2907
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,160
Because I guess when you first described it,

2908
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,680
I was almost like, okay, it just kinda goes in front of it.

2909
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,200
But yeah, if you could do something that from the distance

2910
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,160
looks like it's kind of themed to the Matterhorn more,

2911
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,240
and it gives it some energy,

2912
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:16,680
and then obviously when you're riding it

2913
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:19,040
and you're seeing it, it's just you're going through,

2914
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,080
you're on a space motorcycle, you're on an internet motorcycle.

2915
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:22,920
I mean, I hear you.

2916
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,400
There's something weird about it,

2917
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,280
but maybe it's a good kind of weird.

2918
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,080
I just think, for whatever reason,

2919
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:31,920
I'm hung up on far away seeing it

2920
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:33,320
and it not looking right.

2921
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,960
Blue sky, no bad ideas.

2922
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,240
I'm not saying it's a bad idea.

2923
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,200
There's also, I guess, a version where,

2924
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,760
but it also does not, maybe not from the hub,

2925
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:47,120
but do we not get already monorail right now?

2926
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,640
Monorail doesn't make sense next to Matterhorn, technically.

2927
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,480
That's true, yeah.

2928
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,320
Yeah.

2929
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,160
That's true.

2930
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,000
I don't know.

2931
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,640
I think it's worth an adjust.

2932
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:58,680
You're not wrong, but my argument,

2933
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:02,080
just to try to fight for it, might be fuck it,

2934
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,560
let's do it and be legends.

2935
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,680
I think the electric flow is very kind of besetic

2936
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:11,080
with the weight of the snow is often, snow and ice,

2937
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,040
often portrayed as blue and white.

2938
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,760
The new building of Matterhorn,

2939
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,760
going in and out of it, though I'm on board for,

2940
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,040
I was just sort of thinking of other ways to make it look.

2941
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,000
To bring that back, that a ride goes through.

2942
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,920
For whatever reason, I was hung up on the old Matterhorn

2943
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,960
just sort of having a Tron thing in front of it,

2944
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:26,800
whatever reason.

2945
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,840
Okay, so somehow through does it.

2946
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,720
I'm almost surprised that that,

2947
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,000
okay, well then we're doing that.

2948
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,080
All right, new Matterhorn, yetis in there

2949
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,440
and light cycles go through it.

2950
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:37,400
Sure, yeah, yeah, great.

2951
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,520
Hell yeah.

2952
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,800
They'll blend it, they'll do something good.

2953
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,480
That's for them to do, the engineers.

2954
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,760
Anyway, this is an e-ticket and visual spectacle

2955
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,840
that pumps life through all of Tomorrowland and beyond.

2956
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,320
But by making the light cycles kind of the,

2957
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,640
now that's the track that weaves through all of Tomorrowland.

2958
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,520
Are we now ignoring the need for a mellow,

2959
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,800
slow-moving, family-friendly experience?

2960
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,840
I say hardly because Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters

2961
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,480
will say goodbye, what was the phrase?

2962
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,560
Glowing away.

2963
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,400
I'm gonna use that.

2964
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,240
Like the parade.

2965
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:12,280
Astro Blasters is glowing away forever

2966
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,840
to make way for a brand new journey

2967
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:17,480
through the world of WALL-E.

2968
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:20,440
WALL-E is coming to My Tomorrowland

2969
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,240
in WALL-E's Cosmic Directive.

2970
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,280
Feel free to, we'll workshop this.

2971
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,840
I couldn't quite land on one,

2972
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:31,760
but the word directive's part of the movie.

2973
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,560
Guests will follow WALL-E and Eve's journey

2974
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:38,920
from Earth to space and back aboard the Axiom

2975
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,160
and the returning pet,

2976
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,400
and even go past the events of the film

2977
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,520
to see how WALL-E and his robot pals

2978
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,520
revive Earth with plant life.

2979
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,840
Imagine a pleasant, slow-moving dark ride

2980
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,200
that takes you to space

2981
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,720
where an adorable, creaky-voiced pal

2982
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:58,240
uses his healing touch to turn a planet green.

2983
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,320
Oh, interesting.

2984
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,880
The merchandising makes itself,

2985
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:07,880
like WALL-E or Eve holding a little plant.

2986
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:11,760
And if you, Jason, I know that you like to bring,

2987
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,920
or want to bring little plants home from theme parks.

2988
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,200
If you could do it in a boot,

2989
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,600
in a WALL-E boot, that's, you know what?

2990
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,840
That's a good little merchandise opportunity.

2991
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,160
That's a really good one.

2992
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:27,720
I think this lived entirely in Club 3,

2993
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:31,040
the notion presented by Griffin, not me,

2994
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,960
that people liked, they liked it.

2995
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,160
The notion that living with the land

2996
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:40,480
gets a nice, subtle WALL-E overlay

2997
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:44,360
that uses this, because WALL-E is the bridge

2998
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:47,840
between technology and future and plants.

2999
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,160
He ties it all together.

3000
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,880
It could be subtle, it could be nice,

3001
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,440
it could be additive,

3002
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:54,280
and then you go home with your boot

3003
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:56,400
with a little simple plant in it.

3004
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,840
Cool, cool.

3005
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,800
I didn't even think about that aspect of it.

3006
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:02,520
That is great, and that is not just like,

3007
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,360
with apologies to the star speeder,

3008
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,200
which sounds great, and everything like it,

3009
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:09,240
that's not just a piece of plastic.

3010
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:12,120
Now you go home and you're making nature happen

3011
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:13,720
where you live.

3012
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,600
This is beautiful, is what I think of it.

3013
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,880
Okay, okay, well, then I'm, oh yeah, go ahead.

3014
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:20,080
Does WALL-E have any new character you've created

3015
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,840
that's like a teacher of his or anything?

3016
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,680
Oh, shoot.

3017
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:25,920
Eric.

3018
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,760
WALL-E needs your help.

3019
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:27,600
Not Eric.

3020
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,880
Eric's on mine.

3021
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:32,720
Oh, okay.

3022
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:33,840
Or Eric's Figment's brother.

3023
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,480
He's not WALL-E's teacher.

3024
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:37,840
It's a different character.

3025
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,680
Okay.

3026
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:43,680
I would like a very stiff Andrew Stanton

3027
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:45,720
to do a pre-show video.

3028
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,680
We don't have much time, we have to be quick.

3029
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:49,440
WALL-E needs your help.

3030
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,920
Only you can help WALL-E.

3031
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,880
He would love that.

3032
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:53,920
He's a Parks guy, isn't he?

3033
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,600
Did he write the Mark Davis giant coffee table book,

3034
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,440
I think?

3035
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,280
Oh, really?

3036
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,120
Something like that.

3037
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:00,960
One of the Pixar guys worked on it.

3038
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,120
I think he's got it in him to be as charismatic

3039
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,560
as Steven Spielberg.

3040
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:05,560
I believe so.

3041
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,040
Which is to say, limited,

3042
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,040
but that's what I love is the limited.

3043
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:09,960
Yeah.

3044
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:13,720
Okay, so the ride's exit could perfectly transition

3045
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:16,440
into a stacked hydroponic garden.

3046
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,800
I'm going a little living with the land here

3047
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,600
that forms a lush environment

3048
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,400
for a re-imagined galactic grill,

3049
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,880
I think, to Marlin Terrace, whatever you're calling it.

3050
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,280
Still quick service,

3051
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:31,800
but now serving entirely sustainably grown food.

3052
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,480
We're eating healthy there now.

3053
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:35,040
It's fast, but it's healthy,

3054
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,600
and they have to commit to it.

3055
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,280
They can't say they're doing that

3056
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,200
and then make the food get worse as it goes.

3057
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:44,920
But it's like good, fresh, farm-grown ingredients.

3058
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,640
Let's turn that into a good restaurant

3059
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:48,160
that is the aftermath.

3060
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,600
And in the, you know what?

3061
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,120
It's not consumerist.

3062
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,920
That's the message of WALL-E, right?

3063
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,800
It can't be a gift shop other than getting the plant

3064
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,560
in the boot.

3065
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,880
It has to take you into,

3066
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,800
I mean, it's consumerist because you're in Disneyland

3067
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,520
and you're buying food at a restaurant,

3068
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,120
but it's not a gift shop.

3069
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:07,960
It's a place where you go eat from the earth, you see,

3070
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,760
which WALL-E has made possible for you.

3071
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,200
Beautiful.

3072
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:14,320
You should make available the boot a la carte,

3073
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,440
the boot with seeds,

3074
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,560
just in case people don't want to lug soil home.

3075
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:19,400
Oh, sure.

3076
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,240
But the boot a la carte,

3077
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:22,480
especially for international travelers,

3078
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,480
might have restrictions on bringing plant life

3079
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,000
into their country.

3080
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
This is a very, very good thing that you thought of.

3081
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,440
A good logistical issue,

3082
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:34,200
and I really like the phrase boot a la carte.

3083
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,040
A lot of good stuff happening over there.

3084
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,920
Well, it's what I end up catching down at the pond

3085
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,680
when I'm not catching the ailes.

3086
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,160
I wish they'd throw in French fries and coleslaw,

3087
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:48,200
but it just don't happen.

3088
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,880
Now, I've missed one aspect of this attraction,

3089
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,440
the ride vehicle.

3090
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:57,440
The ride vehicle is an updated and restored people mover.

3091
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:02,240
The people mover is the ride vehicle in the WALL-E ride,

3092
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,880
allowing a high capacity relaxing experience

3093
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,320
for the whole family.

3094
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,920
This is a ride with heart,

3095
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,160
the dreams of a better future for our planet.

3096
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:14,360
But it's not the only heart in Tomorrowland 3055,

3097
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,800
and for that we turn to the long ignored,

3098
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,560
but not destroyed Magic Eye Theater.

3099
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:22,640
The fact is I can't do, I can't blow it up.

3100
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,400
I can't make a new Space Mountain

3101
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:28,600
because I love that area of that Space Mountain atrium

3102
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:32,000
with the big metal bars that feels like an 80s airport.

3103
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,200
I love it too much.

3104
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:35,320
It's too much core memory for me.

3105
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,400
I wanna make it work.

3106
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,280
That's why we got some of Barcade in there.

3107
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,200
And then what we have is a world class venue

3108
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:47,520
that will no longer be limited to previews of movies

3109
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,360
that have been out for years.

3110
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:53,440
In fact, it will no longer be limited to movies at all

3111
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,040
because it will now be home to a little attraction

3112
01:51:56,040 --> 01:52:00,080
called Plekdu's Fantastic Intergalactic Review.

3113
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,840
I'm getting a lot of Tomorrowland 2055 in here

3114
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:05,360
and it's not just due to nostalgia,

3115
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:06,960
nostalgia for what never was.

3116
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,440
I think it can work now today.

3117
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,400
And I don't think that has to be carousel theater.

3118
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,400
I think, honestly, you have to build

3119
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:15,160
less animatronics this way,

3120
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:17,280
but you are still building animatronics.

3121
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,920
God damn it, of course you are.

3122
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:24,240
This is a new country bear, jamboree type

3123
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,720
animatronic and film show.

3124
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,840
You could still screen it,

3125
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,600
but let's update those screens,

3126
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:31,680
teeming with aliens and robots

3127
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,840
from across the Disney universe.

3128
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,920
One thing we have to figure out is who is Plekdu?

3129
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:38,480
What is Plekdu?

3130
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:41,000
And I've decided that Plekdu is the ringleader

3131
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,480
of this whole thing and he is part of the same species

3132
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:47,160
as Skippy from Alien and Counter.

3133
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,000
Here we go.

3134
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:50,920
Yes, he is a Skippy.

3135
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:55,920
His, apparently, his species,

3136
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,120
here's what's happening.

3137
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:00,800
My phone, or sorry, my laptop has autocorrected

3138
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,640
so much of the, in doing this,

3139
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:06,240
I had to teach my computer what Autopia is

3140
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:07,640
and what Plekdu is.

3141
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:10,920
It's trying to tell me that these aren't words,

3142
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,760
but they are words.

3143
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,840
I'm teaching my computer a lot.

3144
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:17,840
My phone tried to correct Chu Chu to Chop Chop.

3145
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:21,920
And I'm like, I must have typed Chu Chu before.

3146
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,440
I need to know the context in which you were trying

3147
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:27,000
to send a message to someone with Chu Chu.

3148
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,920
Great question.

3149
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,880
Jane was sending me a tweet about how there's

3150
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,480
a tiny, big Thunder Mountain playset

3151
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,320
you can buy at Tokyo Disney now.

3152
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,160
Oh, I saw that.

3153
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,560
And I wrote back Chu Chu.

3154
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:40,720
Very good.

3155
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:43,280
This is a text for the ages.

3156
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,920
Anyway, I was, this thing was trying to autocorrect

3157
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:49,840
the species that Skippy is, which is,

3158
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,840
I can say proudly, Fluthmagoon cliffhugger.

3159
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:57,040
That is the species now we know.

3160
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,520
Somehow it didn't come up when we talked

3161
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,680
about alien encounter years ago.

3162
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:04,360
So, this cliffhugger, despite his small stature,

3163
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:07,320
is the most revered musical mind in this or any galaxy.

3164
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,600
And using the power of teleportation,

3165
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:12,440
Plekdu has prepared an incredible show featuring

3166
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:14,480
all the greatest musicians and performers

3167
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,720
across the known universe.

3168
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:21,720
This is now a show, a review, that features Sonny Eclipse.

3169
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:22,560
Whoa!

3170
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:23,400
He's in it.

3171
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,080
You said him before, Max Rebo.

3172
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,560
Max Rebo's in it, they own it, he's in it.

3173
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,760
The Cantina Band is in it, why not?

3174
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,200
Figuring Dan, they own it.

3175
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,800
Why was there not a show that puts all this stuff together?

3176
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:34,920
I hear you.

3177
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,920
Here's where, let me take a deep breath

3178
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,200
and say that the main backing band,

3179
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:43,240
the wrecking crew of this show, will be Hooter,

3180
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:47,520
Heidi and Odie, Major and Minor Domo, Fuzzball,

3181
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:50,840
Captain Eo's pals, who all play music

3182
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:53,520
and turn into instruments at the end of Captain Eo.

3183
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,280
It's the theater where Captain Eo happened.

3184
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:59,640
This will be a great band, we know that they can bring it,

3185
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:03,400
and they will finally be freed from the tyrannical clutches

3186
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:07,640
of their problematic captain, free to do their own thing.

3187
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:08,800
This was a thing I thought about too.

3188
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:11,200
Oh man, they don't work for him anymore.

3189
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,840
It's like, I guess we could just make a new movie

3190
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,360
with a different Captain Eo in there.

3191
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:15,760
That was a pitch I was thinking about.

3192
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's, I don't know.

3193
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,000
Let's just take these characters, they're just,

3194
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,200
they're drums, they're living keyboards now.

3195
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,600
Unless you think that this is only for dorks

3196
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:27,560
and nostalgic for the 80s, this can also be a vessel

3197
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:30,240
to tie together all kinds of Disney IP.

3198
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:33,520
The Toy Story aliens could be in it, Zerg can be in it,

3199
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,760
Zerg can do a song, let's let Zerg do a song.

3200
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:39,800
Baymax, Stitch can do an Elvis song.

3201
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,400
They own the Muppets, they could have the Yip-Yip aliens.

3202
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:46,280
Put the Yip-Yips in it, they'd do some Yip-Yip song.

3203
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,600
Pigs in Space?

3204
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:52,080
Yeah, yeah, sure, yes, yes, and you know what,

3205
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,360
and it doesn't all have to be, they don't all have

3206
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:56,400
to have a song associated with them.

3207
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,560
I think we can draw from the Disney library.

3208
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,640
Well, hey, why not do original stuff too?

3209
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,480
I mean, there's lots of possibilities musically here.

3210
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,000
Hey, you know who's an alien?

3211
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,600
The Navi Shaman song.

3212
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:13,200
What if the Navi Shaman song showed up in her own thing?

3213
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,160
Oh my God.

3214
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:15,160
Yeah, yeah.

3215
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:16,600
She could do a duet with Zerg.

3216
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:20,120
I would love to see Zerg in a full tuxedo,

3217
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:22,840
pulling a Seth MacFarlane and singing some,

3218
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:25,280
like singing Beyond the Sea or something.

3219
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,720
Yeah, yeah, well, what's like a good, you know,

3220
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:31,320
I mean, Randy Newman is the soundtrack of the Toy Story

3221
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:35,480
world, you know, like a really heavy, I don't know,

3222
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:38,280
Living Without You or something sung by Zerg.

3223
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:42,880
Who had to go without his son for so many years.

3224
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:47,360
It's so hard.

3225
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:51,000
Musically, I mean, this could be a way,

3226
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,360
I wanna tie together the whole sci-fi Disney space averse.

3227
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,960
You could do like the Universe of Energy song.

3228
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,800
Oh yeah.

3229
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:59,400
Epcot music could be part of this.

3230
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,920
You know what could be part of this?

3231
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:04,480
Also paying tribute to the legacy of this very spot,

3232
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:07,480
Halix, we could do Halix songs.

3233
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,440
They own the Halix songs.

3234
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:12,000
It's amazing, like to finally use,

3235
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,440
it's such a like fucking movie previews for years

3236
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:18,160
in the place where Halix and Captain EO happened.

3237
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:19,480
We're fixing this.

3238
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:20,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3239
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:21,400
Yes.

3240
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:22,480
I thought about Halix too,

3241
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,840
but I was like, they wouldn't do it.

3242
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,880
I know they would, but I don't know,

3243
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:27,440
they pay attention to stuff.

3244
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,400
The documentary is a huge hit.

3245
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,440
That was a, that's a massive YouTube thing.

3246
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,640
People bring that up to me.

3247
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,680
That's been a way to like reconnect with people

3248
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,200
who I haven't seen in years.

3249
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:39,880
I saw you in that Halix documentary.

3250
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:42,200
That's wild that that is a thing that's getting around.

3251
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,440
And I'm so happy, rightfully so.

3252
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,000
Matthew, Kevin did such a great job.

3253
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,720
But anyway, Halix can be here.

3254
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:51,520
Where else could it build but Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow?

3255
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:54,560
Now we're revitalizing all of these things that they own

3256
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,360
and they could be doing something with.

3257
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:58,560
Like a Skrillex version of Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow.

3258
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,480
That's of course.

3259
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,440
Yes, let Skrillex go to town on that baby.

3260
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:05,360
Finally make it a good song, right Jason?

3261
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:06,200
Yeah.

3262
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,160
We're trying to needle you in failing.

3263
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:13,160
We could really, not in the history,

3264
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:16,840
you could get Devo 3.0 in here.

3265
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:21,160
Even younger children singing the hits of Devo.

3266
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:23,160
Animatronic Devo 3.0.

3267
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:26,920
And yet somehow, and this is not an alien thing,

3268
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,720
but does this not feel like a,

3269
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,680
if we're gonna have lots of alien races

3270
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,200
and different types of robots all working together

3271
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,040
and singing together in harmony,

3272
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:40,040
would not a great way to sum this all up be,

3273
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:42,960
if we listen to each other.

3274
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:44,840
Let's do that, let's do that.

3275
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:46,640
Eye to Eye is the finale.

3276
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:49,480
I think they need a permanent spot

3277
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:51,640
for Eye to Eye somewhere in the parks.

3278
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,680
They've got a Muzak version of Eye to Eye

3279
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:54,920
playing in Toontown.

3280
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:56,000
Really? Yeah.

3281
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,840
Great, great.

3282
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:58,400
And there's others, some like Muzak version of like.

3283
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:59,880
Is that in the queue or is that like out in the.

3284
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:00,720
Out in the.

3285
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,000
That's out in the grass.

3286
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:02,840
Yeah.

3287
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:03,680
Gotcha.

3288
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,560
They have like DuckTales and Chip and Dale Muzak themes.

3289
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:07,400
Oh cool.

3290
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:08,600
And Mickey Mouse Clubhouse songs,

3291
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,240
which now I'm very aware of.

3292
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:11,280
Oh, okay.

3293
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:14,920
Hot Diggity Dog, Bye, They Might Be Giants.

3294
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:15,960
Oh. Hey.

3295
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:17,600
Which plays on the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

3296
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,600
Wow, wow, wow.

3297
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:19,680
Okay, okay.

3298
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:24,240
Anyway, this is gonna of course also be installed

3299
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:26,040
at Epcot's Magic Eye Theater.

3300
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:27,360
We don't have to limit ourselves to,

3301
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,040
I mean space wise, who fucking knows,

3302
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,400
but we'll figure it out, they'll figure it out.

3303
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,520
It also, some of it could be screens.

3304
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,000
If we go really good screens.

3305
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:34,840
Sure.

3306
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:37,360
If we go born-stuntacular screens, maybe now we,

3307
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,280
I don't know, if we're limited in space,

3308
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,880
it could be a mix of animatronics

3309
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:45,680
and just really good screen technology.

3310
01:59:45,680 --> 01:59:48,760
Also, here's a thought too.

3311
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,840
If we're, of course we all love this.

3312
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:52,400
It's very 80s, 90s.

3313
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:56,960
If ultimately, somehow this is not seized upon by the world,

3314
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,200
I have another idea.

3315
01:59:58,200 --> 01:59:59,720
Because to do this right,

3316
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:01,640
you'd have to do a full refresh of the seating

3317
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:03,320
and the sound for this theater.

3318
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:06,160
You'd put immersive speakers next to every seat.

3319
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:08,760
During the day, this would create incredible quality

3320
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,200
for the music for Plectu's Intergalactic Review.

3321
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:15,240
But at night, it could enable an entire second show.

3322
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:19,120
Imagine a Monsters After Dark night only,

3323
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:21,920
perhaps Halloween only, or maybe it expands.

3324
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,280
But imagine if the same space passed a certain hour

3325
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:28,400
transformed into an experience meant only for adults

3326
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:29,840
and the bravest of children.

3327
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:32,760
A re-imagined alien encounter.

3328
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,880
Oh wow, this theater.

3329
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,960
In the same theater, in this theater.

3330
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:40,480
I guess that had harnesses before, but whatever.

3331
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:41,920
I think you'd re, I don't know,

3332
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,920
you could discombobulate it.

3333
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,680
Just do something new with it.

3334
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:47,160
But sort of that idea,

3335
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,360
and I haven't fleshed this out thoroughly,

3336
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:53,360
but imagine if now it finally is featuring the true alien,

3337
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,200
now the property of Disney,

3338
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,600
as it was meant to be in this neck of the park.

3339
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:00,000
The xenomorph is actually in

3340
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,320
a new re-imagined alien encounter.

3341
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,160
Wow.

3342
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,240
Yeah, that would be very cool.

3343
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:06,560
I also thought a little bit about some of that alien stuff,

3344
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,400
but then I was,

3345
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,880
I guess really like you could've put like a mind,

3346
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,480
Buzz Lightyear could've done like a cartoon xenomorph.

3347
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:12,320
Oh sure.

3348
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:13,640
But then, a cute-ish xenomorph.

3349
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:16,920
Are we aware real quick of the Haunted Mansion

3350
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:19,760
Krusty reference that's been removed?

3351
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:20,600
No.

3352
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,600
In Haunted Mansion Holiday, on one of the boxes

3353
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:26,520
where like the Jack in the Box pops out,

3354
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:29,640
there's a kind of haunted-looking Krusty the Clown

3355
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:32,480
on the box, and people pointed it out right away.

3356
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:35,120
Oh, this is a Simpsons reference in a Disney park.

3357
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:37,440
In the Haunted Mansion, people pointed it out right away,

3358
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,560
three or four days later, gone.

3359
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,400
Wow.

3360
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,240
Wow.

3361
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,400
Jeez, I wonder what does that mean.

3362
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,360
I don't know.

3363
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:47,480
Wait a minute, is the Tim Burton Batman Returns duck in there?

3364
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:49,480
The tiny toy duck.

3365
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:50,320
Is it weird?

3366
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:51,200
Do you know about this?

3367
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,040
In the Haunted Mansion?

3368
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:52,880
In Haunted Mansion Holiday,

3369
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,240
there's a small duck that looks like

3370
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,920
the Penguin's giant duck.

3371
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:58,960
I did not see that.

3372
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,320
It's been there for years.

3373
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,160
Oh.

3374
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,000
What?

3375
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:02,840
Yeah.

3376
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:04,760
But is it just a duck-looking thing?

3377
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,720
It looks like the duck.

3378
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,560
Okay.

3379
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,400
It looks like the vehicle that the Penguin.

3380
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:10,240
So it's a little reference,

3381
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:11,080
it's because Tim Burton produced the movie.

3382
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,600
It's a little nod, because Tim Burton, yeah.

3383
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:13,440
Oh.

3384
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:14,280
Produced the movie.

3385
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:15,100
Oh wait, I get a second comment.

3386
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:16,200
But it's sort of like the Mr. Limpet Fish.

3387
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:17,920
Right, it's not official, yeah, yeah.

3388
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:20,960
It's not official enough, and it's,

3389
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:21,800
I see.

3390
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:22,620
You know what I mean?

3391
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:25,340
Mr. Limpet yet, the character is on the Snow White,

3392
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:28,460
or Snow White, it's been a long record, I guess.

3393
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,300
A Little Mermaid ride.

3394
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:30,140
A Little Mermaid.

3395
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:30,980
Yeah.

3396
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:31,900
Oh, they don't, and they don't own Limpet.

3397
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:32,940
That's a brazen cut.

3398
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:33,780
Wow, wow.

3399
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:35,420
Yeah, so he's just, he's not lit up,

3400
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:37,660
Mr. Limpet, on the Little Mermaid ride,

3401
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:39,220
and you have to know where to look.

3402
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:41,260
And that's definitely one of my top.

3403
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:43,260
Grab the person next to me by the arm,

3404
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:44,540
and shake the arm, and tell them,

3405
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:47,140
look, it's Mr. Limpet, the character of Mr. Limpet.

3406
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:47,980
The time-out's played.

3407
02:02:47,980 --> 02:02:49,460
And they're like, what is that?

3408
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:50,300
Yeah, of course.

3409
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:51,140
Let go of me.

3410
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:54,220
I was born in the 1980s, what is that?

3411
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:55,580
What's wrong with you?

3412
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:56,740
Are you a time traveler?

3413
02:02:56,740 --> 02:02:58,740
Your daughter just responds with, eh.

3414
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:04,820
So, brand new attractions, revitalized favorites

3415
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:06,740
from Tomorrowland's past and never built,

3416
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:09,460
light speed and slow speed, thrills and heart,

3417
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:12,500
it's all waiting in Tomorrowland 3055,

3418
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,460
my blue sky presentation.

3419
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:18,900
That felt, I felt emotional writing this.

3420
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:19,740
I bet.

3421
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:22,220
Even just imagining that any of the,

3422
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:25,060
I wanted to go so deep in thinking about this

3423
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:27,540
that maybe it like, lands in my dreams.

3424
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:30,500
I wanna dream about some of this stuff so bad.

3425
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:31,380
I want to too.

3426
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:34,300
I mean, there's a lot of marquee attractions.

3427
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:38,780
It's like, it's kinda like that moment at the movies

3428
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:41,900
in the middle of summer, kind of about now,

3429
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,860
where like, all the blockbusters

3430
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:47,820
and some big indie surprise hits are playing at once.

3431
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:50,900
And you're like, look at all these movies.

3432
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,460
Yeah, well, that's how it should feel.

3433
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:53,700
That's how it could feel.

3434
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:56,340
I don't, you know, it's like some ideas they've sort of done.

3435
02:03:56,340 --> 02:03:57,900
It's some blue sky stuff.

3436
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:02,540
And like, as I said, there's enough that I love

3437
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:04,100
about what's there and what's been there

3438
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:05,940
that I don't wanna fully blow it up.

3439
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:09,540
I do ask you, and I mean, maybe just really quick,

3440
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:10,980
if you were gonna fully blow it up,

3441
02:04:10,980 --> 02:04:12,900
if you had my assignment, what's the,

3442
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:16,620
is there like, do you flash to this thing's out entirely?

3443
02:04:16,660 --> 02:04:19,620
I'm not joking when I say I level the whole,

3444
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:20,540
everything goes.

3445
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:21,380
Wow.

3446
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:23,300
You rebuild space, I mean, the only thing is like,

3447
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:26,660
keeping something that looks sort of space mountainish,

3448
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:28,700
but I think I would rebuild the whole thing.

3449
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:29,540
Yeah.

3450
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:32,460
Because I would want whatever that Tokyo space mountain is.

3451
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:34,260
Yeah, yeah, and maybe I should have,

3452
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:36,940
but again, I love my atrium, it's weird,

3453
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:39,460
and I love Star Tours, and I don't, you know.

3454
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:40,900
I think there's a really good version

3455
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:44,420
that's a full blow up, but it's not my version.

3456
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:45,260
Yeah.

3457
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:46,100
I wouldn't be honest.

3458
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:48,140
Definitely, I would have blown the whole thing up,

3459
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:50,900
it would have been like two stories,

3460
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:53,620
like Tomorrowland 2055.

3461
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:56,740
Yeah, well, you know what I thought about is that like,

3462
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:58,900
at least the WALL-E side of things,

3463
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:00,660
the former Buzz Lightyear side of things,

3464
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:04,940
that that could be room for like a Tron tunnel or something,

3465
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:07,020
like the show scene happens in there.

3466
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:11,540
So you could, maybe you raise, like that one's gone,

3467
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:13,140
Star Tours, I'm capin' though.

3468
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:15,700
Right, and then, yeah, and then just,

3469
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:20,260
yeah, I don't think, I think the Lagoon goes,

3470
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:22,500
I think Autopia goes for me.

3471
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:23,340
Yeah, yeah.

3472
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:27,220
And then I think another full, PeopleMover is there,

3473
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:31,300
it's New Space Mountain, I think there's,

3474
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:33,420
I would add one more e-ticket

3475
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:36,180
that would be like in a completely original e-ticket.

3476
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:37,020
Yeah.

3477
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:39,380
That's like, this is off the top of my head,

3478
02:05:39,380 --> 02:05:44,380
like some sort of like planetary exploration ride.

3479
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:45,980
Okay.

3480
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:48,420
Where you're like goin' through like, I don't know,

3481
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:51,420
maybe like a crater, like an asteroid or something.

3482
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,820
More of an on the ground sort of.

3483
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:55,820
You're running into aliens and stuff,

3484
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:58,580
and it could be kinda scary, depending.

3485
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:01,340
Could you be like in an astronaut training

3486
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:03,300
and Gary Sinise is there?

3487
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:04,940
Gary Sinise could be there, yes.

3488
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:07,220
And you're in a G-Force, like?

3489
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:10,620
We call it Mission Space, but it could be good,

3490
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:13,140
and it could be more of a dark ride

3491
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:14,540
where you come upon aliens

3492
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:17,020
and like you're now exploring the surface of a planet.

3493
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:18,500
What about like Journey to the Center of the Earth,

3494
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,380
but it's in space?

3495
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,220
Sure.

3496
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:21,820
The way, like those cool caves that you.

3497
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:22,660
Yeah.

3498
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,380
Yeah, you know what, God, that's really good.

3499
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:27,300
That is a future aesthetic that isn't mined anywhere,

3500
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:30,540
is like craters underground.

3501
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:32,700
Here's an interesting, this is again,

3502
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:34,060
I haven't thought this through to where,

3503
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:36,360
but if you could have it where it was almost like

3504
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:39,820
a Tower of Terror ride system,

3505
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:41,820
and you could kind of float almost

3506
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:43,660
and make it feel like you were zero gravity.

3507
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:45,660
If there was a way, I guess maybe Kuka Arm

3508
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:48,100
is the way to do it, but a Kuka Arm

3509
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,300
that wouldn't so kind of aggressively move you around,

3510
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:51,140
if it could almost like,

3511
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:53,420
a Kuka Arm that was really gentle,

3512
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:54,780
that could kind of float you.

3513
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:55,940
Serene feeling.

3514
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:58,620
Yeah, so it could kind of float you in front of things

3515
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:00,280
and you could get jump scares that way,

3516
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:01,580
but then you could get like cool,

3517
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:03,760
like feeling like you're zero gravity

3518
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:05,420
where you're kind of jumping.

3519
02:07:05,420 --> 02:07:06,520
That feeling that you would always,

3520
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:09,180
when you see like the footage of the people on the moon,

3521
02:07:09,180 --> 02:07:11,500
where you're like, oh, that would be so cool to be jumping

3522
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:14,420
and you'd have like 10 seconds of hang time,

3523
02:07:14,420 --> 02:07:16,100
something like that.

3524
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:17,420
Like I would have gone with another, yeah,

3525
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:18,580
like a completely original.

3526
02:07:18,580 --> 02:07:19,940
The gravity, representing the gravity

3527
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:21,660
like on the ground on the moon.

3528
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,000
Something like that.

3529
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:23,840
Yeah, yeah.

3530
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:26,940
Because I'm obsessed with that patent for that spider,

3531
02:07:26,940 --> 02:07:31,140
probably a Spider-Man ride that was suspending you

3532
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:34,160
from the ceiling on kind of like a row of chairs

3533
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:36,620
that would have simulated swinging like Spider-Man,

3534
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:38,860
because it's when we talk about like,

3535
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:40,860
well, what would you want from the property

3536
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:41,700
with Spider-Man?

3537
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:44,140
It's like swinging is the coolest thing

3538
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:46,860
if you could actually feel like you were swinging

3539
02:07:46,860 --> 02:07:48,140
in a practical city,

3540
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:50,260
which is what it looked like that ride would have been.

3541
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,100
And I guess it gets like.

3542
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,540
Well, getting a good upper body workout

3543
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,900
is also a very cool thing.

3544
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:54,740
Well, that's true too.

3545
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:57,340
Yeah, having really warm down shoulders.

3546
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:58,180
It's pretty fun.

3547
02:07:58,180 --> 02:07:59,000
Sure.

3548
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,700
But yeah, even though I do love the stuff

3549
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:02,860
you're talking about in Tomorrowland,

3550
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:07,760
I'm like, I'm envisioning like crazy new Tomorrowland.

3551
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:09,260
Well, I almost like, you know,

3552
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:13,980
I almost feel like I landed at not fully,

3553
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:17,260
but I had a lot of like logic in mind

3554
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,620
and in keeping infrastructure.

3555
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:20,860
So I almost feel like mine,

3556
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:22,800
if there was any failing in what I did,

3557
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,620
it was that the, like,

3558
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:28,740
it was like maybe somewhere between mid and blue sky.

3559
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:31,460
I do like the dreaming of,

3560
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:33,180
no, yeah, it's just, you know,

3561
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:35,280
to personal taste, I suppose.

3562
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:38,740
But yeah, something fully new.

3563
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:42,820
I think I am so hung up on what they've wanted to do.

3564
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:46,780
I do, I love all of the never built Tomorrowland stuff,

3565
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:48,460
almost like more than what I think

3566
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:50,100
I could come up with myself.

3567
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:52,820
Well, I love so much of these ideas.

3568
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:57,820
I think reusing that UFO abduction drop tower is like,

3569
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:00,940
I think yours were a lot of e-tech kids

3570
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:03,340
and honored Disney history

3571
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:05,980
and then no idea ever abandoned, you know.

3572
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:07,700
What we both were doing

3573
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:08,980
was trying to like,

3574
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:11,820
cause there's so much stuff that's gone

3575
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:14,660
that we miss or miss cause it didn't exist

3576
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:19,220
and trying to like encapsulate that sign,

3577
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:23,220
trying to like forge that in iron

3578
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:24,500
so it can't go away.

3579
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:27,220
It has a presence like there forever

3580
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:30,600
or like just like embalm it.

3581
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:33,600
So like we can still get little tastes

3582
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,700
of all the stuff we like from the history of Disney.

3583
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:39,980
Cause it feels like so much of that weird stuff is gone.

3584
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:42,820
So just trying to sneak it in here and there.

3585
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:44,500
Yeah, we're still very IP brand.

3586
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:45,340
We like we need,

3587
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:48,500
we know even in a blue sky version, you like want that.

3588
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:50,180
But I do love some of this IP.

3589
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:51,860
That's the thing,

3590
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:54,100
Metron, I love the aesthetic of at least.

3591
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:56,780
I do love Wally, like of all the areas,

3592
02:09:56,780 --> 02:09:57,760
I think there are a lot

3593
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:01,700
and some Toy Story Buzz representation, you know.

3594
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:03,480
I don't need it to be free of IP.

3595
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:05,360
That said, I love your crater.

3596
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,960
It's just off the top of my head or whatever.

3597
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:10,680
I know, you don't even have notes out.

3598
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:11,840
Can you put the guitar down?

3599
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,920
We don't have it hooked up to the audio.

3600
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,760
You can't sing.

3601
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:17,040
I'm just strumming G, A minor, D minor.

3602
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:18,240
I'm just feeling it.

3603
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,600
I feel like we should wind it down,

3604
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:25,080
but I mean, I don't think there's any winning or losing here.

3605
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:25,920
No.

3606
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,920
The only losers will be all of us

3607
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:30,440
when they don't stay anything close

3608
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:33,360
to any of what was said, not even the sod.

3609
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,440
I actually, trying to be faithful to current company,

3610
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:37,720
I have been laid off.

3611
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:41,080
I've been kicked out of the Slack channels.

3612
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:43,560
You got fired from your fictional job?

3613
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:46,800
I was only 10.99 anyway, so.

3614
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,720
It's not like an official firing.

3615
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:49,560
Yeah.

3616
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:52,400
Oh man, so you didn't get insurance anyway.

3617
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,360
It's just freelance.

3618
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:56,320
Covered California actually got worse

3619
02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:00,800
because of the increased revenue, increased income.

3620
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:03,880
Boy, oh boy, I am so sorry for your fake struggles.

3621
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:08,280
Sorry, so many thoughts in my head at once.

3622
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,160
What is the most logical thing

3623
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:13,040
that they'll announce of all three of these pitches?

3624
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:14,880
Is there one thing that one of us has said

3625
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:17,000
where you go, well, that is gonna happen?

3626
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,080
Is there a single thing?

3627
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:20,640
I think some, I don't think they will.

3628
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:23,440
The fact that we both landed there,

3629
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:26,360
I think something with Carousel and Space Restaurant

3630
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:28,280
or something, or it's a bar up there,

3631
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:30,160
you build higher or you make that building cooler,

3632
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,120
they should, I don't know if they will,

3633
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:35,200
but I think if they actually are gonna redo all of Tomorrowland,

3634
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:37,200
now I'm like, that we both landed there means

3635
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:38,280
maybe they will too.

3636
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,320
Maybe, yeah.

3637
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:42,120
But, yeah, you're right.

3638
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:44,480
Of what was said, what do we think actually will?

3639
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,960
Ant-Man could be the answer.

3640
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:50,560
This ride is, now I've watched it, it's nonsense.

3641
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:52,960
It took me a while to realize,

3642
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,880
oh, Ant-Man, you're shrunk down.

3643
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:55,880
They still have the rule

3644
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:58,400
that Marvel's in California Adventure, but.

3645
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,240
I guess.

3646
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:02,560
That's like an easy thing they've got designed

3647
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:05,240
that would fit and it would be an announcement

3648
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:07,600
of something somewhat exciting to.

3649
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:08,440
I don't know.

3650
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:09,280
I don't know.

3651
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:10,120
I think it's gotta be from yours, right?

3652
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:11,640
What do you think from yours, Mike?

3653
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:16,000
Well, from mine, I mean, I don't,

3654
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,880
I don't think they're gonna do my Buzz Lightyear idea,

3655
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:21,600
but I think they could potentially announce

3656
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:23,240
just other Star Tours levels.

3657
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:25,480
They could, it's possible they could just throw those in.

3658
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,200
I think it's funny we all got rid of Buzz,

3659
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:29,000
which I don't know that they're guaranteed to.

3660
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:30,640
Well, I kept Buzz the character.

3661
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:31,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3662
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:32,320
So I just changed it.

3663
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:33,360
But we all agreed something there,

3664
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:34,400
which I don't think we've like.

3665
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,240
Yeah, that's true.

3666
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:36,080
It's not that I dislike the ride,

3667
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:37,520
it's just like there's still possibilities.

3668
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,560
It needs something, it needs a refreshing.

3669
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,400
There's little juice, something.

3670
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:42,560
It needs some juice.

3671
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:43,400
Yeah.

3672
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,240
Some fresh juice.

3673
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:47,080
It's hard, I cannot come up with what,

3674
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:48,960
I mean, it's something to carousel building,

3675
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,640
but I'm not sure what it is.

3676
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:51,480
Maybe.

3677
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:52,320
Yes, yes, it is something,

3678
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,440
if you're right, it's something there.

3679
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:56,160
Is there any possibility that Tron is there

3680
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:57,320
and not in the new?

3681
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,120
This is the whole thing,

3682
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,520
I'm looking at Google Maps and I'm looking

3683
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:03,520
at the footprint of Tron in Magic Kingdom,

3684
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,320
and I'm like, it's so big.

3685
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:07,520
That's why I went with a deconstructed.

3686
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:10,120
I like Tron as people movers.

3687
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:12,480
Kind of both of our ideas in different ways.

3688
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:14,000
I really love that idea.

3689
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,240
I think they should do it.

3690
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:16,920
And again, I want as much,

3691
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:18,360
I'm just like, let's do shit here,

3692
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:22,040
so then it's all free over in Disneyland Forest.

3693
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:23,680
It still feels like if they do a rear,

3694
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:26,680
like a bridged Tron or a different Tron,

3695
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:29,120
it still feels like they're gonna have to build a lot.

3696
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:33,120
It doesn't feel like there's an easy plot of land

3697
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,520
for them to build this new Tron

3698
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:38,960
because it still needs long stretches for it to go fast.

3699
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:41,560
So, I mean, your idea into the Esplanade,

3700
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:44,920
it makes a lot of sense if they're gonna,

3701
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:49,280
if it's gonna coincide with the expansion of that area.

3702
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:52,280
So, yeah, I guess it's possible,

3703
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:53,400
but I was just looking at it going,

3704
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:55,680
ah, it feels like that's a lot of work for them

3705
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:57,320
to figure out where to put Tron here.

3706
02:13:57,320 --> 02:14:00,400
I don't think you can just do regular light cycle run.

3707
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:01,960
You can't, I don't think it's possible.

3708
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:05,000
That's right, I want them to do something bold.

3709
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,400
But yes, then it's an expensive thing, I think,

3710
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:08,320
because then they gotta build

3711
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:10,160
either on top of infrastructure there

3712
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:12,760
or they gotta go behind into different areas,

3713
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:15,200
and I don't know which buildings are necessary.

3714
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:17,600
And then the train stuff is right there.

3715
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:19,960
There's like a road, there's like a service road,

3716
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:22,280
and then the train stuff is right there.

3717
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:24,400
And you're at Harbor pretty fast, too.

3718
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,720
It's a tough gambit.

3719
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:30,040
Listeners, we had to think so hard about all these things.

3720
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:30,960
It's tricky.

3721
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:33,160
Oh, the maps, all of us.

3722
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:34,640
It wasn't, yeah, you know what?

3723
02:14:34,640 --> 02:14:36,440
It was a struggle for all of us.

3724
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:38,800
Jason's the only one who got fired, but otherwise.

3725
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,840
I try my best, I mean, I'll still put it on my resume.

3726
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,520
You should, yeah, you should.

3727
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,160
It's a bad time to look for work

3728
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:50,200
in Southern California entertainment industry, but.

3729
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:53,560
Cissier, you personally redesigned and painted

3730
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:55,720
all of New Tomorrowland at Disneyland.

3731
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:58,440
Yep, yep, I'm willing to start from the bottom

3732
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:01,760
and I'm hard, my, you know, my greatest weakness

3733
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,960
is actually that I'm too hard of a worker.

3734
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,040
That's smart, that's a good tip.

3735
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:07,480
I care too much.

3736
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:09,000
That's a good thing to say when you're in an interview.

3737
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
It's a tip, good tip.

3738
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,560
All right, well, that's good because

3739
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:15,720
we got a lot of sod to sew.

3740
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:18,240
Well, you are hired as a sodsman.

3741
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:20,960
Okay, well, at least that has benefits

3742
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,280
in the Landscaper's Union, right?

3743
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,160
Of course, yeah.

3744
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,000
Okay.

3745
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:27,720
We've undermined the union a little bit,

3746
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:29,640
don't worry about it. Oh, no.

3747
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:32,560
Well, we will see, we will see tomorrow,

3748
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:35,160
if tomorrow, if there is anything close

3749
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:36,520
to what we have discussed for Tomorrowland.

3750
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:39,000
Yes, and real quick, I'd like to say,

3751
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,960
why not do this concept with other lands?

3752
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:45,360
Ooh, you're right, you're right.

3753
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,200
May as well.

3754
02:15:46,200 --> 02:15:48,200
I enjoyed it, I hope the listener did too.

3755
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:50,600
I absolute well, that's, hey, listeners,

3756
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:52,880
what do you want us to,

3757
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:55,960
you know what, yeah, because any,

3758
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:59,520
even the best land could use it, you know?

3759
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,320
I'll demolish almost any land.

3760
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:02,760
Yeah, yeah.

3761
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:04,520
It's interesting, like, make it better,

3762
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:05,360
I'll try to make it better,

3763
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,760
that's the whole goal, I think,

3764
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:08,560
if you get the, if you draw,

3765
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:10,280
I think we'll keep this structure,

3766
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:13,400
and if you draw the special blue sky

3767
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,080
where you could demolish everything,

3768
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:16,480
just try to make it better.

3769
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:18,800
Yeah, I'm helping, I'm just here to help.

3770
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,640
Just here to help.

3771
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:21,400
And you know what, building our dream

3772
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:23,760
Disneyland four words is also probably,

3773
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:24,600
I think we should do that too.

3774
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:26,400
Yeah, yeah, I think we should.

3775
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,800
All right, well, hey, new ideas opened up.

3776
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:31,400
I hope you enjoyed this mental exercise.

3777
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:35,000
I hope that you're sad that none of what we said will happen.

3778
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:35,920
I hope that there is,

3779
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:39,160
I hope that there is, like, the Avatar onboarding.

3780
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:41,440
I don't get to actually live on Pandora,

3781
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:44,760
and I hope that all of you are upset

3782
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,760
that some of these cool things will never happen.

3783
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:47,840
I know I am.

3784
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:51,440
I have to say goodbye now to Plectu

3785
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:53,640

3798
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,840
Wow.

3799
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:25,680
Imagine.

3800
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:26,500
I hope not.

3801
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:27,340
Imagine.

3802
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:28,360
Everyone wished so hard.

3803
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:29,320
Imagine if you will.

3804
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:30,360
They said nothing.

3805
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:33,160
You know, the story is no story

3806
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:36,960
because what is better story than a blank piece of paper?
