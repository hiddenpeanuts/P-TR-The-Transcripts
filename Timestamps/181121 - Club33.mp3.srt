1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:26,908
podcast arrived, the second gate, the fancy upper class rich person edition

3
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:31,188
right behind that sweet paywall. My name is Mike Carlson as always joining me

4
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:37,868
Jason Sheridan. Hi Scott Gardner. Hey yeah if you if you're listening to this then I

5
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:45,508
assume that you have paid your $25,000 episode admittance fee and that in order

6
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:51,508
to continue listening to it you will pay your $10,000 yearly episode renewal fee.

7
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:55,648
And if you haven't paid those things and there has clearly been a lapse in the

8
00:00:55,648 --> 00:01:01,508
patreon system if you only paid a some $5 monthly then there's a big we're

9
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:07,248
missing out on a lot of funds. Someone had mentioned because about the patreon that

10
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:13,728
we should have like a club 33 like there should be some insane like $5,000

11
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:18,168
membership for some other specific like I don't know what it would be like being

12
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:21,708
sitting here watching us do this live that doesn't sound pleasant. I thought

13
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:27,088
the joke was that it was $33. I saw a different one I saw that too I saw a

14
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,608
different one though. Oh I saw another one person mentioned like an actual

15
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:36,568
tier I think. If we can think of a decent enough tier to yeah 33 is like cap it

16
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:41,268
because it's supposedly club 33 is like 500 members is that right? That's a

17
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,048
number I kept seeing pop up but there's it's not clear. There's a lot of like

18
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:48,608
numbers that aren't clear about club 33. I think it gets dicey once you incorporate

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,508
corporate membership. Right because some of the memberships. Yeah companies they

20
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:56,288
could be counting it as one they could be counting yeah. I think I think $33 a

21
00:01:56,288 --> 00:02:03,608
month maybe gets you exclusive China sets each month delivered to your home

22
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:09,308
with the podcast the ride logo. Super fan so we have to find a China manufacturer

23
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:13,788
once we do. Okay that's good. We got a great perk. You get a new plate every

24
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:17,988
month and the longer you subscribe the more you end up with a full 30-piece set.

25
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:22,248
Yeah that's a good look that's a great idea if we can find a cheap China

26
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:27,928
manufacturer. Don't tell them it's cheap no it's the finest quality real

27
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:31,768
gold leaf slated into the plates. Well we'll work on that is what we're saying

28
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:35,428
but thank you by the way this is the first one recording patreon where we've

29
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:43,768
seen the people actually are interested in the patreon. Yeah. And they like to thank you

30
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:49,788
It's super encouraging and it makes us very excited to do more stuff. Yeah we're having fun

31
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:53,728
patreon ideas all the time and I especially love that right away people

32
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:58,008
were commenting you got to do this you need to do one and so again this is this

33
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:03,628
is for y'all tell us what you want us to do and what we're very happy to get the

34
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:09,548
prompts and you know the more obscure the better over here you know. Yes.

35
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:14,528
We're unfettered by people who you know we don't have to go back and explain what all the

36
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:19,848
stuff is we can just dive straight into yeah I don't want to ruin any surprises

37
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:26,248
I guess but we were talking about a well who is the character the in the in the

38
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:31,408
factory that you go oh yeah so so yeah we don't want to we will tease a little

39
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:35,188
bit of an episode that will be coming in the next couple months probably but

40
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:39,128
there's a character if you know it his name and he's a character I think he's a

41
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:44,908
real man as well but his name is Papa Steve and even just leave it at that

42
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:50,088
like will you write us and tell us if you know what Papa Steve is I didn't but

43
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:53,988
you guys have a long history with Papa Steve yeah I have multiple I'll just say

44
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:58,548
this I have multiple photos of Jason through the years I think at least two I

45
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:04,088
got to go back to the archives of Jason and a picture of Papa Steve and well

46
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:07,508
yeah let's just leave it at that I mean you guys are theme park nerds and

47
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:12,468
weirdos so you figure out who Papa Steve is fan favorite maybe that's what

48
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:16,728
deep-cut fan favorite yeah and that's what paid the patreon's all about yeah

49
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:20,448
I think maybe maybe what if it's that someone has to either email us or

50
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:25,908
comment on the patreon or tweet it as who Papa Steve is and that will unlock

51
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:29,848
the episode oh yeah then we'll have to do it like pretty quickly but somebody

52
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:34,868
has to name it yeah yeah yeah that's good I like that but otherwise maybe we

53
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:37,728
should just do it get it in the can but maybe it never comes out unless people

54
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:42,468
solve the mystery of Papa Steve sure I bet it doesn't take much well I don't

55
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:45,628
know it's a this is a good little theme for the audience to play I do think Papa

56
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:50,588
Steve is on the higher end of obscure Disney character although that's a too

57
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:55,248
much of a hint actually okay I said Disney but I think he's I think we'll

58
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:58,848
see we'll see I will I will will be surprised yeah

59
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:06,648
a licensed character there is not a park star of Papa Steve there's no vinyl

60
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:11,588
nation of Papa Steve as far as I know no t-shirts available yet no merch we

61
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:16,908
popularized Papa Steve with our audience and we and we profit off of his likeness

62
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:21,848
yeah the Papa Steve merch will roll we'll get a lawsuit from his estate

63
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:28,828
there's a state if you're dead yes okay sorry I don't know cuz I frankly well

64
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,248
I'll save it I'll save it for the episode but uh yeah when we sell Papa

65
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:38,588
Steve t-shirts and then the bootleg knockoff puff puff sativa shirts which

66
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:43,748
is just the Papa Steve shirt and he's got a little joy this map so everything

67
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:50,248
we talk about we're going to sell pot themed version like Bart Simpson kicking

68
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:56,128
Saddam's ass not sure if and I would have you Google Papa Steve the first

69
00:05:56,128 --> 00:06:00,408
thing that comes up is Papa Steve's no junk raw protein bars and it's a guy

70
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:05,068
named Steve Dybald this is not Papa Steve we're talking about that's a good

71
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:08,848
hint that's a good narrow down right I'm really excited I'm glad we gave the

72
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,748
audience a little mission here and I'm excited to see if it's fruitful and also

73
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:19,508
Papa Steve 100% sure on Steve right oh yeah it's in the photo okay as long as

74
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:25,888
it's in the photo there's for some reason I got in my head Papa Mark but I

75
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:32,188
it's just a pizza place in Pennsylvania my family goes to sometimes no I mean I

76
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:35,888
I'm gonna look right at the photo here I sent it yesterday there's a picture of

77
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:42,648
you looking longingly at this photo and it says Papa Steve at the bottom okay

78
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:49,088
very good so confirmed Papa Steve but please send us when you discover Papa

79
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:55,148
Steve is and that will unlock the episode yep I'll give it hints Papa Steve is

80
00:06:55,468 --> 00:07:01,128
from an active attraction it is not a dead attraction oh so you can find okay

81
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:05,328
yeah that's good oh that'd be the best way to unlock it send us a photo of you

82
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:10,268
and Papa Steve yes yeah huh interesting okay this is this is great well I think

83
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,508
you're gonna start I also think somebody's gonna get this immediately

84
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:18,528
yeah I think that's entirely likely yeah yeah also we have not when we say unlock

85
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:22,688
we don't mean in the patreon sense we have not recorded that episode yet just

86
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:28,108
general scheme of it'll force our hand there's a lot of terms yeah on that

87
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:32,788
website that we're still learning so look at this we're still to work we're

88
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:37,468
sending in on on the exclusive scavenger hunts this is a per this is a premium

89
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:42,648
experience already and which which is fitting with today's topic which is the

90
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:50,228
ultimate Disney Disneyland premium experience that we got to experience for

91
00:07:50,448 --> 00:07:57,608
ourselves will this be a braggy episode potentially and I apologize to the

92
00:07:57,608 --> 00:08:02,188
audience if it verges on that however you've been listening to us presumably

93
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:06,728
for a little while I hope that you're that you're happy for us that we got to

94
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:12,808
enter the promised land of of Club 33 so how do we and we'll talk a little bit

95
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:16,768
about you know Club 33 in general in the history of it and everything but let's

96
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:22,628
I guess explain our experience I think we alluded to it in an episode but we got

97
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:29,108
to go thanks to our our new friends as of the who made who made our live show

98
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:35,248
possible Richard and Nicholas Kraft who ran the that's from Disneyland gallery

99
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,928
where we did our live show which hopefully you checked out and also we

100
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:46,748
were at we were it was very fun to be joined by Paul Scheer who also did a

101
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:52,728
and to say thanks Richard brought us into Club 33 and specifically into the

102
00:08:52,728 --> 00:09:01,088
into the lounge where which is a newer area of the club called Le Salon Nouveau

103
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:10,048
Le Salon Nouveau so we had a we had a super fun lunch that went on and on and

104
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:15,408
on that dragged out we were there for so long it was such a delight and don't

105
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:20,688
I was gonna say dragged on seems like it might be like a bummer but no yeah wrong

106
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:26,068
drag good in a dragging in a good way yeah like leisurely a leisurely drag

107
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:34,208
drag from what I understand about Europe absolutely yeah yeah yeah so hey this was

108
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:39,508
this was a blast how do we handle this do we talk about the the place in

109
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:44,868
general and we talk about our experience or yeah I guess I mean it was very cool

110
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:49,748
in general we went to that we Jason I went down with Paul a little early we

111
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:53,428
rode the Ferris wheel which is the first time I ever rode the Ferris wheel

112
00:09:53,428 --> 00:10:00,788
around yes and that'll be an episode pal around definitely a patreon episode and

113
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:04,968
yeah and then so say is pal around separate from yes wheel for sure

114
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:08,368
separate from fun wheel yeah that's two different episodes no way we could

115
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:12,708
possibly contain fun wheel and pal around yeah the mythology is all different

116
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:18,228
from pal around to fun wheel yeah I well on the other rounds I don't well I don't

117
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:23,388
want to give away to my but I had a perfectly lovely ride on it and once we

118
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:28,908
got off you were like I was I had a comfortable I had a little mild panic

119
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:32,488
attack as the first who was going up and it probably didn't help we were loaded

120
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:38,688
in with a another party I didn't realize I thought like oh Ferris wheel we were

121
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,328
we will get our own car oh yeah well they got to pack them in because the

122
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:46,408
thing is such a bad loading that helped because they took a nice picture of us

123
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:51,488
yeah that was nice I where is that photo send that to me I haven't seen it Scott

124
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:55,388
hasn't seen anyway but so we went on a couple rides and then we met up with

125
00:10:55,388 --> 00:11:02,328
Scott and it was a very crowded it was Columbus when it was Columbus yeah and

126
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:10,248
that was nightmarish around there like getting me getting into the park and

127
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:16,908
to like inside New Orleans Square which is where Club 33 is and I made a joke

128
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:21,948
loudly that we have ten minutes hopefully I don't think we're gonna make

129
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:25,428
it which is crazy if you know how close that is to each other but the crowd was

130
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:28,828
so bad and the crowds like the lines were being rerouted through pirates that

131
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:35,168
like we almost didn't make it it was just an insanely crowded day away yeah it

132
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:42,848
was so awful yeah which just really let us I think savor in writing in this

133
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:49,628
private calm location on an incredibly stressful day yeah that's I was gonna say this is why I

134
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:53,008
bring that up is because the park was so crowded and I remember I think I said it

135
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:56,888
to you or something my understanding always was that this place was sort of

136
00:11:56,888 --> 00:12:04,448
packed every day that there was full of people dining and eating and the

137
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:09,408
Club 33 is you know the waiting list goes on for decades right and you know

138
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:13,908
you know maybe if you're lucky your child will get to go in after you're

139
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:20,588
dead or like it's so like the terms are so stacked but then but and yet we're in

140
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:27,088
there and had place to ourselves yeah basically it was wild so yes we made it

141
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:32,828
there just right on time and Club 33 used to be closer to where the Blue Bayou

142
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:35,288
was which is the Pirates restaurant.

143
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:40,948
Yeah the restaurant that's in the launch point essentially of Pirates.

144
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:44,908
Scott you've been there before you had been to that version of the entrance.

145
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:50,468
I had yes so that's yeah Mike and Jason had not not been to Club 33 I got to go

146
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:55,548
thanks to my friend David we had a blast there good like you know five years ago

147
00:12:56,968 --> 00:13:04,608
and yes we had been we'd been into that entrance which had a like private little

148
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:12,888
elevator yes French lift yes okay and it was like a which we in looking up the

149
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:17,908
history of this was something that Walt found somewhere and tried to buy it

150
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:22,408
from the building and they said that's impossible to remove it nor are we

151
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:25,048
interested in removing our elevator no matter the cost.

152
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,628
We also need the elevator.

153
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:35,468
Yeah yeah it's extremely functional so so he just so he like took photos and had

154
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:41,208
imagineers just build one to his specifications and it's yeah that's like

155
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:45,628
that's that was that was an incredible little experience to have going up that

156
00:13:45,628 --> 00:13:50,808
thing and really takes you into the past but that is no longer there that is one

157
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:55,148
of the changes and this is a whole you know I think Club 33 was a certain

158
00:13:55,148 --> 00:14:00,048
certain way in a certain amount of space until like 2014 2015 and then it's been

159
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:04,688
pretty drastically not drastically but expanded an amount of yeah mostly

160
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:09,188
expansion mostly a good thing mostly allows more space and more more room

161
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:11,248
more empty space where no one is yeah.

162
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:15,368
But also controversial because they they took over the

163
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:23,048
which is this is like very peaceful manicured courtyard like New Orleans kind

164
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:27,668
of courtyard that for many years anyone could just go back there and take

165
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:34,148
pictures there's tons of photos online of people's engagement photos or

166
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:38,868
proposal like in the Court of Angels and I used to love going back there and

167
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:42,868
getting pictures and showing it to people because it is an interesting like

168
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:48,168
this doesn't exist anywhere else like this is only in Disneyland it it's not

169
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:53,008
an attraction it's not a show it's not a restaurant it's just a cute little you

170
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:58,248
know bit of place making and now it's gone and only for the rich yeah it's

171
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:03,568
over and X sing yeah people are shocked that Disney has made moves for money

172
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:08,968
making purposes right it does like it does it does make sense though to have

173
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:13,108
a better more out of the way area to load this place though I mean

174
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:16,448
unfortunately I it is a bummer that it's gone you can't just walk into it

175
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,808
because it was nice it was one of those spots where it was like a little

176
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:24,028
peaceful it was very yeah it was like a couple and it's still peaceful like that

177
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:28,608
well sure and there's little there's a locked or infused water for you to wait

178
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:32,988
before you are back in oh my god the infused water was so good yeah it was a

179
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:37,528
wasn't iced tea but it was like infused with like

180
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:41,948
the time I lavender I believe yeah yeah did I say when we were drinking the

181
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:44,848
water that like the employees were looking at us like we were two hobos

182
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:48,408
that had wandered into like a rich person's restaurant I mean it did feel

183
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:54,288
that way and the sheer number of napkins that I got out of that place oh yeah my

184
00:15:54,288 --> 00:16:02,968
got crumpled over there they're sitting on the sound bar we all do this

185
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:13,208
I think so yeah not cloth napkins by the way paper like nice paper like the

186
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,348
bathroom paper towels essentially well do you worth taking home do you wipe

187
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:21,208
like your hands on a special occasion with them they've all been free there

188
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:28,148
there in 12 frames napkins and 12 identical frames if you got liquid gold

189
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:31,808
on your hands and needed to clean that off maybe that's that's when you break

190
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:37,548
open the frames and start using the fancy yes yeah so you're staying with if

191
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:42,368
you have caviar all over your fingers right I'll say this then they were very

192
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,848
this makes it sound lawless but there were very few rules at Club 33 the only

193
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:53,288
thing they told us you can take photos anywhere you can walk into but not the

194
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:59,108
bathroom yeah doc take photos in the bathroom so that normal rule of society

195
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:05,348
right club 33 but I would have taken a photo in the bathroom very a very nice

196
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:10,308
ornate bathroom with Chuck Berry wouldn't like it there no photos that's

197
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:15,208
his favorite pastime it's a good point what in the bathroom we're talking

198
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:20,508
bathroom already I was shocked that they have little vials of mouthwash yeah I

199
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:27,028
got oh you took some I did not take Richard and I both mouthwash together at

200
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:31,928
the sink and then that was I was like I thought about it but I was like I'm not

201
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,848
gonna take a handful of there were glass too or were they plastic they were

202
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:38,508
plastic they were plastic okay if Richard had taught you how to shave that

203
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:43,088
would have been the experience he's dabbing your cheeks he wanted to see if

204
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:48,228
I was good at flossing he wanted to see yeah that would have been better it was

205
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:52,988
in there the Florida ceiling doors on the stalls as well right yes and pull

206
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,768
chain toilets like oh I cuz I didn't go into one of them I have the pull chain

207
00:17:56,928 --> 00:18:02,268
had the where the the water tank is like closer to the ceiling and stuff oh

208
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:07,228
wow like I should go in the stall how did you not go in the toilet well I go I

209
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:11,288
went to the urinal and I didn't think you didn't need to use right I didn't

210
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:14,908
need but of course I should have explored all the every inch of it I went

211
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:20,968
a few times because not to be gross but hard liquor just goes right through me as

212
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:26,308
I've gotten older what do you really yeah quickly that's weird it's weird it

213
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:32,448
is weird you just hard liquor but not water yes really is there have you

214
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:37,388
googled this is this a real phenomenon like you okay no no yeah I mean as long

215
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:42,228
as that songs there's a bathroom close by which again the laws of society I

216
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:47,028
want you to leave places that serve hard liquor have a bathroom close by new

217
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:55,288
episode title Jason shits at club oh no other other other side okay oh yeah no

218
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:58,648
that would be more oh yeah that's what yeah I thought hard liquor makes you

219
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:04,828
makes you shit oh no I just have to you're an oh okay okay yeah oh yeah no

220
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:08,828
that would be very bad that would probably mean I had some sort of

221
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:12,228
allergic yeah all right some sort of that's what I was picturing the way that

222
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:17,208
coffee like could so yeah coffee yeah yeah yeah okay I thought just like a you

223
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:27,728
know yeah like some sips of rum yeah I really don't drink that much except on

224
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:32,148
your birthday it's all right and then you let it then you let her risk yeah

225
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:42,988
let's all wag our fingers the wound is healed thankfully okay so entrance area

226
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:47,708
that one yeah I guess we're trading out a cool thing for a less cool or for

227
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:51,628
another cool thing the elevator is not there but you get to walk in this this

228
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:55,508
Court of Angels area that's now annexed and that that is cool like boy yeah

229
00:19:55,508 --> 00:20:01,548
wonderful entrance beautiful staircase and the elevator they turned into a

230
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:06,708
booth so you can sit in the elevator and eat your meal that that's in the lounge

231
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,328
I don't think it registered with me that that's oh I didn't realize that they

232
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:15,268
moved the little like the tiny little pull chain door the elevator into you

233
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:19,548
can like sit in there and it's right next to a little table really yeah but

234
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:25,128
like one person can barely squeeze in it'd be a very odd place to sit and eat

235
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:30,368
that's for sure there was also a table in the back of the lounge with one table

236
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:36,548
one tiny table almost like an old-time school desk yeah and one chair looking

237
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:42,268
out on the bay windows looking directly at the train station hmm and if I was

238
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:47,188
popping by myself that is where I would request to sit yeah it's this little

239
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:54,468
private nook it's yeah it's pretty neat but then there's a lot of like cool

240
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:58,848
stuff all around like every table is neat I think there's said there's some

241
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:03,848
table that was a prop from the happiest millionaire this 60s Disney movie

242
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:09,728
period piece the host station oh is that it I think and then there was an old

243
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:14,648
there used to be a phone booth in the original okay I think not there anymore

244
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,548
I or in another room I didn't think to look for it but that came up reading

245
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:24,048
about the original Club 33 huh huh and beautiful beautiful paintings and all of

246
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:32,968
the yell so where is also what they call Richard craft absolutely that I mean you

247
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:38,468
like in his element I'll say that what are like you know what a blast hanging

248
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:42,268
out with them and like I don't you know I'm not gonna go telling stories that

249
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,968
he told us but this is like you may have heard in the episode he's like he

250
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:50,588
represents here's his Danny Elfman he represents Jerry Goldsmith he represents

251
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:56,908
Marc Shaman the writer of Hairspray and all that I didn't also and John Bryan

252
00:21:56,908 --> 00:22:02,508
who but Mike I love him we just saw last night and in concert not been a friendly

253
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:08,168
way we paid to see him right and and also I don't know if it's him or if it's

254
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:14,368
the company but but air apparently really the craft management Wow yeah

255
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:18,068
like air yeah there's one of them their film scores are wonderful it's also he

256
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:22,808
represents like all the coolest like like Pat like past and present a wide

257
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:28,868
wide range of cool composers and he had like amazing stories from all that and

258
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:37,168
yeah super super cool to hang out and hear all of it and what else well we

259
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:41,448
went so like let's like let's step by step a little more so we go to go into

260
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:46,148
the back of like New Orleans Square toward like if you're headed if you were

261
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:48,988
headed to the Blue Bayou and we're Club 33 used to be you just keep going back

262
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:53,008
to the Court of Angels so then there's all it sort of indicates I forget how it

263
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:57,768
indicates outside that it's 33 it's not as big like it used to be that we

264
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:03,648
couldn't figure out how to do it like Hill people we were just knocking on this

265
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:08,648
right so we know this is the real door yeah so we eventually figured out that

266
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:13,808
that was the real door yeah and then I think Nicholas like a like scan a card

267
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:17,528
or something yeah I think that there is supposedly there's so much rumor about

268
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:20,028
exactly what it is but I think yeah you're right there's a card scanning and

269
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:24,828
then you go and you're in a tiny little room with like two or three employees or

270
00:23:25,108 --> 00:23:28,908
something yeah and they have like two or three employees with a desk and a

271
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:34,148
beautiful crystal display case of all the Club 33 exclusive merch yeah merch

272
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:37,928
and collectibles and stuff which really caught me off guard I totally didn't

273
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:41,528
realize there was Club 33 exclusive merch which is embarrassing I didn't

274
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:46,968
remember no yeah which of course I went wild for and I'll say what I got later

275
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,908
so yeah it's just like a normal restaurant thing where they're like

276
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:54,808
looking up your name and then they basically send you into the Court of

277
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:59,188
that amazing water what was the flavor of the water do you remember it was it or

278
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:03,468
was just fruit and I said lavender oh you said it okay it was like yeah cuz I

279
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:07,068
had never had water that good I don't think I think it was the best water I

280
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:11,808
ever had it was really nice and I Jason I can only zoom lavender water treats

281
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:17,248
your body just fine yes do you think though you you weren't peeing because you

282
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:21,248
ate straight had so much lavender water earlier and then you had like a cocktail

283
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:27,548
I mean yes cumulative it probably out I had I saw you with your mouth on the

284
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:32,968
spigot just pouring the lavender water in yeah and you could see the water

285
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:37,868
going through like bumps in my body right yeah yeah yeah walking water bed

286
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:43,488
yeah and then we had I rolled you up the stairs yeah I mean I think I was

287
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:50,928
drinking a lot of water to begin with that's healthy yeah yeah so then we you

288
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:54,628
kind of down there and then did they call I'm trying to remember my memories

289
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:58,328
already he's kind of overwhelmed and there was a lot yeah it's it was like a

290
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:02,548
dream a little bit of a dream yeah and then you would just walk upstairs and

291
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:06,808
the bathroom is up sort of on the like Terrace type thing or in like the walkway

292
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:12,508
up there and then you go through big doors and you're in Club 33 and there's

293
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:18,348
tile display yes we have a photo of that yeah yeah and then they kind of like

294
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:22,208
make you wait a second and then they take you to the table yeah there's a

295
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:27,548
hostess I mean every door open for everyone greeting you very nice asking

296
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:31,828
if you need anything yes well that's what I've read is that there it's I mean

297
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:37,608
like the does this Disney standard of service that you find everywhere and

298
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:41,948
certainly in the restaurants and the hotels especially the hospitality is

299
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:47,408
always great but I think the Club 33 people are like hyper trained yes yeah

300
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:54,188
like many months of super hospitality training and yes and it showed and like

301
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:58,668
boy did they were they helpful with food and drink recommendations right and

302
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:03,588
they put like their most knowledgeable people I think on it too I mean the

303
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:06,328
person we there are waitress had been working there for many many years so

304
00:26:06,328 --> 00:26:10,228
knew a lot of stuff but I think like they probably have to pass like extra

305
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:15,008
tests in like Disneyland history and I bet like I bet like they have to know

306
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:19,588
more they have to be like there yeah I mean she's just telling us about the

307
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:23,608
lounge she's like oh of course this lounge is new in the last few years this

308
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:29,268
whole physical space you are in used to just be storage for like the stores

309
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:34,968
right below or like other New Orleans Square area merchandise and stuff and

310
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:39,428
then they had to reconfigure all of that because the pictures is pre

311
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:45,848
refurbishment the bar was so tiny like the lounge bar area was so tiny and

312
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:50,208
like just had a few maybe a couch and a few chairs it was almost just like a

313
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:57,388
hallway mm-hmm yeah whereas now this is this giant ornate bar it's just

314
00:26:57,388 --> 00:27:00,308
wonderful well should we hear should we talk about it's okay so we're we're

315
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:07,048
entering you go through this hallway that's very very dim that is on either

316
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:15,168
side of you is case after case of fancy wine bottles you know so my eyes were

317
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:20,988
bouncing out sure like the mask and my pupils turned into wine bottle shape we

318
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:24,708
all turned into cartoons at certain points it depends our star particular

319
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:28,588
things active and then when I went up to the merch I saw the merch thing the

320
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:33,348
cabinet with the glass I my tongue like shot out and my tongue was giant and

321
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:39,468
like licking the glass in front of the exclusive club 33 merge and when they

322
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:44,708
accidentally put the check in front of Jason Richard he turned into a devil

323
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:50,428
like the incredible five feet up in the air and my legs looking like legs and

324
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:57,168
we're just spinning tires like yeah the check came and then we just turn there

325
00:27:57,168 --> 00:28:06,988
a puff of dust Jason's perfect shape yes he sped out of there to steal more

326
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:14,028
paper towels so you yeah you go through this it's this amazing hallway like mood

327
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:17,408
and they're just like perfect I couldn't pretend to know the type of wood but

328
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:23,968
right is very like old-school mahogany crazy wine cellar and then further down

329
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:29,148
this hallway on either side of you are a couple of booths yeah very small and

330
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:33,548
exclusive yes that are all in each one is themed to a different ride I believe

331
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:38,308
there's a Pirates one a Haunted Mansion one a Tom's Island one that's like is

332
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:42,628
if it's like Tom and Huck on on the island like watching the Mark Twain go

333
00:28:42,628 --> 00:28:46,208
by and then is it a bit was it a big Thunder I don't remember the fourth I am

334
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:53,948
looking through my photos I have a picture of the pirate ship and I have a

335
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:58,748
yeah I don't know I truly like felt so weird and overwhelmed in there I don't

336
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:02,068
know why I didn't photos yeah I felt uncomfortable doing that I think I was

337
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:06,408
trying to play it cool as well yeah yeah I think I don't want them to be like oh

338
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:10,728
look at those rubes look at those like they were more than encouraging oh yeah

339
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:14,628
they didn't photos ask question that's we get it mm-hmm right that's my that's

340
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:19,948
my problem not theirs because yeah I think I didn't take these pictures till

341
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:23,928
later like we were walking in I was like oh cool cool yeah cool oh great oh

342
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,908
whatever well you don't want to do it right away but once we felt like at home

343
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:31,248
once we sure there for three and a half hours whatever it was but anyway yeah

344
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:35,408
there's like there's there's little bits of Disney magic throughout this

345
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:38,848
restaurant is really what makes it so cool and these paintings have little

346
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:42,608
effects you know the Mark Twain puffs smoke or that I don't know what they'll

347
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:47,748
do but it's very it's like the ship's a little boo oh okay okay it's it's very

348
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:52,548
similar to the effect that the effects they have it like Trader Sam's yeah yeah

349
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:56,368
we're like a volcano shoot like shoots up once in a while when you order the

350
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:59,508
right drink which to eat at one of those booths would have been great but we had

351
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:02,768
a bigger with a bigger party and we were somewhere kind of just like dead

352
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:08,028
standing up dead center of the of the lab Le Salon Nouveau we sure we were

353
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:12,008
there so long though we could have each for an hour just gone in our own booth

354
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:16,788
alone yeah yeah because there was enough seat out like yeah pretty quickly the

355
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:22,428
most we had the place to ourselves and we're able to the bar had effects going

356
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:29,568
to similar to Club 30 oh yeah our effects were very cool yeah so yeah in

357
00:30:29,568 --> 00:30:35,688
the the bar has kind I mean it's just like it's it's you know it's it's very

358
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:43,828
like Maleficent essentially it's like sort of like apothecary weird like yeah

359
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:49,048
study with vials and stuff and then with a big like crystal ball orb thing in the

360
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:54,828
center and every once in a while the crystal ball lights up with a swirl of

361
00:30:54,828 --> 00:31:02,648
magic and the swirl spreads down the bar to like a little trumpet on either side

362
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:08,748
and then a ghost appears and starts playing the trumpet back and forth

363
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:14,308
trumpet goes yeah oh cool that's my highlight a mate like a bar with little

364
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:20,668
and to be you know that it's it's that it's well done Disney magic it's not

365
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:26,808
some like half-assed theme bar thing it like yeah it was so like detailed and

366
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:30,268
subtle and it's yeah it's I have a picture of it when the effect is not

367
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:33,948
going and it just looks like I don't know if that's a trumpet or like I

368
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:37,108
guess a tie yeah it's just a tiny trumpet or like a flugelhorn maybe is

369
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,968
what it's called but it's just like sitting there are you laughing at

370
00:31:40,428 --> 00:31:46,908
it is a funny name it's just it does like it's one of those effects where

371
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:51,388
it's not clear that an effect is coming or is going to happen it's just looks

372
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:55,628
like a trumpet or whatever is sitting hanging there yeah and then when the

373
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:59,668
effect happens a ghost is playing it and it's crazy and you're really not sure how

374
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:03,988
it's done it's wild yeah like there's a couple effects like a Tokyo Disney like

375
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:09,148
they're like that where you're like staring at it and going what I'm not

376
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:14,208
sure like so cool yeah very very cool thing like that but only the members

377
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:18,928
get to see or the roofs that they let join them right only Goldman Sachs

378
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:24,788
employees get to see that ghost playing a flugelhorn yeah and it should it

379
00:32:24,788 --> 00:32:29,768
should be noted that the lounge they were saying it's like oh it's harder to

380
00:32:29,768 --> 00:32:33,408
get a reservation at the lounge because for one thing you have to be with a

381
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:38,488
member right like a member can make you reservations for the dining room

382
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:44,288
although I saw one thing online did you guys come across this that like say

383
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,448
someone made reservations for you or I think even for members this holds if you

384
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:55,188
are going to eat in the dining room there was a food minimum oh yeah possibly

385
00:32:55,188 --> 00:33:01,348
equivalent to a one-day admission ticket sure per person it's pricey yeah per

386
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:07,708
person or the full full meal I think per person mm-hmm yeah because they're and I

387
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:12,888
think this is the appeal of the lounge is that if you've gone there for dinner

388
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:17,688
you know for for the many decades this has been open it's been like a you know

389
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:22,688
fancy four course meal that you have to do and and probably liquor on top of

390
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:27,948
that and to make the minimum and which is great and it was it was wonderful

391
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:32,568
when I got to do it but you end up spending a lot and the but in the lounge

392
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:37,548
it's more casual you could do piecemeal stuff you can get you can get a burger

393
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:41,968
although even the burgers are like we're crazy fancy burgers and it's still like

394
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:48,068
elevated and great food but you can it's it's certainly more casual than I think

395
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:51,548
that the dining experience have been although would they we were offered

396
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:56,248
four course menu they're like here is the four course menu right a la carte

397
00:33:56,248 --> 00:34:00,628
menu if you see something on the four course menu you can order it a la carte

398
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:06,048
it was lunchtime yeah we were there it's unclear yeah so so the thing I kept

399
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:12,368
finding is it's unclear exactly what the system is for like because there are

400
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:18,268
tiers now to club 33 membership as well okay for different lounges and it's or

401
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:21,908
it's unclear now exactly what level because I think there's only the top

402
00:34:21,908 --> 00:34:25,308
tier gets you into the lounge in general I could I can be completely wrong about

403
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:31,028
this somebody easily can correct me I'm sure but it seems like access to which

404
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:35,388
we did go to later do we even talk about Club 1901 we probably have to right yeah

405
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:39,548
yeah sure but there's a club in California Adventure that is a lot

406
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:44,348
smaller and I think that is like supposedly you have to be top tier access

407
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:49,528
in Club 33 to do that and I think also lounge access as something like I think

408
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:54,288
there might be like a base level Club 33 that you can just go to the dinner and

409
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:58,308
lunch in the regular dining room it's unclear though is what I'm saying there's

410
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:02,068
a lot of missfully there's a lot of misinformation online there's like old

411
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:06,888
I think stuff a lot of stuff has changed the membership fees they list are all

412
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:11,028
over the map we should have called oh and I tried to figure out that number is

413
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:16,828
not public oh right we would have had to acquire it some oh there's an official

414
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:21,368
website for Club 33 but it says nothing you can't you write sign in as a member

415
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:28,868
right there's no FAQ where it tells you how much it costs like some Hollywood

416
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:32,148
agencies or production companies that essentially just they have a website

417
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:36,788
because they have to but it is just essentially a business card yeah yeah

418
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:43,028
pro website right yesterday Scott we were talking about this and we'll we'll

419
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:46,788
probably do this at wrap-up but now that I'm thinking about it remind like we

420
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:51,248
were saying like what our dream version of Club 33 would be like what we would

421
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:57,768
pay for and I've just I'm just now realizing I know the perfect thing so

422
00:35:57,768 --> 00:35:59,068
let's remember to do this

423
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:00,668
we'll hold on to that at the end

424
00:36:00,668 --> 00:36:03,468
where are we saying that?

425
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,248
misinformation about

426
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,848
you know what I keep finding is that when I tell people we got to do this I say oh we went to the

427
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:14,328
California Adventure one too they don't know 1901 I think people know yes and so

428
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:18,568
if you're so next time you're if you're at Disneyland you're waiting in line for

429
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:24,268
the Carthay Circle restaurant off to the right there is a sign says 1901 it's

430
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:28,848
sort of hidden and you have to put your card up and then the 1901 lights up oh it

431
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:33,208
lights up yeah fast pass but oh that's so it's like you know what is hiding in

432
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:36,348
plain sight too because if you stand under the marquee of Carthay Circle

433
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:40,728
straight ahead is the lobby for the restaurant slightly to the right is

434
00:36:40,728 --> 00:36:46,308
direct entry into the bar I think and then next to that is the 1901 door yeah

435
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:49,868
and I didn't I I've heard of somebody told a couple years ago it was like

436
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:52,748
there's one in Carthay and I was like what are you talking about and then it

437
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:57,108
was confirmed that it exists I still did not know where the door was and we've

438
00:36:57,108 --> 00:37:02,828
waited in line for Carthay a million times it's right next to the door yeah

439
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:06,588
we've we've been in there before I just was like all these two doors that don't

440
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:12,468
go anywhere but they go to 1901 it's like the it's like the Buzz Lightyear

441
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:17,388
astro blaster target in the hallway it seems to be the same technology where

442
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:21,048
it's like dark and then you shoot it and it kind of lights up in a little like

443
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:25,808
D way that's what it looked like to me when you like they put his card to the

444
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:29,988
1901 sign and it lit up as 1901 anyway to that and there should be a secret

445
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:34,988
target that you can hit in Buzz Lightyear that gets you lifetime oh yeah sure

446
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:39,748
Club 33 I feel would be a lot more incentivized to I don't know why they

447
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:44,428
need people to be incentivized but right I knew about the 1901 lounge but I

448
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:49,028
thought it was upstairs like cuz there's that patio that's what I thought too yes

449
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:53,288
I'm like wait how can I sit on that patio so I guess it's just outdoor seating

450
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:58,748
you know you can set up there for regular and Karthik yeah I've sat on

451
00:37:58,748 --> 00:38:02,948
that patio before a car thing but I I thought it was upstairs somewhere they're

452
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:07,208
just like a magical upstairs place that I didn't think like I didn't know or it

453
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:11,008
was like I didn't think it was in like the tower and the tower whatever you

454
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:14,448
would call it's not a cloud that's a little private bar all the way up in the

455
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:18,748
That would be great. Yeah yeah yeah. That would be fantastic. Well here let's go back.

456
00:38:18,748 --> 00:38:27,148
Let's stick with Club 33. Okay well you want to talk food and such? Yeah because I also when you

457
00:38:27,148 --> 00:38:30,748
talk about remodels and stuff that have happened there apparently was a room

458
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:34,548
called the trophy room that is not there anymore which I guess I recall now when

459
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:44,428
I was there five years ago I do have a picture there and it's a very like it's

460
00:38:44,428 --> 00:38:48,888
product of its time so it's definitely what fancy people thought was like a

461
00:38:48,888 --> 00:38:55,388
novel back in the 60s yeah yeah it is filled with I think Walt's original idea

462
00:38:55,388 --> 00:39:00,368
was to have it filled with animatronic animals oh that didn't really happen but

463
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:06,788
we'll talk about the fanciest Chuck E. Cheese in the world yeah there are a lot

464
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:12,548
of mounted and stuff like game wild game animals yeah were there and then a lot

465
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:18,688
of photos and memorabilia including signed a signed fest part rifle signed by

466
00:39:18,688 --> 00:39:23,328
fest Parker Davy Crockett and then a bottle of fest Parker wine signed by fest

467
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:30,068
Parker oh sweet I love the fest Parker wine that's cool yeah but so so my my

468
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:36,208
my cocktail it was a was called the trophy room cocktail as a tribute to the

469
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:42,528
what used to be there and apparently I was looking for something that like I

470
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:48,228
bartender at Le Salon Nouveau it was in the section Le Salon Nouveau originals

471
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:54,268
bourbon cognac maraschino, Cynar, whatever that is and bitters one of the best

472
00:39:54,268 --> 00:40:00,068
drinks I've ever had insane so one of and like and high high content like

473
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:04,528
really good like the the thinnest drink there's like very little liquid in

474
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:09,988
there but man potent I was sailing it was great one of the best cocktails I've ever had

475
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:15,668
high marks for that I took picture because the drink menus were were

476
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:20,088
dressed up like you know old books yeah and then I was like oh that's a fun

477
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:24,668
container and then inside I'm like this is almost a novella length like there

478
00:40:24,668 --> 00:40:30,428
were so many pages of drinks of like yeah the classic cocktails that are are

479
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:36,288
hard to find like you can they had a Vesper which is the drink James Bond

480
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:43,268
woulders in Casino Royale named after Vesper and it oh I I wanted to order it

481
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:49,048
and then I'm like no I will be under the tape because it's only vodka gin and

482
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:52,748
lilette which is I looked up or I asked someone and they're like oh it's a

483
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:58,048
fortified wine you would have been in the bathroom constantly for sure yeah as

484
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:02,728
it stands I forget the name I took pictures of the drink menus I did not

485
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:07,968
take a picture of the page the drink I ordered there's a picture I was like I

486
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:14,408
found a picture online it was called like a ship of the sea or something it

487
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:19,368
was called something was nautical both yeah you both laughed when I ordered it

488
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:24,568
oh really it's mostly it was rye and cherry bitters and something else

489
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:31,088
served up I think I just now I might I just have a base of enjoying listening

490
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:35,288
to you order in the wake of when we went to this City Walk Hotel or the

491
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:42,568
Universal Hotel and hearing you proudly say an apple strudel please it was done

492
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:47,208
with such gusto I feel like any probably just some boring drink item I would

493
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:52,168
enjoy hearing you order at this point yeah well look I know if I'm ordering

494
00:41:52,168 --> 00:42:01,068
something a little sale with like a silly Dave or something I think you

495
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:06,588
are barely alcohol content you're gonna get at Club 33 can you make a

496
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:12,068
transformer I ordered their version of the transformer I think right well I

497
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:15,968
honestly I don't have like great photos of it I ordered the hurricane though I

498
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:21,748
think yeah you order the classic hurricane the paddle the original the

499
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:26,908
hurricane invented at Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans the drink and this was like

500
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:32,388
I didn't know the history version the original made with fresh fruit juices

501
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:36,268
and stuff nowadays I think people think oh a hurricane that's like syrup and

502
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:40,168
tea serve yeah I'm gonna get fucked up that looked very good although they

503
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:43,608
brought you a different drink yes I got double drinks you got double drinks and

504
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:46,948
they're like oh sorry we must have some wires got crossed just keep that one

505
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:50,468
we'll get your hurts you would do was the other one I'm trying to remember it

506
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:54,008
was kind of like a why it almost tastes like kind of a wine spritzer or something

507
00:42:54,008 --> 00:42:58,628
it was very good it was like kind of like a subtly wine type of taste but I

508
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:04,648
don't remember the name of it did anyone just to refresh my memory did anybody

509
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:14,248
get the Louie the 13th rare cask cognac for $1,500 per one ounce serving I

510
00:43:14,248 --> 00:43:20,008
stared at the cognac like locked cabinet uh-huh because those prices were truly

511
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:27,608
fascinating to like I didn't if I were sheer got eight of those right yeah and

512
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:33,308
had to be we had to call him a cab to get him home sure sure in a torius mess

513
00:43:33,308 --> 00:43:38,848
yeah yeah yeah yeah and loves to spend money like loves him like loves a

514
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:43,168
$10,000 drink yeah he's like yeah this is this is nothing to me and then he

515
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:48,988
shoved all of us in the face I he's a monster usually has like a coke bottle

516
00:43:48,988 --> 00:43:55,628
that he dumps the soda out of and pours crown into and he's like this is my fast

517
00:43:55,628 --> 00:44:03,848
pass he kept saying this is my fast pass of course this is silly but we I get we

518
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:08,108
could probably say because he was Steve's you know joking around to everyone

519
00:44:08,108 --> 00:44:18,748
with it that like he we stayed pretty late at the park and he's like I have to

520
00:44:19,528 --> 00:44:25,088
she was working yeah she was shooting great of course well the fact that I had

521
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:29,588
forgotten that that she is in the cast of grace and Frankie as Jane Fonda's

522
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:35,328
daughter yeah which is a very fun so yeah impressive body of work June was oh

523
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:48,728
my god June was with Jane Fonda and sure was with Jason and Mike and Scott the

524
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:54,348
so all right so we're all we're all wasted on cognac we also ordered when

525
00:44:54,348 --> 00:45:01,748
they asked if we wanted second like you and I both ordered beers like club 33

526
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:06,608
exclusive beer like I had a porter mm-hmm that they they explained they're

527
00:45:06,608 --> 00:45:11,948
like oh this was made just for us it was aged in bourbon barrels that at one

528
00:45:11,948 --> 00:45:17,788
point were used to make bourbon just for us oh cool and yeah sir they're like

529
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:22,988
it's a very small portion because it is potent and it was good it was like a very

530
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:28,768
I don't order dark beers a lot but I was very interesting like to have yeah this

531
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,268
beer there was another beer there was like a blonde ale made just for them

532
00:45:32,268 --> 00:45:36,488
they're like we're out of that and oh I would have really enjoyed that I got

533
00:45:36,488 --> 00:45:42,028
something that was well first but first I got a like giant goblet of wine that

534
00:45:42,028 --> 00:45:48,328
was a Kurt Russell wine yeah so I'm drinking a Goldie that was that was a

535
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:52,828
blast and then I threw a beer on top of it and like walking up and we'd already

536
00:45:52,828 --> 00:45:58,908
the meal had closed out and walking up to the bar and like paying for paying

537
00:45:58,908 --> 00:46:05,788
for a big nice beer at the club 33 bar felt super cool and then we that post

538
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:11,608
our meal like we went outside to the veranda and said and like stood out

there I forget if you guys had drinks or not but I didn't we didn't you know but

540
00:46:15,228 --> 00:46:21,268

government or the New York State oh my god very cool movie past jewel all the

561
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:22,628
great companies currently under all the best all the best companies were founded

562
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:29,608
after 2012 all the coolest least corrupt most progressive CEOs hey I'm still

563
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:34,208
holding on to my Theranos that stock what's there I know there knows was the

564
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:39,988
blood testing startup that turned out to be a massive scam oh my god yeah and

565
00:48:39,988 --> 00:48:51,108
this is very odd woman Elizabeth is Elizabeth Holmes I think like trying to

566
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:56,708
jobs and like it took a few years but there is a book out about it called bad

567
00:48:56,708 --> 00:49:02,888
blood that they has been exited cheese cool and it's it's like a page turning

568
00:49:02,888 --> 00:49:09,128
read like I've only read parts of the but it's like wow what a con like music

569
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:13,668
music man level con there's pictures of like Joe Biden touring this place of

570
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:17,628
like this is gonna revolutionize blood testing and they're gonna partner with

571
00:49:17,828 --> 00:49:23,968
and it all just turned out wow I've never heard about any of this oh I can't

572
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:28,908
I can't wait for wait what's the name of the company Theranos there in us there

573
00:49:28,908 --> 00:49:33,028
so this do we think Theranos has a corporate membership to club 33 or

574
00:49:33,028 --> 00:49:37,108
juice oh yeah for sure crazy juice one where you could you could just squeeze

575
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:43,868
the packages yourself if not use the $400 $500 pressing machine it's a

576
00:49:44,308 --> 00:49:48,688
you're paying for like a little prick the bag yeah you're paying for a

577
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:56,208
glorified sewing needle insane so it's really what you know in this situation

578
00:49:56,208 --> 00:50:03,028
we are we are living like like CEOs essentially because like I don't think I

579
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:05,768
and looking into the history a little I didn't realize that a lot of the

580
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:10,848
memberships and the initial impetus for starting this place was it was to

581
00:50:11,128 --> 00:50:15,728
entertain clients and sponsors right of Disneyland and that's a lot of the

582
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:20,328
memberships are like interchangeable like that company can send somebody to

583
00:50:20,328 --> 00:50:25,548
I don't know what the companies are necessarily it's not public oh yeah I

584
00:50:25,548 --> 00:50:30,228
guess I guess it wouldn't be but that's part but part of the the rumor about the

585
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:37,208
name is that 30 33 potentially was the number of sponsors at the time oh right

586
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:43,468
also but also 33 well people have said it's somewhere it's like mouse ears

587
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:50,008
turned on its side I think it's the address of the club is 33 Royal Street

588
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:56,968
yes but in terms of New Orleans Square storyline and might also be the address

589
00:50:56,968 --> 00:51:02,228
on the liquor license yo and that's part of it's probably the literal need for a

590
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:07,668
an address was speed needed a separate address from Disneyland yeah but there's

591
00:51:07,668 --> 00:51:12,768
also do you guys catch the crazy rumor but what club 33 refers to I don't know

592
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:17,608
like though that's how the Satanists greet each other it's you're not you're

593
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:28,668
not far off people think that Disney himself was a a 33rd degree Freemason oh

594
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:33,708
that's a level of Freemasonry that you can climb to and it's a it's a nod to

595
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:38,568
that and people have tried to pick apart like designs on the floor like this

596
00:51:38,568 --> 00:51:42,528
spiral or whatever clearly is a reference to the to the Freemasons

597
00:51:42,528 --> 00:51:46,928
that's like so I know like Denver Airport shit that's Denver Airport thing

598
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:52,228
oh the Denver Airport people like it is it's apparently a very odd architectural

599
00:51:53,128 --> 00:51:58,788
creation and there's a lot of weird art and and people if I talked about this on

600
00:51:58,788 --> 00:52:02,488
the show I feel like I've talked about this before but there's like art that

601
00:52:02,488 --> 00:52:06,568
people are like no this is this is to summon the demon mullock and this is

602
00:52:06,568 --> 00:52:12,048
like there's illuminati messages or Satanist messages which I think the

603
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:16,708
airport is now being refurbished and the Denver Airport is like having fun with

604
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:21,208
the urban legends and stuff like you know they should have find out what

605
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:26,928
secrets will be revealed yeah they're playing with it because it's now it's

606
00:52:26,928 --> 00:52:31,968
just so old and such a thing it's a the mode it's a haunted Auntie Anne's yeah

607
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:37,408
it may also be a people mover that might be one of the few existing I believe

608
00:52:37,408 --> 00:52:41,908
Houston had a Houston Airport has a people like a Disney a wed way people

609
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,768
yes I don't know about other words there's other other places have like

610
00:52:44,768 --> 00:52:50,108
similar implements right I think theirs is an official Disney made anyway

611
00:52:50,308 --> 00:52:56,148
I don't know that is bizarre that that's a 33 does have Freemason right

612
00:52:56,148 --> 00:53:01,768
significance should I join the Freemasons sure how easy is it Evans I

613
00:53:01,768 --> 00:53:05,248
don't know how much does that cost we talked about joining the Elks Lodge

614
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:10,768
yeah we should join the Elks Lodge like a like rotor rotary yeah and just hear

615
00:53:10,768 --> 00:53:16,448
old men tell stories well I think that's what you go do this and oh shrimp boils

616
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:22,768
shrimp oils and like this I didn't realize that was part of it yeah there's

617
00:53:22,768 --> 00:53:27,188
all kinds of cool clubs we could join in fact I was gonna propose to you guys

618
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:35,688
should should we like maybe the prep the perfect use of the patreon funds is to

619
00:53:35,688 --> 00:53:40,808
just start a corporate membership for the three of the podcast the ride

620
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:47,508
corporate membership club 33 just all it all goes right to that I don't know you

621
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:51,688
know I know it's a great write-off we can entertain podcasts the important

622
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:59,208
podcast the right clients and guests you know like our girlfriends and wives I

623
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:02,448
think it's a good could be crucial to keeping up the relationships I don't

624
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:06,128
look I like what you're saying I think that it makes a lot of sense I think

625
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:12,308
maybe we start with Florida because it's cheaper I think initiation fee wise

626
00:54:12,308 --> 00:54:16,388
all right okay I think there's one in each park and there's one in each park

627
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:21,888
new pretty new and the last very new yeah I think maybe they all are not even

628
00:54:21,888 --> 00:54:26,248
open yet but I think it's they announced pricing for them so that's official and

629
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:30,268
I think they're like 25,000 to get in and then like 10,000 upkeep because I

630
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:33,288
think Disneyland if we want to do the good stuff it's a hundred grand now to

631
00:54:33,288 --> 00:54:38,988
get in so maybe we start with Florida just because it's cheaper mm-hmm and then we

632
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:44,488
can entertain clients and it makes a lot of sense to have a membership to an

633
00:54:44,488 --> 00:54:49,548
insanely expensive private club in your state across the country I think that's

634
00:54:49,548 --> 00:54:54,528
right if we can get like some real Chappo Trap house fuck you patriot money

635
00:54:54,528 --> 00:54:59,588
I think that's fair that if we start making that level of money sure yeah we

636
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:03,288
can do something dumb that it actually that it actually might behoove us that

637
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:07,288
it might be all right off if we make if you want to look up Chappo I forget how

638
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:10,788
much money they're making if we can make that amount of money we will send Jason

639
00:55:10,788 --> 00:55:17,188
to Florida permanently and he will be a permanent on-the-ground cub reporter for

640
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:22,428
Florida so we can be bi-coastally represented he's looking to the sky and

641
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:26,488
he doesn't he's not upset about it well cuz I feel like last I saw they were

642
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:35,008
like a hundred thousand yes so now so now what we're asking people to do it's

643
00:55:35,008 --> 00:55:38,928
not like okay help us out a little and then we can give you some fun bonus

644
00:55:38,928 --> 00:55:44,008
episode we're relocating one of the hosts and I like to you know what I think

645
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:48,888
the issue would be if we were always Skyping with Jason they'd be it'd feel a

646
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:53,108
little impersonal and you wouldn't feel the dynamic presence of Jason in the room

647
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:59,468
T1 line it's a paper like t3 or or yeah well that could be a help in what I'm

648
00:55:59,468 --> 00:56:04,328
proposing which is what maybe one better which is that way and an animatronic

649
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:09,748
Jason that he is operating like an avatar remotely yeah up to all of the

650
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:14,148
wires and the sensors like the guy programming the carousel of progress guy

651
00:56:14,148 --> 00:56:21,028
so you what we need now we room and board for you in Florida and like phone

652
00:56:21,268 --> 00:56:24,488
robot mechanism so that there can be a robot Jason here at all yeah here's what

653
00:56:24,488 --> 00:56:30,128
we need we need three months of the El Chapo trap house patreon first month

654
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:34,068
hundred grand we can get you a house in Orlando for a hundred grand I was kind

655
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:39,468
of hoping for like whatever the highest suite at the boardwalk hotel you want

656
00:56:39,468 --> 00:56:50,288
to live like telly at the boardwalk telly is probably healthier sloppy telly

657
00:56:50,288 --> 00:56:53,948
tissue boxes on my feet as shoes that's gonna be a lot more expensive

658
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:56,968
unfortunately so maybe you're probably right so we're gonna have to up well

659
00:56:56,968 --> 00:57:01,868
clearly all right latitude Margaritaville latitude Margaret that's

660
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:05,428
what I think we can do that I think that's two months worth of El Chapo

661
00:57:05,428 --> 00:57:09,148
trap house we were looking at no no I screwed up yeah I can't screw it up

662
00:57:09,148 --> 00:57:17,648
what's the highest level of patron and I think okay it's 33 grand a month which

663
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:22,108
gives you the satisfaction of knowing that your favorite host Jason has put up

664
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:26,408
in the nicest room and board possible we can get your family down there too like

665
00:57:26,408 --> 00:57:33,648
telly yeah sure what would it be if we didn't move your parents also yeah I

666
00:57:33,648 --> 00:57:37,168
think that's a great idea and then yeah paintings you need better but you need

667
00:57:37,168 --> 00:57:42,908
to redecorate the suite also yeah oh 100% yeah this is a single visit to Club 33

668
00:57:42,908 --> 00:57:47,628
has I'll put it on my so it's gone to my head I'm dreaming lavish tree yeah

669
00:57:47,628 --> 00:57:51,688
I can't go back to coach because I've been in first class we're looted we're

670
00:57:51,688 --> 00:58:01,168
mad mad now yeah I know we lost our minds yeah these new microphone stands

671
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:05,028
have really changed at Club 33 in these new microphone stands they've freed us

672
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:09,368
yes yeah expense number one microphone stands so you don't hear our wires

673
00:58:09,368 --> 00:58:15,568
rustling around to relocation of a host in a robot in his place reasonable just

674
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:19,168
know that the page the patreon donations are going to real things that

675
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:25,948
we really yeah well so the food the food yeah so we order I had a cheeseburger I

676
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:31,208
had the cheeseburger so good it might be one of the best if you really cheeseburger I

677
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:35,068
it was yeah at least top two or three I don't even have the other examples of

678
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:39,508
what though are in the top three but I was like whoa this is legit awesome hmm

679
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:43,408
yeah and the fries were good very good but not like at the level of the

680
00:58:43,768 --> 00:58:50,268
okay the cheeseburger had like bacon jam and it was a fancy cheeseburger

681
00:58:50,268 --> 00:58:54,348
cheese they told us like just so you know the patty is made with the

682
00:58:54,348 --> 00:58:59,408
trimmings of our sir Lloyd's and fillet so it is essentially a real right yes

683
00:58:59,408 --> 00:59:06,728
exactly oh my god and that's like a rugel on it yeah and yeah like some what

684
00:59:06,728 --> 00:59:12,348
was the cheese did you say that I had never it was it was similar to a brie

685
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:16,148
or like a goat cheese or something Andrews or post it I have a picture of

686
00:59:16,148 --> 00:59:22,088
this yeah picture it was cheese squeezed out of the Big Thunder Mountain go they

687
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:26,448
had actually it produces cheese only for club 33 members and they were very

688
00:59:26,448 --> 00:59:31,368
using robot I asked like oh do you because I was like oh the steak frites

689
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:35,168
are the burger and they're like the steak frites are steak frites but the

690
00:59:35,168 --> 00:59:41,908
burger is very special yeah she pushed the burger and I choose right to do it

691
00:59:43,588 --> 00:59:50,768
Andre cheese sauce Bernays tomato it's kind of like a tomato relish or

692
00:59:50,768 --> 00:59:57,888
something and it cost $33 which I thought was very cute very cute yes very

693
00:59:57,888 --> 01:00:03,228
charming I had a fancy fish thing that was great I don't remember a lot of

694
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:07,528
details about it but I love you know Carthay Circle makes really good fish

695
01:00:07,528 --> 01:00:11,508
any whatever their catch of the day is always great oh yeah you had the catch

696
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:15,708
of the day and I remember it was served in lobster bisque cheese yes and they

697
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:20,568
caught it I would have like I think was lobster sausage yes or people like did

698
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:25,048
we are we do we sound horrible yeah it is a disgusting episode yeah and then we

699
01:00:25,048 --> 01:00:30,448
then it was the most perfect sauce I'd ever have usually when I go to the park

700
01:00:30,448 --> 01:00:35,088
like I stop at a grocery store to buy a bottle of water at a cliff bar ahead of

701
01:00:35,088 --> 01:00:39,448
time so I don't have to yeah and I've like money there and I figured out all

702
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:42,828
the locations of the free water so that I don't have to buy a sunny

703
01:00:42,828 --> 01:00:49,688
constantly yeah this is how it usually works this was a treat and we really

704
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:56,208
appreciate it and it was great we're not becoming monsters here's the test of

705
01:00:56,208 --> 01:01:00,108
how when you will here's when we will become monsters is when you catch wind

706
01:01:00,108 --> 01:01:04,928
that we go a lot and we don't talk about it that is when we truly will become

707
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:08,628
monsters because you will not hear about it we will keep our monster

708
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:12,088
monsters in his private right now we're just humble nice guys that are very

709
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:15,208
excited to go to a fancy place that we've dreamed about going yeah when

710
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,188
people on the social media are like hey I was in the park and I walked up to

711
01:01:18,188 --> 01:01:21,488
what I thought was one of them and I said hey are you from podcast a ride and

712
01:01:21,488 --> 01:01:27,688
and they wrote they replied no wouldn't make eye contact and walk away they

713
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:33,808
wish I used to be now I'm better they somebody walked under us while we were

714
01:01:33,808 --> 01:01:38,608
on the balcony of Club 33 and they said podcast the ride guys save us and the

715
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:46,568
podcast the ride guys turned and said no hard rain hard rain hard rain fell on

716
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:51,428
New Orleans our rain of four dollar to Saudi water a school fall we know that

717
01:01:51,428 --> 01:01:56,468
Club 33 is equipped with ropes you could pull us up to the balcony no drown

718
01:01:56,468 --> 01:02:08,588
we're up here there's a reason we're up here I cheeseburger was great yeah so

719
01:02:08,588 --> 01:02:13,368
so good I had so much catch of the day here's another weird Jason moment

720
01:02:13,368 --> 01:02:18,408
because they said like oh it either comes like on a bed of a lobster bisque

721
01:02:18,408 --> 01:02:23,808
or a bed of oyster stew and you heard it out you got excited to go to sleep I did

722
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:29,428
well I know what but I kind of cut in and I was like can I ask is it a

723
01:02:29,428 --> 01:02:34,868
traditional oyster stew because traditional oyster stew is is you can

724
01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:39,628
it in some set places in South Jersey it's mostly cream and some light spices

725
01:02:39,628 --> 01:02:45,188
and fresh oysters it's pretty simple it's not the most robust flavor that's

726
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:51,608
a very acquired taste mm-hmm and it's very creamy and I they're like yes it's

727
01:02:51,608 --> 01:02:55,028
prepared the traditional way and I was like yeah maybe get the bisque you did

728
01:02:55,028 --> 01:03:01,368
help me out you gave me good tips and and the bend the wages was super helpful

729
01:03:01,368 --> 01:03:06,248
and like recommended pretty like talked me through so much stuff it was it was

730
01:03:06,248 --> 01:03:10,208
oh it was wonderful it was a wonderful like perfectly catered experience while

731
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:17,028
we listened to wonderful stories from our from our friends and guests and yeah

732
01:03:17,028 --> 01:03:22,928
it was great time so also what another thing that happened is that Jason

733
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:30,608
celebrates his birthday like kind of for a month straight so like he had a

734
01:03:30,608 --> 01:03:35,408
four days after my birthday but you are a birthday guy who loves to stretch it out

735
01:03:35,408 --> 01:03:39,348
sign up for all these email programs that restaurants and stores have right

736
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:43,828
they've gotten pretty good they've gotten good this year I was very happy

737
01:03:43,828 --> 01:03:47,428
because a lot of them were like this is good for the entirety of your birthday

738
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:51,968
but so I've not bought a lot of groceries no I know cuz you you are I

739
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:59,928
mean look I'm a guy who likes checking I'm a guy who likes deals I like to

740
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:04,668
promotions like just locked down I've never seen someone do it so much you'd

741
01:04:04,668 --> 01:04:09,408
be like I have 12 free birthday lunches coming from various restaurants like you

742
01:04:09,408 --> 01:04:14,548
have got it down I had a free pastry for breakfast for Panera on the drive down

743
01:04:14,548 --> 01:04:17,868
yeah right I remember that and then you oh yeah because you were like hey do

744
01:04:17,868 --> 01:04:20,568
you want this thing and you first you acted like you had just bought it for me

745
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:26,388
but then you know I asked if you wanted something and you say just get me what you get and I got a

746
01:04:27,008 --> 01:04:31,988
you revealed it to me later as if like well I just in full disclosure I got it

747
01:04:31,988 --> 01:04:35,528
for free you did say like you did I thought that was funny because like the

748
01:04:35,528 --> 01:04:39,848
doughnuts they're just like no I just take it right which is another time when

749
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:43,288
you came over with doughnuts and you and the employee told you just take it we're

750
01:04:43,288 --> 01:04:46,668
closing soon and I said it's like six o'clock they're not closing soon and

751
01:04:46,668 --> 01:04:49,648
you're like I don't know right what do you mean all right that's that's I'm not

752
01:04:49,648 --> 01:04:50,828
insulting you that's just what happened

753
01:04:50,828 --> 01:04:56,208
yeah I know anyway sitting back and watching this is something the first no

754
01:04:56,208 --> 01:05:01,068
no no scolds okay so this is so dessert related context for this all I was just

755
01:05:01,068 --> 01:05:03,528
doing was goofing on you for celebrating your birthday for weeks I

756
01:05:03,528 --> 01:05:07,848
wasn't goofing on you for getting those three donuts okay so you asked for the

757
01:05:07,848 --> 01:05:12,028
button up for these look I got a free butter cake to go from California Pizza

758
01:05:12,028 --> 01:05:15,088
Kitchen one day I was coming home from something I'm like oh I got a free

759
01:05:15,088 --> 01:05:18,868
dessert and the fine print says you could do it for takeout so I sure walked

760
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:23,788
in and walked out with a piece of cake to eat it I believe I think that you have

761
01:05:23,788 --> 01:05:29,228
some I think you have different drivers licenses every state in the country and

762
01:05:29,228 --> 01:05:33,728
you do it do you do a birthday tour you it's a different birthday every three

763
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:39,168
weeks that is a great scam because you've worked out a string of CPKs and

764
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:46,528
Jersey mics yeah he's thinking about it also you should have bought went before

765
01:05:46,808 --> 01:05:50,928
the upstar crow stopped selling those life fake licenses you should have just

766
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:59,828
bought those oh yeah it was right it's yeah it's apartments this I believe

767
01:05:59,828 --> 01:06:04,188
there's you were born on John Lennon's death day it's a free egg roll you're

768
01:06:04,188 --> 01:06:09,188
John Lennon you're oh you are John here you you want your free birthday scoop

769
01:06:09,188 --> 01:06:16,508
but it says under restrictions diabetes I don't know if the good conscience I

770
01:06:17,068 --> 01:06:21,568
there is a novelty drivers license the word that said Halle Berry's as it

771
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:24,508
mentioned that she has diabetes which is a fact that I didn't know and really

772
01:06:24,508 --> 01:06:28,688
yeah I didn't know back to the city walk so basically so it does it can they

773
01:06:28,688 --> 01:06:32,748
brought us dessert menu yeah well hold on going back a little bit one of my

774
01:06:32,748 --> 01:06:37,388
favorite things is to go with you in the week surrounding your birthday because

775
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:40,968
you insist on the birthday button which is something I've never gotten it's like

776
01:06:40,968 --> 01:06:44,508
too much attention for me for whatever reason but you get it and it's great

777
01:06:44,688 --> 01:06:47,988
because everyone wishes you happy birthday yeah and sometimes you get

778
01:06:47,988 --> 01:06:50,888
little and sometimes you get little treats which I guess honestly makes you

779
01:06:50,888 --> 01:06:54,528
smarter than me because I should have to just do that every year one of my

780
01:06:54,528 --> 01:06:57,628
favorite times we were walking down by the Grizzly challenge trail and a man

781
01:06:57,628 --> 01:07:01,808
was playing like nice soft acoustic guitar and he's like happy birthday Jason

782
01:07:01,808 --> 01:07:06,128
like I was like fantastic this is wonderful so we walked in and you got

783
01:07:06,128 --> 01:07:09,268
asked for the birthday button and they say happy birthday so because you were

784
01:07:09,268 --> 01:07:15,268
wearing that in club 33 they brought you a special dessert and you because no one

785
01:07:15,268 --> 01:07:19,428
ordered dessert we got dessert menus and I'm like oh Valhura chocolate

786
01:07:19,428 --> 01:07:26,328
absolutely chocolate mousse tart 100% but everyone else was like nah I don't

787
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:33,708
think they have a dessert and like your heart saint we heard it yeah and I

788
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:39,248
guess I could have pushed but I was also a little groggy from that burger was

789
01:07:39,828 --> 01:07:44,188
really a lot yeah it was a lot the drinks for a lot so well the thing you

790
01:07:44,188 --> 01:07:48,488
take me better for my body if I hadn't had full-size dessert I think the thing

791
01:07:48,488 --> 01:07:52,788
is you take your cues from people who have taken you somewhere that's probably

792
01:07:52,788 --> 01:07:57,388
if everyone had had a dirt road yeah so that's the only reason I would have

793
01:07:57,388 --> 01:08:01,068
indulged with you that's all I'm just making an excuse yeah but they brought

794
01:08:01,068 --> 01:08:05,868
me a very charming little dish of strawberry ice cream and a little Mickey

795
01:08:05,908 --> 01:08:11,408
house butter cookie and it was delight it was actually worked out great was the

796
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:16,348
perfect amount of like sweet to have great yeah I know seeing you with a

797
01:08:16,348 --> 01:08:21,688
little Mickey cookie on a plate on a oh yeah plate that was that was I have a

798
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:26,908
video of singing happy birthday to you oh that's nice so we can post that yeah

799
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:32,588
and they went you know this is the cookie you can get in the park it's just

800
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:38,288
a little bigger yeah that's what they hell yeah sure yeah right to your head

801
01:08:38,288 --> 01:08:43,888
so that was fun again yeah usually I'm there like I'm walking in at the park

802
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:47,968
going like okay yeah this is my birthday child get the birthday button and then

803
01:08:47,968 --> 01:08:52,148
maybe that'll get I can save some money on that this is that's the normal the

804
01:08:52,148 --> 01:08:56,528
normal hustle to like you save money the day it actually is something we haven't

805
01:08:56,528 --> 01:09:01,688
talked about off air or anything what is your I don't get let's all just try to

806
01:09:01,688 --> 01:09:06,688
eliminate because we're talking a lot but like what is the birthday path you

807
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:09,608
take like what is the what are the places you have to hit when you have that

808
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:14,208
birthday button to try it yeah Disney I don't know I we're joking about but I

809
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:19,068
feel like I forget about it pretty quickly uh-huh there's not a specific

810
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,048
place you go oh you're like they're gonna give me a little this I didn't

811
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:26,528
have this on but when my family was last visiting we were eating at Napa Rose and

812
01:09:29,068 --> 01:09:35,028
both it was like the week of it was right around both my dad's birthday and

813
01:09:35,028 --> 01:09:39,988
and the person I was dating at the time's birthday and so I like snuck away

814
01:09:39,988 --> 01:09:45,628
to the to our waiters to grab our waiter and like hey we have two birthdays and

815
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:50,968
and he's like oh okay I'll take care of it and so like after the meal they came

816
01:09:50,968 --> 01:09:55,028
oh he's like I hear there's some we're celebrating some instances so what would

817
01:09:55,028 --> 01:10:00,488
like for your your birthday desserts so he it wasn't like oh here's the little

818
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:04,528
birthday cupcake we have he brought the full dessert menu and whatever you two

819
01:10:04,528 --> 01:10:08,228
oh wow he did once and then he looked at my brother and I were also there he's

820
01:10:08,228 --> 01:10:15,128
like yeah you guys can order birthday dessert you can get this so like you

821
01:10:15,128 --> 01:10:20,768
know that's like a few $40 $50 free thing at Napa Rose I will say this if

822
01:10:20,768 --> 01:10:25,608
you haven't been to Napa Rose the level of service there is is very is pretty

823
01:10:25,608 --> 01:10:29,328
close to Club 30 like they really take care of you there too I had a guy who

824
01:10:29,328 --> 01:10:33,668
you know once I read an article that was of somebody who was I think

825
01:10:33,668 --> 01:10:37,428
disappointed by the Club 33 experience or not maybe no it just like didn't

826
01:10:37,428 --> 01:10:42,368
think it was like the greatest thing they'd ever they'd ever done even at a

827
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:47,768
Disney park particularly in terms of food quality and they argued that

828
01:10:47,768 --> 01:10:53,648
Carthay and Napa Rose are both superior just pure food wise which is interesting

829
01:10:53,648 --> 01:11:00,388
because Andrew Sutton the executive chef of Napa Rose was poached or shifted

830
01:11:00,388 --> 01:11:05,108
over to be the newer executive chef of Club 33 oh interesting I didn't know

831
01:11:05,108 --> 01:11:09,248
that huh this was an older article too so maybe that maybe the quality has

832
01:11:09,248 --> 01:11:17,348
improved because of him so that makes sense but that's that's something I

833
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:21,928
don't feel like they will be lucky enough to get to go to Club 33 I had a

834
01:11:21,928 --> 01:11:26,988
great time it was wonderful I don't this was not like some like earth

835
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:31,508
shatteringly incredible experience and you know that nor was the the food

836
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:35,268
exactly that's just the one thing I would say is like you know if you're

837
01:11:35,268 --> 01:11:40,088
looking for top-tier nice Disney experiences Carthay and Napa Rose are

838
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:45,608
great and like super comparable mm-hmm to this I say just to like if you're

839
01:11:45,608 --> 01:11:50,888
feeling like oh whoa is me I will never get to enter the Xanadu of Club 33

840
01:11:50,888 --> 01:11:56,768
there's great those those places are like you know yeah right it right in

841
01:11:56,768 --> 01:12:00,588
line yeah I mean your steakhouse 55 at the Disneyland Hotel supposed to be

842
01:12:00,588 --> 01:12:03,708
pretty nice to I've never done I would like to do yeah I had a cheeseburger at

843
01:12:03,708 --> 01:12:08,228
the bar once and it was very good I can't remember it was yeah I like that

844
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:15,588
bar it's a great chill option if Trader Sam's is just oh yeah going back to the

845
01:12:15,588 --> 01:12:20,968
bottom of Trader Sam's is just out of oh yeah I mean like always yeah all the

846
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:27,468
time yeah well I don't know where what haven't we done we do well we mean we

847
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:33,328
Intermeal enjoyed enjoyed a truly relaxing beer on the verandah Club 33

848
01:12:33,328 --> 01:12:37,168
where I forget if I said this on the podcast but I told it to you guys and

849
01:12:37,168 --> 01:12:45,568
then the crafts how that in the previous time that I was a Club 33 that I had my

850
01:12:45,588 --> 01:12:51,648
we got there before our before David Melissa who let us in and and we like

851
01:12:51,648 --> 01:12:58,308
watched phantasmac finish out on that porch and I was like I had the ring I've

852
01:12:58,308 --> 01:13:02,508
been like looking for the opportunity to pop the question to Aaron almost did it

853
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:06,188
there I was gripping it like is that this is pretty cool we're in this like

854
01:13:06,188 --> 01:13:11,168
exclusive zone maybe maybe I do it and then I was like yeah but then we're like

855
01:13:11,348 --> 01:13:17,268
the dinner will be so distracted by that like it'll be hey thanks for letting

856
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,768
us into this nice place anyway we just got engaged and that's more important

857
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:23,508
than I didn't want to end up in that scenario yeah

858
01:13:23,508 --> 01:13:27,768
Disney Parks blog is here they wanted to write a nice little post about the

859
01:13:27,768 --> 01:13:36,448
engagement yeah yeah Kayla cameras are on us now I don't but I don't but I was

860
01:13:36,448 --> 01:13:41,688
very sad I that's another I've now I've between having a beer up there with y'all

861
01:13:41,688 --> 01:13:46,148
and gripping my my wedding ring and thinking about popping the question five

862
01:13:46,148 --> 01:13:51,548
years prior nice memories on that up on that porch and there's many memories that

863
01:13:51,548 --> 01:13:56,848
come in Florida when we're constantly at Club 33 in all four parks when we shift

864
01:13:56,848 --> 01:14:02,948
our operations on the coast yeah we could do a little Club 1901 well I mean I

865
01:14:03,408 --> 01:14:08,668
think to to wrap up officially Club 33 oh it's a Disney attraction without the

866
01:14:08,668 --> 01:14:13,068
gift shop yeah so so we walk out into the lobby and there's a big glass case

867
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:16,948
and I think I said I was like oh my god I didn't realize there'd be merch yeah

868
01:14:16,948 --> 01:14:20,308
yeah there was some exclusive shag prints I think there was a print there

869
01:14:20,308 --> 01:14:25,728
was a paint a shag piece in the lounge yeah made for the lounge mm-hmm and

870
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:29,548
there's a lot of like what they're like wine glasses with 33 the logo on it and

871
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:40,668
like polo shirts and a lot of golf stuff. That was the one thing. It's really saying like you know we know you're a rich guy you buy some of this golf crap.

872
01:14:40,928 --> 01:14:45,148
That was what I found like I like a baseball cap that's like a little

873
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:51,128
distressed or a little you know a little beat up and it was very like the one

874
01:14:51,128 --> 01:14:56,348
baseball cap they had was like had a lot of those like ventilation hole like it

875
01:14:56,848 --> 01:15:01,328
was very like glossy and it's like yeah this is for golf people yes right for

876
01:15:01,328 --> 01:15:08,208
the rich yeah so I immediately my eyes fixed I was like where the character I'm

877
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:11,988
looking for like anytime I'm there's merch I'm looking for the character and

878
01:15:11,988 --> 01:15:15,688
he's sitting up here now on the mantle and I'm still not sure if we're gonna

879
01:15:15,688 --> 01:15:18,248
take take him out of the box we could probably will take him out of the box

880
01:15:18,248 --> 01:15:22,608
because he needs to have like a stand like he was in the box yeah that's a

881
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:25,748
nice box it's a nice box but also like if you go up it kind of looks cheap to

882
01:15:25,748 --> 01:15:29,508
me if you really look at the box well it's got a vintage aesthetic too I think

883
01:15:29,508 --> 01:15:34,148
that yeah I'm torn about it so so anyway they have like a very old looking

884
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:37,828
distressed Donald Duck not that distressed but he's like his color

885
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:43,228
palette looks like it's a classic Donald stuffed plush and I was like oh I'm gonna

886
01:15:43,228 --> 01:15:47,588
guy was like probably making a noise on his little foot and on his little foot

887
01:15:47,588 --> 01:15:52,368
is a 33 the logo is on his little foot and this poking it's I'll post a picture

888
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:57,568
of it online 33 owns him like Andy owns would exactly yes so this is the Donald

889
01:15:57,568 --> 01:16:03,108
for the rich this is rich persons Donald from the 50s I was like having I was

890
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:07,208
like I don't need glass with stuff and and I turned around and I was like oh

891
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:13,248
there's a second display case and I'm like there's a keychain and I I love

892
01:16:13,248 --> 01:16:20,728
like good quality part keychain like that is usually my little you know I buy

893
01:16:21,228 --> 01:16:26,448
t-shirts I have a Disney World hat but I don't buy a ton of stuff at the park

894
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:30,868
I'm pretty picky about what I buy at the park but I like to have a little fun

895
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:37,188
theme park keychain especially just if you're like doing errands or stuff for

896
01:16:37,188 --> 01:16:40,868
your like like going through the day it's like oh there's a little bit of

897
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:45,608
parks to cheer you up if you're in a bad mood or something mm-hmm so I've had a

898
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:49,588
Ministry of Magic keychain which I like Harry Potter I like Harry Potter fine

899
01:16:50,668 --> 01:16:57,248
but mostly I bought it because I'm like I like the park specific like that this

900
01:16:57,248 --> 01:17:01,888
was like hmm a lot of the Universal Harry Potter stuff is very good quality

901
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:06,388
very detailed and that's kind of why I bought it and now right walk it out for

902
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:11,848
a little while for this Club 33 keychain nice little blue in the logo I'll take a

903
01:17:11,848 --> 01:17:17,168
picture of it me I haven't swapped it out yet it's still in the nice little bag

904
01:17:17,168 --> 01:17:18,648
Oh really you haven't done it?

905
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:23,428
No, they gave me this cute this very charming Club 33 bag

906
01:17:23,428 --> 01:17:27,228
hmm right that's Scott you almost weren't you like looking at the wine

907
01:17:27,228 --> 01:17:31,908
glasses you were thinking about it yeah then maybe I didn't have done it

908
01:17:31,908 --> 01:17:35,828
there did there needed to be more characters I think in the merch it's a

909
01:17:35,828 --> 01:17:40,708
lot of like clothes and like let's wear the action figures right like oh you're

910
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:46,888
Club 33 specific action figures I want to see formerly poor characters hmm like

911
01:17:46,888 --> 01:17:53,328
the Cinderella mice oh yeah that'd be great fancy and snooty yeah like holding

912
01:17:53,328 --> 01:17:59,508
Club 33 scepters yeah there should be like a toy where like Belle goes through

913
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:03,528
the doors of Club 33 and comes out with the dress on the big yellow dress

914
01:18:03,528 --> 01:18:08,868
the characters in Disney who become rich there should be some sort of diorama

915
01:18:08,868 --> 01:18:13,408
that that happens I know a lot of the design inspiration you know they talk

916
01:18:13,408 --> 01:18:17,208
when they were redoing it they talked about taking cues from Princess and the

917
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:24,908
Frog a lot oh cuz that's in New Orleans and you could also because there's a lot

918
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:29,648
there was a jazz festival coming off in the club oh so you could have a toys of

919
01:18:29,648 --> 01:18:35,368
the aristocats in tuxedos oh but they're fancier yeah they're not street riff

920
01:18:35,368 --> 01:18:39,048
riff yeah they got a great gig that's fine they're like set for the year from

921
01:18:39,108 --> 01:18:44,768
this corporate gig there and they're playing way it's not like fun 40s scat

922
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:51,088
jazz it's like very syrupy corporate you know acoustic guitar right yeah it's

923
01:18:51,088 --> 01:18:57,288
yeah they're playing bony James type jazz adult contemporary you talk about

924
01:18:57,288 --> 01:19:00,208
the design of the place I want to hit the before before we move on I want to

925
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:04,688
hit the the the two people primarily responsible for how it looks around

926
01:19:04,688 --> 01:19:08,928
there and I think other areas of New Orleans Square because if you walk around

927
01:19:08,928 --> 01:19:12,948
the rest of New Orleans Square it's the same level of ornate and detailed and

928
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:18,108
feels very authentically New Orleans and the it was based on the club is based on

929
01:19:18,108 --> 01:19:24,348
sketches commissioned from by Walt from Dorothea Redmond Dorothea Redmond was

930
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:29,188
is considered the first female production designer in Hollywood history

931
01:19:29,188 --> 01:19:34,628
worked on Gone with the Wind worked worked extensively with Hitchcock was

932
01:19:34,628 --> 01:19:38,468
the production designer of rear window and Rebecca Wow I didn't know that yeah

933
01:19:38,468 --> 01:19:45,088
so she did sketches that like set the tone for like what you know Hitchcock

934
01:19:45,088 --> 01:19:49,148
showed to his DP and whatever on those on those films I think she did six seven

935
01:19:49,148 --> 01:19:56,748
films with the Hitchcock all told she designed the private room above Pirates

936
01:19:56,748 --> 01:20:02,408
of the Caribbean that Walt was going to move into which all right that never

937
01:20:02,408 --> 01:20:06,648
happened but they did turn it into the Disney Gallery did you guys ever get to

938
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:11,108
the Disney I love that Disney Gallery yeah yeah that was really really nice a

939
01:20:11,108 --> 01:20:15,688
Tony Baxter installation in the late 80s at Disneyland and now it is now it's

940
01:20:15,688 --> 01:20:20,688
enclosed again and it is the Disneyland Dream Suite the private now it's not

941
01:20:20,688 --> 01:20:26,348
the dream it's a private dining room now private above Pirates yeah yeah that you

942
01:20:26,348 --> 01:20:33,088
can get for like 15 grand something crazy yeah like if you pooled 15 people

943
01:20:33,608 --> 01:20:41,188
together and they each had a few hundred dollars for a meal like it is it is the

944
01:20:41,188 --> 01:20:46,168
next it is it might be one level up from Club 33 because it's such an ordeal

945
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:50,228
that's insanity yes I'm incredibly please you can stay anymore I don't

946
01:20:50,228 --> 01:20:54,808
believe so oh interesting okay very right yeah she's amazing her body of

947
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:59,008
work she also apparently helped design the space needle in Seattle well they

948
01:20:59,008 --> 01:21:05,728
lived till 98 what a badass amazing body and then the actual the actual

949
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:11,488
interior was designed by the set designer Emile Curie who did production

950
01:21:11,488 --> 01:21:16,548
design for 20,000 Leagues Mary Poppins it's a wonderful life and Hitchcock's

951
01:21:16,548 --> 01:21:21,108
rope man so the level of I think that that really adds to the the authenticity

952
01:21:21,108 --> 01:21:27,288
it's not like some fake fancy experience right like the you're like the the best

953
01:21:27,908 --> 01:21:33,108
Hitchcock people were creating this environment so so cool and I you know I

954
01:21:33,108 --> 01:21:35,108
honestly didn't realize till we were there and I asked the waitress about

955
01:21:35,108 --> 01:21:40,268
this that that Walt's I didn't realize he did not set foot in the place it was

956
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:44,608
a year or 67 yeah year after he died so this thing designed his specifications

957
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:52,148
like a perfect place for him and he never got to go but we did so yeah that is

958
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:59,348
she mentioned and we think we looked at on the way out he used to be in the

959
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:07,988
trophy room there was a turkey vulture oh and the there was a room set aside

960
01:22:07,988 --> 01:22:12,728
for an actor to be in with a microphone and there were microphones scattered

961
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:18,108
through out the trophy room with the idea being the vulture would converse

962
01:22:18,108 --> 01:22:23,328
with the guests now that never came to pass and the additional animatronics

963
01:22:23,328 --> 01:22:28,668
never came to pass but when they redid it they mounted this turkey vulture in

964
01:22:28,668 --> 01:22:35,268
the lobby of Club 33 and now he does like wake up and talk every now and yeah

965
01:22:35,268 --> 01:22:39,948
we did get to see him talk and what did he say do you remember it was really

966
01:22:39,948 --> 01:22:45,268
brief yeah he say hello or like good afternoon right and then we like rant

967
01:22:45,268 --> 01:22:48,588
we were like oh hey and then like we stayed for like a minute and we're like

968
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:54,188
oh that's it huh nothing more happened but that like I'm three drinks in of

969
01:22:54,188 --> 01:22:58,288
like three of the finest drinks I've ever had like great beer great line great

970
01:22:58,288 --> 01:23:02,428
cocktail and then I'm talking to a vulture it this was a perfect little

971
01:23:02,428 --> 01:23:09,548
zone of time just wonderful but I will say I will duck Alfred the vulture points

972
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:15,388
in that I do he is not well here my personal animatronic of the month this

973
01:23:15,388 --> 01:23:20,708
was not my animatronic highlight it but that instead would have to be as we

974
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:25,328
talked about before we went on the knots log ride and the bear turned to us and

975
01:23:25,328 --> 01:23:30,908
said trick-or-treat sure that was cooler I have to say then then the vulture sure

976
01:23:30,908 --> 01:23:39,528
so you know this premium robot experiences a lot of other places but

977
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:45,148
to use the new mobile ordering system yeah I ran over to his side of the table

978
01:23:45,148 --> 01:23:48,768
and I was showing him how to order a dole whip that's true yeah I was

979
01:23:48,768 --> 01:23:53,708
watching Mike in heaven like showing teaching yeah one how to check I was

980
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:57,308
trying yeah I was trying to teach Scott that when we were there later and he was

981
01:23:57,308 --> 01:24:00,868
like I said I don't care I'm getting in the regular line and I was like I don't

982
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:05,508
know and then to prove a point I mobile ordered I mean it wasn't really to prove

983
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:08,788
a point I was just trying to use this system because I like using it and then

984
01:24:08,788 --> 01:24:12,448
we got like our food at the same time but I got to sit down the whole time

985
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:16,648
instead of standing in line you got to turn to me and give a little look like

986
01:24:16,648 --> 01:24:23,788
hmm see self-satisfied yep no blurring so I don't know self figure it out but

987
01:24:23,788 --> 01:24:27,528
at the mo we're like on the way over like we're almost there like next to the

988
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:32,848
thing but it's fun as we'll and it's fun to mobile order but we get over to

989
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:36,688
California venture head and scan the secret thing to get into 1901 I had

990
01:24:36,688 --> 01:24:41,808
also got into that thanks to my friend David and the like I was I was so

991
01:24:41,808 --> 01:24:44,748
excited we get to go in there again because if you've been in the car they

992
01:24:44,748 --> 01:24:52,088
circle bar imagine getting a zone like that but to yourself and I by that point

993
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:58,028
I do stop dry like I must begin to sober up for him in trouble but I was so glad

994
01:24:58,028 --> 01:25:02,948
that you Mike ordered a drink that came with an orb ice cube well it's yes like

995
01:25:02,948 --> 01:25:05,988
so they have the same drink menu as the car they launch which we've been to

996
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:10,488
oh what not hungry like exclusive yeah right they had a couple of things but

997
01:25:10,488 --> 01:25:14,008
like I don't know if any of us ordered because we were also just like well yeah

998
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:17,188
so what so I was asking because my favorite drink at the car they lounge is

999
01:25:17,188 --> 01:25:22,188
a car they Manhattan which has a beautiful circular orb of ice and I

1000
01:25:22,188 --> 01:25:25,428
don't know what did Richard say like they have the ice they'll show you how

1001
01:25:25,428 --> 01:25:28,888
to like they'll make the ice for you uh-huh which we had not experienced at

1002
01:25:28,888 --> 01:25:33,168
the lounge so I was asking away I was like do you make the ice at the bar or

1003
01:25:33,168 --> 01:25:36,548
could you make he goes we can do it over here if you want I go well we got to do

1004
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:43,628
it so he brought the ice or making machine over to us and we got to see a

1005
01:25:43,628 --> 01:25:50,108
circular perfect sphere of ice be made in front of us that they take a big cube

1006
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:55,848
right and using this gravity press machine it becomes a perfect sphere like

1007
01:25:55,848 --> 01:26:02,008
like technology that's probably hasn't changed since the 30s yeah and it just

1008
01:26:03,028 --> 01:26:09,048
slowly crushes it into an orb crazy bartending like the or I love this so

1009
01:26:09,048 --> 01:26:14,168
much I would watch that I wish I would I'd pay an extra ten dollars at that

1010
01:26:14,168 --> 01:26:18,848
lounge oh yeah the orb show that was that's how they made the orb that Trump

1011
01:26:18,848 --> 01:26:25,448
at the Saudi Arabia leaders that was that insane anti-terrorism center they

1012
01:26:25,448 --> 01:26:30,428
all realize the orb that was an ice orb too it was it was a cube first and then

1013
01:26:30,428 --> 01:26:35,108
they said but only he who is pure of hearts can turn it into an orb and Trump

1014
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:39,568
of course the purest of heart and it became the most beautiful orb you've

1015
01:26:39,568 --> 01:26:47,568
ever seen he's been doing great lately really killing it 1901 I mean 1901

1016
01:26:47,568 --> 01:26:51,468
probably again we'll have to do a full episode on it but you know do we not

1017
01:26:51,468 --> 01:26:55,008
everything has to be a full episode hey we got a patreon we got a fill of a

1018
01:26:55,008 --> 01:26:59,548
patreon here is a cool what do you what sports cool lounge this cool photos like

1019
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:03,648
the effects that drinks great snacks I'm done well the effects that weren't

1020
01:27:03,648 --> 01:27:08,368
working which there was that thing that looks there's tooth I think two of them

1021
01:27:08,368 --> 01:27:12,968
oh we saw the one we saw the one they said look at this it's the worst

1022
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:18,128
animation you've ever seen oh it's it was a picture I think of Walt who were

1023
01:27:18,128 --> 01:27:22,248
one of the other artists yeah sort of then the arm started to move and draw a

1024
01:27:22,248 --> 01:27:26,748
character but it moved it like that wasn't jab.com yeah that wasn't great but

1025
01:27:26,748 --> 01:27:30,488
there were two effects not working which they have wallpaper that look just looks

1026
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:34,428
like wallpaper but then once in a while there's like in a silhouette of Walt's

1027
01:27:34,428 --> 01:27:38,608
that appears in like the wallpaper because 1901 lounge is named after the

1028
01:27:38,608 --> 01:27:42,668
year he was born right so it's very it's a very cool effect supposedly that's

1029
01:27:42,668 --> 01:27:47,508
what everyone says but it was not working the whole thing is very like

1030
01:27:47,508 --> 01:27:50,228
there's a bar in there there's a lot of comfortable couches it feels very much

1031
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:56,328
like someone's was the word rumpus room is that the term like oh it hasn't been

1032
01:27:56,328 --> 01:28:00,188
for many decades right but sure sure but you that is maybe what I would be

1033
01:28:00,188 --> 01:28:05,308
referring to is that what a rumpus room was or no I thought it had a lot a lot of

1034
01:28:05,308 --> 01:28:11,808
the study or a day bar but then a little bit of the sort of craftsman accents

1035
01:28:11,808 --> 01:28:17,588
what room in the house would this be do you know he like a den or something

1036
01:28:17,588 --> 01:28:23,808
room dad's room that's all my dad's dead yeah the dead or a rumpus room is you

1037
01:28:24,128 --> 01:28:28,248
know I was gonna say rumpus room is appropriate because it's John that

1038
01:28:28,248 --> 01:28:35,188
character that was created 70 years ago yeah and he makes a joke about it

1039
01:28:35,188 --> 01:28:43,608
yeah John aka Jason so it's great I mean that was yeah that was wonderful it was

1040
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:48,008
a hell of a time great great stories from these folks this was this was just

1041
01:28:48,008 --> 01:28:54,228
blast yeah yeah really really cool to have experienced it but we were we were

1042
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:59,908
talking about this last night that while it is a while it is a wonderful

1043
01:28:59,908 --> 01:29:04,268
experience we had a wonderful time and wonderful meal it is I would not say

1044
01:29:04,268 --> 01:29:10,948
that it is some mind-bending Lee incredible level of Disneyland access

1045
01:29:10,948 --> 01:29:15,088
it's not as if like it's all very cool but there's no like thing that you get

1046
01:29:15,088 --> 01:29:18,588
to do or thing that you get to I mean having a drink out on the porch is

1047
01:29:18,588 --> 01:29:22,668
great but like I'm just I think I think what we were talking about is is there

1048
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:27,908
if you're gonna pay that amount of money thousands of dollars every year to be

1049
01:29:27,908 --> 01:29:33,628
part of this club what is the the exclusive only for you experience that

1050
01:29:33,628 --> 01:29:38,068
that the club 33 membership could provide yeah that would really

1051
01:29:38,068 --> 01:29:43,428
deeply be worth all that money right and I think last night my first thought was

1052
01:29:43,428 --> 01:29:49,248
if club 33 was in like the top of Space Mountain or something like if you if

1053
01:29:49,248 --> 01:29:53,108
there was a bar the top of space money you look out over Disneyland there was

1054
01:29:53,108 --> 01:29:58,788
like like something like that yeah like and everything was very very hyper

1055
01:29:58,788 --> 01:30:05,128
stylized Space Mountain motif inside and like yeah if you could just generally

1056
01:30:05,128 --> 01:30:08,648
like in the dark they don't really change anything but there's just like

1057
01:30:08,648 --> 01:30:13,408
there's hallways and stuff there's like it's like a secluded little like bar

1058
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:18,288
zone that leads you I like I like what you're saying about at the top if there

1059
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:22,728
was some vista within Space Mountain right and then probably where you like

1060
01:30:22,728 --> 01:30:28,428
really have your meal and hang is where the ships take off like where currently

1061
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:32,688
the employees are checking on the the Rockets but get them out of there move

1062
01:30:32,688 --> 01:30:36,908
them somewhere I want to have a like a purple drink in there yeah that I mean

1063
01:30:36,908 --> 01:30:41,668
like a blue bayou Space Mountain but exclusive club 33 yeah I almost think

1064
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:46,508
three people at a time I know that sure small so yeah let's not we're not filling

1065
01:30:46,508 --> 01:30:54,268
that up yeah I want my exclusive rocket vista I almost feel like blue bayou if

1066
01:30:54,268 --> 01:30:59,308
it was exclusive would be cooler mm-hmm than like if you could drink and blue

1067
01:30:59,308 --> 01:31:02,988
bayou mm-hmm that was your exclusive club that kind of is a more highly

1068
01:31:02,988 --> 01:31:08,768
themed experience but I like that it is open to everyone well of course I'm not

1069
01:31:08,768 --> 01:31:11,948
saying shut blue bayou none I'm just saying it's a more themed experience

1070
01:31:11,948 --> 01:31:15,848
that is true that is more yeah no I'm not saying the rich should only be able

1071
01:31:15,848 --> 01:31:22,328
to access blue bayou we're starting to siphon off we're separating the cars

1072
01:31:22,328 --> 01:31:28,048
every if there was a if there was a much fancier radiator Springs I want it like

1073
01:31:28,048 --> 01:31:34,508
a butt like a book like a private I want a Maserati that's alive who like you know

1074
01:31:34,508 --> 01:31:41,228
at the other cars and who all who wins every single time sure he'd like I don't

1075
01:31:41,228 --> 01:31:44,608
know what kind of crowd on if Maserati's electric or whatever but it should be

1076
01:31:44,608 --> 01:31:49,808
like super gas spewing right the people you should win against the other car

1077
01:31:49,808 --> 01:31:55,068
guaranteed and a bunch of such should blow in their faces sure salt entry

1078
01:31:55,068 --> 01:32:01,508
that's great yeah we got a I've got a add-on I've got a club 33 at oh go ahead

1079
01:32:02,068 --> 01:32:08,648
yes you are you are given a key card and you to for the two for use at the

1080
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:12,628
Grand Californian and you check in at the front desk and they're like all right

1081
01:32:12,628 --> 01:32:18,088
your nap suite is available and you're gonna because I mean that was a heavy

1082
01:32:18,088 --> 01:32:23,488
heavy so it's like all right we will come and get you at the end of four

1083
01:32:23,488 --> 01:32:29,348
hours so you have an hour to settle down get comfortable and then a ideal I

1084
01:32:29,548 --> 01:32:32,408
suppose just under three hour nap because then you need to collect

1085
01:32:32,408 --> 01:32:37,308
yourself so maybe you you use that hour 30 minutes before 30 minutes after to

1086
01:32:37,308 --> 01:32:42,648
compose yourself you get a nice so now you're saying that then you come back to

1087
01:32:42,648 --> 01:32:46,888
life and maybe they bring you that nice water at the end and then you're like we

1088
01:32:46,888 --> 01:32:52,208
hope you enjoyed your stay so for 50 grand entrance and then like 10 to 25

1089
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:57,328
thousand a year you would if you could take a three hour nap at this a three

1090
01:32:57,328 --> 01:33:03,428
hour nap in a really not and I feel like hourly hotels are you presented

1091
01:33:03,428 --> 01:33:11,028
usually for seedy affairs frowns upon okay that's not a bad idea to add my so

1092
01:33:11,028 --> 01:33:14,628
what the mind the thought I had during the show which I realized is is

1093
01:33:14,628 --> 01:33:20,888
basically that the all the touches of of imagineering and theming are awesome in

1094
01:33:20,888 --> 01:33:24,668
club 33 but it doesn't feel overwhelming which is sort of the feeling you want

1095
01:33:24,668 --> 01:33:28,888
like a blue bayou it's like you're in it you're in the bayou whereas like oh

1096
01:33:28,888 --> 01:33:33,108
those are awesome effects here and there but even like being in Trader Sam's to

1097
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:37,628
me feels like a little bit more of an immersive themed experience maybe not a

1098
01:33:37,628 --> 01:33:45,168
little bit maybe a lot more so if it was like adventurers club 33 mmm and it was

1099
01:33:45,168 --> 01:33:53,428
like as themed as that mm-hmm I think you'd obviously I'd have to be doing a

1100
01:33:53,788 --> 01:33:57,488
cool with actors and like the effect which they never did but like you could

1101
01:33:57,488 --> 01:34:02,628
talk to a ghost while you eat at the bar like if it was like that hardcore level

1102
01:34:02,628 --> 01:34:07,708
theming I think at that point you're like me and I mean that's hundred

1103
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:12,908
thousand dollars but yeah I mean if you could hundred thousand dollars if I was

1104
01:34:12,908 --> 01:34:16,808
a multi-millionaire I guess we're talking yeah there's no way if I like

1105
01:34:16,808 --> 01:34:22,148
make a hundred grand that's something you order and the puppet general presents

1106
01:34:22,148 --> 01:34:25,568
it to you the adventures club that drink that he would have which was just

1107
01:34:25,568 --> 01:34:30,288
a bottle of Beefeaters but with like seven straws taped together so we could

1108
01:34:30,288 --> 01:34:35,688
reach up to him that's fun so like something like that again if I was a

1109
01:34:35,688 --> 01:34:40,448
multi multi-millionaire I would say I do want to go to that club a lot like

1110
01:34:40,448 --> 01:34:44,088
cuz that would seem like it would be really worth it to keep going back I

1111
01:34:44,088 --> 01:34:47,088
mean I get also that it would be this whole thing would have been more

1112
01:34:47,088 --> 01:34:51,548
enticing back when you couldn't get liquor anywhere mm-hmm but now you can

1113
01:34:51,548 --> 01:34:56,468
drink every so I've said many times you can walk 500 feet and get a drink so

1114
01:34:56,468 --> 01:35:01,868
it's not a big deal and in highly themed great places yeah so yes you know like

1115
01:35:01,868 --> 01:35:06,728
the point of like even if I had some money I still think like you probably

1116
01:35:06,728 --> 01:35:10,528
would it doesn't make sense to pay for this unless it would they've turned it

1117
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:21,528
into something insane like crazy well that's mine mine would be I mean it's

1118
01:35:21,768 --> 01:35:26,588
Kick em out oh yeah right I'm hanging in there now and that is a perfect

1119
01:35:26,588 --> 01:35:32,088
vantage point for the big monitors and I want to be able to put whatever I want

1120
01:35:32,088 --> 01:35:36,508
on that TV there's a game on I'm watching the game oh you love watching

1121
01:35:36,508 --> 01:35:43,528
the game you know me yeah get the game on the big game I want for using the

1122
01:35:43,528 --> 01:35:49,568
copyright free would term that we're allowed to use we can't even say the

1123
01:35:49,948 --> 01:35:58,008
initials of the football organization you all know the big game yeah so I

1124
01:35:58,008 --> 01:36:03,328
that's how Doritos frames it yeah but I want to be able to like imagine this you

1125
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:08,068
can like that maybe I don't want to cut it off from the the regular or you know

1126
01:36:08,068 --> 01:36:12,488
a space crew it starts or closes at five o'clock every day it's a that's a

1127
01:36:12,488 --> 01:36:18,368
private dining room I sit up there see 3PO and R2D2 talk to me they ask how was

1128
01:36:18,368 --> 01:36:23,408
your meal sir well they should be the waitstaff R2 brings the stuff on his

1129
01:36:23,408 --> 01:36:27,588
tray like he does a job as Palace yeah see 3PO is though it does you take your

1130
01:36:27,588 --> 01:36:33,528
order and Rex is just like sloppy telly he's just it's his little comes out in a

1131
01:36:33,528 --> 01:36:38,668
bathrobe and he chats with you and he you know he's got thoughts on the game

1132
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:43,228
cuz he's got money right he's got credits riding on it oh yeah yeah yeah

1133
01:36:43,228 --> 01:36:46,728
and I want to hear how everything's going with him and Roxanne I think

1134
01:36:46,728 --> 01:36:50,828
they're married and they're doing great and he is one of the top DJs in all of

1135
01:36:50,828 --> 01:36:55,668
space he's he's in I want to hear all the wonderful details of Rex's wonderful

1136
01:36:55,668 --> 01:37:01,148
life oh yeah he's making Steve Aoki like Vegas money now that's fuck you money

1137
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:10,648
yeah he's smashing his head into synthetic cakes so all right that's my if

1138
01:37:10,648 --> 01:37:16,468
I could be I would pave to turn the Star Wars TV onto anything I want and to be

1139
01:37:16,468 --> 01:37:21,108
best friends with Rex and now I'm paying 100 grand now all right well

1140
01:37:21,108 --> 01:37:25,488
hundred grand for you to live in Star Tours hundred grand for me to have an

1141
01:37:25,488 --> 01:37:29,068
adventures club or a space mountain hundred grand for Jason to nap in a

1142
01:37:29,068 --> 01:37:36,748
theme park done everyone's on sort of game here I do have I only have one I

1143
01:37:36,748 --> 01:37:45,088
should get a new one the figured out years ago where Disney supplies sources

1144
01:37:45,088 --> 01:37:49,668
the pillows for the hotels for the night so it tells everybody for really like

1145
01:37:49,668 --> 01:37:55,548
50 bucks bucks on Amazon save that for the Disney pillow patreon episode you're

1146
01:37:55,548 --> 01:37:59,568
gonna lead the way on that one down is a pain in the ass to care care for though

1147
01:37:59,568 --> 01:38:02,788
you can machine wash it but then you really have to dry it because it's a

1148
01:38:02,788 --> 01:38:06,448
little wet hey save it for the episode save it for the pillow and we don't want

1149
01:38:06,448 --> 01:38:12,268
to give that away here also I think the top tier are another perk of the 33,000

1150
01:38:12,828 --> 01:38:18,908
the the the super patreon tier is to is to be able to watch Jason nap oh yeah a

1151
01:38:18,908 --> 01:38:30,248
live cam of you nap all right you can access dot com slash you can make more

1152
01:38:30,248 --> 01:38:35,268
like twitch you could like how you could sleep in pajamas that are branded so
