1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,600
Welcome to Podcast the Ride.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
This, the, what is that?

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,380
I'm sorry, I can't, I'm having trouble reading

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,500
through my long black bangs.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,580
They're getting right into my eyes.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,260
I have a try, who is that over there?

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,860
Is that Mike Carlson?

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,140
Yeah, hey, it's me, Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,660
My regular, that's my regular name.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,780
Mike Carlson, wow, that's a crazy,

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,820
that's like a nuts kind of goth glam rock kind of name,

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,380
just like Chris Gaines.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,140
Jason Sheridan too, what a,

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,940
that'd be an amazing stage name

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,260
if you were to get into real angsty.

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,820
Thanks so much, I wanna thank you guys

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,100
for giving me the eight to 10 months off

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,660
due to my hideous face to figure men.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,460
Oh yeah, of course, you look radically different.

21
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,780
Much worse, you look like dog shit now.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,620
I looked like that piece of shit Garth Brooks,

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,660
because my face was horribly disfigured.

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,700
Ugly, ugly man, who could think of an uglier,

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,220
fatter man than Garth, if you don't,

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,100
okay, if you're coming into this,

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,020
if this suddenly now seems like we're launching

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,500
an attack. Well, you're if.

29
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,420
There it will look.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,020
Wait, what does that mean?

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,100
Are you saying that no one listening

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,060
has any sense of the Garth Brooks, Chris Gaines situation?

33
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,540
What's your percentage?

34
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,380
What are you putting at, Mike?

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,140
I bet 95% of the audience

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,060
has maybe heard the name Chris Gaines,

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,140
knows that it was an alter ego,

38
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,860
and that's where the line is drawn.

39
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,500
Could be, that might be it.

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,300
Yes, happy to be wrong, by the way.

41
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,180
I think we got some troopers born

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,220
between the years of 1984 and 1986,

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,900
who had very weird media diets as preteens like I did.

44
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,140
Yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,540
I think we're the same.

46
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,180
This thing, when you had less going on,

47
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,660
when you didn't have a social life,

48
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,820
yeah, I was early high school for me.

49
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,100
I had nowhere to be.

50
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,460
I had nothing to do.

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,620
I had no social event.

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,540
When something like Chris Gaines falls in your lap,

53
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,900
and you have nothing but time on your hands,

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,300
that's great.

55
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,660
Nothing but time to think about it,

56
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,540
to solve the riddle and the conundrum,

57
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,940
and to absorb every piece of media, all three of them.

58
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,740
You had to come up with small talk

59
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,100
for extended relatives at parties

60
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,940
where you can't remember why you're there.

61
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,780
Oh, so you were talking Chris Gaines

62
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,620
at family functions?

63
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,460
No.

64
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,020
Actually, Garth Brooks is Chris Gaines.

65
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,980
There's an SNL where Garth Brooks hosts,

66
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,940
but Chris Gaines is the musical guy.

67
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,820
And I don't know anything beyond that.

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,660
I don't know, it's like, you know.

69
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,780
Well, that's what I'm saying.

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,620
That's what I'm saying,

71
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,260
you don't know anything beyond that.

72
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,100
That's all.

73
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,140
That's what I'm drawing the line at.

74
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,820
I would say mostly I didn't, yes, you're correct.

75
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,660
People might know that for a while,

76
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,580
there was a stretch of time where Garth Brooks

77
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,020
kind of became another guy named Chris Gaines.

78
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,500
And still not ever fully, really.

79
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,820
We were doing, I was getting into some,

80
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,420
you too, Jason, we were getting into some deep cut.

81
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,100
If it sounded like we were suddenly

82
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,420
really insulting Garth Brooks, here's a preview.

83
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,180
We weren't saying anything about him

84
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,020
that he didn't already say about himself.

85
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,420
That is his kayfabe.

86
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,300
That is his storyline that he made for himself in the,

87
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,540
I don't even know where to start.

88
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,380
There is so much more in this story

89
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,140
than I did not know about the unmade movie, The Lamb.

90
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,220
I didn't know about the in-character fictional

91
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,580
behind the music.

92
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,420
There's a lot.

93
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,140
And then still another, an NBC concert special.

94
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,940
I have a notion of the order, but I don't, you know,

95
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm grasping at surprise.

96
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,100
It's gonna be an experimental process,

97
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,740
much like the creation of the Chris Gaines persona.

98
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,820
We'll figure it out together.

99
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,940
We're just, we're blowing it up, you know?

100
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,540
We've been doing, just like Garth,

101
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,220
we've been doing the same thing for a long time,

102
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,980
riding high, global superstars.

103
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,100
Yeah, yep.

104
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,980
And now it's time to shake it up.

105
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,820
Time to shake it up.

106
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,260
Time to break the entire mold.

107
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,780
Finally get on the billboard charts

108
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,380
because you insisted on them not playing your songs

109
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
for some reason.

110
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,220
I don't know.

111
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,380
I don't know what this means exactly.

112
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,060
Garth Brooks, I think the billboard pop charts,

113
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,580
he did not release his music to the pop radio stations.

114
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,220
So he didn't chart on one of them.

115
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,420
It's very confusing.

116
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,740
You're talking Garth's music, not Chris Gaines music.

117
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,300
No, Chris Gaines' music charts on the pop charts.

118
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,140
Of course it does.

119
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,660
Because it's pop music.

120
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,500
But Garth Brooks.

121
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,340
There's nothing country about it.

122
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,180
Nothing country.

123
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,220
He completely absorbed into the pop world so authentically

124
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,460
without any trace of country,

125
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,780
anywhere in the voice or look or band or songwriting.

126
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,620
That's right.

127
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,580
Yeah, I had to really put myself back

128
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,940
in that 1999, 2000 hit space

129
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,380
because they would say things like,

130
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,100
the album was a total failure,

131
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,580
only sold two million copies.

132
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,500
It's like, what?

133
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh right, 12 million was like a big hit.

134
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,020
Okay.

135
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,940
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,940
No, this really does reek of like pre-collapse.

137
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,780
Like they don't know what's coming for them.

138
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,780
And by that I mean like Napster and that whole implosion.

139
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,900
Jason, I wanna give you the opportunity

140
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,500
whenever you feel fit to contextualize Chris Gaines

141
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,180
in terms of 9-11.

142
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,700
It feels like it's waiting to happen.

143
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,420
For 9-11 did the album come out?

144
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,380
Over 365.

145
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

146
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,260
It was 99.

147
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,140
Yeah, like 600 days probably.

148
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
Okay, all right.

149
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
But that's something.

150
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,100
There has to be some correlation between the two of them.

151
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,820
We'll find it, we'll figure it out.

152
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,860
I'm sure he did some of those charity events,

153
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,180
some of those TV special fundraisers.

154
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,020
Chris Gaines.

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,940
Chris Gaines did?

156
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,180
Not Chris Gaines, Garth Brooks came out of semi-retirement,

157
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,020
I'm assuming.

158
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,780
Chris Gaines died on one of the planes.

159
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,620
Oh no.

160
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,860
Yeah, they in-universe killed him.

161
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,940
Wow, really?

162
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,980
Ironically, just like his crushed bandmate

163
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,340
died in a plane crash.

164
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,540
Yes, that's right.

165
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,980
Yeah, one just a one-man plane crash

166
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,140
and then the other much bigger,

167
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,500
just as big of a scale as Chris's solo career grew to.

168
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,340
Yeah.

169
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,500
That's a dark joke I was gonna make, but I won't.

170
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,340
I won't.

171
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,380
You're in Dicey territory.

172
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,020
Let's veer out of, and that's what we get to do.

173
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,780
We don't have to think about the dark days of 2001.

174
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,620
No.

175
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,500
We can think about how much,

176
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,060
just the freedom and the silliness of 1999

177
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,420
when we could pay attention to this.

178
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,860
Let's just calibrate this.

179
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,220
How about let's just do basics.

180
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,060
It's kind of what we say.

181
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,700
I think, Mike, as you said,

182
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,580
kind of all anybody knew then, really,

183
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,060
if your life didn't revolve around Garth Brooks,

184
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,860
and mine did not.

185
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,740
I would say that I did not listen to any Garth Brooks.

186
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,580
I was not a country person then.

187
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,540
Are we all, I don't think,

188
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,260
I don't feel like this group is big Garth,

189
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,380
or Garth Brooks fans, at least then.

190
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,700
No, certainly not then.

191
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Certainly not then.

192
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,780
Now I've listened a little more.

193
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,020
Garth makes it hard to stream music too.

194
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,860
Really?

195
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,020
I can't really find his album.

196
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,180
You can find his albums, but they're not on Apple Music,

197
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,300
because there's been a couple times over the last few years

198
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,060
as I grow, I've gotten more into

199
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,180
more modern 90s style country music, 2000s.

200
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,620
And I've been like, oh, I should probably do a Garth.

201
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,420
But every time I run into a wall,

202
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,740
Garth put a wall up, so now I have to get,

203
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,540
go like physically into a store or something and buy them.

204
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,380
Or I have to download them.

205
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,220
That's how he made his money, you know?

206
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,060
Like this is the level of music sales.

207
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,540
Oh my God, Astronome of the Sky, yeah.

208
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,820
When I think about 90s crazy music selling,

209
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,740
I definitely think about him and Mariah Carey.

210
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,580
Right.

211
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,500
Like the two of them, just the bestounding

212
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,060
amounts of money for themselves and for everyone involved.

213
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,780
Like celebrated to such an extreme degree,

214
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,060
especially on those other awards,

215
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,500
like the American Music Awards are always touting,

216
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,220
you know, 10 times more than the Beatles.

217
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
The Beatles are nothing.

218
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,060
Right.

219
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,420
They grovel at Garth Brooks and Mariah Carey's feet.

220
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,980
I think this made my mom mad when she would hear this stuff.

221
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,020
She'd be like, well, we don't listen to Garth Brooks.

222
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,300
We don't know someone who likes Garth Brooks.

223
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,420
Because she was a big Beatles fan, so she would be like,

224
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,500
he can't be better than the Beatles.

225
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,980
I'm sorry, but he is.

226
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,700
That's what it is.

227
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,740
Yeah, that's the number's the lie.

228
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,580
It makes it a shame that I listen to so little of the music

229
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,660
that I'm missing out on music that has to be better than the Beatles.

230
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:46,900
Right.

231
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,180
Now, as of today, the only full Garth Brooks album

232
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,420
I've listened to is Chris Gaines' album.

233
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,820
Wow.

234
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,420
You went further than I did.

235
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,540
I didn't listen to the album.

236
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,180
You didn't.

237
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,660
I didn't.

238
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,700
Oh my gosh.

239
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,100
Now, you can correct me down the road.

240
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,500
My assessment is I don't think that,

241
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,940
and I'm probably I could be wrong because I haven't listened to it.

242
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,820
I'm not sure that to me, the album is a primary Chris Gaines text.

243
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,940
I know what I consider the main text, and it could be.

244
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,580
My impression certainly is that it's kind of like boring.

245
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,340
Well, I went hunting for it.

246
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,700
I tried Spotify.

247
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,060
I tried Apple Music.

248
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,980
I tried the iTunes store, and then I found it.

249
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,100
I didn't order it because I was looking last night.

250
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,980
But it's on eBay anywhere from 99 cents to like $30.

251
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,580
You got to dig a little bit, but it didn't take me too long.

252
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,620
There's a Reddit, and somebody has a link to this site I've never heard of

253
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,140
that just has it streaming on there, probably illegally.

254
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,860
So Garth, if he hears this, he's going to be upset.

255
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,340
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,060
The link is to it's a link from the alternate dimension that Chris Gaines comes from.

257
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,540
Right.

258
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,380
It's that it took you to the iTunes of that universe.

259
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,100
Right, right.

260
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,940
Yeah, whole different interface.

261
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,460
Website, very confusing looking.

262
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,780
I'll say this.

263
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,700
You're not wrong that it's a boring album.

264
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,300
I think there's one song on it that has to be included in the Chris Gaines text

265
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,700
in the record of Chris Gaines existing.

266
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,260
Maybe you know what I'm talking about.

267
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,660
That is unlike the other songs in a lot of ways.

268
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,780
Oh, I've been wondering.

269
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,860
I only barely caught that this is on the...

270
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,140
I think I know what you're talking about.

271
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,860
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

272
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,260
And it's called Right Now.

273
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,340
Oh, actually, no.

274
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,140
I thought you were talking about the song that he made with his band

275
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,820
before his solo career, Crush, who made kind of a neo-psychedelic

276
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,100
monkeys influence type song, which I think somewhere on this earth,

277
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,900
you can listen to the whole thing, but I couldn't quite find it.

278
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,940
I like the sound of that.

279
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,300
No, Right Now, I think needs to be included in the conversation.

280
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,420
That is the one that samples a 60s song or like he covers a chunk of...

281
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,300
People know.

282
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,700
Yeah.

283
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,900
Smile on your brother.

284
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,020
It's that song.

285
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,340
It's that song with it's the chorus from that, but with like almost a rap talk,

286
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,380
singing sort of like the Chicka Cherry Cola band.

287
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,860
What's that?

288
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,100
Oh, you have a certain or kind of his vibe, isn't it?

289
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,700
Like physically, too.

290
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,300
He's kind of like Savage Garden.

291
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,020
There's a lot of stuff.

292
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,340
Yes.

293
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Now, I think the album is interesting.

294
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,340
I don't want to do rail because you this is Scott.

295
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,060
This is your train.

296
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm not trying to do rail it here.

297
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,340
I have to allow for discussion of Chris Jones music in the Chris Gaines episode.

298
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,700
But Right Now is very funny.

299
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,820
Right Now is embarrassing and very funny and shitty and sucks really, really bad.

300
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,980
I remember it from the time I didn't re-listen to the whole thing.

301
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,500
We probably should re-listen to it together on here because it is,

302
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,540
I think it's funny and bad.

303
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,580
Do you want to pull a clip up?

304
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,700
Yes, I do.

305
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,460
That one is available.

306
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,180
That song is in its entirety on YouTube.

307
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,740
Yes, it is.

308
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:13,460
But Wikipedia told me there's music videos for Lost in You, which I found, and Right Now.

309
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,780
And I only saw a little snippet of the Right Now music video,

310
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,340
which like Lost in You, seems very stupid music video wise.

311
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,900
So all of the songs on the album, and this happens a lot, I feel like,

312
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:37,060
are ripoffs of different 90s, kind of temporarily popular genres in a way.

313
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,460
Yeah.

314
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:37,940
Yeah.

315
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,620
Well, because it is all the one album that was put out is a best of.

316
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,260
And I'll get into the mythology, but he was, Chris Gaines,

317
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,140
this alter ego was scoring hits in the world, in this universe, mega hits in the late 80s,

318
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,740
early 90s, all through.

319
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,540
So it would make sense that it would kind of like jump genres.

320
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:01,780
Yeah.

321
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,260
Yeah.

322
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,140
It doesn't.

323
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,460
I think there was more of a dividing line in the 90s of like, oh, if you're a country guy,

324
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,740
you can't do pop music.

325
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:17,300
Whereas now that song Fancy Like, the Applebee's on Date Night song, the remix has a Kesha verse.

326
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,620
I see.

327
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,660
And Kesha, there's a music video with her and the guy.

328
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,220
Mm-hmm.

329
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,860
Mm-hmm.

330
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,180
Yeah.

331
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,940
Your guy's country view stems entirely from that song.

332
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,420
From the song Fancy Like that we heard on an Applebee's commercial.

333
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,180
No, we know about Fancy Like, so we can assess the industry as a whole.

334
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,340
What's one from like 10 years ago?

335
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,540
Chicken Fried?

336
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,980
Chicken Fried, Zach Brown Band.

337
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,820
A Country Girl Shake It For Me, Shake It For Me Girl by Luke Bryan, I think.

338
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,220
Oh, yeah.

339
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,500
Is that one of his songs?

340
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,620
I know a lot of these.

341
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,580
I know that Toby Keith.

342
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,020
He's 10 year old songs.

343
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,500
Yeah.

344
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,060
Jane's been teaching me a lot about Jodie Messina, who sang Heads Carolina,

345
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,020
Tails California, which is also covered in a new hit country song.

346
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,060
Oh, interesting.

347
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,940
I don't know about this.

348
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,420
Mm-hmm.

349
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,060
This is new to me.

350
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,260
I'm gonna have to go home.

351
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,500
Yeah.

352
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,540
But right now, I have to talk about right now.

353
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,100
Right now.

354
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,820
So like, just really right before we get there, I think just the other thing is like,

356
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,180
all of this music is packaged under, there's really one photo that you

357
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,420
saw a lot and there's a lot of Chris Gaines photos.

358
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,420
But the main thing to know is that we know what Garth Brooks looks like.

359
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,780
Just kind of like good old boy, regular guy.

360
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:40,180
But Chris Gaines is a pouty, moody, black bangs, eyeliner, like trench coat, all black.

361
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,260
There's kind of a crow thing going on.

362
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,620
He's kind of a crow.

363
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,540
Lighter, I believe.

364
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,460
Garth Brooks says at some point.

365
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,980
In universe, he's 50 pounds.

366
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,060
All the weight talk today is all in canon.

367
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,540
Yes.

368
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,220
It's not you guys saying that.

369
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,340
That's what you were saying before.

370
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,820
Oh, yeah, exactly.

371
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,700
We'll get to it.

372
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,180
I get specified.

373
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,540
And that's really, sure, this episode is about Chris Gaines, but really, ultimately,

374
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,700
it's about Garth Brooks' body issues.

375
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,860
That's truly what we're gonna get to and analyze here.

376
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,180
Right, right, right.

377
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,300
But anyway, I just wanted to establish the vibe.

378
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,180
But I don't know.

379
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:20,260
Now that I've said the vibe and the look of Chris Gaines, does that help explain right now?

380
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,220
I don't think it does.

381
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,500
Because what is that type?

382
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,780
What have you ever seen besides I think we finally thought of it with Savage Garden?

383
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,300
Who looks like Chris Gaines?

384
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,580
I have an answer.

385
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,980
And it's if you type the term alt rock into that website, WikiHow,

386
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,420
that has the weird, bad illustrations of like how to soft boil an egg.

387
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,260
And like the people look very cartoony.

388
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,780
Like it looks like the shitty AI art before the shitty AI art.

389
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,280
You know?

390
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,020
He looks like Chris Angel.

391
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,300
Yes.

392
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,660
He's got some angel in there.

393
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,860
Yeah, a little bit cleaned.

394
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,260
I don't sense like tats because he's not.

395
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,140
No, no, he would not do that.

396
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,340
He's not goth.

397
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,260
He's very like, he's very like sensitive.

398
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,300
And then the music is very like it's not and it's not punk.

399
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,460
I think what it is is he's thinking of himself as more of like a beat poet.

400
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,580
A coffee house acoustic rocker, which is what some of these songs on the album are.

401
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,060
Yeah.

402
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,100
It's very soft, very emotional, in touch with his feelings.

403
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,340
And I think in his mind like that like beret-ish wearing guy with a little soul patch.

404
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,460
I forgot the soul patch.

405
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,940
Oh my God.

406
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,980
I missed the most important part.

407
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,780
He's got a soul patch.

408
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,100
Yes.

409
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,660
And that's like that's what I think he thinks he's doing.

410
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,860
It's more of a quiet rocker, pop rocker guy.

411
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,140
He's making music.

412
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,420
I think, I don't know.

413
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,820
It's music that would score the cafe within a border's books.

414
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,460
Yes.

415
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,260
That's good.

416
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,140
Yeah, that's not bad.

417
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,180
Yeah, that's a description.

418
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,700
Some of some of the songs are a little louder, but a lot of them are pretty quiet.

419
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,220
Some of them are there's like some Tony Braxton ripoff thing.

420
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,420
And one of these songs I feel like.

421
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,380
That's a good way to put it.

422
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,880
Yes.

423
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,820
All little like baby face tinged and he's like a he's a part of it a little bit.

424
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,820
There is a straight up wall flowers ripoff song.

425
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,780
Just a one headlight ripoff that even has the same drum fill.

426
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,420
Like exactly the same.

427
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,300
But it's and he's singing like Jacob Dillon.

428
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,740
It's so weird.

429
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,780
Well, he's looking at what's popular now as I'm starting this project in 97.

430
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,860
And I guess it was I guess it was that.

431
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,360
Headlight.

432
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,260
Let's let's hear some right now.

433
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,060
Let's hear right now, which is extremely crappy for this album.

434
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,100
For in the standards of the standards of this Chris Gaines album.

435
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,340
This thing sucks 10 times harder.

436
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,100
Is Savage Garden.

437
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,300
The Walker team.

438
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,300
Moody like.

439
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,300
It's my.

440
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,820
Now, it sucks so much shit.

441
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,060
That's really that's really weak.

442
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,580
That's that's major week.

443
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:49,140
And also like he this is this is some put we're not at 9 11, but we are post Columbine.

444
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,740
So we're trying to reckon with that.

445
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:50,980
Yeah.

446
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,820
And you got to that song you just played and the come on people now he can't do that as Garth.

447
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,500
He had to put on a wave and a soul patch to make that radically different music.

448
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,380
Maybe he wanted to do like he like I better be in disguise in case people don't like this.

449
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,700
There is and I I did not come here to do this, but now I have to.

450
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,620
There are bands that do this all the time where I go.

451
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,380
I don't know what the point of this was.

452
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,420
I feel like they got in their own heads about the set their sound or what people expect from them.

453
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,940
So they end up doing something different.

454
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,300
Green Day, for instance, has done this a couple times.

455
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,940
Something bad.

456
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,420
What do you mean?

457
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,820
No, I'm not.

458
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,380
No, no, no.

459
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,620
Who?

460
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,340
Wait, wait, wait.

461
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,740
Hold on.

462
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,180
Never never.

463
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no forget.

464
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,900
Never ever in their career.

465
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,940
They have Alter Eag band.

466
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,140
They have different bands.

467
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
They have the Fox Pearl Hot Tubbs.

468
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,020
They have off.

469
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,420
Yeah, I didn't know they did this.

470
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,700
Yeah, they have a song, a band called Network something, something, but that is a little more

471
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,380
like a Kraftwerk band.

472
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,020
I don't like that.

473
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,780
Oh, I'm sure that's very successfully.

474
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,420
Very good.

475
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,700
Masters of synth Green Day.

476
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,620
Yeah, I haven't revisited that in many years.

477
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,900
But you won't see that it's bad.

478
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,820
You refuse to see that the Kraftwerk one.

479
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,180
Yeah, it might be bad.

480
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,540
Yeah, it might be bad.

481
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,300
Finally, some honesty from Mike.

482
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,660
Finally.

483
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,140
On the subject of Green Day, I'm saying.

484
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,540
So yeah, Garth, I don't know why Garth couldn't have done this dog shit piece of music on his

485
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,940
own regular album because it's not too, it's like got the little country, like kind of

486
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,420
acoustically vibe there.

487
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,900
I guess he just felt like it was too big of a departure.

488
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,460
If I'm going to make this even shittier with the information that this might have been

489
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,060
from a stereo gum profile of Chris Gaines that had some great info in it in general.

490
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,820
But the so it's not just stolen from who did the original song.

491
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,260
What's the come on people now?

492
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,900
Oh, yeah.

493
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,780
Oh, shit.

494
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,340
I don't know.

495
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,460
I have a name in my head and I'm not going to say it to not embarrass.

496
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,860
Yeah, I know.

497
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,420
I feel the same way.

498
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,220
Chorus is from one source versus the little rap.

499
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,500
He didn't write that either.

500
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,740
That is a poem or spoken word piece or something by Cheryl Wheeler called If It Were Up to Me.

501
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,300
And so all of that stuff, maybe it's the movies, maybe it's the books and the government and the

502
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,500
crooks and all that pulled from Cheryl Wheeler.

503
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,180
But he made one change.

504
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,620
He removed.

505
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,900
Maybe it's the guns.

506
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:22,740
No, he did not agree with the notion that guns could be the as many smart people have.

507
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,100
Oh, no, guns are not.

508
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,540
Get that off that list.

509
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,660
Probably the parents.

510
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,620
No, that bums me out.

511
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,740
The books.

512
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,900
Probably books are causing the shootings.

513
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,620
It feels like Chris Gaines would keep the guns in.

514
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,380
That feels like a Garth Brooks move.

515
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,020
Well, it's almost as if Garth Brooks was not fully committed to the character.

516
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,700
No, which is a shame.

517
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,900
Honestly, all this story line stuff, I am kind of into the commitment of making a world

518
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:56,180
around the character who is tangential to the plot of a movie that never comes out.

519
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,180
That's bonkers.

520
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,580
There is such a first of all, it's the Young Bloods.

521
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,700
And I actually didn't know that.

522
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,660
OK, I know in my I'm like, I know in my heart it's not Crosby, Stills and Nash.

523
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,620
And I will say it's not stupid.

524
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,300
If I guess that's Buffalo Springfield.

525
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,660
Yeah, but I'm thinking I'm thinking.

526
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,100
For what it's worth.

527
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,980
Yes, exactly.

528
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,480
OK.

529
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,940
There's such a fine line, though, between this stuff that works and like Ziggy Stardust.

530
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,540
I was watching that moon age daydream that's on HBO, which is a very psychedelic video

531
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,980
documentary essay of David Bowie.

532
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,940
I don't know if you guys have seen this.

533
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,060
And Ziggy Stardust is cool.

534
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,340
He's got cool outfits, but it's a dumb fake name and a fake character is not as much

535
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,580
supplemental material as there is for Chris Gaines.

536
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,460
I would say none.

537
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,580
I would say never in all that help did we really dive into what is we never got a bio

538
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,020
on Ziggy Stardust, right?

539
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,220
Just use the name and was cool, which is all you can do.

540
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,380
So the other closest equivalent to this is Sergeant Pepper, where it's not like.

541
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,220
And now to learn all about right Billy Shears.

542
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,940
But even though, yes, that goes a long way to not like if you give too much information,

543
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,020
it's always going to I think it's going to be bad if you're a rock star creating a new

544
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,060
persona because the writing is not going to be so hot.

545
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,100
Right.

546
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,220
But there Chris Gaines doesn't work at all.

547
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,140
And other other people have tried this and I feel like it rarely works.

548
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,300
It's usually silly.

549
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,180
This is probably one of the greatest silly examples of all time.

550
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,580
Which is the main I know like for anyone who's like theme parks.

551
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,940
The only way I can justify it is that this is as silly as things that happen in theme

552
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,260
park.

553
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,580
This was a theme park of the mind to be in 1999.

554
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,580
Asked me to do McFisto so we could at least have a straight line for.

555
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,620
A bridge to.

556
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,100
Yes.

557
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,420
Yeah.

558
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,540
So we could be here today.

559
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,660
I thought of it as a prequel.

560
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,860
Yes, I know, because every part of me that was not into McFisto.

561
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:56,100
Well, at least sets the precedent that fake rock star alter egos are theme parks.

562
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,140
We are.

563
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,700
We get to decide this and we did.

564
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,140
And Bono is smart because he just stuffed it into this tour.

565
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,500
Yeah, you need to know like before you go to the concert, please know that he is

566
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,220
not Bono.

567
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,420
He is Mr. McFisto.

568
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,580
Right.

569
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,940
And it was not an album called U2 plus McFisto or something.

570
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,020
It was just by the way, you're here already.

571
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,460
You paid for it already.

572
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,300
You got to deal with me and my alter ego.

573
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,660
Well, and he also bombarded people of like, oh, he's always doing this.

574
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,380
There's the fly.

575
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,740
There's the mirror ball man.

576
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,420
There's Mr. McFisto.

577
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,460
You know, he.

578
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:27,700
Sure.

579
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,900
There was a well, yeah.

580
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,260
And that tour specifically.

581
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,740
Yeah.

582
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,540
Can I have I said this to you guys even in private?

583
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,700
I have tickets to the sphere.

584
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,020
What?

585
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,900
Oh, you got a sphere.

586
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,220
Really?

587
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,780
Tickets to the baby tour.

588
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,260
Wow.

589
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,460
You did it.

590
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,100
Very excited.

591
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,660
My God.

592
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,300
When is that?

593
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,340
End of October.

594
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,980
Wow.

595
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,460
OK.

596
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,140
So you're so you're back to Vegas.

597
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,020
Not long after Vegas Groove Blender.

598
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,300
Your tickets now.

599
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,100
Wednesday night.

600
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,940
My God.

601
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,380
Well, that's a day of good traffic free.

602
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:57,940
Yeah.

603
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,260
Fingers crossed that it actually opens on time and that you two actually honors commitments.

604
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,140
Well, they would never not honor their commitments.

605
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,580
I'm not saying anything about them.

606
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,700
I'm just saying like a lot of residences have been moved around from what I've read about

607
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,500
like Vegas.

608
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,980
I don't think you can move this residency somewhere else.

609
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,180
I think there's only one venue.

610
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,180
Oh, no, it's not.

611
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,260
No, I just mean move on the calendar.

612
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,580
Well, you're right that the risk of the sphere not coming together seems very high.

613
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,820
I believe it's already a financial debacle.

614
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,820
He's calling it.

615
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
This is who we're going to be doing some sphere talk.

616
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,780
Yeah, it's going to be.

617
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,580
Like many financial debacles, the sphere has already or had been planned for London,

618
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,260
Los Angeles and New York.

619
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,060
Different spheres.

620
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,620
Wow.

621
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,660
It's a Disney quest.

622
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,020
Yeah, we're doing so many of you'll be there'll be a sphere in your town.

623
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,900
No matter where you live on every Starbucks are going to get kicked out in favor of spheres.

624
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,620
That's right.

625
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,100
Yeah.

626
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,340
So I at least picked like three or four weeks after it starts or something.

627
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,460
Okay.

628
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,580
Happy spearing to you.

629
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,380
That's good news.

630
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,780
Yes.

631
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,180
Let me let me back it up a little and let's see if we can figure out why this happened.

632
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:14,980
At the time, it's all I knew and all I read was it was certainly framed to me in any article

633
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:21,220
I read is like he wants to try to do pop music and stretch out of the country persona.

634
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,780
And this is how he the way he found to do it.

635
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,300
I didn't know about this movie.

636
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,500
Well, first of all, just before the movie, another thing Stereogum sheds light on is

637
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,220
that 1999 is a weird time for Garth in general.

638
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,740
Maybe you call it midlife crisis.

639
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,380
Maybe it's the maybe it's the books.

640
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,420
Maybe it's the age.

641
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,700
I don't know what's causing it but or just like that he's kind of climbed the mountain

642
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,580
like the you know, where do you go when you're the biggest country's star in the world and one

643
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,100
of the biggest selling artists in general of all time.

644
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,780
I don't think he knows exactly what to do.

645
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,140
So earlier in this same year in 1999, he announced that he was going to join the Padres.

646
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,420
Never heard this before.

647
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,860
Now, you know, it's you can't just say that and then be on the Padres.

648
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,940
You have to go through spring training, but he was he was going to Jordan it.

649
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,100
He was going to like use the celebrity to at least get the leg up to go straight to

650
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,540
training camp.

651
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,500
He's 35 years old or something here.

652
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:26,980
Older.

653
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,780
I think 30.

654
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:33,060
I think 37 or 38, which means he is around our age right now.

655
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,980
The ages that we all are right.

656
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,300
Right.

657
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,180
Imagine that now we decide we are going to start our baseball careers.

658
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,380
Granted, he's like kind of a he's a big guy.

659
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,020
I hang on.

660
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,580
I don't know.

661
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,220
I guess he's in shape.

662
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,260
He you know, concerts are more physical than anything that we do than touring the world.

663
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,100
But it's still I don't know that he does not necessarily seem like a given

664
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:04,420
that he's going to walk right onto a major league baseball team at 38 at 38 years.

665
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,340
I don't know his baseball history or anything.

666
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,940
Yeah, it seems weird to me.

667
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,020
I you know, I've been watching.

668
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,340
I got the Phillies like one team package on MLB TV and there's a handful.

669
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,660
There's guys on that team that are like 23, 24 on their first or second season.

670
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,660
There are some people who are like 34, 35 who've been playing for like eight or 10 years.

671
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,260
I can't say like there's even like a bulldorum level story of like, oh,

672
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,740
they were just stuck in the minors and they finally got called up when they were 38 or whatever.

673
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,540
You know, I don't know.

674
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,380
You're an ancient old man at that age in baseball terms.

675
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:50,500
I feel like he maybe would have some luck playing for like the San Bernardino Padres

676
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,020
as opposed to the San Diego.

677
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,660
Well, maybe that was just what every AAA team.

678
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,860
That's what that's what Jordan did when he was double A, right?

679
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,580
And but I don't think this ever came to pass.

680
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,300
I don't think he I think this was just something announced for Phillies and then it didn't happen.

681
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:14,340
But important part of it is that he said if I make it to the team or to the camera,

682
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,500
whatever, at whatever point where a salary would be involved, do not pay me a salary.

683
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,620
I have all the money I need.

684
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,780
Please just donate a salary amount to the children's organization.

685
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,660
I work with the Touch them all foundation.

686
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,700
Oh, man.

687
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,420
My goodness.

688
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,620
Garth is very concerned about children and that some of them aren't being touched.

689
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,780
He really wants to make sure that we touch them all.

690
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,060
Words were a little different back then to be fair to the touch them all.

691
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,140
It's still pretty close to like Kill them all or something like Metallica's album.

692
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,420
Touch them all.

693
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:48,920
Yeah.

694
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,860
So I don't know if pretty wild.

695
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,460
This organization still exists.

696
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,420
I hope that they've changed their name or could have considered.

697
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,140
Is it EM?

698
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,580
Yeah.

699
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,060
Yeah.

700
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,540
Casual.

701
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,260
Yeah.

702
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,220
Touch them all.

703
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,460
Okay.

704
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:01,860
Yeah.

705
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,900
So it's like Metallica's.

706
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,860
Get them touched.

707
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
It's like Metallica's kill them all.

708
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,940
I work with the Get them touched foundation.

709
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,300
Get them.

710
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,660
It's called G-I-T-T-U-P.

711
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:10,980
Yeah.

712
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,220
Yeah.

713
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,460
Yeah.

714
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,580
Get them.

715
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,460
Get them touched.

716
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,460
So this is one part of where we're at.

717
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,700
Garth Brooks wise.

718
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,660
Then another announcement comes out.

719
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,220
Garth is starring in a movie.

720
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,740
I didn't know any of this at the time.

721
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,300
So I don't know why I'm watching a special with a goth or whatever he is Garth Brooks

722
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,780
and why he's on Saturday Night Live as a different guy.

723
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,060
I didn't know this movie context.

724
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,340
You have to have been reading the trades or the LA Times or something.

725
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,340
But now this year, this is context that we have

726
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,060
is that he was going to be in a movie called The Lamb.

727
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,780
Babyface was going to produce this movie and presumably the music therein.

728
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,820
I forget who else was.

729
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,020
Oh, the writer.

730
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,820
The writer was Jeb Stuart who co-wrote Die Hard and The Fugitive.

731
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,460
Major.

732
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,260
This is stacked.

733
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,300
I don't think a director was ever.

734
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,380
Another hit maker just like Garth Brooks.

735
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,760
Yes.

736
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,620
The great person movies, Jeb Stuart.

737
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,700
And he all we know about this.

738
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:16,580
I mean, it felt to me tonally, I think it was going to be kind of a dark film.

739
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,740
I bet he was trying to do a bodyguard.

740
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,860
I think he was following that model, like the kind of surprising degree

741
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,260
to which she crossed over when he used it and had big hits within that.

742
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,500
So maybe this is a vehicle to put it all together.

743
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,300
I'm acting and we get big hits out of that, too.

744
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,060
The only information we have about The Lamb.

745
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:46,260
Okay, he would have been a Chris Gaines would have been a sort of a rock and roll citizen Kane.

746
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,900
Which way in that we're going backwards.

747
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:56,020
We're like, okay, well, this is maybe in the first scene already dead.

748
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,020
And then it's all flashbacks, mysterious cloaked in shadow.

749
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,260
And the movie's not actually about Chris Gaines.

750
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,220
It's about a diehard fan convinced that Chris Gaines had been murdered,

751
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,540
possibly for the sins of his fans.

752
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,220
So this is maybe this is like a seven or something.

753
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,300
This is a creepy, taut thriller.

754
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,340
So Chris, it's more about the fan on a search for the truth.

755
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,780
Yeah, it's a guy.

756
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
I don't know this would have been who was around,

757
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,980
but maybe this would have been like a Russell Crowe vehicle.

758
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,560
Go.

759
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,580
Garth was not playing the fan?

760
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,220
No, no.

761
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,500
Okay, this is Chris Gaines.

762
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,000
Right.

763
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,980
Also died for the sins of his fans sounds an awful lot like Jesus Christ.

764
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,980
Yeah, yeah.

765
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,900
So well, and didn't Jesus had to, right?

766
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,220
He so maybe the Jesus.

767
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,860
I well, I guess Jesus was murdered, but he like willed it.

768
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,260
He allowed it to happen for a greater good.

769
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,060
He knew.

770
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,860
So is that what so Chris Gaines died?

771
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,980
He like a lot guy broke into his house and he's like, fine, this is what it must be.

772
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,860
So that all of all of the games, all the Christians, the Chris,

773
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,540
can all ascend to a higher plane.

774
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,700
It's heavy.

775
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,860
We got to find the script to the opening of Sunset Boulevard,

776
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,860
where you see the guy face down in the pool and he tells you how he ended up there.

777
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,900
You know, we know is it more of a pool scenario or is it more of a citizen cane where you see

778
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,740
him just sort of in bed and he dropped something?

779
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,500
Well, all I have is already dead in the opening scene.

780
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,980
So maybe closer to closer to Sunset Boulevard.

781
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,460
Yeah.

782
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,340
So he's been murdered.

783
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,460
Murdered.

784
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,900
Yeah, it's a who done it.

785
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,780
I maybe this, you know, who would have been great on this case is Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd.

786
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,180
Oh, wow.

787
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,540
I should have put it in that universe.

788
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:49,860
Yeah.

789
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,300
Whatever those movies were called.

790
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,140
Along Came a Spider.

791
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,100
Kiss the Girls.

792
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,020
Then now we're talking superstars.

794
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,700
Lion Garth with them.

795
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,500
I think that's great.

796
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,940
I mean, I think there's plenty.

797
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,660
Yeah, I know.

798
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,980
I think that's the best detective duo you could put in there.

799
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,060
That might be where it had it might have been a mashup.

800
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,100
Alex Cross.

801
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:14,260
James Patterson's beloved character, Alex Cross, solves the mystery of who killed Chris Gaines.

802
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Could this get made till today?

803
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,460
Maybe.

804
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,980
Does the script exist?

805
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,060
Possibly.

806
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,260
I think, well, you know what?

807
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,700
You know what's very odd and sad is that then in 2002, there's an art way after this thing

808
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,500
is seemingly crashed and burned and Chris Gaines already kind of a weird footnote joke.

809
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,820
Then there suddenly is an announcement in one of the trades like, hey, remember that?

810
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,100
Remember the lamb?

811
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,420
No.

812
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,900
OK, well, the lamb's still going.

813
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,660
Jeb Stuart had to deal with his wife who was terminally ill, but now she passed away.

814
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
So he's got time to work on the lamb again.

815
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,700
Huh?

816
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,740
Why did you release this?

817
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,020
This is horrible.

818
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,500
Jesus.

819
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,340
He shouldn't have to do anything he doesn't want to do.

820
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,540
That sounds like a terrible thing.

821
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,380
No one is sitting around asking where are those pages on Chris Gaines?

822
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,300
Get over your wife.

823
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,140
Does that get worked into?

824
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,500
Because Chris Gaines' story involves some terminal illnesses.

825
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,340
Well, I don't know.

826
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,860
I don't know the degree of the backstory that was worked out by hit screenwriter Jeb Stuart

827
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,620
or if this was all given.

828
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:25,220
I don't know if the bio essentially was given to Jeb as the material to base the lamb off of.

829
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:25,940
I see.

830
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,180
This much I don't know because there is a Chris Gaines narrative via the behind the music.

831
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,620
So this is all I know about the lamb.

832
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,580
He gave quotes about it and he said,

833
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,140
We want people to go into the theater and know Chris Gaines and care about Chris Gaines.

834
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,180
The thing I'd like to get across is how serious we are about this.

835
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,460
There's the ruttles and there's spinal tap and this is exactly the opposite.

836
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:57,460
It's the opposite of things that people like and that are very fleshed out and accurate even in their silliness.

837
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,580
Right.

838
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,740
We want to be the opposite of that.

839
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,060
This is fake and it's dead serious.

840
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,380
Yeah.

841
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,380
It's a jokeless spinal tap.

842
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:05,860
Jokeless.

843
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,340
None of that nonsense with the stone end and getting trapped in the pod and the 11.

844
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,460
Let me be clear.

845
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
Chris Gaines' amps go to 10.

846
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,980
10 because that makes sense.

847
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,740
It's not fake.

848
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,540
It's silly.

849
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,420
It's silly.

850
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,380
That's also weird because Oliver Stone's Doors movie had been out for years.

851
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,940
They could have just pointed at that and been like,

852
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,300
Well, but that's a real band.

853
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,820
That's a real band.

854
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,580
Oh, you're saying, okay, those other ones.

855
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,620
Yeah, we're fictional.

856
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,420
Yeah, sure.

857
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,220
So if this is the goal, if this is the idea that we need people to care about Chris,

858
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,140
my biggest question about all this and what I would ask anyone involved,

859
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,300
anyone in the Gaines camp, I would say,

860
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,540
what happened to make it where, all right, we're going to make a movie.

861
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:53,940
We should probably have the biggest artist on the planet start being this guy,

862
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,620
appear as him on several shows, produce several full length specials,

863
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,580
and then the movie will come because by then it'll be Gaines mania.

864
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,060
Right.

865
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,660
So we'll have no problem getting that move, the lamb funding.

866
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,380
Right.

867
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,260
That doesn't seem like a good plan to me.

868
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,580
Like, what if that doesn't work and everyone's just confused

869
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
and they feel like they had their fill of Chris Gaines.

870
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,820
Of course everyone's going to be confused.

871
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,940
There had to be plenty of people around him going like, oh, shit.

872
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,340
This isn't going to, we can't.

873
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,860
Yeah, they must have known.

874
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:30,660
Because Garth seems like from what little I know about him, a little bit of a head case.

875
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,780
I think a little bit of an over thinker, a little bit of worried and self-conscious.

876
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:42,820
And I don't think that's maybe the mindset to go into completely changing your persona publicly.

877
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:48,420
You maybe want to have your own head on straight before you start being another person all the time.

878
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:48,900
Yeah.

879
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,260
Maybe you've got to look in the mirror and deal with that person in the mirror.

880
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,420
Yeah.

881
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,020
And maybe you should, if you're going to do it and put on a little costume,

882
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,780
you should have a sense of humor about it.

883
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,060
No, these are serious bangs.

884
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,460
Yeah.

885
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,700
His lack of sense of humor about it is a big runner.

886
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,580
Yes.

887
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,020
There are moments that are like, calm down, Garth.

888
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:17,060
The whole thing also, I feel like this entire thing took me as an observer who didn't listen

889
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,100
to his music from, all right, Garth Brooks seems like a good old boy country guy who knows what

890
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,900
he's doing in his field to, boy, Chris Gay, or I'm sorry, Garth Brooks is crazy.

891
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,380
As something that manifests to this day.

892
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,740
I don't think he ever shook the craziness.

893
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,540
And at this point, some of you might know either you guys or listeners might know that I

894
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,060
must play the video where he welcomed you to his Facebook.

895
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,260
Are you guys, is everyone familiar with this video?

896
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,620
Oh, I don't know if I am.

897
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,900
Oh my God.

898
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,220
Okay.

899
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,060
So I don't know when this happened.

900
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,620
This is later 2000s, earlier 2010s.

901
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,060
But when I saw this was going around and people were like, whoa, what's happening here?

902
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,340
And I'm like, this seems like classic Mr. Chris Gaines to me.

903
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,420
I love this clip.

904
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,380
I'm looking forward to this.

905
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,420
Well, I guess it's official.

906
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,580
We're now on Facebook.

907
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,340
I really wasn't sure about this at the start.

908
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,220
He's in bed, by the way.

909
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,700
A friend of mine said something that just made all kinds of sense.

910
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,420
She said, think of it more as a conversation.

911
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,340
I like that.

912
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,060
But I'm already finding out on my own.

913
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,700
So it's wiping the walls out between you and me.

914
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,740
And I really like that.

915
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,500
It allows us into each other's worlds, or I guess in my case, the hotel room.

916
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:38,820
When I think about things I want to post, I want to post cool stuff, slick stuff, neat stuff.

917
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,660
But most of the stuff I'm going to post is going to be raw stuff like this.

918
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,540
This is just who I am.

919
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,940
So if this is truly a conversation, then I say, let the conversation begin.

920
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,300
That's a word for word, one of the Joker's monologues in the Dark Knight.

921
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,660
When he's got the little camcorder.

922
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,780
If he has deep faked Joker makeup on to him,

923
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,980
this would be the most terrifying video because he's holding the camera himself.

924
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,340
It's so close.

925
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,180
It is uncomfortably intimate.

926
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,620
I like that.

927
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,300
I'm going to post raw stuff.

928
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,260
Raw stuff.

929
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,900
Raw stuff.

930
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
Oh, I like that.

931
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,420
Oh, the bat's going to like that.

932
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:24,260
That was a standby on the best show when Tom would do sound collages

933
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,020
and he still does sound collages.

934
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,460
And it would go like in and out, like horrifying.

935
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,540
It was a clip of Sweet Charity, like Hey Big Spender.

936
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,820
And then it would be that.

937
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,620
And then it would go into like, oh, God, what's the other?

938
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,060
Frankie Teardrop, the suicide song, Frankie Teardrop.

939
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,260
Which is like a scary punk song.

940
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,180
Frankie Teardrop.

941
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,660
Oh, okay.

942
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,780
20 year old Frankie.

943
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,140
It's very affecting in the context.

944
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,180
So just all of that looped with like other snippets of other songs.

945
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,780
And then just in the middle of it, just a snippet of the Garth Brooks.

946
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,980
It's just real, you know, it breaks down barriers.

947
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,700
Raw stuff.

948
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,340
Raw stuff.

949
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,140
Real stuff.

950
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,100
I like that.

951
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,340
This is just who I am.

952
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,100
Why is he singing like that?

953
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,860
Let the conversation begin.

954
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,780
I feel like there's maybe a lot of people.

955
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,420
I know this stuff is also a runner on Tom Segura's podcast, I believe.

956
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,980
They're all like, what is happening?

957
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,380
The insanity of Garth Brooks, I feel like, has only grown.

958
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,460
And truly, all of the clues.

959
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,220
Mr. Policeman, I gave you all the clues.

960
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,140
The Mr. Policeman had all the clues back in the.

961
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,940
He didn't have to show.

962
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:44,100
He could have just retired in 97 on top and not shown us all that he's nuts.

963
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,980
Yeah, just done a song for a movie every now and then.

964
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,480
I know.

965
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,620
Somewhere on Wikipedia or some website, it was like 2021.

966
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,100
It's like Garth Brooks is putting his music on digital.

967
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:03,220
And in 2023, I could not find anything that fast of a turnaround.

968
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,660
Geez, Garth could have done.

969
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,740
Garth could have just done with Billy Joel did.

970
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,820
Where Billy just plays live and nobody's.

971
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,740
No one is asking where's what's up with Billy Joel's new album.

972
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,240
Right.

973
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,300
And nobody wants nobody's like, what?

974
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
How come I can't see him on Instagram?

975
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,620
Where's his real stuff and raw stuff?

976
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,060
Where's Billy's raw stuff?

977
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,180
No slick stuff either.

978
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,020
Just concerts.

979
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,500
That's not what I want out of my rock artists.

980
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,660
Oh, conversation where the walls are down.

981
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:37,060
So what I can't decide whether I what I can't decide what to go into first is.

982
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,660
We got two specials here.

983
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,420
I don't know which way to approach it.

984
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:46,500
One is an NBC concert special called Garth Brooks in the Life of Chris Gaines,

985
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,420
which is the name of the album.

986
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:55,220
The other is the more mythology one, which is called Behind the Life of Chris Gaines.

987
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,580
This was on VH1.

988
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,260
This was a parody of Behind the Music done full tilt.

989
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,780
I say parody, but not it's not roles in spinal tap.

990
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,340
None of that.

991
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,740
Take that.

992
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,020
Take it seriously.

993
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,460
But it's all the trappings.

994
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,820
It's the interviews with the candles and the zooming in and out of the photos,

995
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,100
the actual voice of Behind the Music, Jim Forbes.

996
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,460
But they don't call it by music.

997
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:17,960
Right.

998
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,540
Is it more important to know about Chris or to get into?

999
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,020
Because the behind the music is much more about Chris and the NBC is the most

1000
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,100
like deep dive into the brain of Garth.

1001
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,420
Yeah.

1002
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,300
Only possible.

1003
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,620
Tell me again, what's the NBC thing?

1004
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,580
Because I didn't.

1005
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,860
It's OK.

1006
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,420
It's called it's called Garth.

1007
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,540
It's very simple, Jason.

1008
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,340
It's called Garth Brooks in the Life of Chris Gaines.

1009
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,380
And it's a content.

1010
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,580
It says Garth Brooks like you've never heard him before.

1011
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,620
So it's Garth Brooks performing songs by Chris Gaines, a fictional person who he's

1012
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,620
going to play in a movie, but he's otherwise spoken of as real.

1013
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:07,700
And Garth Brooks does not dress up as Chris Gaines, hence you've never heard him before.

1014
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:13,460
So it's just Garth Brooks doing Chris Gaines songs also with meandering interviews

1015
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,940
and the onstage monologues about the difference between Garth and Chris.

1016
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,340
I think we I think we need to learn about Chris first.

1017
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,540
I think so.

1018
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:25,940
We can.

1019
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,900
That's what I was going to say.

1020
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,780
OK, OK.

1021
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,780
As I say this, because this is this is also some of why it's haunted.

1022
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,980
I forgot about Chris.

1023
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,980
I would just bring up Chris Gaines every once in a while.

1024
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,420
I may have said this on the show once before.

1025
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,980
My favorite way that Chris Gaines came up in my life was early dating Aaron

1026
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,300
that we were in a long car ride and we'd passed the time playing 20 questions.

1027
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,580
And I like, you know, so guess a celebrity.

1028
00:44:50,580 --> 00:45:00,100
And I thought of Chris Gaines and I she got so angry and vexed as we went further and

1029
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,620
further down the rabbit hole because at some point she had to say, OK, hang on.

1030
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:08,020
It's a fictional character who's not from movies and TV.

1031
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,700
What is that?

1032
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,060
And then and then eventually after a long time, she's getting so mad and she's like,

1033
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,540
is this the fucking Garth Brooks thing?

1034
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,900
Like barely remember it.

1035
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,400
Yeah.

1036
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,700
He squealed like an idiot.

1037
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,820
She was very mad.

1038
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,060
So the tip for you, if you want to infuriate someone in your life, use Chris.

1039
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,220
It is impossible.

1040
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,020
By the way, everyone approaches anything and 20 questions.

1041
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,540
It's like impenetrable.

1042
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,740
So that's my little tip for you.

1043
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:45,940
But other than that, the main way that Chris Gaines lived in my head was this like a couple

1044
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:51,140
years ago, finally saw a clip from this NBC one that is just it might be I'm going to

1045
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,260
play what might be the longest clip I've ever played on the show.

1046
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,540
And I think it's important to see the entire thing.

1047
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,140
It's like it's a meltdown.

1048
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:05,540
So with that, I guess we talk about the VH1 special, which you watched the one and a half

1049
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,020
times.

1050
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,380
Yeah, headcanon of Garth of Garth for his character.

1051
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:09,780
Yes.

1052
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,100
Yeah.

1053
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,340
Yeah.

1054
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:17,700
And this is I feel like the VH1 special is a good example of a theme park connection to

1055
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,100
this.

1056
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:24,980
It's almost like if you if you go through the queue of a ride and you look up if there's

1057
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:31,540
a secret website for the rider, there's stuff in the gift shop or other parts in a land.

1058
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:37,700
If you pick a ride and you consume all the ancillary material, there's a whole additional

1059
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,500
story that you get in addition to the two to three minute ride.

1060
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,940
And some people like a little of that.

1061
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,900
Some people don't want any of that, don't really care.

1062
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:53,860
And so I feel like with Chris Gaines, you can listen to the album and know it's Garth

1063
00:46:53,860 --> 00:47:01,380
Brooks or you can learn all of this ancillary stuff, which is this behind the music fully

1064
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:07,140
available on Dailymotion, a podcasters best friend, Dailymotion and the Internet Archive.

1065
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,140
The Wild West.

1066
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,900
It's really something.

1067
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,180
Yeah.

1068
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:19,140
Thank God because otherwise VH1 wants us to forget anything they aired from 1989 to today.

1069
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,420
They want VH1 wants you to not know that they made anything.

1070
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:22,580
Right.

1071
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,060
So we need our Vimeos and our Dailymotions to pick them up for us.

1072
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:33,140
Well, yeah, I mean, so, you know, if you got the record, you get you know, you see some

1073
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,660
Chris backstory, you see some old photos, you see there's like a Cliff Notes version of his story.

1074
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,060
Sure.

1075
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,180
But in the special, the story is allowed to run free.

1076
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,620
Mike, you did not see this piece of material?

1077
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,900
I did not watch the VH1.

1078
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,500
I read the backstory, though.

1079
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:48,900
Oh, OK.

1080
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,740
I'll see you know a lot of this is.

1081
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,940
So you know everything.

1082
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,540
You know that Chris Gaines was born in Australia.

1083
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,020
Yeah.

1084
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,940
But moved at 10.

1085
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,500
So no accent that Garth has to do.

1086
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,140
Five.

1087
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,540
Yeah.

1088
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:01,780
OK.

1089
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,180
OK.

1090
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,900
Oh, he's trying.

1091
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,860
He's testing my back.

1092
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,340
Yeah, I know.

1093
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,840
Yeah.

1094
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,140
Making sure you are real gains.

1095
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:12,500
This is sort of like the Chris gave to his manager to get out of the cond when he realized

1096
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,460
he was being screwed.

1097
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,420
But that'll come.

1098
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,460
That'll come in time.

1099
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,820
Five makes a lot more sense.

1100
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:21,540
That is when you get it absolves Garth of the need to do an accent in this eventual movie.

1101
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:30,260
And, you know, I mean, look, my takeaway from his story and from the spine, the music,

1102
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,540
the story of Chris Gaines is so dramatic and fraught.

1103
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,980
I mean, for this guy to have lived what he's lived, you could see why Garth Brooks would

1104
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,620
want to sink his teeth into playing this character.

1105
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,540
I mean, can you imagine just, you know, I think we all felt pretty supported by our

1106
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,860
parents growing up to some extent.

1107
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:57,540
Can you imagine if your father, Gene Gaines, wanted you to follow in his footsteps and

1108
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,100
be an Olympic gold medalist like him?

1109
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,500
But you didn't want to do that.

1110
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,100
You wanted to play rock and roll.

1111
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:09,380
And so the only support you have is from your mother, Carol and John's gains.

1112
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,260
I mean, if like you and you want to be true, you need to be true to yourself.

1113
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:14,980
There's a person.

1114
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,100
There's a spirit waiting to explode out of you.

1115
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,340
And that spirit is not a gold medalist.

1116
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,300
Don't you dare make me win gold medal, dad.

1117
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,100
I'm not you.

1118
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:31,860
Was there a detail, too, of like his mother was also a medal in swimming and his father

1119
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,980
was her coach.

1120
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,420
And it's just like, oh, no.

1121
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,220
Oh, I see.

1122
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,580
Yeah, that doesn't feel good.

1123
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,500
Yeah, that's not a good recipe.

1124
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,060
Yeah.

1125
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,060
Well, you know, if when you add that in, now it becomes kind of an interesting story.

1126
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,260
I don't think they get into that.

1127
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,180
It seems like it was just a fine marriage.

1128
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,300
Yeah, no, they seem normal and they also seem relatively the same age.

1129
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:59,620
It feels like at every step that the Chris Gaines story could get a little weirder and

1130
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,260
darker, they just veer away into.

1131
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,100
But then he found his way into just making more hits and keep.

1132
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:11,620
And yet he was still sad because that's how we decided Garth will look in the pictures.

1133
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:19,540
Did anything else strike anyone about the tragic tale of Chris Gaines?

1134
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,040
Yeah.

1135
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,100
Hold on.

1136
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,520
I mean, so I deal the whole thing.

1137
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,320
I mean, yes, please.

1138
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,600
Oh, you know, it's important.

1139
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,880
Everybody should know that he did.

1140
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,720
He left Morningside High School to pursue his music professionally, although he did

1141
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,200
complete his GED in 1987.

1142
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,960
So if you're wondering the degree of education that Chris Gaines had, it's GED.

1143
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,320
I think the all the additional material to like fill out who Chris Gaines was,

1144
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,040
that he was when he first started out, he was in a three man group called Crush.

1145
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,560
And one of the other guys was the real front man.

1146
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,120
And that was the one who died in a plane crash.

1147
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,640
Yeah, Tommy Levitz.

1148
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,140
Yeah.

1149
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,600
It's the reals Morgz Borg of great, like nothing names.

1150
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,480
There's so many.

1151
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,960
And so then they go through great pains to go like, and Chris, he started working on

1152
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,440
the solo record and it was a huge hit.

1153
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,400
And we were all shocked that he could carry this himself because he was not the front

1154
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,120
man of Crush.

1155
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,160
It was the other guy.

1156
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:36,120
Tommy Levitz was the front man of Crush, not Chris Gaines and certainly not Mark Obed.

1157
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,640
Okay.

1158
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,000
Do you think like when they're putting this together, they're like thinking of like,

1159
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,280
okay, Dave Grohl now is in this Foo Fighters band.

1160
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,560
And no one knew, oh, Dave could front after being the drummer from Nirvana.

1161
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,680
That's a good comparison.

1162
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:53,960
Yeah.

1163
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,680
Or a little, the fact that it was kind of like a brightly colored band,

1164
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:05,080
it's maybe in the George Michael Wham zone a little bit too.

1165
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,480
Right.

1166
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:05,980
Yeah.

1167
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,480
He says like, in this one interview where he says, it seems like it's always that when

1168
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,560
there's the solo guy, it's like, you always hear about this band that they used to be

1169
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,440
in, you know, like there was always a band that they were in.

1170
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,680
I'm like, yeah, always.

1171
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:20,920
Sure.

1172
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,600
Hard to think of an example where that isn't the case.

1173
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,520
Like really close by, like in the same skin close by.

1174
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,240
Oh, wait.

1175
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,960
Yeah.

1176
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,520
Yeah.

1177
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:30,840
Wait.

1178
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,440
Well, that's what's allowing him to stretch, I guess, to be a guy who didn't start solo.

1179
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,080
He just, he, the thing that's different about Chris Gaines is he came out of the

1180
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,000
started with a band that had a smash hit immediately.

1181
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,480
Right.

1182
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,400
Then moved to a solo career where he also had smash hits immediately.

1183
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,280
Yeah.

1184
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,240
The other big thing that jumped out at me in this VH1 special is they go to great pains

1185
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:04,520
to describe that Chris Gaines has sex and not just that, he's a sex addict.

1186
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,240
A sex addict.

1187
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,480
Damn.

1188
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,240
He has a bad problem.

1189
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,920
Which is a bad problem.

1190
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,200
So much sex.

1191
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,840
He just couldn't turn it down.

1192
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:18,280
To the point that it starts affecting his music, like his second solo album, Fornicopia.

1193
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,320
Again, this doesn't-

1194
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,280
Fornicopia is the best thing in all of it.

1195
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:30,840
For the Fornicopia photo where he is kind of like, he looks like Clockwork Orange a

1196
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,840
little bit in his buller hat and his little like bob haircut.

1197
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,920
And he's like, he's staring at you, staring daggers at you while resting his hands just

1198
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,080
below a pair of boobs.

1199
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,640
There's a version of this where they actually like, he did his own like version of Darling

1200
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,600
Nikki or something.

1201
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,200
Which would have been more interesting than what we got.

1202
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,560
Is there any song that reflects the sex addict period, really?

1203
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,040
No, just interviews with his ex-girlfriends or his current girlfriend.

1204
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:08,360
And the one that really stuck out to me was the ex-girlfriend who was like, oh yeah, she

1205
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:15,560
said a lot of the stuff in this special, people say things that could have used another pass

1206
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,200
in scripting.

1207
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,080
Because it's like, Chris was a, well he was a bit of a womanizer.

1208
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:26,600
And like she says it so like with a smirk, like laughing.

1209
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,560
And it's like, that's a little of an intense way to put it.

1210
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,600
You said it in like a jolly way of like, well he was a bit of a ladies man.

1211
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,320
But they call him a womanizer.

1212
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,440
There's a part where, I don't know if it's the same part, but she says like, yeah, he's

1213
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,640
yeah, he was not so great with women.

1214
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,440
And I'm laughing, but I really shouldn't be because it was a serious problem.

1215
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,280
Why did you?

1216
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,600
Yeah.

1217
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,720
You just get another take on that.

1218
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,560
People awkwardly, you know, it's hard to say truth sometimes.

1219
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,280
It's hard to say.

1220
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,960
I'm a nervous laugher, I understand.

1221
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:04,680
And I feel like they a few times said like, Chris was getting famous on stage, but nearly

1222
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,840
as famous in these hotel rooms.

1223
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,640
And it's like, what the, what, what the fuck?

1224
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,600
What are you saying?

1225
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:16,440
It's the only in this story, it's the besides the car crash, which is like a real dark thing.

1226
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,120
Otherwise, look, as I said, the story of him seems to be he had a, he wanted to do music

1227
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,000
is dead and wanted to.

1228
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,280
So he said, I'll show you.

1229
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,520
He started a band and had a big hit and then went solo and then had big hits.

1230
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,880
And then, and every one of the albums was a huge hit.

1231
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,640
So like, what's the story here?

1232
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,560
Why is this guy this brooding?

1233
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,360
I don't understand what's, what is the meat of this story?

1234
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,080
It is making everyone make all of this material.

1235
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,800
The sex addict stuff is the only stuff that's like, okay, that's not in every rock star

1236
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,360
story.

1237
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,880
It's a little interesting.

1238
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,760
What might've helped is if they talked to anyone who is a sex addict, because it all

1239
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,320
feels like it's like, what's what I would guess.

1240
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,640
So it's like, I like, there's nothing specific here.

1241
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:03,080
It's just at some point, somebody says like, boy, he'd do all kinds of weird combos.

1242
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:08,840
Two women, three women, four women, huh?

1243
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,200
Whoa, that's weird.

1244
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,480
That and also never, never, obviously never.

1245
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,880
I know this is a country star in 1999.

1246
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,840
There is never any thought given to that.

1247
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,320
Someone who is not a woman would be caught.

1248
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,360
It called sure.

1249
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,160
Oh, no.

1250
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,960
World of sex.

1251
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,440
The day certainly look, look, I was crazy.

1252
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,480
I wasn't that crazy.

1253
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,120
Okay.

1254
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,720
There was no Mick Jagger, David Bowie type rumor for Chris Gaines.

1255
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,760
I don't believe so.

1256
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,360
Like Chris, Chris sucked Jacob Dillon's dick or something.

1257
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:43,480
Jacob Dillon, Rob Thomas, Steven Jenkins and Chris Gaines were just fucking like crazy.

1258
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:43,980
Whoa.

1259
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,040
In a hotel room in 1997.

1260
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,320
They did a big square.

1261
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,040
They did a human.

1262
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,880
I didn't at one point.

1263
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,720
God, I don't even I have the fuzziest memory, but I believe I did a big square.

1264
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,880
Oh, I think Steven Jenkins was there.

1265
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,920
Maybe look, I don't I'm sorry.

1266
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,000
I don't remember his name, but Mr. Fastball.

1267
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,760
Maybe he was just watching.

1268
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,600
Mr. Fastball's like Mark.

1269
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,560
I can't remember.

1270
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,520
I'm sorry.

1271
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,400
Mr. Fastball.

1272
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,440
The fastball.

1273
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:16,040
There's also also speaking of they want Chris Gaines isn't doing any fastballs.

1274
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,320
He's not doing any drugs.

1275
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:17,800
No, no, no.

1276
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,680
Drugs are not drugs.

1277
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,240
Drugs don't enter.

1278
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,480
Maybe that's why maybe he chose sex because he's like, well, look, hey, Garth still got

1279
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,920
to be big with the kids, right?

1280
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,200
So I can't be saying even fake that I drank a lot, did a lot of drugs.

1281
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,080
Sex is fine.

1282
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,840
I'll tell my 12 year old friends I had lots of sex pretty long.

1283
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,640
It's with women.

1284
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,400
Women make it only women.

1285
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,440
Look, I want to watch all the footage of all the other interviewees.

1286
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,000
And if one of them said even in footage we don't use, Chris Gaines had sex with one man,

1287
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,320
and just kill, strike it, fire them.

1288
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,520
No way.

1289
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,480
Kiss them out of town.

1290
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,000
I will never have this said.

1291
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,600
And in the VH1 Behind the Music, communicate that with a montage of Chris Gaines in a parade

1292
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,560
of women kind of in corners pressing their foreheads into each other.

1293
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,640
Like it's just a lot of that canoodling.

1294
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,620
Never.

1295
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,440
He refused to.

1296
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,480
Look, I know this is all just for pretend, but I am married, so I'm not going to do any fake kissing.

1297
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,360
You can leave that to the kid on the fornicopia cover.

1298
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:20,440
I like the detail that his manager took advantage of him, but then he also had sex with her.

1299
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:23,800
Excuse me.

1300
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,280
Yeah, yeah.

1301
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,640
I said it was confusing what I just said.

1302
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,880
Stole his money, but then it was complicated by the fact that they had sex.

1303
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,120
Right.

1304
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,240
Because he was sex addict.

1305
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,120
Because he was sex addict.

1306
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:32,280
Right.

1307
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,280
So then you mean, sorry, you mean his manager, Roma Steele?

1308
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,320
Yeah.

1309
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,120
Steele.

1310
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,040
Who is not apologetic.

1311
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,680
She exclaims like I made Chris Gaines.

1312
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,960
I made him what he is.

1313
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,840
She's just in it.

1314
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,200
She's just in the interview.

1315
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,080
Yeah, she's happy to talk about any of it on the record.

1316
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:55,560
There's even the moment where he finds out that the house he's living in is actually in Roma Steele's name.

1317
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,680
And they let Chris improvise on this point.

1318
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:04,280
Let me to find out that the house that you're in is not the house of your name.

1319
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,920
This, oh, I mean, it was tough.

1320
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,400
Like he.

1321
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,240
None of the Chris.

1322
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,760
None of the interviews do any good towards convincing you that Chris Brooks can carry a

1323
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,040
traumatic feeling.

1324
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,960
I'm so like, I'm getting tired of this.

1325
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,560
This is me, by the way.

1326
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:26,200
My capacity for absorbing crap is sky high, but I'm halfway through this.

1327
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,320
I checked the time at some point in this behind the music and like, oh, it's only halfway.

1328
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,960
You're kidding.

1329
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,040
Who was going to see this and go sign me up?

1330
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,000
Two hour film of Chris Gaines.

1331
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,800
Many people.

1332
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:44,280
The the checking the check marks, like check the boxes of rock and roll story.

1333
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,880
Manager takes advantage.

1334
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:52,760
They also in explaining the sex addiction, which is a lot of this, a lot of the rest of it is about,

1335
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:58,200
like, he was in a horrific car crash, had to get his face repaired, and he just couldn't get used to that face.

1336
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:05,560
But the sex addict stuff is justified by, like, eventually after professional help, I discovered

1337
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,280
it's because I never quite had a good relationship with my father.

1338
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:16,040
And it's like, okay, you're like, you're like, I never got to tell him I was right.

1339
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,160
He was wrong.

1340
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,360
You know, okay, I guess I guess that's how addiction works.

1341
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:28,600
So I'm like, you're dealing I know sex addiction is hard, but is it as hard as your father,

1342
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,080
Jean, insisting that you win gold medals the whole time?

1343
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,160
He's he's getting gold records.

1344
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,920
It's well, it's very similar.

1345
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,840
It's probably the same amount of gold just melted down, like spread further.

1346
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,040
It's still round.

1347
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,640
I mean, we should have said I'm winning.

1348
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,720
I'm winning gold round.

1349
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,520
Dad, I'm stuck with gold rounds.

1350
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,720
He didn't know about them.

1351
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,920
Rona was taking them off.

1352
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,680
Oh, yeah, he wasn't getting the money.

1353
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,960
They probably weren't giving him the record.

1354
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,720
Probably Roma Steele was stealing the gold for herself and turning it into fancy jewelry.

1355
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:06,040
He makes a comment about like making half a million dollars or a million dollars.

1356
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:11,240
And the delivery of the line makes it unclear of like, is that when he knew something was wrong?

1357
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,080
Or is that when he knew like, I'm at the top of the game?

1358
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,320
Like, it could go either way.

1359
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,760
And I wasn't really sure.

1360
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,560
I don't know to talk about the dad stuff again, too.

1361
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:29,800
At some point, it's like, and he got the news that no son wanted to hear his father had cancer.

1362
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,960
And like, again, Kay, fine.

1363
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,920
But like, why is this?

1364
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:37,400
How is this story so singular and interesting?

1365
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,360
Why he had he wanted to do something early and then decided to do something else.

1366
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:46,760
And his dad got cancer and he had some money troubles.

1367
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:52,280
What is there's nothing in the Chris Gaines story that's proprietary.

1368
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,400
Like, you know what I mean?

1369
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,720
Like, what is going to make the lamb so great?

1370
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,720
Like, well, I need him to be addicted to a really specific.

1371
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:06,360
Drug or have like a really like, really like only him mental illness or something.

1372
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,000
I just don't know.

1373
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,500
Promise.

1374
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:15,240
The problem is, is that like you can't if you're taking it seriously, then you can't.

1375
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,240
First of all, they did already put in the funniest thing by making his father want him to win gold

1376
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:19,560
medals.

1377
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,440
That's more of a funny premise than anything else.

1378
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,400
So silly.

1379
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,200
But everything else is like the medals there.

1380
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,000
Everything else is like they can't get.

1381
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,560
Garth is too worried about getting too real with the actual outcomes of sex addiction or

1382
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,320
cancer or whatever.

1383
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,160
He doesn't actually want to go there.

1384
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:44,200
Then you're right in the way that an actor, a real actor would be excited to go there

1385
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,640
and to process their own trauma and experiences and run them through this lens of this character.

1386
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,680
And I went somewhere and it was really hard, but it paid off in the point.

1387
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,080
He wants to put on a wig and have a different name.

1388
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,840
Yeah, he doesn't want this.

1389
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,560
You're right.

1390
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:57,960
He does.

1391
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,120
He can't go there.

1392
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,400
He wants to play dress up.

1393
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,440
He wants to play dress up.

1394
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,800
He says, this ain't my hair.

1395
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,760
He's feeling worried.

1396
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,960
He's pants with his Garth.

1397
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:13,720
But he wants to use a real like Chris Gaines is a human's name, but the backstory is so

1398
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,280
cartoonishly like hack.

1399
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,560
He may as well just be called Johnny Rockstar.

1400
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,520
I would like it a lot more.

1401
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,360
It can't.

1402
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,400
Yeah, he can't.

1403
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,720
I mean, first of all, sex addiction for a fictional character, it's hard not to even

1404
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,600
make that comedic.

1405
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,640
I think in some way that's probably not true.

1406
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,360
But well, maybe with the right is games.

1407
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,960
It's are impossible, especially because there's at one point they cut to like some guy who

1408
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,880
was in his little posse or whatever at the time.

1409
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:51,560
And he's like shaking his head like, oh man, everywhere he went, he had babes.

1410
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,600
If it was sex, they're right.

1411
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:59,320
They call it playing is like he the lion got fuzzy between.

1412
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,040
It's like he couldn't see the humanity of a babe.

1413
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,160
He saw he looked in a babe's eyes and he saw nothing.

1414
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,640
He didn't know that that babe was a daughter or a mother and father.

1415
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,560
He just he just saw babes were like mannequins to him.

1416
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,360
Here's another.

1417
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,480
Here's a theory.

1418
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,320
All of this stuff is stuff Garth wants the public to think about in relation to him.

1419
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,280
If I'm playing psychologist, Garth wants people to know.

1420
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,240
He fucked.

1421
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,400
Yeah, yeah, that's that.

1422
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,160
And they've set calling sex addiction that makes it seem less gross that he would be

1423
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,880
sort of braggy about it because you can at least make it seem like an issue versus

1424
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,440
just a perk of being a very famous rich guy.

1425
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:38,920
Sure.

1426
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,400
Oh, no.

1427
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,040
What's this?

1428
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,080
Oh, you found more photos of me with babes.

1429
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,720
No, I don't want those out there.

1430
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,600
Oh, shoot.

1431
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,880
This interview is over.

1432
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,120
He stands up as a manila folder.

1433
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,400
Oh, no.

1434
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:58,520
Well, when I have these 210 photos of me with different babes, sometimes two or three or

1435
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,400
even four at a time, please don't look at these.

1436
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,560
No, and that one over there is not me and eagle eye cherry together.

1437
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,400
Imagine the photos.

1438
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,320
Imagine the photo of me and babes.

1439
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,880
I was wearing a black Henley, not a really start shirt and really start jeans and a

1440
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,160
starch 10 gallon hat.

1441
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:19,880
So, yeah.

1442
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,960
Me and all the boys know.

1443
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,320
Yeah, that's tell Bachman jerking off in the window.

1444
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,640
People aren't ready to see me on the tour bus with Chumbo Wumbo.

1445
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,840
I thought it was a babe.

1446
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,440
I didn't know it was Duncan Sheik.

1447
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,960
I mean, I would like just the rest of this to be this game.

1448
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1449
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,560
Can I eat them enough?

1450
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,560
That the band or the guy, I don't know.

1451
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,320
Anyone younger than us is going to be lost.

1452
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,960
You must go through the pieces and listen to every one of these important artists.

1453
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,120
Uh, uh, what, what else?

1454
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:14,440
All right.

1455
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,800
We covered, oh, you know what?

1456
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,120
If you were worried, he worked at, he dropped Roma steel and he got with Dan Lanier.

1457
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,920
So he is a better manager, Dan Lanier.

1458
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,400
Yeah.

1459
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,400
And they're never going to have sex because Dan Lanier is a boy, not a baby.

1460
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,920
Chris Gaines is too straight.

1461
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,320
He would never, never Dan Lanier.

1462
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,680
Unisexual.

1463
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:40,680
Chris Gaines also like he's got some famous friends or at least famous people he's worked with.

1464
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,400
Of course.

1465
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,640
Who have a lot to say about him.

1466
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:48,440
A lot to say about him, like multiple appearances in this behind the music.

1467
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,240
Well, I mean, who's the, who are you the most excited about?

1468
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,240
Uh, well, the one I was most surprised to see and hear a lot was Billy Joel.

1469
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,360
Yeah, he's Billy Joel acting.

1470
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,120
It seems like they got a good, uh, seven minutes with him.

1471
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,280
They kind of, they kind of told him what was going on.

1472
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,920
So now the guy's in a car wreck.

1473
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,640
Okay.

1474
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,160
Yeah, boy, we were worried.

1475
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,840
I remember when we got the call.

1476
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,680
Oh boy, we were so worried.

1477
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,040
All right now, now Billy, he really likes babes.

1478
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:16,840
So can you incorporate?

1479
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,720
Oh yeah.

1480
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,120
When he was in the, when he was in the wreck, I thought he'd never bang a babe again.

1481
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,680
Is that good?

1482
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,480
Are we done?

1483
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,440
Yeah, we just got a second.

1484
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:24,760
Nope.

1485
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,080
Nope.

1486
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:25,560
So long.

1487
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,880
Billy Joel says, uh, I guess for plausible deniability, um, he says,

1488
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:38,360
we were on tour in Beijing and we heard about the accident and we didn't know whether he was dead or alive.

1489
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,760
It was just like, what?

1490
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,480
He's better Intel.

1491
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:43,720
Yeah.

1492
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,200
I know you're in Beijing, but somebody could give you the,

1493
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,320
somebody can give you more trustworthy info, Billy.

1494
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,760
Guys, you can put this on boards.

1495
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,560
You can put this on poster board and he could just read off.

1496
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,640
Like you can write the script on a big board.

1497
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,800
I feel like now this has been around this genre of musician doing a fake interview

1498
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,760
that plays that most musicians now have done these.

1499
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,080
Sure.

1500
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,280
Various like the muppet, that new muppets thing.

1501
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,520
There's a bunch of similar thing.

1502
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,400
Country bears.

1503
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,280
Country bears.

1504
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,960
It's a real easy way to plug in and you, because they don't have to stretch at all.

1505
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,920
They're playing themselves.

1506
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,320
Yeah.

1507
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,440
So you're describing somebody who was the biggest star in the world and they go, oh man,

1508
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,960
ah, they're the biggest star in the world.

1509
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,320
When I first heard their music, I was like, oh, bang.

1510
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,120
Loved it.

1511
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:26,600
All right, great.

1512
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,080
That's all you need.

1513
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:27,720
Good.

1514
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,240
Dave Grohl probably knocks 10 of these out in one afternoon.

1515
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,360
He goes back and forth between parody and real thing.

1516
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,320
Doesn't miss a beat.

1517
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,200
You're like, this is about a country bear.

1518
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:38,600
Got it.

1519
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,080
Great.

1520
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:39,320
Okay.

1521
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,440
He's a rockin' guy.

1522
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:40,680
All right.

1523
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,720
This one's about Ringo.

1524
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,040
Okay.

1525
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,400
He's a rockin' drummer.

1526
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,640
Like it just doesn't matter back and forth wildly between genres.

1527
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,480
Dave Grohl, you know, Prince had the recording studio in his house so he could record any

1528
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,840
he could record in the bathroom.

1529
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,840
This is like Dave Grohl with cameos.

1530
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,680
He could use some of the equipment to record music and he does from time to time,

1531
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,000
but Dave Grohl's bread and butter is cameos.

1532
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,320
Cameos.

1533
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,840
He needs to be able to, he's like cooking an egg for his kid.

1534
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,480
Oh, shit.

1535
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,200
Cam, I forgot.

1536
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,400
It turned to the left.

1537
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,520
Nine cameos today.

1538
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,600
All he has to do is like clap.

1539
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,400
It's like the clapper.

1540
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,840
It's just hand activated.

1541
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,280
There's a camera in every cupboard.

1542
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,840
Oh, there's a new rockadoodle that we need Dave Grohl to do a little bit in where he

1543
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,440
talks about rockadoodle.

1544
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,560
Oh, shot declare?

1545
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,680
Oh, man.

1546
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,520
We all wanted to be shot declare.

1547
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,160
Got it.

1548
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:27,400
Done.

1549
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:28,840
Cut, print.

1550
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,080
Dave goes back to making the food.

1551
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:31,880
You'd be in the movie.

1552
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,320
There's barbecue, by the way, he barbecues straight to video movie rock puppy.

1553
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,240
We just need you for just need three seconds.

1554
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,760
Just establish the puppy is the biggest rock puppy there is tight.

1555
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,360
Love it.

1556
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:42,600
Fun.

1557
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,320
This is so fun.

1558
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,320
Keep calling.

1559
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,040
Please call me again.

1560
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:46,920
I love being in your stuff.

1561
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,480
You also.

1562
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:49,880
Oh, wait.

1563
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,680
And then you also get you.

1564
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:55,720
Well, you get a lot of Don was my man continues to haunt the show producer.

1565
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:59,080
Don was he was on stage just with this Willie Nelson tribute at the Hollywood

1566
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,440
Bowl a couple of weeks ago.

1567
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:00,760
Okay.

1568
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,680
I think he's like a less famous girl.

1569
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,160
He's a girl.

1570
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:03,960
You don't realize.

1571
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,280
Yeah.

1572
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,920
Yeah.

1573
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,920
If you if you keep your eyes out for Don was he's going to see him everywhere.

1574
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,840
Man, it was very strange facial error.

1575
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:15,480
A name I know as a reference point and then came up on the walk like a diet.

1576
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,160
Everybody do the dinosaur.

1577
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,000
Yes, that's right.

1578
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,880
Because that was him.

1579
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,440
His band was not was right.

1580
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:22,840
Yeah.

1581
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,160
Okay.

1582
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,560
And he actually did produce a lot of this stuff.

1583
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:36,600
So, Mike, are you disappointed that your producer hero Don was because of so much boring?

1584
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,080
Maroon.

1585
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,080
Well, no, I'm not.

1586
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,920
It's not his fault.

1587
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,200
It's not Don's fault.

1588
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,800
Some of the songs I don't think you have you heard a little bit more.

1589
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,840
I'm roughly familiar.

1590
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,840
A lot of the songs are peppered throughout behind the life of Chris Gaines that I think

1591
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,520
have things in them that you would like, but they're not good songs.

1592
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:01,080
I don't mind the song that he played on SNL way of the girl.

1593
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,880
I think the song way of the girl is okay.

1594
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,480
I think way of the girl is bad.

1595
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,600
Okay, that's fine.

1596
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,720
But I think I would not.

1597
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:12,120
And that's the end of this fight because I'm not going to the mat for way of the girl.

1598
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,840
I'm just saying if I'm looking for something, I don't find abhorrent.

1599
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,760
But there's a couple other there's a maybe I'm crazy, but there's a very like Steely Danish

1600
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,880
one there at the end of the album.

1601
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,440
Okay.

1602
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,480
I know there's little things in there.

1603
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:30,920
You can tell me that I'm going to be viewing it under the harshest microscope.

1604
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,240
I know.

1605
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,760
I even know that's been said.

1606
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,360
I winced at saying it coming out of my mouth because I could be wrong.

1607
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:43,400
But just so we're clear, Don was produced a lot of the actual Chris Gaines stuff that you can

1608
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:44,760
get a hold of.

1609
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,880
It takes a little work.

1610
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,680
But in storyline, he produced some of the fictional Chris Gaines.

1611
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,560
That's a good point.

1612
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:51,960
Yes.

1613
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,400
In this world, he produced the full albums.

1614
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:01,960
Fornicopeia, straight jacket, apostle triangle.

1615
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,960
Those don't exist, but there is an album called Chris Gaines Greatest Hits,

1616
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:13,000
which is also referred to, I believe as Garth Brooks in the life of Chris.

1617
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,040
That album that is real has multiple names.

1618
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,400
Oh, in the special, they refer to it as Chris Gaines Greatest Hits.

1619
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,840
They don't acknowledge the cover.

1620
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,480
This is an image.

1621
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,720
There's an image collage of all the fake Chris Gaines album and the one real Chris Gaines

1622
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,280
album because there is an eight or nine episode podcast about all this.

1623
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:38,200
I think from a country music, here is the lens.

1624
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,040
We're looking at Garth Brooks' actual career and where Chris Gaines falls into it.

1625
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,960
Not from a theme park podcast perspective.

1626
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,080
No, not from a...

1627
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,320
I think what we can bring to the table that's very crucial.

1628
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,640
This is a pop culture ghost that haunts us sort of thing.

1629
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,800
What year did Fornicopeia come out?

1630
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,720
94, I believe.

1631
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,440
94.

1632
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,560
I'm trying to think of how...

1633
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,440
I'm sorry, 91.

1634
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,000
91.

1635
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,720
91.

1636
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,360
Actually, that's better.

1637
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,320
I'm such a fool.

1638
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,600
The closer it is to the 80s, I think I like it in concept more.

1639
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,360
You know when it starts to...

1640
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,840
It feels a little equivalent maybe to Inexcess.

1641
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,080
And actually, his look on the album cover of straight jacket

1642
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,120
feels...

1643
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:19,240
His hair seems like Michael Hutchins.

1644
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:19,800
Yeah.

1645
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,720
But the vibe of the cover otherwise, which is very bright and has several sexy nurses

1646
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,600
trying to fuck him even though he's in a straight jacket.

1647
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,040
What a conundrum.

1648
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,560
We've all been there.

1649
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,720
You don't know how to get their straight jacket off.

1650
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:40,440
But this cover is extremely enema of the state.

1651
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:40,920
Yeah, it's true.

1652
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,960
Despite being in the in universe, it's from 89 and he looks like Michael Hutchins.

1653
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:46,760
Yeah, that's true.

1654
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,320
Sexy leather nurses are definitely...

1655
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,920
That's covered by Blink.

1656
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:58,200
I made four fake McGruff songs, but is the most niche bit possible to actually just write

1657
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,800
the full Fornicopeia album?

1658
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:01,740
Wow.

1659
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,180
Yeah.

1660
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,680
That's extremely...

1661
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,000
That's the most niche thing I've ever thought.

1662
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,560
Yeah.

1663
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,200
I mean, that's...

1664
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,640
I'm into it, but even I probably don't finish listening to it.

1665
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,280
I know.

1666
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,800
I would you want to listen to all of it.

1667
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,280
Wow.

1668
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,640
Somebody did Fornicopeia.

1669
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,400
Are you going to do it?

1670
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,600
Are you going to try to put on your own inner Don Waas hat?

1671
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,680
I like the end concept.

1672
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,560
I like the idea.

1673
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,120
I love the cover of Fornicopeia.

1674
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,800
I would like to see...

1675
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,920
I would say don't abide by the rules that you think would heat with the boring music.

1676
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,320
Well, that's...

1677
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:33,960
That would be...

1678
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,880
Try to really imagine what the neon pink and the clockwork orange vibe...

1679
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,760
What Fornicopeia is in your heart based on this cover?

1680
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,840
I mean, I would certainly go off 1991.

1681
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,600
I would try to like...

1682
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,080
It would have to be really dirty.

1683
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,640
It would have to be a disgusting album.

1684
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,600
Sorry to say, yes.

1685
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,680
It's naughty by nature or something.

1686
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,120
Yeah.

1687
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:02,920
Also, to put this into perspective, being a sex addict in the middle of the AIDS epidemic,

1688
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,360
that's kind of a rough time to be a sex addict.

1689
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,000
Did they say what years it was that he was a sex addict?

1690
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,480
Well, it's like we're talking like 90s.

1691
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,920
We're talking early 90s.

1692
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:13,960
That's still going on.

1693
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,240
Yeah.

1694
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:15,880
So I'm just...

1695
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,480
It's an odd time.

1696
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,680
That's much too interesting for the life of Chris Gaines.

1697
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,160
Right.

1698
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,640
Yeah.

1699
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,600
Now, that's something.

1700
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,360
If there's AIDS in the story, now we have something to work with in The Lamb.

1701
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,800
That's a genuinely dramatic instead.

1702
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,000
Just like too much reality.

1703
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,560
Babes.

1704
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,920
Oh, boy.

1705
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:31,560
One time...

1706
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,000
I have to...

1707
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,200
I was like, uh-oh, I feel an itch down there.

1708
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,560
Do I have a disease?

1709
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,560
But then I just been bitten near my crotch by a spider.

1710
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,560
Turned out I was fine.

1711
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,000
Peed into a cup, all good.

1712
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,960
So then I went back into ease my jangled nerves.

1713
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,560
I had sex with more babes.

1714
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,760
Oh, I couldn't stop.

1715
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,840
It is very much.

1716
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,240
It's not even as good as stuff in rock stars books.

1717
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:01,320
Sammy Hagar is like, it was the encore and I went down there and there were 10 women and this.

1718
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,440
And they had set the...

1719
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,640
There's explanation.

1720
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,840
There's nothing even remotely close to that level.

1721
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:12,280
The level of Sammy Hagar bragging about getting together with ladies during a concert.

1722
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,680
No, because they didn't do anything that could have made this interesting.

1723
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,720
I hope that the screen...

1724
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:22,840
I hope that Jeb Stuart was ready to try to make Chris more interesting than...

1725
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,200
Probably.

1726
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,720
This is the most PG...

1727
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,040
I bet there was the calculation too of like, I have...

1728
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,680
My fans are kids.

1729
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,280
He must have laid...

1730
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,520
If he's thinking my fans are kids, sex addict is not in there.

1731
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,160
That's the one thing.

1732
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,160
Maybe we're more like PG-13 then because the sex addiction is never...

1733
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,160
You don't hear one specific word.

1734
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,320
You don't hear the words penis or vagina.

1735
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,160
It is the most generic.

1736
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,040
The most specific story you ever get is from a woman who's like,

1737
01:16:54,040 --> 01:17:00,120
then Chris said maybe he and I should have sex and with also my sister.

1738
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,640
And it was then I knew that he had a problem.

1739
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:06,920
This is as creative as we can get here.

1740
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,600
And then it doesn't happen also.

1741
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:16,280
It is very much like a high school sophomore trying to write a letter to like penthouse four.

1742
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:22,600
Like, dear penthouse four, I've had sex with any number of women.

1743
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,360
You know, whole school bus fault.

1744
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,640
Maybe, and maybe this is maybe I was wrong earlier.

1745
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,680
Maybe Garth has only had sex with like his wife.

1746
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,680
I think maybe that is maybe he didn't have sex with anyone on tour.

1747
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,600
This does not come from a place.

1748
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,480
His first wife needs us to know that he's straight.

1749
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:44,520
However, yeah, I don't know that I don't think he's like the 40 year old virgin.

1750
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:51,880
When he does sound like touching a bag of sand, he's pretty like what he thinks that is on tour.

1751
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:52,200
Yeah.

1752
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:52,520
Yeah.

1753
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,680
What he thinks having sex in a debaucherous ways is.

1754
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:02,280
Doing something perverse like taking your Hanes undershirt off and leaving the lights on.

1755
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:10,200
You say that and now and on my screen, please allow me to show you a sexy photo of Chris

1756
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:14,440
Gaines lying chest down on his bed wearing a Hanes undershirt.

1757
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:14,920
Perfect.

1758
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,400
Man.

1759
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:15,800
Perfect.

1760
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,120
With the most eyeliner I've seen in any of the photos and he's kind of looking to the side all coy.

1761
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,400
Here we're committing a little harder here.

1762
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,120
And then here's one where he's in like a striped shirt.

1763
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,640
He's making a diamond with.

1764
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:31,960
Oh, he wears a ring by the way, in memory of Tommy Levitt.

1765
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,960
He's dressed like a mime in that photo.

1766
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,240
Like he's got the striped black and white shirt.

1767
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,840
What kind of music is Chris Gaines?

1768
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,160
Well, he's kind of like Nuvo mime core.

1769
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:41,800
Mime core.

1770
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:49,560
But then this one, I showed this one to Erin and she was as upset as when this came up in 20 questions.

1771
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,520
Look at this picture.

1772
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,760
There's no, I'm just going to have to post it.

1773
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,920
You'll know it's this picture if you see it.

1774
01:18:54,920 --> 01:19:00,440
But he's just like, he's bailing on the whole thing that Chris Gaines is like a wispy gothy guy.

1775
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,640
And now he's just like shoulders, big arm muscles.

1776
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,160
I'm Chris and I'm Jack.

1777
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,640
You look at my armpit hair.

1778
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,040
If I was squinting, I would say that's Chris Angel.

1779
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,880
I would say, I was thinking he looks a little Tommy Lee.

1780
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,560
Well, oh yes, Tommy Lee as well.

1781
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,960
That hair specifically.

1782
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,440
Yeah.

1783
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,000
That rocker hair that Chris has, which is.

1784
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,560
The photos are tremendous.

1785
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:27,240
My other favorite one is this one where again, we're back to mime core.

1786
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:30,680
Here's one where he's wearing black and white pants.

1787
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,320
Oh my God.

1788
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,440
Like Jod Hopper.

1789
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,000
That's interesting.

1790
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,240
Like a jester or a Harlequin.

1791
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:35,800
That's right.

1792
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,360
Yeah.

1793
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,000
Yeah.

1794
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
He looks like, I feel like there's something I'm picturing where somebody is trying to be

1795
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,720
camouflaged in a black and white environment.

1796
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:48,040
And then like, you know, you can't see there's a person there and then they like peel themselves out of the space.

1797
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:48,360
Right.

1798
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:55,400
He looks like he's in like maybe an earlier version of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.

1799
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:56,520
Yeah.

1800
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:03,320
Halloween Horror Nights had a human chessboard that year and the scare actors would come out

1801
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,400
from the walls because they were in all black and white.

1802
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,080
All of this has to go through him.

1803
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,000
He is choosing to do all this.

1804
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,480
So I almost, and a lot of this, I just feel bad.

1805
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,160
There's something hidden inside him that wants to come out.

1806
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,680
And I'm not saying anything specific, even more than just like he wants to wear

1807
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,800
jester pants on tour.

1808
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,920
And why can't Garth Brooks come out and greet his fans wearing jester pants and a mime shirt?

1809
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:29,480
He should.

1810
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:29,640
Yeah.

1811
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,960
It was all mental roadblocks.

1812
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,480
He could have done this.

1813
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,520
He would have found a new it.

1814
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,720
Now there is a roadmap.

1815
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,920
Now people do crossover, but there wasn't this then.

1816
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:44,280
And I don't think he felt like brave enough or comfortable enough to wear the pants that he wanted to wear.

1817
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,720
Yes, I feel he's very, he's very locked up.

1818
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,160
He's in a mental prison.

1819
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:54,040
And I feel like unless there's more details from the VH1 special, what you've just said

1820
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:59,880
is a perfect reason to now switch to the NBC special because you haven't seen any of this.

1821
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,080
I have not seen any of this.

1822
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,960
You have no idea how true what you just said is.

1823
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,600
Yeah.

1824
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:11,560
This special, this is for, okay, this might be one of the most revealing pieces of material

1825
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,680
with a major performer or the major rock star.

1826
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,000
Yeah.

1827
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,120
You know, I mean, sure, it seems like something like truth or dare is more like, oh, we're seeing

1828
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,680
our world.

1829
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,840
Madonna's getting like nasty.

1830
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:28,680
And but like for the real shit, you got to go to Garth Brooks in the life of Chris Gaines.

1831
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,080
And I say that now that I've said that, let me say that I skipped half of the special because

1832
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,080
it was just Chris Gaines songs that are boring.

1833
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:35,720
Yeah.

1834
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,920
That's not what matters.

1835
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,680
What matters is everything in between.

1836
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:45,160
So, all right, this special, the VH1 special we just talked about, you can see there's one

1837
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:48,280
good thing you can say about it, which is that it does the K fave.

1838
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,880
It's committed to it.

1839
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,280
Yeah.

1840
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:56,600
The name Garth Brooks doesn't appear until the end when he has an executive producer credit.

1841
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,440
Nobody in the special ever says he resembles Garth Brooks or you don't see Garth Brooks

1842
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,360
saying like he was a big influence on me.

1843
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:06,920
They fully, so if you were watching, I could see there's maybe a little bit of a Tony

1844
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,160
Clifton thing here where if you're just bored watching VH1 and you're like, what's up with

1845
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,520
this? And isn't that Garth Brooks?

1846
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,000
And like the VH1 special is like successful in that regard committed.

1847
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:17,240
Right.

1848
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,120
Then, but that's, that's cable, right?

1849
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:26,040
You could be weirder on cable for the NBC platform, you know, where we're probably more

1850
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,160
of his audiences.

1851
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:27,800
He cares.

1852
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,280
He cares.

1853
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,320
Who's watching.

1854
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:34,440
This is the most hedging of bets special humanly possible.

1855
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:41,160
This gets so convoluted as he tries to like beg and plead with us to keep watching, not

1856
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,840
leave, say how it's not really that different.

1857
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:49,320
It's especially that starts and says Garth Brooks, like you've never heard him before.

1858
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,680
Almost immediately.

1859
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,840
He's like, you've kind of heard me like this before.

1860
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,040
It's really not different.

1861
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,440
It's like you've heard me before, but a little bit a new way of hearing me.

1862
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,040
But you'll come to find that it's kind of like you've always heard me, but a new way

1863
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,000
of hearing me.

1864
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,640
It's I will just let it speak for itself from here on out.

1865
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,600
But so all right here.

1866
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:19,000
So he performs a song and then we get into an interview portion and, you know, feel free

1867
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,040
to stop it whenever you have something to comment on.

1868
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:26,680
I mean, this is the year that I get my chance to play a character in a movie, actually a

1869
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,640
fictitious rock legend that has existed over the last 15 years by the name of Chris Gaines.

1870
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,200
This is his music and the same breath.

1871
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,240
It's my music.

1872
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:41,000
What you're about to see is going to is going to be a little different for me.

1873
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,520
It's very different for me to even see it.

1874
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,240
I can understand the people that are diehard country fans and have always seen Garth doing

1875
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,280
country music, not being able to come along on this ride.

1876
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,480
So if they choose to sit this one out, I can't complain.

1877
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,360
And that's cool.

1878
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,640
I've had a wonderful decade.

1879
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,760
Thanks to them and God.

1880
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:01,480
And hopefully there's some God in there that we can dance again to.

1881
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,680
And for those people who see this as totally what it is, just a ride, a fictitious character

1882
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,120
that just lets us swing.

1883
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,080
So bad for this guy.

1884
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,400
If you don't view it that way, he's so afraid of his audience.

1885
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:13,960
Yeah.

1886
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,800
But I think what you're going to find by the end of this, you're going to see a lot of

1887
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,280
Garth and Chris.

1888
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,200
You know what it's like?

1889
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:27,800
It's a little I we're currently dealing right now with like, you know, Mr. Country, Mr.

1890
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,600
Big Dick country, Florida man.

1891
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:37,960
You know, like rough and tumble, real American DeSantis, who could not be more terrified of

1892
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:41,000
every single thing that happens and everything he says.

1893
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,560
And he knows these people are fucking Trump maniacs and they will like tear him apart

1894
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,680
if he gets any of these riddles wrong to the most like you just look in his eyes.

1895
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,600
He's so, so scared.

1896
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,080
Oh, yeah.

1897
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,440
And that is how that's how Garth comes across.

1898
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:01,320
Yes, they're like he's he is just like venturing into uncharted territory and like

1899
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,760
I might lose it all.

1900
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,560
Please don't.

1901
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,400
I just want to wear different pants.

1902
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,080
Don't make me lose it all.

1903
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,000
Yeah, you might hate their pants.

1904
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,400
You might not have seen before and that's OK.

1905
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,040
If you don't want to look at me wearing these pants, don't worry about it.

1906
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,640
Well, I wear different pants that you're comfortable with later.

1907
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,640
And I didn't throw away my old pants.

1908
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,360
The old pants are I mean, they're not with me now, but they're in my house.

1909
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:23,560
I can call them.

1910
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,200
I can get somebody to bring them here in an hour's notice.

1911
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,000
Do you want me to?

1912
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,280
I'll have somebody get the pants.

1913
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,280
Yeah, I don't want to alarm anyone.

1914
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:34,600
But it turns out there are more pants manufacturers than just Wrangler and Lee.

1915
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,720
But you don't if you like Wrangler and Lee, that's fine.

1916
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,320
Do whatever you want with your pants.

1917
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,320
Maybe the pants I'm wearing now.

1918
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:45,720
Imagine that there is a patch that says Lee and Wrangler as far as far as you picture it there.

1919
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,680
Then if you want them, if you will them to be Wrangler, they'll be Wrangler.

1920
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,000
I'm going to show you a photo of the pants for two seconds.

1921
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,120
And I want to warn you two seconds and I'll count loudly.

1922
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:54,840
One, two.

1923
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,600
OK, are you comfortable with that?

1924
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,960
Just so you got a little bit of it in your head now to know that I'm going to.

1925
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,720
From the waist down, we're not shooting it there, but waist down, I'm wearing those pants.

1926
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,480
You still here? Your money still here?

1927
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,040
OK, great.

1928
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,280
It does. That interview feels very secure.

1929
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,320
There was a moment or two where it's like, is he about to start crying?

1930
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:20,840
And I think this frame, I keep landing on frames that look more broken than the last.

1931
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,120
It's literally like he's out.

1932
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:26,840
He's like addressing millions of people outside that are directly there.

1933
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,760
And if he says the wrong thing, he will be killed.

1934
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,120
He's one foot.

1935
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,440
We have a list of the wrong things to say.

1936
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:38,360
And if you say one of them, there's a guillotine above your head.

1937
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,400
Chop it goes.

1938
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:45,400
One of the most successful music acts of the 1990.

1939
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,280
He has so much power.

1940
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:53,320
Yeah, he could do this so easily, but instead he is doing this character that seems like

1941
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:57,320
a country guy saw a bunch of Rolling Stone photo spreads.

1942
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,960
And that's how he got his idea of what a rock and roller is.

1943
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:08,440
Yeah, as we develop this episode live, the more I think maybe he's right.

1944
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:14,760
And Chris Gaines is just like a little, it was a growth out of a necessity more than

1945
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:20,440
almost anything that maybe part of him was just going to come out somehow.

1946
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,200
Right. It had to be this and he couldn't do it any other way.

1947
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,480
Maybe I'm thinking that now.

1948
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,320
I've changed my mind a couple of times in this last whatever three hours we've been

1949
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:29,960
talking about this.

1950
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:38,680
So did he the lamb gets announced and they're like, so maybe we'll get people interested

1951
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,320
in the movie.

1952
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,040
Maybe if we announce it, maybe you could do like a special.

1953
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,320
Yeah, we could do a special or tour.

1954
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,360
I go on Saturday and live.

1955
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:47,160
Let's find some opportunities for me to wear the pants.

1956
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,280
I'd really like to wear the pants.

1957
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:55,160
He's just like he jumped right to I think it happens because he was.

1958
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,640
He almost joined the Padres.

1959
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,400
He I think that was like a needed to get out.

1960
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,720
He just wanted to play dress up is what he wanted to do.

1961
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:02,040
Yeah.

1962
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,880
When it was a baseball uniform.

1963
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,760
It could be fucking Elton John in 1970s at Dodger Stadium.

1964
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,960
Wear the baseball outfit.

1965
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,120
He couldn't wore the baseball outfit on stage.

1966
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,160
That's all he had to do.

1967
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,680
He could have done so much less.

1968
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:18,840
He didn't have to go to this extent and do this apology tour within the special itself.

1969
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:24,040
Where, by the way, there's not even there's not so much of as a picture of Chris Gaines

1970
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,200
until deep into the special.

1971
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:26,440
Right.

1972
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,560
He and it's like introduced at some point.

1973
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,880
You want to see him, but he's like afraid.

1974
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,640
Okay, so we're but imagine watching this.

1975
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,280
You're a fan of his.

1976
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:40,280
So this is all the music of Chris Gaines, who is a fictional rock star who I am playing.

1977
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:45,640
But Chris's music, you know, he's lived a hard life and he's had a rough and tumble story.

1978
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,560
And but he's fake, but he's real.

1979
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,840
And this is and it's it's essentially me, but he's him.

1980
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,280
And I feel bad about his dad.

1981
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:53,640
Gene.

1982
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,800
And you make sure you know about gene.

1983
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,120
All right.

1984
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,640
And here's the next song.

1985
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:02,680
But like all I'm saying is maybe the audience, I don't know.

1986
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,920
Maybe the audience would have been irate.

1987
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:05,640
I don't know.

1988
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,440
It is 1999 and it is the country music.

1989
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,880
I mean, Dylan went electric.

1990
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,840
And I hear about this as a thing that was real.

1991
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:17,080
And now it's like now you're like, huh, what is the problem?

1992
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:17,560
It's hard.

1993
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,520
It gives a shit.

1994
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:19,320
Like, what are you talking?

1995
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,240
Well, was it because this is on every stupid music special you ever watch.

1996
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:27,400
Dylan went electric and everyone was upset that he was not playing folk music anymore,

1997
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,680
even though it wasn't that it wasn't that crazy of a change.

1998
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:34,360
Was it 100 people who was actually mad?

1999
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,000
I don't know.

2000
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,480
Yeah.

2001
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,800
But is this like legend grown in rock?

2002
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:42,440
Are there other actual precedents for this where the audience rejected it?

2003
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,360
Generally, I feel like the audience stops caring more than ever rejects things.

2004
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:46,840
Yeah.

2005
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,920
That's usually the bigger problem.

2006
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,440
And then you can make money on a return to form album or tour.

2007
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:52,680
Sure.

2008
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:53,480
Yeah.

2009
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:56,200
So anyway, sorry, I want to dig more into this.

2010
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:56,440
Yeah.

2011
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:56,920
Yeah.

2012
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,480
OK.

2013
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,320
Now what I'm going to play is that I was like, I have to cut this shorter.

2014
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,840
And then I couldn't find a place to do it because everything we're talking about

2015
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,960
comes to a head here in this moment.

2016
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:14,200
This is as vulnerable as an artist has ever gotten on stage, I feel.

2017
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,800
Maybe I'll pause it midway through, but I do have to play the full minute and a half.

2018
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,360
Now, maybe some of you are wondering what this cat, Chris, kind of looks like.

2019
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,000
All right.

2020
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,120
You got to know he was in a bad, bad car wreck in 92.

2021
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:35,240
Because we got this young kid to play him from 1986 to 1992.

2022
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:39,560
Happens to be the same young kid that played young Brad Pitt in seven years at Tibet.

2023
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,560
I heard him talk about this on a different thing.

2024
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:41,800
Yeah.

2025
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,440
I've seen this.

2026
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,280
I casted him myself, of course.

2027
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,120
Because the kid's just gorgeous, right?

2028
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,080
And I'm looking at him.

2029
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,600
I'm going, yeah, that's me.

2030
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:52,600
Yeah.

2031
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,080
So.

2032
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,600
So this guy's in a car wreck in 1992, right?

2033
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,720
And so I'm supposed to take the character over from 92 on.

2034
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:08,120
So my loving brother, the first time he ever sees young Chris,

2035
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,960
he looks at his face and he looks at me and he goes,

2036
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,200
that must have been a hell of a car wreck.

2037
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:17,800
I said.

2038
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,400
It's all fake laughter and stuff.

2039
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:25,880
He just gave the finger on television pixelated finger.

2040
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,920
Sweetened audio from the audience.

2041
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,200
I didn't say that.

2042
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,160
Chris said that.

2043
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:31,660
All right.

2044
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,480
It's better.

2045
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,400
So it's better.

2046
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,600
So all right.

2047
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,680
So we got a number of things here.

2048
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:43,480
Mainly, here's where he has opened up about the narrative,

2049
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,440
which is he's also dealt with a lot in the buying the music where

2050
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:52,520
the Chris Gaines is a little like, you know, very slight rock star.

2051
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,840
I think the amount of pounds is said at some point.

2052
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:03,560
And it's clear that he, he views the young version of Chris as being very like,

2053
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,360
thin and attractive.

2054
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,960
And he does not view himself as thin and attractive.

2055
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:14,280
And the story with the brother has blown the whole thing up.

2056
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:17,400
This is exactly what he needed not to hear.

2057
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:23,160
We've gone so far out of it that it's a car wreck that is so bad

2058
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:29,000
that it turned this this beautiful creature into hideous big Garth Mee.

2059
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,120
And you're like, Garth, you look fine to me.

2060
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,880
Garth, you don't need to do this.

2061
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:34,920
Why are you?

2062
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:36,760
This?

2063
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,160
Yeah, this is really, this makes me sadder.

2064
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,520
It feels like he's trying to build up like so much has happened to Chris Gaines.

2065
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,800
You're sympathetic to him, right?

2066
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,720
You'll give his music a chance, right?

2067
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,920
He was in a wreck.

2068
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,160
He was, he got wrecked up.

2069
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,920
That's another part of the buying the music I forgot is that they like,

2070
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,520
I think they didn't have the actors check with each other about what happened in the car wreck.

2071
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:05,800
Cause one of them was like, yeah, it, boy, it smashed his neck apart.

2072
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,360
Yeah.

2073
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:15,160
The other one's like, yeah, I broke both his arms, ripped his, ripped his pelvis off.

2074
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,520
His jaw was jangling, dangling down.

2075
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,080
Like this seems like too many things.

2076
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:26,600
I think this person is dead from what you described, but mainly the main effect of the

2077
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:33,480
car wreck is that it turned a young, beautiful musician into the monster as he views it.

2078
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,680
That is Chris.

2079
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:39,240
And then he keeps, he uses the specific word gorgeous for the actuary cast.

2080
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,120
And he wanted to cast because it was young Brad Pitt.

2081
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:45,880
Although I couldn't find any proof that there is a young Brad Pitt in seven years in Tibet.

2082
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,160
Maybe it got cut from the movie.

2083
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,200
I don't know.

2084
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,680
But then like that word just stuck with me.

2085
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:55,800
And then I found another interview where he says, well, originally I was just going to

2086
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,560
produce the movie and I wasn't going to play Chris because I figured Chris had to be played,

2087
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,400
you know, by somebody thin and gorgeous.

2088
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,080
Chris, he Garth doesn't feel gorgeous.

2089
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,040
I know.

2090
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,080
And I feel bad for him that he doesn't.

2091
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:13,880
And I think somebody needed to, he didn't have someone in his life to tell him that

2092
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,240
he's gorgeous.

2093
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,920
It would have made a lot go away.

2094
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:23,000
And certainly his brother, this brother I am mad at, at this point, look what he caused.

2095
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,280
Do you think that's a real story?

2096
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,920
It occurred to me.

2097
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,320
I was wondering what if, and I don't know this fact, I haven't looked it up.

2098
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,520
What if he looked it up?

2099
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,800
Garth Brooks doesn't have a brother.

2100
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,080
Yeah, we gotta look it up.

2101
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,200
That would be pretty funny.

2102
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,760
So then I go to my brother, right?

2103
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:43,080
I go to that my brother in that box that my brother always lives in with the gold frame in it.

2104
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,360
And everything in the background looks exactly like what's in my house.

2105
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,360
And he looks exactly like me, right?

2106
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,040
You know, that's where your brother is.

2107
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,000
And I got into a big fight with that my brother in the box.

2108
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:57,800
Then I ended up smashing up the glass between my brother and I.

2109
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,640
My knuckles were bleeding for weeks.

2110
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:00,920
Anyway, here's my next song.

2111
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,120
It's called Main Street.

2112
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:05,880
He still seems so nervous in that NBC special.

2113
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,680
He's got brothers.

2114
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,320
He's got brothers.

2115
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,280
He does have brothers.

2116
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:08,760
Okay.

2117
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,360
Well, I don't like them.

2118
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,880
Garth Brooks, brother Kelly, plus their four half siblings.

2119
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,600
Mike Brooks, Kelly Brooks, Jim Smitle, and Jerry Smitle.

2120
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,800
I think it's Jim Smitle.

2121
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,280
I think Jim Smitle did it.

2122
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:24,520
I had a bad feeling as a shiver came over me as soon as I heard Jim Smitle.

2123
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,640
Jim Smitle, you need to tell Garth that he's gorgeous.

2124
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,840
He needs it.

2125
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,960
His heart is hurting.

2126
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:35,800
This young Brad Pitt isn't any better looking than Garth Brooks.

2127
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,080
Why is this in his head?

2128
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:37,640
What is the role?

2129
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,480
What's this poor guy?

2130
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:45,400
Playing stadiums, the scores of loving fans is not enough for Garth Brooks.

2131
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,880
If you don't have love inside, then you're never going to get it that way.

2132
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,960
That's not even the end, by the way.

2133
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:56,600
Anyway, this guy comes out with this long hair and he hides out for three or four years

2134
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,240
because he's really not happy with his face, which upset me.

2135
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:04,200
And he kind of looked like Prince.

2136
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:06,860
No.

2137
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:09,560
This guy gained a lot of weight after the car accident.

2138
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,000
Garth, stop it.

2139
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,500
Garth.

2140
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,400
Oh wait, that was it.

2141
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:13,880
Okay, okay.

2142
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,440
And then he shows a picture and then he starts saying like,

2143
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:19,720
that's a pretty good looking man if I do say so myself.

2144
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:24,760
So then he's trying to say that he's handsome, but or maybe he only feels like he looks good

2145
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:31,960
as Chris, but he's I don't, I'm not looking at this guy and thinking you're fat.

2146
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,560
I don't, what is in his mind?

2147
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,080
What's happened to this poor guy?

2148
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:40,280
He's just the, the lot he's trying to logic everything in his head and also his own

2149
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:44,040
insecurities and whatever, either fears or fantasies are coming out.

2150
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:44,840
We don't know for sure.

2151
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,160
I've been guessing wildly this whole time.

2152
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:52,040
So it's a mix of insecurity about the bits.

2153
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:56,680
It's a mix of him feeling like no one understands this.

2154
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,520
So he has to over explain everything.

2155
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:05,640
And then fantasies and insecurities are coming out and mixing in to this big ball of confusion.

2156
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:10,040
Yeah, it feels, it very much feels like a 20 year old who has learned that if they

2157
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,560
make some self-deprecating jokes about themselves, everyone will laugh.

2158
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:20,040
But he has made like five or six self-deprecating jokes and now everyone is feeling really weird.

2159
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,880
It's like, that's enough.

2160
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,280
You've, you've made your point.

2161
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:24,920
That's enough.

2162
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:25,960
We're ready to move on.

2163
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,640
Also, I'm here to hear music.

2164
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,800
We're worried about you at this point.

2165
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:30,680
Okay.

2166
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:34,760
Also, I thought I got a ticket for this and it said Chris Gaines and now it's you.

2167
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,760
And you're just telling me about Chris Gaines.

2168
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:40,840
And in the same breath, you've told me he's fake and he's real and you're playing him.

2169
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:43,880
But then you're telling me about his dad and his best friend who died.

2170
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,400
What's happening?

2171
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,360
What is it?

2172
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,080
Just decide one of the things that it is.

2173
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:54,360
And don't on top, it's a bunch of confusing shit next to your body image issues.

2174
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,080
This is the strangest hour of television.

2175
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,160
It's really some primetime NPC.

2176
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,160
What is ever this weird now?

2177
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:05,960
No, I can't think of a single thing other than the Warren Beatty Dick Tracy.

2178
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,400
That's why we like it.

2179
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:09,880
Yeah.

2180
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,080
That's completely.

2181
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:11,400
Wow.

2182
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:16,440
It's just a confusing thing where you can unpack it from a psychological standpoint forever.

2183
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:16,840
Yeah.

2184
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,680
What's going on behind this?

2185
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:24,760
And you're torn between like, is this so interesting because of a lack of thought or over thought?

2186
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,240
Yeah.

2187
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:26,120
Which one is it?

2188
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,960
It's a weird stew of both.

2189
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,800
I was going to say stew of both because there's just like very thin soup stuff.

2190
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,200
And then there's also stuff where you're like, we could get the top psychologists in the nation here

2191
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:43,560
and they would have a tough time figuring out exactly why this is the way it is.

2192
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:49,640
I feel I saw like one or two mentions of like more recent interviews or long form interviews

2193
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:53,800
where if you ask Garth Brooks enough questions about his career, eventually you hit on Chris

2194
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,960
Gaines and he's like, well, I could see doing more music like that, but I'm not going to lose

2195
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,920
50 pounds again.

2196
01:38:58,920 --> 01:38:59,640
That's for sure.

2197
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:05,160
And then it's just like, Garth, we just wanted to, were you going to make a poppy song or something?

2198
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:09,720
Like you still haven't gotten your songs on Spotify and even the iTunes store because I

2199
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:13,240
was going to buy the album and that was not available to me.

2200
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:18,840
This reminds me of how some I'm and I'm going to have a breakthrough because I've sometimes if I'm

2201
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:23,400
having a bad day or something bad just happened to me and then I go to a party and I'm talking

2202
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,720
to people, I feel like I have to talk about the thing and I don't need to talk about the thing

2203
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,000
or like be in a bum.

2204
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,280
Like nobody's asking this of you and you don't want to like not to say withhold things because

2205
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:38,760
you don't want to bum people out, but like something that you think is like, well, I better

2206
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,760
address it because it's the elephant of the room.

2207
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:43,640
And then it's like, no, no one's thinking about this at all.

2208
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:43,880
Yeah.

2209
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:45,080
You don't have to do that.

2210
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,440
This is how I, this is Garth and the weight to me.

2211
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:55,080
You are just, you're going so far out of your way to address something that is on no one's mind.

2212
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:55,640
Yeah.

2213
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:56,200
Yeah.

2214
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,320
That's why it makes me sad.

2215
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:57,800
Yeah.

2216
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,760
It's a homer.

2217
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:59,960
I, yeah.

2218
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:05,880
Can I mention some, we are clearly not the only ones who this is Chris Gaines is in their

2219
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:06,840
mind somewhere.

2220
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,240
Yes.

2221
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,640
Some like 2020 stuff I came across.

2222
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,000
Okay.

2223
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:17,480
There's a, I, I can't tell if it's a web show or like a show that just put a bunch of clips

2224
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:23,320
online, but there's a series called like a version where artists do other songs.

2225
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:25,400
So like Ben Foltz does a Kesha song.

2226
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,880
The vines do a gorilla song.

2227
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:34,920
There is a cover of the Chris Gaines song lost in you by Childish Gambino.

2228
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:35,160
Yes.

2229
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,080
I have watched this.

2230
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,280
It's not bad.

2231
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:38,600
Yeah.

2232
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,240
It's fun.

2233
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:39,960
It's pretty good.

2234
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:45,480
It feels, it feels like that song might be the most successful song in terms of like,

2235
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:50,680
well, here, finally, it's just a whole absolutely other style of music.

2236
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:55,880
It feels like Garth Brooks trying to do baby face, just again, like I actually like a lot

2237
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:56,680
of baby face music.

2238
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,600
I don't love the song change the world.

2239
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,680
The Clapton, it feels like he's trying to do that.

2240
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,200
It's the writers of that song.

2241
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:02,680
Yeah.

2242
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,480
Yeah.

2243
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:06,040
Cause Garth didn't write any of the Chris Gaines songs.

2244
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,080
You know what's the crazy thing?

2245
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,920
Garth didn't write any of the Garth songs.

2246
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,280
A couple of them.

2247
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,560
A few, but mostly and with co-writers.

2248
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:17,640
I was surprised by that because I was looking through that and I went, oh, maybe that's

2249
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,880
that's just the Chris Gaines album he didn't want to write.

2250
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:20,360
Yeah.

2251
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,760
But no, it seems like, yeah, like a lot of his stuff.

2252
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,320
Which is weird.

2253
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:27,720
So now we're just like, it's just other music, not written for you mostly.

2254
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:29,400
He's still married to Trisha Yearwood, right?

2255
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:29,720
Yes.

2256
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:29,960
Yeah.

2257
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,360
And she wrote a couple of Chris Gaines, I believe.

2258
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,160
Oh, is that so?

2259
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:33,880
At least one.

2260
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:34,360
Wow.

2261
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:34,860
Wow.

2262
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:41,260
The weirdest thing I found, which I'm excited for now, you guys know the 33 and a third

2263
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:41,980
books?

2264
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:42,460
Yeah.

2265
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:46,300
Those books, the small books, each one about an individual album.

2266
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:51,180
In 2024, in the next run of books, there is a Chris Gaines book.

2267
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:51,660
What?

2268
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:52,460
About the album.

2269
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:58,780
There's a 33 and a third, the next run includes books about Modest Mouse, The Moon in Antarctica,

2270
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:02,300
The Moon End Antarctica, excuse me.

2271
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:08,140
The one of the No Doubt albums, and then in the middle of this list, it says Chris Gaines.

2272
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:09,660
That's insane.

2273
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:12,380
I mean, that's interesting.

2274
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:16,540
And I'll probably look at that given what we've put the music, because this is,

2275
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,780
it's a weird revisionist thing to go.

2276
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:21,580
But actually, the Chris Gaines, right?

2277
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:25,660
I was looking, look, I was looking to roll in here with one track or something that I

2278
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:31,260
would say, this is actually, I love this, but I did not find it on this.

2279
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:32,620
So yeah, I don't know.

2280
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:36,060
It wasn't like, what's the song from Starlight?

2281
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,420
He Whistled at Me.

2282
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:37,660
Yeah.

2283
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:40,380
I came in here like so excited about it.

2284
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,380
I was like, guys, he whistled at me.

2285
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:43,100
He's my favorite.

2286
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:44,940
But that's pretty catchy.

2287
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:46,140
I feel like, yeah.

2288
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:47,180
Oh yeah, that's a pretty, yeah.

2289
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:48,620
That was a Rolling Stock guy.

2290
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:49,900
Yeah, sure.

2291
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:50,700
I stand by that.

2292
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:51,420
Rolling Stock's not bad.

2293
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:52,220
I like Rolling Stock.

2294
01:42:54,140 --> 01:43:01,180
Here's a weird thing to tie to the, there's still one more text to mention.

2295
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:06,540
Which is, and here's something I thought was strange about the Childish Gambino doing a cover.

2296
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:14,540
Childish Gambino, musical guest on SNL with host Donald Glover, same person, different names.

2297
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:18,780
The only other time this has happened is Garth Brooks and Chris Gaines.

2298
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:25,100
And this is probably why I knew it, because I watched SNL pretty religiously then.

2299
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:30,620
I think 1998, not long before this, Garth Brooks hosted SNL and was musical guest.

2300
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:34,380
In what I think was a pretty successful episode.

2301
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:34,700
Yeah.

2302
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:39,660
I think a very game fun host with sketches that really worked.

2303
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:41,980
I feel like it might've helped cause all of this.

2304
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,660
Where like, oh, Garth is pretty good on SNL.

2305
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:44,780
Maybe Garth could act.

2306
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:46,300
I bet this all kind of spun you.

2307
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,180
Yeah, I bet.

2308
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:54,940
But then a weird, bizarre year and a half later, where we land is we're skipping ahead of the movie.

2309
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:56,700
We're doing Chris Gaines.

2310
01:43:56,700 --> 01:44:00,940
And it led to what might be the only live Chris Gaines performance.

2311
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:01,580
Oh yeah.

2312
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:06,380
Cause the rest was just kind of like pre-taped, used, you know, in fits and starts and different

2313
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:09,580
specials. But the NBC thing was, he was just Garth.

2314
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:14,300
This might be the only time that like, here is just Chris Gaines performing.

2315
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:21,420
I, of course, I've, for ever since, I have loved so much the way that they had to handle this.

2316
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:23,260
Where? All right.

2317
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:30,300
Typical SNL style bumper fades to host, ladies and gentlemen, Chris Gaines.

2318
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:36,700
And then it cuts wide and there is a cowboy, cowboy, there's a cowboy there.

2319
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:39,500
There's a guy dressed like Garth Brooks with a big hat.

2320
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,620
Can't quite see the face.

2321
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:46,780
So they have clearly married a pre-tape to the live wide shot.

2322
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:51,980
And then they pan over to the musical guest stage where he is currently being Chris Gaines.

2323
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:54,700
This piece of footage I love so much.

2324
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:56,860
He is so proud of himself.

2325
01:44:56,860 --> 01:45:01,420
He gives you this look like you're going to wait till you see what I'm doing.

2326
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:02,620
I am proud.

2327
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,740
This even you ain't never seen this before.

2328
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:07,420
Even it's almost like a double take.

2329
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,820
He like looks around like, are you ready for this one?

2330
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:13,740
So love that.

2331
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:21,500
But the, do you remember the other way that that Chris Gaines manifests in the episode?

2332
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,000
No.

2333
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:23,600
Why?

2334
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:33,440
There is a runner in the episode essentially that carries through the monologue and then a later

2335
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,240
sketch that comes right after the Chris Gaines performance.

2336
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,320
And this is a running, this is a story in an SNL episode.

2337
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,800
Something that does not happen very often.

2338
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:49,200
And the story is that, well, the star of our story is beloved,

2339
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,720
I'm sure still works great for everybody today.

2340
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,160
Character Mango.

2341
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:54,800
Of course.

2342
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:03,040
Mango is the through line Chris Gaines stripper character who people would get very enamored with.

2343
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:06,240
This is Mango in general.

2344
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,760
We're in a lot of trouble the day that we decide we're going to reckon with Mango.

2345
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,440
That we're going to unpack everything that Mango means.

2346
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,360
I feel like everyone is just keeping Mango in a drawer in the back of their minds.

2347
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:23,760
I haven't talked about Mango in a long time and I don't believe he's ever come up on this show.

2348
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:24,640
I don't think so.

2349
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,560
We all saw it.

2350
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:27,680
We all saw it.

2351
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:28,720
We were all part of it.

2352
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,480
We were too young to do anything about it.

2353
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,600
No, we were innocent.

2354
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,080
None of this is on us.

2355
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,880
Other than that we're in society.

2356
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,080
We have to own some of society's sins, don't we?

2357
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:43,360
We look back and we just fondly remember Mr. Peepers.

2358
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,600
Mr. Peepers is just wholesome fun.

2359
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,280
Mr. Peepers was unloaded.

2360
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,960
Unpleasant in a few ways.

2361
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:54,400
I may have done a Mr. Peepers sketch junior year in high school.

2362
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,040
I definitely got up in front of...

2363
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,320
There was some classroom setting in which I did Will Ferrell's Janet Reno voice.

2364
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:02,640
Sure.

2365
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,120
And acted like that was my own thing that I thought of.

2366
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:06,080
This is what you do.

2367
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,360
You do this until you realize you should do your own things.

2368
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:09,600
Yeah.

2369
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,160
Well, you know what?

2370
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,360
Now that I say that, it was my friend's sketch and he was Mr. Peepers.

2371
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,480
You were the scientist?

2372
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,840
I was just a scientist.

2373
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,400
Yes.

2374
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,800
Okay.

2375
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:22,800
But I think we did an original sketch of mine in that same show as well.

2376
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,760
Which one did better?

2377
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,720
It's tough because he was really good at...

2378
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:29,840
My friend Luke was really good at physics, like roll his arms going crazy.

2379
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,920
So that probably did well.

2380
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,520
But I played a hall monitor and I made topical jokes about the school.

2381
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,040
Oh, that's good.

2382
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:37,520
Okay.

2383
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,280
Which played really well.

2384
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,720
Hyper topical material that your school or college kills.

2385
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,480
I would have to see the VHS to know.

2386
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,080
I think they both did very well though.

2387
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,160
You're gonna run that through an audience meter.

2388
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:48,640
Yeah.

2389
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,600
I'll run that through there.

2390
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,800
That's like you being the weekend update of the show.

2391
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:53,280
Yes.

2392
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,000
Yeah.

2393
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,360
Jokes that are close to home.

2394
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,160
I think a lot of people were lip syncing stuff too in that show.

2395
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:01,920
So I think we didn't have too much competition as far as comedy was concerned.

2396
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,560
Anyway, let me see if I can...

2397
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,400
Let me step through this briefly.

2398
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,880
There had been a mango sketch the first time Garth Brooks hosted.

2399
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,760
They could have left it there, but they decide in this case to make Mango a runner

2400
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,600
and to keep the story going.

2401
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:24,320
So Mango shows up in the monologue, which confuses things because in the universe,

2402
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,280
now what is Mango?

2403
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,000
Is Mango a person who lives at Saturday Night Live?

2404
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,320
Or is he in the world of the strip clubs?

2405
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:30,880
Good question.

2406
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,000
I don't know.

2407
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,720
So I have problems from that end.

2408
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:35,280
Yeah.

2409
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,200
Then it's so weird.

2410
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,080
First of all, he comes out and says, music guest tonight, Chris Gaines.

2411
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,160
And to like 20% applause.

2412
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,680
I don't think they know what it is.

2413
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:47,920
Yeah.

2414
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:48,480
I don't think.

2415
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,120
Nobody's...

2416
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,880
He's at the center of no one's world.

2417
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:51,120
Right.

2418
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:52,400
Nobody's paying that close of attention.

2419
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:57,760
And he says, oh, hey, I knew him before he got his big break.

2420
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,520
To no response.

2421
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,560
They don't know what it is.

2422
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,920
They don't know what it is.

2423
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,000
Anyway, Mango comes out.

2424
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,200
They do a flashback of the last time Mango was there.

2425
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,600
His desire to do Mango material.

2426
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,280
I don't know.

2427
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,960
I don't want to ask further questions.

2428
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,280
Do you think Garth was like that Mango stuff was a hell of a good time?

2429
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:22,560
I may have heard something from the inside that he was insistent on coming back.

2430
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,920
More Mango, please.

2431
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:24,720
That's interesting.

2432
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:27,520
This we end up with two Mango sketches.

2433
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,800
Now I'm going to revise my whole thought process for this whole episode.

2434
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:32,800
That's another curveball.

2435
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,520
Insisted.

2436
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,080
I've changed my home position four or five times now.

2437
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:41,120
You haven't mentioned though, I think probably the thing that may have actually endeared

2438
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,920
the Chris Gaines material, which is Tracy Morgan.

2439
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:45,360
Oh, yes.

2440
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:49,680
With Garth Brooks and Tracy Morgan and Tracy Morgan just does not understand

2441
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:52,080
the Chris Gaines thing.

2442
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:52,560
Right.

2443
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:53,200
That's funny.

2444
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:53,760
Yeah.

2445
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:53,840
Yeah.

2446
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:57,840
That is some things that has some lines or if you watch it today, like, oh, wait, whoops.

2447
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,520
In terms of not being sensitive to certain things.

2448
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:01,840
Yeah.

2449
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,400
Yes.

2450
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,440
That was like putting the whole thing on blast.

2451
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:09,360
And that's the get me a soda, bitch, to Lauren, which is very funny.

2452
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:09,760
Yes.

2453
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,080
Star making moments for him.

2454
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:18,560
At the time, I think like and not the material so much as like having a good sense of humor

2455
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,720
that Garth is also Chris Gaines.

2456
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,560
If he had done it a little more, you know.

2457
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,120
Yeah.

2458
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:28,080
Well, to his credit, that's kind of what they're trying to do here.

2459
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:32,320
Basically, what happens is there's this odd run of stuff that's about like, yeah, well,

2460
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,480
you know, I'm feeling better since back then.

2461
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:40,240
You know, I've been going to therapy and I don't make my wife wear the mango mask anymore.

2462
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:43,520
And all of that kind of bond, none of it is working very well.

2463
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:48,720
And what it's leading to is the story that Mango has no interest in Garth Brooks.

2464
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:55,040
But then Mango says, do you know where Chris Gaines dressing room is?

2465
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,480
And it turns out that Mango is into Chris Gaines.

2466
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,040
Doesn't like Garth, but likes Chris Gaines.

2467
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:06,000
Again, now we're back into the duality where Garth doesn't feel wanted as Garth,

2468
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,440
but feels wanted as Chris.

2469
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,640
Like Batman forever.

2470
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,400
This is what Chase Meridian and Batman forever.

2471
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:14,160
She wants Batman at the start and then at the end she wants Bruce Wayne, but not Batman.

2472
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,840
It all comes back to Chase Meridian.

2473
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:20,720
The teachings of Dr. Chase Meridian provide the roadmap for lots of psychological evaluations.

2474
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:21,360
Mycologist.

2475
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,200
Well, she could do to spend some time with Garth Brooks.

2476
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,520
I don't know that he actually did go to therapy.

2477
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,520
I think that was a joke.

2478
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,760
That's, you know, it'd be funny if I said I went to therapy.

2479
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,480
That'll get him laughing.

2480
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:39,600
So Chris Gaines is the idealized version of Garth in his own mind in a lot of ways.

2481
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,240
I think so.

2482
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,000
I think he's Garth inside.

2483
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,120
So in that, okay.

2484
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:46,480
So if in case you don't, I don't even know if maybe I'm restating.

2485
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,120
Mango was a sketch that Chris Catan used to perform.

2486
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:52,400
It was a male stripper and then the sketch was they would play that song like,

2487
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,400
I miss you like a desert, miss the rain.

2488
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,040
Is that the lyric?

2489
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,520
Yeah.

2490
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,480
And then it would just be, they would fantasize about him over and over again and they'd fall

2491
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,720
in love and then they would like profess their love to mango.

2492
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:05,200
And this was the same sketch every time, basically.

2493
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,240
Yeah.

2494
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:08,560
Except that it grew and grew again.

2495
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:12,800
If you, I don't know if people remember the, the mango sketches started to become like

2496
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:21,600
minutes long with multiple sets and stories and songs and parodies and musical guests would be in

2497
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:27,360
it and cameos and Matt Damon showing up and like they, I remember just as a viewer of the show,

2498
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:34,000
I started to feel so worn down, like am I the only person noticing these mango sketches are like

2499
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,920
in defiance of God?

2500
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,360
These are crazy.

2501
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,120
They basically aren't on the reruns.

2502
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,160
They're hard to find.

2503
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:40,960
Yeah.

2504
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,120
Because of the song, because they don't clear the song.

2505
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:46,560
But I think, I think, I think that's helped us not have to reckon with mango.

2506
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,280
Yeah.

2507
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,080
Too much.

2508
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:53,920
In comic book terminology, it's like his superpowers evolved to reality warping,

2509
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:57,280
where it's just like, okay, you are too powerful now.

2510
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:02,800
Like you can do any, you're like Dr. Manhattan on the moon, like these people.

2511
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,960
I'm tired of these people.

2512
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,040
A new cast member, it's like, we'll give you a chair.

2513
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,440
You get out, you're gonna have a chair to do this bit.

2514
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:13,520
So Chris, at the end of the run, yes, we will, we will build you.

2515
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,560
You can use every corner of the studio for your mango.

2516
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:16,960
You could do it.

2517
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,880
The whole episode, give me mango if you want.

2518
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:24,640
So anyway, so we were, so we're flipping it, right?

2519
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:29,520
Usually it's the other person who's not, who is enamored and mango says, no,

2520
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,200
you can't have the mango.

2521
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,400
Here we flipped it.

2522
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:38,720
Garth wants, but so Chris Gaines is mango is suddenly into.

2523
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,680
So mango exits with a spank on the butt, as you'd expect.

2524
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:42,080
Of course.

2525
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:42,960
A trademark.

2526
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,320
Big applause, big applause.

2527
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:45,120
That's where you go out.

2528
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:47,440
That's where you say, all right, we got a great show.

2529
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,120
Instead applause dies down.

2530
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:57,200
Garth says, ooh, mango's got the hots for Chris and does a little like, okay.

2531
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,400
Like a little like, oh yeah, some little dance with his arms.

2532
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:01,120
No laugh.

2533
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,240
And then he has to like recover from that.

2534
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:05,280
Like, this is weird.

2535
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,160
You are milking.

2536
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,120
What is this?

2537
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:11,600
So then performance introduces himself with the free tape right after the performance,

2538
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:15,920
a whole other sketch where now we're in Chris Gaines dressing room,

2539
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:20,640
where we'd usually be in mango's dressing room and it's flipped and mango has flowers

2540
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:24,560
for Chris Gaines and Chris Gaines is turning mango away.

2541
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,960
And here's where I, I do have a clip.

2542
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,320
So this is again, one of the only like narrative.

2543
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,480
We didn't get the film, but we did get this.

2544
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:40,240
Have you have Chris Gaines?

2545
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:45,520
Can a rainbow have, can a rainbow be brought over for dinner?

2546
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,920
Can you make out with an ocean?

2547
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:52,800
Can you take a broken heart and dress it up in a wig and a goatee and call it Chris Gaines?

2548
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,040
No.

2549
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:56,000
What are you saying?

2550
01:54:57,200 --> 01:55:04,080
I'm saying that you can't have a Chris Gaines, but you can have Garth.

2551
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,080
What the who, what, what is this?

2552
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:10,880
What is this here?

2553
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,280
What happened to the Chris Gaines?

2554
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:20,800
He took off his, for the listener, he took off his wig there and then he reveals that all of Chris

2555
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:25,120
Gaines was just a ploy to get back to the studio to be with mango.

2556
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:31,600
But why wouldn't, I mean, I guess, I guess he doesn't want to trick mango.

2557
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:36,640
I guess that's his only way is to develop an alter ego.

2558
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,680
Who looks better, who looks better than he thinks he looks.

2559
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:44,640
If he's going to have consensual sex with mango though, he has to reveal that he's

2560
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:47,200
been fooling him. I suppose. That's what I mean.

2561
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:50,160
He would have to reveal that I'm not actually this guy. I'm actually Garth.

2562
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:51,760
Cause it would be improper if he didn't.

2563
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:52,480
And he's doing it.

2564
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:52,960
That's what I'm saying.

2565
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:57,600
There's a version where, as we know, sex addict Chris Gaines, if he's deep in that character,

2566
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:00,800
he would just let it happen. Lie about the persona.

2567
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:01,040
Yeah.

2568
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:05,360
But it's, it's nice of him that he wants to be, cause I think he wants true love with mango.

2569
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:06,960
This isn't just a fling.

2570
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,800
He wants true to love with mango.

2571
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,360
Is that what you said?

2572
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,920
Yeah. Did I say it weird like that?

2573
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:15,120
I thought there was an, I thought you did a little mango in there, but I could be wrong.

2574
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:16,000
True love of the mango.

2575
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,560
I thought there was an, an A, an errant A at the end of one of those words.

2576
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,400
That's an interesting clip.

2577
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:27,040
Yeah. It's all look.

2578
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,000
It's all interesting.

2579
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:28,720
The last.

2580
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,400
We'll leave it at that. It's interesting.

2581
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:33,200
There should be, cause there's so many different lists of Saturday Night Live.

2582
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:37,040
It's fun to rank characters, fun to rank errors and blah, blah, blah.

2583
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:41,120
There should be a, like, I know this is going to, you're going to get like behind this.

2584
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:44,400
You have to get behind the scenes stuff, but like the Steven Seagal clip that,

2585
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:46,720
that I think you post the, did you post a full one?

2586
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,400
I did a cut down of it.

2587
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:49,440
Yeah. Just the craziest.

2588
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:55,840
Where he beats up people in the last sketch of the night, executives at oil company.

2589
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:00,880
He, it was a sketch where they bailed on it being cast members and they just brought in a bunch of

2590
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:06,000
stunt men so that Steven Seagal could do live stunts, beat up oil executives.

2591
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,040
Great clip of Bob Odenkirk explaining it on Howard Stern.

2592
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,760
Yeah, that lit it up for me. I didn't quite know about it until.

2593
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:14,560
Yeah. And then it's like, it's a nine minute sketch.

2594
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,520
Phil Harmon's in it, but then he disappears to be replaced by a stunt man.

2595
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:22,160
They duck him out and it's a live, bad, sloppy stunt show.

2596
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,600
And then the tables are just breaking.

2597
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:27,760
What is a comedy audience supposed to make of this?

2598
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:32,400
Steven Seagal like points at the camera and he goes, this is what happened when you pollute the earth.

2599
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,560
This is what happens when you pollute the planet.

2600
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,440
In front of the planet.

2601
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:36,560
It's a silence.

2602
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:49,120
But like a host, hosts like pet, pet things that got onto shows is an interesting category for Saturday.

2603
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:52,320
I feel like somebody had to deal with this. And I think they're trying to do their bit.

2604
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:56,160
Like that they're, I think it's funny to say Garth Brooks is doing this weird thing.

2605
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,920
This must be in the service.

2606
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:02,000
Like what if we make it in our universe in service of trying to get with Mango?

2607
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,240
And that's the only reason the whole character was invented there.

2608
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:09,840
We're close to having a little fun here, but it's also weird.

2609
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:15,680
Again, we're bailing on he like, if he had just never acknowledged that he's Chris Gaines

2610
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,920
instead of that, why did they do that?

2611
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:21,520
Pre tape where he introduces Chris Gaines and he's a separate guy.

2612
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:24,160
If he's going to take the wig off in the very next sketch.

2613
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:24,480
Right.

2614
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:30,960
They hadn't, they must've hit on the, like, they must've had people who were the host

2615
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,000
and the musical guests.

2616
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:36,400
Then a guest star or a cast member just introduces them.

2617
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,160
That's typically, I mean, don't get me wrong.

2618
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:38,960
I love it.

2619
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:39,360
I love it.

2620
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,040
That's my favorite part of the whole thing.

2621
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:45,520
There was a time I was at where I was at Conan one time and there was an SNL rerun on it.

2622
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,920
It was this episode and I was like, I'm going to have to,

2623
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,160
I'm going to have to push something back so I can watch that.

2624
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,800
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Gaines.

2625
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:53,760
I know it's coming.

2626
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:54,640
I got to see it.

2627
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:55,920
I would see it in years.

2628
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:56,480
Yeah.

2629
01:58:56,480 --> 01:59:02,400
Also in comedy, comedy, like technical terms, like, oh, it makes sense to eventually do

2630
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:08,000
a mango sketch where you flip it around and someone does the mango back, back to mango.

2631
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:08,320
Yeah.

2632
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:13,040
But because you already have the weirdness of Chris Gaines, you have so many hats on hats.

2633
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,080
And what is Chris Gaines?

2634
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:15,920
Then he talks and he's just a regular guy.

2635
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:16,800
Yeah.

2636
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,360
You can't, what I'm saying, you can't have the Chris Gaines.

2637
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:22,640
That's my favorite.

2638
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:27,440
All of the, I think that's the peak of all of it to me is him on Saturday Night Live saying to mango,

2639
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,280
you can't have the Chris Gaines.

2640
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:30,080
Yeah.

2641
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:34,320
He's not doing it enough and he doesn't have like a shirt or a hat.

2642
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:38,560
So it doesn't really read cause he's like, he's not committing fully.

2643
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,320
He doesn't know.

2644
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:41,360
And he doesn't know.

2645
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:43,760
He doesn't know what Chris Gaines is either.

2646
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,120
He never figured it out.

2647
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:48,480
All he knows is that Chris Gaines is what he looks like in his heart.

2648
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,920
Is there a, have you ever thought of just like having maybe a Craig Healy meets mango?

2649
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,120
I just hope Chris Gaines gettable.

2650
01:59:59,120 --> 01:59:59,360
Okay.

2651
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,080
Well, I don't know.

2652
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:01,200
I wouldn't know anything about that.

2653
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:02,720
I'm just saying.

2654
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:12,160
Anyway, I just like, it's an insane way for a character to live in these forms and

2655
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:17,280
three specials with drastically different rules, each of which has a different approach

2656
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:20,400
to how we're going to handle the Garth and Chris duality.

2657
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:27,360
And it's all just, to me, it just all feels like a flash hallucination that happened for

2658
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,320
a month or so.

2659
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:33,360
And that's why we need to be here for each other and share our memories and be sure that it happened.

2660
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,080
Yeah.

2661
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:38,720
I'm still not sure that it happened, but it at least makes it a little more concrete now

2662
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,720
that we've talked about it for two hours.

2663
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:46,640
I also, I think that he did like kind of get lost in this in a way.

2664
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:46,880
Yes.

2665
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:52,160
He's only done two new studio albums since otherwise it's been a lot of greatest hits

2666
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:55,040
and Vegas residencies and stuff.

2667
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,920
And he's going to have Vegas residency starting this July for like a few weeks.

2668
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,400
Yeah.

2669
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:03,760
And I think he, I believe he had a falling out with Saturday Night Live

2670
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,920
not long after that second episode.

2671
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:06,320
Really?

2672
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:08,880
I believe Tina Fey, I heard Tina Fey talk about something like,

2673
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:13,440
I forget he was like, thought they insulted Tricia Yearwood or something.

2674
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:13,920
Oh.

2675
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:14,320
Or something.

2676
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:17,760
There's something happened where he kind of like, that's why he never came back.

2677
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:18,400
Whoa.

2678
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:22,320
I don't remember if it was on that episode or if it was some joke they did later on update

2679
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:22,800
or something.

2680
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,560
But he did come back as Chris.

2681
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,520
He of course hosted as Chris Gaines.

2682
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,160
Four more times.

2683
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:29,760
Chris Gaines is in the five timer.

2684
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,200
If only.

2685
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:38,240
Anyway, I don't know what else to say about this.

2686
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,520
It's fascinating, right?

2687
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:46,240
You think it's about, you think it's going to be about the character, but it's really,

2688
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:50,720
but he maybe revealed more about the real man than he ever intended.

2689
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:51,760
Absolutely.

2690
02:01:51,760 --> 02:02:00,480
Is there any high profile version of this with a music star that sort of worked or was kept up

2691
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:03,280
in the sense that it was a complete rebranding on the album

2692
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,480
and it was rolled out in such a bad, but like high profile way?

2693
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,320
I don't think, like.

2694
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:11,520
It's hard to think of any.

2695
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:12,160
I don't think so.

2696
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:14,560
I mean, everybody, yeah, what we said, like Mr. McPhisto or

2697
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:19,360
every alter ego I feel like is very low key.

2698
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,400
Princess Camille is a couple songs.

2699
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:25,200
Yeah, but it's not, we're fully shifting over to this.

2700
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:26,960
You got to give him credit.

2701
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:27,120
Right.

2702
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:29,280
This is a crazy thing to do.

2703
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:33,200
I just think he should have just go all the way.

2704
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:36,400
The best, as I said, the best piece of all of this is him saying,

2705
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:40,080
ladies and gentlemen, Chris Gaines, besides saying you get to mango,

2706
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,520
you can't have the Chris Gaines.

2707
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:48,000
But the word where we get muddy is, you know, so I'm being a fictional rock star named Chris Gaines

2708
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,080
and he's, he is a lot like me.

2709
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:53,280
He there's even, there's a clip I didn't show from the concert where he says, like,

2710
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:57,520
all it is, all it is, is a little stretching out of the arms.

2711
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:01,600
It's just, this is Garth, this is Chris, this is Chris, it's not a big deal.

2712
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,040
Stop making it a big deal.

2713
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:05,520
He could have just joined a band.

2714
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:06,880
He couldn't put a band together.

2715
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,880
And then like just like had somebody write the songs for them.

2716
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,200
That wouldn't have been hard either.

2717
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:15,440
Like he just, she didn't go far.

2718
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:19,200
He simultaneously went too far and didn't go far enough.

2719
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:19,680
Yeah.

2720
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:19,920
Yeah.

2721
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:24,320
Cause if there was a band, like you're saying, or the movie came out, people had been like,

2722
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:24,960
oh, okay.

2723
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:25,200
Yeah.

2724
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,200
He's kind of doing the character from the movie.

2725
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:27,520
Right.

2726
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,480
I get that.

2727
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,840
I don't like it, but I get it.

2728
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:31,040
It sucks.

2729
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:35,040
But the movie, the movie was a catastrophic failure.

2730
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,600
But I understand.

2731
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,320
It's like spinal tap.

2732
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:36,800
And I'm funny.

2733
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:37,280
Got it.

2734
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:37,780
Yeah.

2735
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:39,760
I understand this.

2736
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,280
Those jokes got in the way.

2737
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:41,840
Right.

2738
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:44,320
So, but I want, oh, come on.

2739
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:44,880
What's he do?

2740
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:46,240
He's nothing to lose now.

2741
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:47,760
More Chris.

2742
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:51,920
He, I, well, I watched an interview with him where he, somebody asked him Chris Gaines question

2743
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,520
and he was like, man, I'd love to.

2744
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:57,600
He goes, but I got my ass kicked for that.

2745
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,240
So I think he's still hurt by the reception of it.

2746
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:05,840
Even though I do think the rollout was a big part of why.

2747
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,960
Well, the lamb died for his fans.

2748
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:17,120
Sins was crucified much like Garth was crucified for playing the character from the lamb and

2749
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:23,200
much like Jesus Christ was crucified for just trying to bring some new thought into this

2750
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:25,840
world, some truth and look what we did.

2751
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,960
We didn't appreciate him.

2752
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:27,840
We do.

2753
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:30,320
We didn't appreciate his message of love and we chased him away.

2754
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:31,920
Chris Gaines.

2755
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:32,800
Blue 32.

2756
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:34,320
All the greats.

2757
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:39,440
If I put together a fornicopia demo and get it to get it to Garth and say like, look,

2758
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,640
we can do a full album.

2759
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:45,760
I feel like it's not, I feel like Garth maybe was not going to trust.

2760
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:54,400
And then Garth goes, Garth goes into the 11th bedroom of his seventh house.

2761
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:54,880
Yeah.

2762
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:59,520
And he, he gets the email and then thinks about it for a minute and then digs through

2763
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:05,200
a bunch of piles and then goes into a locked box and a little smaller locked box in that

2764
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:11,280
locked box and then pulls out a perfectly kept up soul patch, presses it against his

2765
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:19,760
face in the mirror, sees a hallucination of his brother, Jim Spittel and gives him the finger.

2766
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:20,000
Yeah.

2767
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,800
Says Chris is back motherfucker.

2768
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:23,360
Oh my God.

2769
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:25,120
Chris goes on a run.

2770
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:29,440
He does his whale or bird man or like he's at his awesome.

2771
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:30,960
Yes.

2772
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:34,400
Well, are we not ready to embrace this?

2773
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:34,640
Yeah.

2774
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:37,040
It feels like it's his whale.

2775
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,920
It feels like, as Jason said, there's stuff, there's more material coming.

2776
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:43,120
We're crusting maybe Oh Hill here on Chris Gaines.

2777
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:46,800
And if Garth is tapped into the zeitgeist, it's time.

2778
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:47,840
Yeah.

2779
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:51,200
You may as well at the very least for a Superbowl commercial.

2780
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,000
Oh yeah.

2781
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,240
Yeah.

2782
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:57,520
You know, well, you know what I want them to do it in the, in the poetic artsy way.

2783
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,320
I would believe that.

2784
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:58,720
Yeah.

2785
02:05:58,720 --> 02:05:59,120
Yeah.

2786
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:03,440
Well, so it's one, it's some like KitKat kind of situation or somewhere, you know,

2787
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:08,000
or something where flavors are opposites and like it works for anybody in your family of Garth or

2788
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,480
a Chris.

2789
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:14,960
Oh, could he, you know, Chris Christopherson is that a very, you as musician, very successful

2790
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:15,760
acting career.

2791
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:19,440
And he was Whistler in Blade.

2792
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,960
Is there, could there's another blade?

2793
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,720
Wait a minute, where is this going?

2794
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:26,160
They're working on another blade.

2795
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:28,160
I didn't think it was one to one, but it could be.

2796
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:29,040
All right.

2797
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:29,840
Let's hear this out.

2798
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:30,320
No, no, you're right.

2799
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:31,040
You finish it.

2800
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:31,600
Finish it.

2801
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:35,600
Is Whistler in the Mahershala Blade?

2802
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:38,720
Okay.

2803
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:39,520
I'm fine with that.

2804
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:40,560
We found the cleanest solution.

2805
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:45,440
I was just trying to figure out where is there a superhero mentor character.

2806
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:50,720
We went from the most realistic version where he has to show up for 10 minutes and put a

2807
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:57,360
soul patch on to he's now joined the MCU as an, as the character as a character.

2808
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,080
A different character.

2809
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:03,920
And then he turns to the camera in the movie and says, now you're probably a little bit

2810
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:04,400
confused.

2811
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:08,400
Maybe you're not willing to go on this ride, but I think you're going to find that Garth

2812
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:13,280
is pretty, is it just a couple of arms length from Chris and Whistler is just a little bit

2813
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,960
further than that from Chris.

2814
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,800
So you're going to see there's a lot of Whistler in Garth and a lot of Whistler and Chris and

2815
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,080
a lot of Chris in Garth.

2816
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:23,920
So there's a lot of everybody and everybody is, you know, and hopefully we can all just

2817
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,520
get together, have a big old dance.

2818
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,160
And if you don't want to do that, then that's fine.

2819
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:31,520
I've had great years together and with Christ in my heart, I'd have

2820
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,760
in this vampire movie is not in a front against Christ.

2821
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:36,800
Don't worry about that.

2822
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:37,680
No, we don't.

2823
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:39,920
That does not indicate my belief in the occult.

2824
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:41,440
He is a daywalker.

2825
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:41,840
Okay.

2826
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:42,800
He's a daywalker.

2827
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:44,320
You're fine.

2828
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,960
There's a lot of Wesley Snipes in Mahershala Ali.

2829
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:50,240
And if you're not willing to go on that ride and you want to stick with the Snipes version,

2830
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:51,040
well, it's available.

2831
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,520
You can rent that and I'm not going to stop you from doing it.

2832
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,800
Well, this is a great run.

2833
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,000
Thanks to God and

2834
02:07:58,560 --> 02:07:59,600
Snipes could be Whistler.

2835
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:03,840
Jason, I don't know if Whistler has been cast.

2836
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,160
They should get back in that movie.

2837
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,080
A rewrite of the script as far as I know.

2838
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:13,120
The right is certainly delayed, but I think the first draft of the script was not good

2839
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:15,200
enough and they went back to the dammit.

2840
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:15,600
All right.

2841
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:16,160
I'm quitting.

2842
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:17,120
I'm scabbing.

2843
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:19,280
I'm going to go to where's making this Disney.

2844
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:20,480
I'm watching there.

2845
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,280
March there right now.

2846
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:22,400
Hey, you got your guy.

2847
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:24,960
I'm failing on the guild on one condition.

2848
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:29,680
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris, all right, you survived.

2849
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:30,720
I guess the ride.

2850
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:32,800
Thanks for subscribing.

2851
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,080
This nonsense.

2855
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:47,120
there's a lot of second gate in club three.

And you know, it's like arms like this.

2857
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:49,760
Okay.

2858
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:53,200
Or just stretch the arms, just stretch the arms.

2859
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,960
And if you don't like one of the topics, that's okay.

2860

2863
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:05,120
Okay.

2864
