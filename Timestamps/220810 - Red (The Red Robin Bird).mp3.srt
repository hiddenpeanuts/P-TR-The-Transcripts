1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Welcome to Ride Robin, gourmet podcasts and spirits.

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
I'm still here.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,280
Hey, it's Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,360
Hi.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Hello.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,800
That's pretty stupid.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,960
Okay, look, today's episode is about,

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,960
is it about Red Robin?

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Yes and no.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,640
The restaurant, the chain restaurant Red Robin,

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,880
I mean, it's part of it.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,040
That's the environment where we meet our protagonist.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,000
And our protagonist is of course

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,320
Red Robin's beloved walk around character Red.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,820
Red, you know it.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,840
You've been to Red Robin.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,760
You're a Red Robin probably every week,

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,680
as I'm sure all of us are.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Beloved American watering hole.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
And one of the best parts about being there

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,560
is when our good pal Red walks in.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,000
Red, the bird, with all of their qualities

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,880
and things that we know about Red.

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,880
When Red comes in, it's like, oh boy, we're in for it.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,040
Yeah, Red's here.

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,080
We know, when Red's here the party's on.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
And I just wanna make sure when we make the title

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
for this episode, we're gonna say Red from Red Robin,

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
because I don't want people thinking we're talking about

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,520
Red from Pirates of the Caribbean.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,200
I don't want people thinking we're talking about

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,040
Sammy Hagar, the Red Rocker.

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,720
And there's a Red from that 70s show.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Oh, the guy from Robocop, yeah.

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,680
Kirkwood?

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,600
Smith?

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,440
Yeah.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,240
I remember a Red characters.

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,560
Isn't it a pet name on Mad Men for?

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Oh, maybe.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,440
I was on a Mad Men, Jason Mad Men guy.

43
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,360
Yeah, I think occasionally, yeah, one of them.

44
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,000
Maybe John Slattery's character would call her that.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,800
He would've liked Red Robin, I think.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,520
There's, you know, mixology is a big,

47
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,360
but I think they call it Mad Mixology.

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,840
I don't have to explain the basics.

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Red Robin does?

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,680
Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,520
Oh, I didn't know that.

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Yeah, their bar branding is that they have Mad Mixology,

53
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,760
and which I, for this episode, did a little trip

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,160
to a Red Robin yesterday, and saw a lot of drinks going by,

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,280
and saw a lot of colors going by.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
They are all about the bright colors.

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,760
Blue Curacao is flowing at Red Robin in crazy,

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,400
bulbous glasses that are like the beakers

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,840
that a scientist would use.

60
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,880
So if you want a bourne, if you just

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,120
want to pour a little whiskey into a glass, sip it, sadly,

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,320
this isn't your place.

63
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,000
But if you want crazy mixology experimenting

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,720
in the shadow of a red bird, you got to go to Red Robin.

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,480
They've done stuff.

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,760
I mean, in the past, they had like, it wasn't a,

67
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,120
or maybe they had a drink too, but they had like a Wolverine

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,480
tie-in 10 years ago called the Berserker Burger here.

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,240
Oh, I remember this.

70
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
I saw that there was a Berserker.

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,960
I didn't know this was related to an IP.

72
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,480
It's reliable.

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,960
This is from 2013.

74
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,440
Whoa.

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,560
Is it being stabbed by Wolverine claws?

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,280
Yes, Wolverine has the hamburger on his claws,

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,200
and it's sticking up.

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
Does it get cut in multiple pieces instead of just half?

79
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,160
Not in the promotional image I'm looking at,

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,000
but perhaps somewhere else.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But yeah, they do fun stuff is really my point here.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,920
And I will always remember the Wolverine.

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,200
Oh, here, look at this.

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,760
It says, claws on this deal.

85
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,680
Get $3 off at your movie tickets.

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,720
What's claws on this deal?

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,080
So Wolverine has three claws on each hand.

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,400
And he's got the movie ticket.

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,840
Yeah, but what is the, still, what is the phrase, claws

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,480
on this deal?

91
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,960
Well, you could say your claws.

92
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,160
Claws could also be hands.

93
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,080
Get your hands on this deal?

94
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,880
Get your hands on this deal and get $3 off.

95
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,080
Yeah, you'd say hands on this deal.

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,320
Instead, you say claws on this deal.

97
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,400
Well, because the claws are Wolverine and the movie ticket

98
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,920
deal.

99
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,440
No, I get it.

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,480
Look, I know he has claws.

101
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,600
I'm just still, it's not really like a common phrase

102
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,680
that it's turning on its head.

103
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,960
Well, get your hands on this deal is a common phrase,

104
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,560
I feel like.

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,520
Well, get your, I think it needs the qualifier of get your.

106
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,760
Is that in there?

107
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,240
It is saying, oh, in tiny letters, it says get your.

108
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,840
OK, that helps.

109
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,760
OK, get your.

110
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,720
It was hidden by another icon.

111
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
That's all I needed.

112
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,200
OK, OK.

113
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,880
Maybe make that typeface a little bigger.

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,040
Otherwise, I have no notes for this berserker burger tie

115
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,320
in from 2013.

116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,920
Get $3 off your meal, including our limited time

117
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,840
berserker burger, when you flash your Wolverine ticket stub

118
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,920
July 29 through August 1.

119
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Can I show it for a longer time than just a flash,

120
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,880
or can it, do I have to pretend I'm

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,640
like revealing that I have drugs and then

122
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,280
hiding it really quickly?

123
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
I think you should flash it.

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,880
You have a big, you wear a big trench coat

125
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,080
and you kind of flash it and you have it sucked inside.

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,400
Make sure you say, yeah, it's the magic word.

127
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,960
They do bring you three knives and make

128
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,160
you put them between your fingers.

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,600
And then you have to put the ticket stub through at least

130
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
one of the knives.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,480
You know, yes, one of them fell.

132
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,080
It bounced on the table.

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,400
It took my kid's leg.

134
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,160
This has not been the dream movie meal night I imagined.

135
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,120
2013 is the worst year ever.

136
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,480
Can someone correct me if I'm wrong?

137
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Because I've never been to a Red Robin.

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,520
Oh, what?

139
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,240
Well, I know that's surprising, right?

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,400
Oh, my god, we should have gone.

141
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,680
I didn't realize that you had never been.

142
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,560
There's those that are, these happen.

143
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,160
I think I've maybe never been in an Applebee's.

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
What?

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,520
Sometimes you just miss these places.

146
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,640
I've been to both of them in Chili's, right?

147
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,800
Yeah, I've been in Chili's.

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Oh, of course.

149
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm a lot on this earth.

150
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,240
I made a point of going to Chili's,

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,800
but you were saying, Jason.

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,680
One of their selling, one of their marketing bits

153
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,280
is like unlimited fries, right?

154
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
They'll keep bringing you fries.

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,640
Bottomless fries.

156
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,680
Bottomless fries.

157
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,400
Well, I like that.

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,320
Although I don't think I'd get,

159
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,240
I don't think I'd get through,

160
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,000
I can eat like five or six fries.

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,240
They're not one of my pig out go-tos.

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,080
Okay.

163
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,160
Wait, wait, five or six single fries?

164
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,840
Yeah, I'm not a big fry guy.

165
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

166
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,520
This is shocking, actually.

167
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,720
Wait, McDonald's only five or six fries?

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,400
I will eat like a small fry from McDonald's,

169
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,240
which is probably more like, what do you think?

170
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,280
12, 15?

171
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,120
20?

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,080
20 maybe, and then I'll feel bad afterwards.

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Really?

174
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,760
Yeah.

175
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,720
How do I not know this?

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,600
I'm not a big fry guy.

177
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,520
Any kind, crinkle cut, waffle fries, sweet potato?

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
I think they're delicious.

179
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,480
I usually just feel bad.

180
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,800
I like a crinkle cut.

181
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
I love a seasoned curly fry.

182
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
That's probably my number one.

183
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,280
Waffle fries.

184
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,000
Hardee's has like a seasoned curly fry.

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
They do, yeah.

186
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Or Arby's.

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
Arby's, yeah.

188
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,360
Yeah.

189
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,440
Maybe Hardee's too, I forget.

190
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,680
I think some of my trying to not be awful to myself

191
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,000
diet-wise most of the time is that I know

192
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,720
if I'm in a place with fries, I am gonna go nuts.

193
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,360
I am a fry guy, I would say,

194
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
and that's just a great weekend indulgence,

195
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,960
and I know it's not good, but if I try to be better

196
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,320
throughout the week, if I try to be a good person,

197
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,680
yeah, from Sunday to Friday.

198
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,720
Red Robin has a couple different kinds of fries.

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
I think so, because I saw some boring small ones

200
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
going by, and I got concerned,

201
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,360
so I made a point of saying steak fries.

202
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh, I like steak fries.

203
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,560
Yes, I mean, bottomless steak fries is a pretty good situation.

204
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
Like, Fat Burger has steak fries.

205
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah.

206
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,840
I really like.

207
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,680
We can get the fat and skinny.

208
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Yes.

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,760
And that signature fat burger soaking wet food.

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,360
The bag is wet.

211
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,680
The weight is long.

212
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
The weight is long.

213
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
The price is expensive.

214
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
It's like sweaty and all.

215
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,960
I find them to be like hot rooms.

216
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,600
That's my recollection of Fat Burger.

217
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
They're tiny rooms that are very warm.

218
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
They're like little shacks where the food is made.

219
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,120
The cost of a meal is like $19.

220
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,160
Yes, not cheap.

221
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,200
Yeah.

222
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,680
And then you have to wait 25 minutes to get it.

223
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
I still do it on occasion, but it's not,

224
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,040
if you're looking for something fast and cheaper.

225
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,360
Well, I retired on a high note with Fat Burger,

226
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,160
where I had a hookup to have free Fat Burger on the strip.

227
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,760
I got to walk in and they said, get whatever you want.

228
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,920
I forget what the hookup was,

229
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,440
but I had a big, which included a beer.

230
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,840
And I swear that's why I was,

231
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,120
because then the thing I did after was go see Jurassic World

232
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,760
at a strip movie theater.

233
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,480
And I think that's why I was kind of apologetic

234
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
to Jurassic World,

235
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,560
because I was in such a great mood

236
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
from that free Fat Burger.

237
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
Wow.

238
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,800
You talking Vegas strip or sunset strip, my man?

239
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Oh, Vegas strip.

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,480
Oh, okay.

241
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,140
Oh yeah, to be not even,

243
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,740
the discomfort of not my own state.

244
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Where can I go?

245
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,500
Where can I get nourishment?

246
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,580
Wait a minute, I have a ticket now for free Fat Burger.

247
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,620
Well, thank you for this sumptuous meal.

248
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,860
Harvest, yes.

249
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh boy.

250
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,660
Could you imagine if someone gave that offer to Mike

251
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,820
about the Taco Bell Cantina in Vegas?

252
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,900
We never see him again.

253
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,980
We lost, there's no more food.

254
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,540
We were shutting down for a week.

255
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,740
Big colorful yard, first of all, with the slush in it.

256
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,580
Oh yeah.

257
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,380
And then, I could say my order maybe,

258
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,380
but cheesy gritty to crunch, Chalupa Supreme,

259
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,660
maybe Softshell Taco Supreme as well.

260
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,220
And then, I don't know, Cinnamon Twists.

261
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,860
And if you're getting a slush, what's the slush?

262
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,620
I don't know the slushes they have offhand.

263
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,540
They bought a blast slush.

264
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,380
Yeah.

265
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,820
And they'll pour like a shot of vodka in it.

266
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,180
I might just go like a cherry.

267
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,020
Yeah?

268
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,840
Some standard cherry.

269
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
Okay.

270
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,520
Get my mouth nice and red.

271
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,060
Can you spike it at that cantina though?

272
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,900
Yeah.

273
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,060
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,180
We went in the one in Times Square.

275
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,020
Well yeah, we talked about it.

276
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,860
Yeah, it was chaos.

277
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,700
Yeah, it was chaos.

278
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,620
Yeah, there was a lot going on in there.

279
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,780
Yeah.

280
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,020
So anyway.

281
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,460
Well then you'd love the mad mixology of Red Robin.

282
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,980
Look, well it's, all right, well then, okay,

283
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,580
Jason's never been.

284
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,220
The Bottomless Fry is not an attraction to you.

285
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,740
Mike, general thoughts about Red Robin?

286
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,580
About Red Robin?

287
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,920
I mean, I'm not a huge Red Robin guy,

288
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,580
but I like Red Robin.

289
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,260
And it's a place I feel like I would go,

290
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,460
or I have gone to, and I haven't been in a few years,

291
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,820
but every other year, probably before the pandemic,

292
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,660
one, maybe once a year.

293
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,380
It would still be every other year, interesting.

294
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
Not too many.

295
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,340
I haven't been in a long time.

296
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,940
And I, you know what, what's so funny,

297
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,780
I actually didn't even think about this until just,

298
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,820
just right before recording, and we didn't eat there,

299
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,860
but I have a photo with Red on my Instagram

300
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,700
from a couple of years ago.

301
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,420
Wow, wow.

302
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,260
Wow.

303
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,380
With the statue, because that's one of the ways that Red,

304
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,860
the beloved mascot and bird is represented,

305
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,740
is with kind of a pretty, pretty short guy.

306
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,900
It's like half your height.

307
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,120
And some, often those are elevated.

308
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,020
Sometimes those are up on some pedestal,

309
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,900
but there is just on the ground.

310
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,420
And how'd you feel hanging with Red?

311
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,740
Well, I liked hanging with Red.

312
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,980
We hadn't had Red Robin.

313
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,460
I think we just went to see Uncut Gems.

314
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,420
It was 2019.

315
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,980
There was still, so is that, what Red Robin is that?

316
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Glendale?

317
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,020
Stratford Square Mall, Illinois, baby.

318
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,940
Oh, you're back at, oh, nice.

319
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,780
Oh, gotcha.

320
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,580
Stratford Square is where they had the waterfall.

321
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,140
Oh, yes, we're talking about that.

322
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
Yeah, that sounds great.

323
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,540
And a big part of the reason I took it

324
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,180
is I was wearing an Orange Cassidy t-shirt

325
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,320
and he's a professional wrestler

326
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,660
and he's like a very lazy one

327
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,220
and he kind of holds up like a lazy thumbs up.

328
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,900
So Red was holding up a thumbs up in this photo.

329
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,740
It's kind of lazy too.

330
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,220
So I decided that it made sense

331
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,260
with the shirt I had been wearing already.

332
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,180
Oh, that's great.

333
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,740
Well, let me say, it's a very mall-oriented restaurant.

334
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,100
Not always, there's certainly freestanding ones,

335
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,880
but I associate them with like,

336
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,780
it's in that indoor-outdoor slot.

337
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,220
It's on the border of the mall.

338
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,060
Yes.

339
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,140
We could walk up from the parking lot.

340
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,340
Maybe you're on the patio or you're on the indoor patio,

341
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,820
which is more in the mall hallway,

342
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
or you can be right in the center

343
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,500
where the action is in the bar.

344
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,140
I mean, I associate it with

345
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,100
that it was a restaurant for kids

346
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,260
with a little more going on.

347
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,620
There's a bit of a party and a fest.

348
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,860
I think it's probably a great place

349
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,580
to go with like the Boy Scout troop

350
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,780
or the baseball team after the game.

351
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,140
There's a little bit of,

352
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,020
it's not just sitting and eating quietly.

353
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,860
Maybe today it is, but it's-

354
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,140
I know what you mean, and I remember the vibe,

355
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,700
but I also remember going anywhere directly

356
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,820
after a baseball game and those terrible pants

357
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,180
and cleats that we had to wear.

358
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,020
And the stirrups.

359
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,060
You're uncomfortable.

360
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,900
You were in stirrups?

361
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,500
Yeah, there's like, isn't that the name of them?

362
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,340
They're the socks that kind of-

363
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,460
The long socks?

364
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,880
Yeah, but it was like it would go around your foot.

365
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,140
Like it wasn't- Right.

366
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,700
It would just kind of go under.

367
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,460
Yeah, I would like put those on

368
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,700
and then push them as low, like the tops.

369
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,780
You weren't wearing them correctly.

370
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,460
I don't like high socks.

371
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,820
Yeah, I do not care for them.

372
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,220
Uh-huh, so you weren't in the mood to eat after all this.

373
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,260
No, yeah, sitting in a cup

374
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,060
and an uncomfortable like pair of baseball pants.

375
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,060
Like, oh yeah, give me unlimited fries.

376
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,220
I am surprised this isn't up your alley.

377
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,580
Oh no, I will for sure take advantage

378
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,700
of the unlimited fries.

379
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,860
I just know like, well, that's the day.

380
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,580
Man, I feel like, I feel like shit.

381
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,260
I just want to get those days.

382
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
I went yesterday.

383
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,540
I feel pretty bad from Red Robin still,

384
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
it's stuck with me.

385
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,340
But you know what I mean?

386
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,760
Like it's certainly not,

387
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,660
this is why I think why I wanted to talk about it

388
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,300
is just to analyze the odd place that Red Robin

389
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,500
and its character Red occupy

390
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,140
where it is not full on mini theme park.

391
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,180
And it's like Chuck E. Cheese by any means.

392
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,340
So it's a weird, okay, restaurants from our childhoods

393
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,100
where you might see a guy walking around

394
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,300
or you might see a colorful friend.

395
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,020
Chuck E. Cheese, number one.

396
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,580
Maybe McDonald's, there were occasional scenarios

397
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,780
where a character's walking around

398
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,500
or they're represented via the Playland,

399
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,580
but pretty rare.

400
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,220
I guess Burger King in that sense too.

401
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,540
Maybe you just see like a cutout of the kid's club

402
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,860
or whatever it is.

403
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,340
Only Red Robin is the other one where,

404
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,980
and then a character's gonna walk around.

405
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,500
In terms of it's like something close to your house.

406
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,460
Yeah, I mean we had a place called Shoney's.

407
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,020
We've talked about this before.

408
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,140
That's a chain that there was one managed

409
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,940
by professional wrestler, Scott Steiner,

410
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,820
which is really funny, but that closed.

411
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,740
But Shoney had Shoney Bear.

412
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,580
Oh, right.

413
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,980
And it was a similar thing to this

414
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,220
where once in a while I think if we were at Shoney's,

415
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,980
which we didn't go too often because it was bad,

416
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,020
excuse me,

417
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,580
that Shoney Bear would walk around.

418
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,380
So you get a little taste of character.

419
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,300
Were you excited to see Shoney Bear?

420
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,740
Slightly, yeah.

421
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,620
Were you excited to see Red?

422
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,100
Do you have any memories of Red?

423
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,260
I don't believe I've ever seen Red in person.

424
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,380
You've never seen a Red walking around?

425
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,220
I don't think so.

426
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,020
I found an, okay, this is like three or four years old.

427
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,660
I found an offer up listing of someone selling a Red,

428
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,500
full Red.

429
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,340
Full Red costume.

430
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,380
Oh, there's a Red on the ground.

431
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,500
$80.

432
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,340
$80 for Red?

433
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,260
$80 for Red?

434
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,780
Can you buy it?

435
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,620
No, I think it's an old listing.

436
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,460
I think that's done.

437
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
We need to get that.

438
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,620
It's unclear.

439
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,820
It's not a well-designed website.

440
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,380
It's unclear if it actually sold

441
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,620
or this is just like a dead link or whatever.

442
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,180
That website is hard to map.

443
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,140
Yeah.

444
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,620
I've recently tried it.

445
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,220
It's great to buy nothing.

446
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,540
Those kinds of trade or offer up are very good.

447
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,460
Those are good that they're around, I think.

448
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,300
Right.

449
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,980
But yes, very hard to use.

450
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,540
I'd be curious if listeners can name more

451
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,420
that I'm forgetting about,

452
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,900
kind of like restaurant walk-arounds.

453
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,900
There's maybe the weird flesh-colored shrimp from Bubba Gump

454
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,940
whose name I always forget.

455
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,780
I cannot retain the name of Bubba Gump.

456
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,620
I always forget it too.

457
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,460
Let me look this up.

458
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,900
It's just not natural, whatever it is.

459
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,540
It's not Bubba Gump.

460
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,580
That's two character names.

461
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,860
Yeah, I'm trying to think of chain restaurants

462
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,220
because obviously with the theme park stuff,

463
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,660
Dr. Toothsome or whatever his name is,

464
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,940
Professor Toothsome, he's got a whole range of characters.

465
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,900
But it does, I'm trying to think of like Fridays,

466
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Chili's, Applebee's, Olive Garden, Outback.

467
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,340
Yeah.

468
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,180
Those are all pretty part and parcel.

469
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,020
Fridays.

470
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,420
Kind of like, it's the weekend, kick back,

471
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,940
bring the family.

472
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,780
There's a bunch of stuff on the walls.

473
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,020
It's the only Red Robin I think has somebody walking around.

474
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,820
And I always just found it odd

475
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,500
that there's full on Chuck E. Cheese

476
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,980
where there might be a bunch of characters in a robot

477
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,380
and then there's this, then there's this.

478
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,180
Because I do remember Red walking around the restaurant

479
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,300
when I'm there.

480
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,140
And what I remember is getting very stressed out.

481
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,980
I don't want Red over here.

482
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,420
What is Red?

483
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,020
What is, this is mainly the question I wanted to ask.

484
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,740
You've now you've all seen pictures of Red the Bird,

485
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,700
maybe listeners had experiences where Red's hanging out,

486
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,060
he comes to your table.

487
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
What is he?

488
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,100
What are we supposed to take from,

489
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,660
all right, Red's here, now what?

490
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,980
Is he a Cardinal?

491
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,580
Well, he's a Robin.

492
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,420
He's a Robin?

493
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,260
Yes.

494
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,100
Oh, Red Robin, yeah.

495
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,700
All right, so we know that.

496
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,060
He's a Red Robin.

497
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,900
He's a Red Robin.

498
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,860
Do we know he or she?

499
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,140
Because the name could go either way.

500
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,020
I think usually played by a female, I would think.

501
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,460
Yeah, the costumes tend to run smaller, I saw.

502
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,580
Newer Red is kind of slimmer.

503
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,300
The one that you saw,

504
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,180
the one that you showed us in a puddle on the ground

505
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
was pretty slim.

506
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,300
So you're basically sort of,

507
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,780
you're saying like with Chuck E. Cheese

508
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,860
or any of these other, even McDonaldland characters,

509
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,100
like you have something going in.

510
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,980
You have a knowledge of the character beforehand.

511
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,540
You know sort of what to expect.

512
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,660
If the Hamburglar, first of all, this is a dream.

513
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,100
I never met the Hamburglar in person,

514
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,260
but if I did, I would know, I like this guy,

515
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,540
but I should be worried about him.

516
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,420
Yes, and he might get up to hijinks.

517
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,340
Exactly, you kind of know what to expect.

518
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,780
Even with Chuck E. Cheese, you know,

519
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,820
you kind of knew what to expect.

520
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,660
With Red Robin.

521
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,060
Even though we are characterization of him

522
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,060
is that he's kind of sly and lascivious or whatever.

523
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,260
But really he's just, he likes birthdays.

524
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,460
So he comes out in a tux,

525
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,660
and you know he's gonna be happy to see ya.

526
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,020
He's gonna be nice.

527
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,780
I guess Red is nice, but is he?

528
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,940
What is he?

529
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,380
Well, I mean, Red is, I think he probably,

530
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,420
it's a Mickey situation, we've talked about this before,

531
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,700
when Disney took away some of Mickey's personality

532
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,100
and his aggressiveness.

533
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,220
They wanna make a character that is,

534
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,620
you can basically imprint your own personality on them

535
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,180
because they don't have one.

536
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,580
So you can see what you wanna see in Red.

537
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,060
Red is sort of a mirror maybe to our inner selves.

538
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,100
So if you wanna see Red as like just sort of a nice person

539
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,820
who works, or a nice bird that works at the restaurant,

540
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,340
that's what you can see.

541
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,540
So it's really like, they're trying to keep Red neutral.

542
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,100
You know, number one, not to offend, I suppose.

543
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,580
You know, with like, you know,

544
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,980
Chucky's a lascivious, he's not lascivious.

545
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,540
He's not smoking a cigar or anything.

546
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,260
But then two, yeah, you also, like if you're a kid,

547
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,180
you can decide what Red's personality is.

548
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,500
Well, I got a couple thoughts about everything you're saying.

549
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,340
I know what you mean.

550
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,580
Maybe you're like, okay, if you're saying

551
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,700
that he's an aspirational, he's whatever you want.

552
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,660
He is aspirational.

553
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,300
I know you didn't say that, but I'm putting that on it.

554
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,260
What we know is that he walks around a restaurant,

555
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,780
everybody's like pointing at him, they're happy to see him.

556
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,260
Is that not what we want?

557
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,420
Maybe we don't wanna be huge celebrities,

558
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,220
but we wanna, it's like, you know, Scott entered the room,

559
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,220
everybody's like, hey, and Red has that.

560
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,340
Maybe though, I wasn't happy to see Red

561
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,980
because I didn't understand him.

562
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,820
What's it gonna be when he comes over here?

563
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,220
How would you, but here's a question.

564
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,660
Are you not, you're not happy to see him?

565
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,140
Because I'm trying to think of a scenario

566
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,220
where a person in a suit, in an animal suit,

567
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,380
the person in Clriz, the person in black and brown,

568
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,940
they turn red and they walk away waiting to be seen.

569
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,260
Let's say he's actually gay,

570
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,700
I don't really understand what your response would be.

571
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,260
Berkeley Bournemouth.

572
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,380
She would say no.

573
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,420
Charlotte McChesley, she would say to me,

574
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,500
no, she is gay.

575
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,940
We're kinda people like this,

576
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,900
into a different universe that are really beige

577
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,300
but women I know, daddy thinks are pretty white.

578
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,220
A restaurant, a water park,

579
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,700
I was gonna say toilet store,

580
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,820
that's not what I meant.

581
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820
I meant like a appliance store.

582
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,260
And a big toilet is walking around.

583
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,180
I don't care if I'm at the toilet store.

584
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,820
If I'm somewhere and any suited character

585
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,220
emerges from any door,

586
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,140
they don't even have to work there.

587
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,660
If they come in the front door,

588
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,780
I mean, maybe if they're acting erratically,

589
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,620
I'll be a little scared.

590
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,460
But other than that,

591
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,100
if they're just like kind of waving their arms in general,

592
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,620
I'm going to be delighted.

593
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,540
It doesn't mean, it doesn't matter if it looks like shit.

594
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,380
It doesn't matter if the costume is old.

595
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,980
It doesn't matter what animal it is.

596
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,460
All suited characters are good.

597
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,540
Even the pervert Elmo in Times Square,

598
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm just imagining,

599
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,860
like I'm just imagining hypothetical pervert

600
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,820
wearing an Elmo costume.

601
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,380
As long as he's not doing anything

602
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,260
and he just kind of looks gross and dirty,

603
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,900
he's still good as long as he's not committing any crimes.

604
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,460
You're happy just to see the suit itself is good.

605
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,700
The suit itself.

606
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,340
Yeah, let's take the person out of it just in case.

607
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,260
The suit and the idea that somebody would be walking around

608
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,300
in a suit is good.

609
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,100
Walking around in a suit is good no matter where it is.

610
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,940
Do you agree with me?

611
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,380
Yeah, I will stop what I'm doing and go like,

612
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,500
look, who's that?

613
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
What is that?

614
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Especially if it's like, yeah, a small business

615
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,820
or like a one location place that invested some money

616
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,260
in getting a costume that a teenager's wearing.

617
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,500
Even better, yeah.

618
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,540
We have Charlie Chip at Fry's, of course.

619
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,660
That's a high level mascot.

620
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,300
So thrilled to hang out with Charlie Chip.

621
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,420
And I love that there's like kind of a weird,

622
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,300
that there would be the time taken

623
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,460
to put an IP into this original chain.

624
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,700
But I guess what I'm asking is like,

625
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
you're saying Red Robin,

626
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,540
like you don't know what Red's about.

627
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,420
Tell me, Charlie Chip is a microchip

628
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,460
who is a mascot for now defunct Fry's Electronics

629
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,180
and he's a smiling anthropomorphic microchip.

630
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,700
He's got arms and legs and a big red tongue.

631
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,780
Tell me what you know about Charlie Chip.

632
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,660
Well, he likes costumes.

633
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,860
He's in a different costume.

634
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,700
He likes?

635
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,540
Everywhere you see him.

636
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,660
So he is imbued with the spirit of the theme of the,

637
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,660
which might reflect the city of where they are.

638
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,940
So I think that Charlie Chip has a lot of regional pride

639
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,300
and he respects industry,

640
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,020
he's like the space industry or the entertainment industry

641
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,140
in different towns.

642
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,060
He's a cosplayer.

643
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,540
He likes to dress up.

644
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,500
Okay, so we know a little bit about him.

645
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,740
Yeah, there's something.

646
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,580
Yeah.

647
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,420
So there's something there.

648
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
Yeah.

649
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,260
I think it was more,

650
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,500
look, I agree with you now.

651
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,260
And look, I went to a Red Rob and I really wanted to see Red.

652
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,380
I was like, if I, the lottery would be

653
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,140
if I saw Red the Bird walking around today,

654
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,140
but it was a pretty like quiet 1130 lunch in Redondo Beach.

655
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,260
Oh yeah, Red in coming out.

656
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,700
So there's no, no, no, no.

657
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,940
But I think, but did you feel this way as a kid?

658
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,940
Because I was scared sometimes of mascots

659
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,620
even if I knew them.

660
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,740
You know, I know this character,

661
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,620
but what if they sit on me like the Pinocchio cat did?

662
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,820
Yeah, no, I was afraid of all the mascot character.

663
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,660
I was afraid.

664
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,820
I met the, look, I met the Ninja Turtles.

665
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,820
They signed my box of cookies when I was five, four or five.

666
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,460
And it was, I believe Donatello and Michelangelo.

667
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,740
And I'm trying to remember,

668
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,860
I think it was maybe a place called Cub Foods,

669
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,380
which is a grocery store that maybe is,

670
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,220
I don't think it's still around.

671
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,980
Ninja Turtles at Cub Foods today.

672
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,820
Yeah. Huge.

673
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,940
So we saw it.

674
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,860
It was, I think a weekend.

675
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,340
We went over there and I just remember

676
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,500
being in one of the aisles and peering out

677
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,420
and being like, oh my God, the Ninja Turtles are here.

678
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,020
They look a little fucked up today.

679
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,460
They look a little weird.

680
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,260
They look a little fluffy.

681
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,100
They're not talking.

682
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,940
You're different in person.

683
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,620
I've heard that about movie stars.

684
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,740
They're not talking.

685
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,800
They don't look like the movie.

686
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,060
They don't look like the cartoon.

687
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,900
But I guess this is what they look like.

688
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,180
Why else?

689
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,700
These aren't some imposters.

690
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,140
But I do remember being afraid.

691
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,220
Yeah, is Donatello gonna wail on me with his bowstaff?

692
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,620
I don't know.

693
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,780
I don't think he's gonna do that.

694
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,620
But there's always a chance

695
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,620
because they do have their,

696
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,340
I think they probably do not have their weapons on them.

697
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,980
But maybe.

698
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,100
The intimidation factor of meeting somebody famous.

699
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,780
Red is not famous, but Red's in the logo.

700
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,340
So you sense that Red is a big deal.

701
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,180
Yeah.

702
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,900
I remember, I think I've said this on the show before

703
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,380
that I was afraid of some of these characters,

704
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,820
but I was really excited to do a character breakfast.

705
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,420
But then I found a picture of me just full on

706
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,140
excitedly hugging Mickey or something.

707
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,780
And I think that's the thing with kids.

708
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,100
And that's what, at least for me,

709
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,820
was I was nervous, nervous, nervous, nervous, nervous.

710
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,660
I'm gonna hug you.

711
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,480
Oh, okay.

712
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,320
You go like.

713
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,300
Then in the moment you look.

714
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,780
Yeah, right before.

715
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,340
I don't think I hugged the Ninja Turtles,

716
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,380
but I definitely, you wanted to hug them.

717
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,540
Like I want to see Donatello,

718
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
but I can't.

719
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,340
I think, okay, when I saw Red coming.

720
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,180
And when was this?

721
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,380
When did you see Red coming?

722
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,860
Let's see.

723
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,780
When did I see Red coming?

724
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,900
Sounds like someone's name.

725
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,660
When would I have gone there?

726
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,780
I'm like in the eight or nine range

727
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,140
is what I'm imagining.

728
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,980
Okay.

729
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,300
Calabasas, it's called Lovies delicatessen now,

730
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,460
this freestanding Red Robin is no more.

731
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,860
Oh man.

732
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,460
Lovies seems fairly quality from what I could tell.

733
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,660
But like, so Red's coming table to table with a handler.

734
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
It's kind of like a wedding table to table,

735
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,700
which I think is kind of a stressful interaction.

736
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,140
You're trying to like get a moment,

737
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,140
even though there's a bunch of people with you.

738
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,220
But what do you even say?

739
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,500
Hey, well, you did it great.

740
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,140
Still awkward no matter what you're sitting there standing.

741
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,100
It's weird.

742
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,260
But here's the thing,

743
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,940
I think Red would come and sit at your table.

744
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,260
And that I think intimidated.

745
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,460
I was like, then what?

746
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,300
Then what's gonna happen?

747
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,940
Like it's Hooters?

748
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Like, yeah.

749
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,620
The waitress would sit at your table at Hooters?

750
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,780
A lot of chain restaurants were doing that for a while.

751
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,580
Like I feel like Outback would do that.

752
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,700
They would pull up a chair.

753
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,020
Yeah, you're right, Outback would do that as well.

754
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,340
Maybe like in the cool teacher way.

755
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,620
Cause there, I feel like you encountered Red.

756
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,980
Red made enough of an impression that like,

757
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,820
there was an episode.

758
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,420
Enough to be here today doing this.

759
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,100
There was an episode recently where,

760
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,740
and we talk about it on the episode,

761
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,540
where you were very concerned for a couple days.

762
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,300
Like, is there, there, there?

763
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,380
Like, is there enough here?

764
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,620
But Red, you were very confident.

765
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,300
You never dropped, you never were like, it's like,

766
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,340
oh, I got it. That's a very good point.

767
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,140
Oh, no, no, no, no, not at all.

768
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,540
I still today was thinking,

769
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,420
because you know what a listener suggested this.

770
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,460
And I was thinking, do I name the listener?

771
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,340
I don't think I do,

772
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,900
because I don't want to put this on them.

773
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,500
If the Red episode happens and the Red episode is nothing,

774
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,060
I don't want that on this listener.

775
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,620
This is Scott's folly through and through,

776
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,820
if nobody cares about Red.

777
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,660
I think so.

778
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,500
We've gotten gold out of folly before.

779
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,340
That's why I'm gold.

780
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,260
A folly can be good.

781
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,900
A folly does not always end in despair.

782
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
I think this suggests though,

783
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,260
that you do on some, maybe next level,

784
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,020
have some appreciation. Primordial level.

785
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,020
Something that you're not even in touch with,

786
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,500
you are connected to Red because of your-

787
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,460
Oh, the fact that I said,

788
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,260
there was no question to me when I saw the tweet.

789
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,500
You saw it and you want to talk about Red?

790
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,260
I need to talk about Red.

791
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,540
We need to figure out exactly what it is,

792
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,860
if there's some sort of childhood thing linked to Red.

793
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,620
Did you like Cardinals or Robbins as a child?

794
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,060
Red character?

795
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,940
He never got to Birdwatch.

796
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,100
Elmo?

797
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,620
I mean, Elmo's a little after our time.

798
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,460
Yeah, a little bit.

799
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,300
As far as being so popular.

800
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,900
You're probably Elmo now.

801
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,260
I think, well, okay.

802
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,820
I think it's the confusion.

803
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,420
It's that I just didn't know what to do and maybe then,

804
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,980
I've blacked out on what the actual Red interaction was.

805
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,460
I don't know what happened when he got there.

806
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,420
But none of it, the awkwardness of Red

807
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,820
was never enough to make me not like Red Robin,

808
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,740
which up until recently, I was still saying,

809
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,780
oh, Red Robins are kind of good.

810
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,340
And then I said this, you know,

811
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,220
10 or so years ago to Erin, my wife,

812
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,100
and she said, Red Robin, Jesus.

813
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,940
And I said, what?

814
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,900
What do you have against Red Robin?

815
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,300
And she told a story that unlocks a lot.

816
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,060
And this is really what I really wanted to talk about.

817
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,060
So this is maybe what happens when Red is around.

818
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,420
So Red comes out.

819
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,220
She's there with her family,

820
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,940
with her mom who listens to the show.

821
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,300
Hi.

822
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,780
She, Erin's mom got a gift certificate

823
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,260
for helping out with the soccer program.

824
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,100
So they have a free meal waiting for them at Red Robin.

825
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,380
But I think that she's not necessarily excited

826
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,900
because she's like, I will do the free meal,

827
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,220
but I have a sense that I'm not really gonna like it here.

828
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,140
Is it kind of a kid's zoo restaurant?

829
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,860
Is the food maybe not very good?

830
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,100
So she's coming in with a little bit of prejudice

831
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,540
towards the Red Robin experience.

832
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,460
Then they get to their booth,

833
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,380
Red comes out and Red sits down with them.

834
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,980
So Red is just fully part of the table now.

835
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,340
Erin's mom, Erin and her sister

836
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,900
starts musing up hair of both kids,

837
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,660
which is that's a little invasive

838
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,420
and a little bit like, eh, okay.

839
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,700
Again, maybe you'd let Mickey do it.

840
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,500
But Red, I just met you.

841
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,580
I know you're in this red circle in front of the restaurant,

842
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,460
but why should I be okay with you musing my hair?

843
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,940
What if you're not good?

844
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,660
And then I think he proved that he is not good because,

845
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,940
so they're already like, okay, stop, stop with the hair.

846
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,700
And then he's like, hmm.

847
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,700
And then he puts his hand down into their bottomless fries.

848
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,620
Nope.

849
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,460
Nope.

850
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,740
And he rubs his hand around.

851
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,580
What?

852
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,900
And then starts pantomiming,

853
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,460
bruh bruh bruh, like you're saying, non-verbal.

854
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,900
You're not supposed to touch and then pantomime.

855
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,060
You're supposed to pantomime the whole time or touch

856
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,540
and then cram it in your weird character mouth.

857
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

858
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,780
Well, and then immediately the handler's

859
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,340
gotta get new fries out there.

860
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,060
But instead he does that and then just gets up and leaves.

861
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,740
And I don't think anyone noticed that the hands were put in.

862
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,780
Aaron's mom is like looking at the hand now.

863
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,620
It is visibly dirty.

864
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,820
Just this crusty red felt hand.

865
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,660
Oh my God.

866
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,940
And I don't know that this is how it ended.

867
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Aaron is not sure, but I think it is possible

868
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,860
that the response to this was just putting

869
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,780
all the gift certificates on the table,

870
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,740
getting up and leaving.

871
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,420
And that was the end of Red Robin.

872
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,820
Aaron certainly never went back.

873
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,940
Aaron's mom definitely did not go back.

874
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,540
That was the end of that.

875
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,660
That is for sure.

876
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,260
That is, okay, here we now know one thing about Red.

877
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,940
He is a health code violator.

878
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,260
Wow, Red.

879
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,820
That's weird.

880
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,060
Don't do that.

881
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,860
They need to eat these fries.

882
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,220
And what's the gunk on his hand from?

883
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,060
Is it oil from previous fry experiences?

884
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,300
Well, there's so many questions that need to be asked.

885
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,980
Like is that, yeah, was Red doing that all night?

886
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,420
Was he trying to get fired?

887
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,260
What was the?

888
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,060
That's not a bad thought.

889
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,900
Cause that is.

890
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,460
I mean, you would want, if you were Red,

891
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,620
I read a story even, I read a story about Red

892
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,740
about a guy who worked at a Denver location

893
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,860
who was made to be Red for something that they needed

894
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,940
and to go pass out onion ring coupons

895
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,620
outside of a movie theater.

896
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,340
And it was so humiliating and everybody was awful to him.

897
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,060
And like, I hope they're paying you well in there,

898
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,300
whoever that is in there.

899
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,420
And he's like, they aren't.

900
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,220
And it's just nothing but unpleasant.

901
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,940
And he just does like a half hour of it

902
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,580
and walks back and quits on the spot.

903
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,420
Wow.

904
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,780
Do not need to be doing this.

905
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,820
Maybe I'm not an adult, but I have dignity.

906
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,060
And the manager is like, I'm sick of you,

907
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,860
goddamn lazy kids.

908
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,380
Wow.

909
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,780
But he walks out.

910
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,780
So Red, being Red, turning Red has made people quit before.

911
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,740
So maybe, yeah, that could have been like,

912
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,300
what can I do today?

913
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,540
I'm gonna touch the children.

914
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,300
Because they might tell you day one, don't touch the kids.

915
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,900
Two, don't touch the food.

916
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,420
And maybe he's like, I'm doing the whole checklist today.

917
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,980
And then I'm out of here.

918
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,900
That, wow, yeah.

919
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,700
Cause like that's, so what year will they mess up hair?

920
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
What year are we talking about?

921
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
Cause I feel like you-

922
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,460
95, 96.

923
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,180
Mascots probably, I mean, mascots, look,

924
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,540
we know hugs are back.

925
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,580
Is hair muscing back?

926
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,580
Should it be?

927
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,500
I think there's like, I think it's expected at Disney.

928
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,100
If you're meeting like the bear

929
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,860
at like the local ice cream store,

930
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,340
if you're meeting like Rocky Road, the bear,

931
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,940
a bear that only exists at like three ice cream stores,

932
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,340
and there's one costume that floats between them.

933
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,780
I think you would wanna-

934
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,620
Hands off the children?

935
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,460
Hands off.

936
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,820
Like, I don't think, you know,

937
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,300
say what you will about those silly old

938
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,100
Chuck E. Cheese training videos.

939
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,380
They are pretty thorough.

940
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,500
Here's how to clean the costume.

941
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,340
Here's how to wear it.

942
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,180
Here's how to behave in the costume.

943
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,740
Like they were on top of stuff.

944
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,620
Chuck has touched my hair though, I think.

945
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,660
Yeah, Chuck, but I feel like Chuck and bigger theme parks,

946
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,580
there's an expectation that like,

947
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,180
oh, they're gonna be a little more friendly.

948
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,380
They're gonna be a little more like,

949
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,180
I don't know that like the dirty ice cream, icy mascot,

950
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,820
like at the local-

951
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,260
Oh, or a slush puppy.

952
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,460
Strawberry festival.

953
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,220
That's the name of the icy character?

954
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,500
He's the name of the slush puppy.

955
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,180
There's a different type of icy called slush puppy.

956
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,020
Oh, sorry, icy has a bear.

957
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,620
Icy has a bear, which I don't know the name of the icy bear.

958
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,460
Yeah, I only know the bear.

959
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,820
I just call him icy bear.

960
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
He's cool.

961
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,900
Is icy bear's name icy bear?

962
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,180
Let's see here.

963
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,740
I think it says it's small.

964
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,060
Like if you look at an icy cup,

965
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,860
it's just kind of a pro of nothing.

966
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,260
It's just like-

967
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,740
Oh, his name is John 360.

968
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,860
Interesting.

969
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,020
It looks like his name is icy bear, yes.

970
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,460
But slush puppy is a different type of icy,

971
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,620
which was my favorite of all the slushies as a child.

972
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,460
And now I feel like a slush puppy

973
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,020
is now being marketed more lately.

974
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,860
So I'm excited about that.

975
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,020
More slush puppy forward.

976
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,700
So yeah, you don't want,

977
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,100
I think you need familiarity.

978
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,940
It helps.

979
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,780
It doesn't forgive.

980
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,860
Oh, I like slush puppy.

981
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,260
Slush puppy's pretty old school.

982
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,940
I like that I want a shirt.

983
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,740
Yeah, they're the people that are making them.

984
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,580
You can get one.

985
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,420
I'll do it.

986
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,260
I'll get a slush puppy shirt.

987
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,340
I didn't grow up with slush puppy.

988
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,100
But isn't that like, don't touch the fries.

989
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,500
That'll color your impression of a whole franchise

990
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,660
if one rogue red decides to rub his dirty mitts

991
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,300
all over your fries.

992
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,980
Don't care if they're bottomless.

993
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,860
What if he rubbed all of them?

994
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,460
I don't know what he's doing back there.

995
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,540
He might have rubbed the raw potatoes.

996
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,980
He might have rubbed each one as it came out of the sack.

997
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,260
I would have been traumatized by that.

998
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,780
That would have been so traumatic because we were so,

999
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,020
like my mom was so like obsessed

1000
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,140
with people touching things with like bare,

1001
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,900
their bare human hands.

1002
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,540
If she saw somebody like handle like a fast food

1003
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,380
with a bare hands, we would get the food,

1004
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,780
we'd pay for it and then she would throw it away.

1005
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,620
Like.

1006
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,740
She would still get it though.

1007
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,580
Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,420
Uh-huh.

1009
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,820
So like there were times when she would like see somebody

1010
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,700
like she, when she felt like somebody wasn't being hygienic

1011
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,820
or something behind a counter and she would like,

1012
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,100
she'd be like, all right, we're not eating this.

1013
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,460
And she would throw the food away.

1014
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,060
This is ironically different than your edginess

1015
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,100
about wasting food or anybody knowing

1016
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,500
you didn't finish your plate.

1017
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,340
Well, yeah.

1018
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,140
I mean, maybe if I had seen them like,

1019
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,100
like rubbing the food with their bare hands,

1020
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,060
like excessively, I suppose, maybe.

1021
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,900
But yes.

1022
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,700
If there was a character, the mini monster at CityWalk

1023
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,820
who dipped his full hand into your boba shake.

1024
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,820
Yeah, yeah.

1025
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,260
That, yes, that would have been, yeah, too much.

1026
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,220
I mean, I'll still do it.

1027
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,980
There was over here though,

1028
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,140
the one and the only times I tried Wiener Schnitzel,

1029
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,620
somebody was really sweating

1030
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,980
when they were giving me the food.

1031
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,460
And I was like, no, thank you.

1032
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,180
And I paid for it and I threw it away.

1033
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,460
You guys said before, my,

1034
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,540
maybe I said this a long time ago,

1035
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,940
but my parents found a piece of broken glass.

1036
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,780
Oh.

1037
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,380
It might've been that Wiener Schnitzel,

1038
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,220
the Burmese Wiener Schnitzel.

1039
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,860
The one across from the Tonight Show?

1040
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,820
I think possibly.

1041
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,660
Yeah.

1042
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,420
Which I think I still have never been to Wiener Schnitzel.

1043
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,620
That again, it is, you only get one chance at any of these.

1044
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,900
Broken glass is bad.

1045
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,220
Red touching the food, the fries is bad.

1046
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,820
A chunk of metal.

1047
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,180
I've heard of that one.

1048
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,020
And a Wiener Schnitzel or something.

1049
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,460
No, like McDonald's or something.

1050
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,300
Oh yeah, sure.

1051
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,460
Rat cooked in the hot dog.

1052
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,780
I saw a full cockroach in a Cheesecake Factory salad

1053
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,060
when I was a kid. Wow.

1054
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,820
My friend next to me,

1055
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,580
but like revealed with like perfectly big leaves

1056
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,140
kind of were pulled out of the way.

1057
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,580
And then just like upside down, dead, giant cockroach.

1058
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,940
I love the Cheesecake Factory now.

1059
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,980
Thank God you recovered because again,

1060
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,700
these are things as a kid that can traumatize you.

1061
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,220
Like I've talked about, I threw up

1062
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,580
and the last thing I ate was a corn dog when I was a kid.

1063
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,780
I have not had a corn dog to this day because of that.

1064
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
Wow.

1065
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,420
So like if a Shoney bear came out

1066
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,100
and grabbed the corn dog rubbed on his butthole or something,

1067
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,900
I would feel like never eating corn dog again.

1068
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,700
Not eating Shoney bear's butthole corn dog.

1069
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,980
One of the worst like food illnesses I ever got

1070
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,380
was from a big, thick, buttery slice of pizza

1071
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,940
from the Getty Center from a school field trip.

1072
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,260
And it was the new Getty Center with the tram

1073
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,420
when it was brand new.

1074
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,260
Why would that have gotten me so sick?

1075
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,100
I don't know.

1076
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,180
So that's why I didn't see that movie

1077
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,380
that Kevin Spacey got removed from.

1078
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,380
It wasn't protest over Spacey getting removed.

1079
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,220
You could have hit it though.

1080
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,580
It's not why I didn't see it.

1081
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,020
And I'm sick of people saying it.

1082
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,980
It's because of the butter pizza.

1083
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,860
The butter pizza, yeah.

1084
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
So yeah, I get that.

1085
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,220
And I get that Red,

1086
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,220
who doesn't have a ton of presence on commercials,

1087
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,060
literally it's up to the performer

1088
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,860
who's being paid minimum wage in a Red Robin

1089
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,300
to shape your opinion of the mascot.

1090
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,140
Yeah.

1091
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,260
You tell me, show me what you are with your actions,

1092
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,940
but not with your dialogue.

1093
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,620
You don't talk.

1094
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,260
So yeah, next time you're at the Red Robin,

1095
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,980
like the Glenda at the Galleria or something,

1096
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,820
I mean, you could ask.

1097
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,500
That one's gone by the way.

1098
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,340
What?

1099
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,500
There's no Glendale.

1100
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,340
No.

1101
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,180
How long has that been gone?

1102
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,380
I think a long time now.

1103
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,420
Five years?

1104
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,580
That's the one I had that I probably eaten at the most.

1105
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,420
Yeah.

1106
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,260
Yeah.

1107
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,340
And that was a very like comforting, again,

1108
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,020
your side mall location.

1109
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,780
I don't know what it is about the,

1110
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,620
it's like beckoning you inside.

1111
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,460
Right.

1112
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,780
It's not gonna be as claustrophobic

1113
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,940
as the fully in the center of the mall locations.

1114
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,820
It's breezy on the outside.

1115
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,660
Yeah.

1116
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,140
Mike, you ate there once and shortly after,

1117
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,220
like I saw you and you talked about it.

1118
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,180
And for whatever reason,

1119
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,180
your praise at the time seemed so enthusiastic.

1120
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,020
For a couple years,

1121
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,020
I thought like Red Robin was one of your go-to chain spots.

1122
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,660
And then I brought it up years later and you're like,

1123
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,940
yeah, I don't really, yeah, that's fine.

1124
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,100
I don't really go to Red Robin.

1125
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,340
I was like, oh, okay.

1126
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,900
Maybe it was like Scott's situation

1127
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,180
where he had the fat burger and he was like,

1128
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,580
I had like a particularly good drink or something.

1129
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,740
I was like, this is the greatest place I've ever been.

1130
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,300
Yeah, Sprite and Rainbow Sherbet.

1131
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,300
And you're like, ah, huzzah.

1132
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,500
Least alcohol.

1133
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,500
A lot of my usual haunts don't know how to make a Carlson.

1134
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,580
There's this thing,

1135
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,500
something they put in the drinks usually

1136
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,060
that I just do not care for.

1137
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,900
It's a special little, yeah.

1138
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,940
Is it for net?

1139
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,300
I mean, so that's why I couldn't go to the Glendale one.

1140
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,900
I had to go a little far away to go to one.

1141
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,740
I'm so sorry.

1142
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,060
Before I talk about my Red Robin experience yesterday,

1143
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,180
I'm gonna say another story

1144
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,020
because I was trying to piece together,

1145
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,540
as you were saying, is there something else,

1146
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,260
I know Aaron's story, but that didn't happen to me.

1147
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Is there anything from my childhood

1148
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,580
that made me need to think about Red for a while?

1149
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,500
So I was on my way out the door to drive to Redondo Beach

1150
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,220
to go to a Red Robin with a friend of the show, Buzz Buzz.

1151
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,900
And my mom came over to babysit

1152
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,180
so that I could do this important mission.

1153
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,020
Sorry to cut you off.

1154
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,820
When you're doing theme park podcast bullshit,

1155
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,900
do you always present it, right?

1156
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,460
Or do you be like, I got something for work?

1157
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,260
Do you say for work or when you?

1158
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,860
She's pretty, I don't feel the need to dress it up.

1159
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,940
Sometimes I present it as if to be laughed at,

1160
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,420
but she gets, she actually is always,

1161
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,620
my mom was a big theme park.

1162
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,740
She raised me in this to love all the,

1163
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,140
yeah, she's like theme park things, I get it.

1164
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,740
She offers so much babysitting

1165
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,900
if we want to do a big Disney day.

1166
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,340
So full credit to her.

1167
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
That's if she ever hears that, that'll make her happy,

1168
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,980
but she won't be happy about this other thing

1169
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,660
I'm gonna say, which is that.

1170
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,180
So I'm on my way out the door.

1171
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,100
I'm like, well, I see I'm, yeah,

1172
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,300
we're doing an episode about Red Robin.

1173
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,220
Not really Red Robin, the character of a,

1174
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,740
so I have to go, why do you have to go so far?

1175
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,580
I don't know, just M,

1176
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,700
it's the one that seems the oldest, okay.

1177
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,740
She kind of grasps it.

1178
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,140
And then she says, okay, well,

1179
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,500
if you're talking about Red Robin,

1180
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,660
don't tell the story about grandma getting drunk.

1181
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,300
What, wow.

1182
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,020
And I said, oh no, I would never, what's the story?

1183
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,940
And then, and I have to kind of pull it out of her

1184
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,180
and she's all like, oh, I just don't know.

1185
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,020
And then, but then after kind of some protest,

1186
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,420
the story just ended up being that my grandma

1187
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,820
had one martini and it made her like a little loose,

1188
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,060
loose enough to talk a lot to the man at the table

1189
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,340
next to us who turned out to be Mickey Rooney's son.

1190
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,780
And then I kept like, so then when she fall down the stairs,

1191
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,180
it now, so she was just gone.

1192
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,780
In a bad way, she say something bad, something mean.

1193
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,820
No, she, no, they got along great.

1194
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,180
Well, what's the, she got drunk and then I had a couple

1195
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,260
of things to pull out of this, which is first of all,

1196
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,580
she had a martini at Red Robin.

1197
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,340
Yeah, I got to try a Red Robin martini.

1198
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,780
I'm a little curious, certainly.

1199
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,620
And my mom said, oh, they have a great bar.

1200
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,340
Oh, the bar is great.

1201
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,380
So you're here for Mad Mixology.

1202
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,300
Surfing to James Bond where he orders a martini

1203
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,140
at a Red Robin.

1204
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,540
Then you zoom out.

1205
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,740
You don't know, it cuts wide.

1206
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,340
You see the server with the bright red vest and red.

1207
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,620
Red comes out to attack him and he shoots red.

1208
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,980
And then disguises himself as red to get out of there.

1209
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,340
Oh, I love, why not?

1210
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,420
James Bond's been everywhere.

1211
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,660
Why not put him in Redondo Beach?

1212
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,020
I'll have the bottomless fries.

1213
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,820
It's kind of rebound, by the way.

1214
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,340
Hang on, Red, you can't leave.

1215
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,460
You got 10 more kids birthday tables to touch fries in.

1216
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1217
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,140
Anyway, wait, you do have another point, Jason?

1218
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,500
No, I, well, I did, I did, yeah.

1219
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,780
So your dad had a liquid lunch and dive.

1220
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,620
Yeah.

1221
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,620
Grandma's having, you know, a gin martini at Red Robin.

1222
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,500
I don't know, things falling into place.

1223
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,340
Yeah, yeah.

1224
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,300
I feel like it was already in the blood.

1225
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,020
My dad told me a story.

1226
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,580
I'll save it for, there's a different episode

1227
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,380
that we have not recorded yet.

1228
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,940
I don't know if it'll be out, but I got a really good scoop.

1229
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,020
Dad drinking story?

1230
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,780
No, no, not drinking, just of like,

1231
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,220
oh, that's where the theme park madness comes from.

1232
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,060
Gotcha.

1233
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:06,900
Aha.

1234
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,820
No, all that, and my dad had a boat called Drunky

1236
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,740
with two E's, it's all there.

1237
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,980
The visors come from my dad.

1238
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,260
The DNA is very clear.

1239
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,100
But anyways, wait, what else about this?

1240
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,740
Oh yeah, Mickey then.

1241
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,580
Mickey Rooney's son.

1242
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,900
Mickey Rooney's son is really something to unpack.

1243
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,740
Yeah.

1244
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,580
And how did they know that?

1245
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,980
How did he, was he lying?

1246
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,820
I don't know.

1247
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,660
I was trying to figure out which son it might've been,

1248
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,660
but it's tough because he had eight wives and nine children.

1249
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,500
Wow.

1250
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,660
I don't know where to begin.

1251
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,580
I guess that makes sense.

1252
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,300
Tried to figure it out.

1253
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,700
It might've been Tim Rooney.

1254
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,500
Tim Rooney, then I was looking at an article about him

1255
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,580
and his passing away, and it said that he was,

1256
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,860
Tim Rooney was chosen to be one of the original 1955

1257
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,780
Mouseketeers for the Mickey Mouse Club,

1258
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,140
but never appeared on the show because he was fired

1259
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,020
for getting into mischief at the Disney Paint Shop.

1260
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,860
What?

1261
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,700
Wow.

1262
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,540
It's real.

1263
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,340
It has to be really bad, and they cleaned that up.

1264
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,220
Yeah, maybe.

1265
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,060
I don't know what it is.

1266
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,900
I don't have an idea.

1267
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,020
Because again, wouldn't Walt love a bunch of kids

1268
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,060
getting into, he loves the tales of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn,

1269
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,980
wouldn't he love, he'd love some kids

1270
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,420
getting into some paint business.

1271
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,700
He was like drowning raccoons in paint or something,

1272
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,660
like something weird and sinister, not just like,

1273
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,740
oh, I got some of the blue paint on my face, whoopsies.

1274
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,820
They were like, Cubby, one of the other kids,

1275
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,460
he's like, you're gonna steal my lines and I know it.

1276
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,340
I'm shoving your face in this blue paint.

1277
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,780
It's like, you're gonna be blue forever,

1278
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,940
so they'll think you're sick, and I get all your lines.

1279
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,420
It's the Moe Little Rascals joke on the Simpsons.

1280
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,460
Yeah.

1281
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,260
You killed the original Alpha Alpha.

1282
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,100
He smothered the original Cubby.

1283
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,700
Yeah, it's something dark, whatever it is.

1284
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,220
So Mickey Rooney's, yeah, hey, don't get drunk at Red Robin

1285
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,580
unless you wanna get friendly with Mickey Rooney's son.

1286
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,460
So this is the story my mom didn't want told,

1287
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,620
and then she said, well, you know, hey,

1288
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,220
be careful if you talk about it,

1289
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,420
because she'll haunt ya.

1290
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,100
I'm looking around here.

1291
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,780
Yeah, you guys first, I'm really sorry.

1292
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,580
Boy, if something comes to light,

1293
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:13,020
or if Garfield the dog suddenly gets very animated,

1294
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,700
he's yawning, that's not so bad.

1295
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,500
I don't think you're my grandma right now.

1296
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,340
Hold on.

1297
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,620
Listeners, too, I'm sorry if I'm passing the,

1298
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,180
you're all, it could happen to any of us now.

1299
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,020
My grandma's gonna haunt you.

1300
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,780
Sorry, everyone, you're getting the drag me to hell curse.

1301
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,900
Sorry.

1302
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,260
Is this a common thing where she'll be like,

1303
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,100
oh, we can't talk about that,

1304
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,460
and you're like, there's literally no dark substance

1305
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,660
to this story.

1306
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,620
What are you talking about?

1307
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,420
It's very charming.

1308
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,460
I don't understand one bit.

1309
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,580
There's not a single part of it that's.

1310
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,420
No.

1311
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,260
Not like.

1312
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,100
Unless she was hiding it from you.

1313
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,860
I told this to Erin, and she's like,

1314
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,740
that's what she, my drunk grandma story is that

1315
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,260
she had three margaritas and was staying with us

1316
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,220
in my sister's room, and then she,

1317
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,060
when she was, we had to carry her into the house,

1318
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,060
and then she fell into a very loose nightstand

1319
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,860
that was covered in Erin's sister's snow globe collection.

1320
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,700
Oh no.

1321
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,100
The snow globes shattered,

1322
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,740
gross snow globe water and glitter everywhere.

1323
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,580
That's like.

1324
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,580
Grandma just asleep in it.

1325
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,020
That's the story of Everest,

1326
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,660
the Mr. Show sketch in real life.

1327
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,340
It happened nine times.

1328
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,180
Grandma.

1329
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,220
We put the snow globes back on.

1330
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,540
Grandma taking like a Matt Cardona death match bump

1331
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,980
into the glass.

1332
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,820
Jeez.

1333
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,740
That is a.

1334
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,860
If we're gonna do sketch comparisons, by the way,

1335
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,660
this is what, this is the, that occurred to me.

1336
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,460
After the, I'm gonna mess up your hair

1337
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,820
and put my hands in the fries, and he's bright red.

1338
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,780
I realized that red is the,

1339
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,220
I think you should leave character chunky.

1340
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,060
It's chunky.

1341
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,900
It's chunky.

1342
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,740
Very well, it's chunky.

1343
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,180
No, don't touch the fries.

1344
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,500
You would all summer, figure out what you do.

1345
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,260
You need to figure out what red does.

1346
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,700
That's what I'm saying.

1347
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,540
Yeah.

1348
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,220
What is this?

1349
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,540
And then there's no, and guess what?

1350
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,020
I'm gonna make it worse here because then I'm like,

1351
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,180
is there any information,

1352
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,620
did they ever try to do a red animated show?

1353
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,700
Is there like a kid's menu out there

1354
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,340
where he goes on a maze adventure

1355
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,060
and that can tell me what red is?

1356
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,500
And the answer is no.

1357
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,380
What there is is a photo of original red

1358
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,500
when there was just one location in Seattle.

1359
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,780
It was just a bar.

1360
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,660
And here's what that teaches you about red

1361
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,660
is that he was super high.

1362
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,660
Look at this guy.

1363
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,500
Whoa.

1364
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,580
Original red from 79.

1365
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,020
He is in a long weird baseball cap.

1366
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,700
He's wearing big scary boots,

1367
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,660
but more importantly, his eyes are red.

1368
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,500
That's why he's red robin.

1369
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,340
Wow.

1370
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,260
His eyes are beet red.

1371
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,820
They drew the veins in there.

1372
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,060
He's bloodshot and he is holding a big fat joint.

1373
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,700
It's a Mickey situation yet again,

1374
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,380
where the character's personality and weirdness

1375
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,900
and edge was taken away.

1376
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,580
It's been softened to get him to every mall.

1377
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,900
It just has to be nothing.

1378
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,540
They can't know that he is so high.

1379
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,060
The point of red robin.

1380
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,100
Wow.

1381
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,300
This is less red robin yum and more red robin.

1382
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,180
So was the, so what year 79?

1383
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,180
You think so?

1384
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:32,180
So was the like, that's like early drug stuff, obviously.

1385
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,500
Like before it was fully in, like,

1386
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,620
I mean, it was in popular culture,

1387
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,740
but it was not in mainstream.

1388
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,940
Yeah, the sixties had happened, Michael.

1389
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,140
Yeah, I think we're pretty past.

1390
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,220
Yeah, I think we're kind of.

1391
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,340
We're way past a reaper madness.

1392
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,180
You're right, you're right.

1393
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,500
In the fast lane of Coke and Ludes.

1394
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,660
I'm just trying to think of it.

1395
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,620
He's trying to represent weed culture

1396
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,060
in the face of the upcoming Coke onslaught.

1397
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,940
I'm trying to think of cartoon high characters.

1398
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,860
Like was Fritz the cat high?

1399
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,060
Or was he on cocaine?

1400
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,380
I'm sure Fritz got up to some trouble.

1401
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,740
I'm sure there was a lot of the kind of.

1402
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,100
But like who's the first high cartoon character?

1403
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,340
I mean, if you're counting like the hate Ashbury,

1404
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,740
like Robert Crumb, like the comics

1405
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,140
that would show in head shops.

1406
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,380
Yeah, obviously they were all high.

1407
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,500
The Scooby Doo gang, man.

1408
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,620
Yeah, that's true.

1409
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,580
The HR puff and stuff and team.

1410
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,420
That's true, that's the 70s.

1411
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,740
At least the people making it were high.

1412
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,780
Like sixties, yeah.

1413
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,540
So I guess Shaggy is high.

1414
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,060
It is a little unusual to see like a regular bar

1415
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,900
have like a high cartoon Robin mascot.

1416
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,540
Or at least if he didn't have the joint,

1417
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,860
you could go like, oh, he pulled in all night.

1418
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,620
Or he's like been partying for like the day or something.

1419
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,460
You know what I'm saying?

1420
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,140
Don't do, I like this old red.

1421
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,020
Again, we have something to work off of.

1422
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,460
He is stoned off his ass.

1423
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,940
I think it's almost weird that they covered it up.

1424
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,100
I think I do, I will say though,

1425
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,740
I'm not saying that he's a scumbag because he's high,

1426
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,060
but that he is like very, I mean, he is out of it.

1427
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,620
The vibes are not great.

1428
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,740
He looks like he's gonna hustle you.

1429
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,860
He looks like Chuck, like he's got a vibe

1430
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,420
of like Chuck E. The early Chuck E. Cheese to me.

1431
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,420
I think so, yeah.

1432
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,260
I also found that other picture

1433
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,140
that I could see in the preview image.

1434
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,780
Oh yeah, well I was again art.

1435
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,820
Yeah, here's a deviant art of a more realistic kind of,

1436
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,700
more Zubli-Zoo style.

1437
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,820
He's kind of cut, like he's kind of jacked, right?

1438
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,860
Yeah, they managed to give him abs underneath the feathers

1439
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,780
and they made his vest sexier.

1440
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,500
His blue vest is not especially sexy on its own.

1441
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,980
This one is more Red Robin Yum.

1442
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,500
This is, yeah, somebody wants to see Red's seat.

1443
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,900
There is a photo here that I found

1444
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,180
where like just kind of perking that seat up.

1445
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,020
He is perking that seat up, yeah, for sure.

1446
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,580
Still holding the burger in one hand,

1447
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,820
but kind of like swiveling the hip with the other.

1448
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,620
And it's from behind, it's like you're standing behind him.

1449
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,460
But he knows you're there,

1450
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,300
because he's looking at you. But he knows you're there.

1451
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,020
Giving you a little side eye.

1452
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,140
You want some of this?

1453
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,900
And I don't mean the burger. That's a little thirst.

1454
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,180
Yeah, he's got a thirst trap going in that picture.

1455
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,620
But that's a new thing I hadn't considered.

1456
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:22,060
Like cartoon character drawn,

1457
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,420
you are standing behind,

1458
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,580
like your view of Bugs Bunny from behind.

1459
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,780
Is just nothing.

1460
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:31,420
Like that does seem like, oh no, if I go looking for this,

1461
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,500
I'm gonna find a lot of it, aren't I?

1462
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,380
Yeah, probably, yeah.

1463
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,260
I'm not sure if I want a butt crack or no butt crack.

1464
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,580
I'm a little creeped out by the no butt crack.

1465
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,460
You want Red Robin to have a butt crack?

1466
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,700
No, you don't want that.

1467
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,540
I guess I don't.

1468
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,540
No, that's crazy.

1469
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,180
Other than like Ren and Stimpy,

1470
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,820
where it's like that's the point is for them

1471
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,620
to have like realistic butt cracks.

1472
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,940
You don't want like most of these characters to have that.

1473
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,860
Okay, I don't wanna see this high bird's butt crack.

1474
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,700
That's what the high one is implying.

1475
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,700
Yeah.

1476
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,580
Hey, come with me, I'll give you a show.

1477
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,020
He's kind of squatting.

1478
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,780
We don't just have food here.

1479
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,540
Here at Red Robin, the wedding ring comes off

1480
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,580
at the front door.

1481
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,860
Show your ID, then take your rings off, folks.

1482
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,660
Look, on the signs we have to say, want a beer,

1483
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,140
but what we're really saying is, wanna fuck a bird?

1484
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,620
He's a...

1485
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,100
I'll touch your fries.

1486
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:35,940
Then you can touch whatever you want.

1487
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,300
You wanna touch your fries?

1488
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,500
I looked up original Red Robin,

1489
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,660
and there's a different kind of,

1490
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,140
there's a picture of him here.

1491
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,380
Did you see this one?

1492
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,140
Yeah, he's, well, yeah, this is a mode where he,

1493
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,900
they still gave him pretty huge pupil,

1494
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,740
like the eyes are still upsetting.

1495
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,580
Yeah, oh my gosh, they're so dilated.

1496
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,180
It's like he just went to the eye doctor.

1497
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,420
Yeah, yes.

1498
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,180
That's a black and white photo I should have picked.

1499
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,100
No, I got a color one.

1500
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,940
Yeah, look at this guy.

1501
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,940
Look at his, and look at his creepy smile.

1502
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:04,940
Do you know what I'm thinking about?

1503
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,300
Scary eyes.

1504
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,020
It was, for whatever reason,

1505
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,140
when people started making mascots,

1506
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,340
I do think there was like an initial feeling

1507
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,500
that we need to make them kind of like creeps,

1508
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,100
because it's a familiar-ish arc in corporate mascots

1509
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:26,740
to have people be weird or creepy or annoying,

1510
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,340
and then slowly over time, corporations have rolled in

1511
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,060
and made them all exactly the same sort of bland,

1512
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,340
hello, nice to meet you.

1513
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,060
I don't have any personality.

1514
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,340
Unsettling hats.

1515
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:41,900
We wanna have unsettling hats and big eyes and scary grins,

1516
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,580
but then we're gonna slim them way down.

1517
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,140
Let's make them unhealthily skinny.

1518
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,020
Make them hot as shit.

1519
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,860
Yeah.

1520
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,660
Or our unrealistic beauty standards that we like.

1521
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,660
No attitude.

1522
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,500
It is feel like the people who created all the characters,

1523
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,460
their initial impression of somebody

1524
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,060
who would be in charge of a corporation

1525
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,220
or in charge of a place would be a creep.

1526
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,900
Like that was their experience,

1527
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,420
so that was sort of a default of making all these people

1528
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,500
weird or unusual.

1529
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,340
Oh, you're saying,

1530
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:15,340
is that held over from the guy who runs the nightclub?

1531
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,940
Is a little bit of a creep.

1532
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,660
Yes, I'm working out this theory in real time,

1533
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:23,180
but yeah, real time, not Bill Maher, real time,

1534
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,740
but yes, that's what I'm saying.

1535
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,420
I feel like the people, graphic designers

1536
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,420
or whoever's coming up with all these characters,

1537
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:34,420
there was just a default to make the people in charge creeps

1538
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,860
or weird or something was odd with them,

1539
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,060
and then corporations rolled in

1540
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:43,500
and they've across the board wiped any of this personality

1541
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,260
away from all these characters.

1542
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,140
Yeah, except for like the local sports bar.

1543
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,980
Well, that's a different story.

1544
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,420
Who's mascot is like a dog

1545
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,260
and he's got his arms around like two human women.

1546
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,700
Like I don't care for,

1547
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,580
like I don't like Joe Camel, like with human people.

1548
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,660
Oh, we forgot we were doing a Joe Camel episode.

1549
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,500
Yeah, Joe Camel.

1550
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,340
We got it.

1551
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,940
Remember we talked about doing Joe Camel?

1552
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,780
We gotta do it, yeah.

1553
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,980
The universe of Joe Camel.

1554
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,820
We gotta do it.

1555
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,460
My friend Joe Carnegie has been showing me

1556
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,540
a lot of Joe Camel art that rules.

1557
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,380
Oh yeah, we gotta do Joe Camel.

1558
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,420
They had some air brushy, like perfect LA dusk.

1559
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1560
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,740
Yeah, Joe Camel's a little cool.

1561
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,580
Coming soon, coming soon.

1562
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,420
Coming soon.

1563
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,940
And you know, it's a fitting,

1564
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,180
it's a we've come a long way baby sort of situation

1565
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,820
where like the government's like no more jewels

1566
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,340
compared to like get your, Joe Camel bucks.

1567
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,180
Like.

1568
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:38,220
Hang out with the hottest ladies if you smoke Camelites.

1569
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,540
You wanna be like me, right?

1570
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,220
You wanna be like me.

1571
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,020
The last place where that exists is like Dick's Last Resort,

1572
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,460
which is a dwindling franchise already.

1573
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,940
Dick is just a mean man.

1574
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,780
Worst shitty.

1575
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,540
He's like a sloppy man frothing at the mouth.

1576
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,900
Yeah, yeah.

1577
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,300
And I don't like, we've eaten at Dick's ironically before.

1578
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,180
I don't like Dick.

1579
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,220
He's mean, he's homophobic.

1580
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,500
I don't like Dick.

1581
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,020
I was watching like some Vegas vlogger

1582
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,220
and they were like, hey, we're staying at the Excalibur.

1583
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,500
Like here's how many rooms it has.

1584
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,340
We're gonna have lunch.

1585
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,780
We're heading to Dick's Last Resort.

1586
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,620
And I'm like, oh no.

1587
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,860
Jeez Louise.

1588
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,300
There's so many places in Vegas to eat.

1589
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,140
Yeah.

1590
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,620
Can I talk a little about my, you know,

1591
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,460
this is about the character and not the place,

1592
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,660
but I have to say a little bit about the trip that I took.

1593
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,060
Oh yeah, go ahead.

1594
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,180
Friend of the show, Buzz Buzz.

1595
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,420
We met down at the Redondo Beach Mall,

1596
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,540
the South Bay Galleria, which I determined,

1597
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,540
I think correctly via looking at some Yelps and some photos,

1598
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,900
I wanted to find the one that was the most stuck in time.

1599
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,100
Cause as with all these things,

1600
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,740
there's kind of a blandening of all of this.

1601
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,940
I didn't want to go to like sort of a boring,

1602
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,180
fake sports bar, gastropub, red raw.

1603
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,140
I wanted a little bit of that old spirit.

1604
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,340
And I think I picked correctly

1605
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,180
cause it had the big neon sign up above the kitchen.

1606
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,220
And it's all like, there are,

1607
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,460
the style of the place is inexplicable.

1608
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,380
There's an American flag made of baseballs,

1609
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,860
colored red, white and blue.

1610
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,620
I mean, that couldn't be more on the nose.

1611
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,020
It's all that kind of stuff where it's like, yeah, it's like,

1612
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,540
you know, last hundred years of America,

1613
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,820
but kind of like swirled around like a bunch of food

1614
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,420
and drinks in your stomach.

1615
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,380
Who knows how it's going to look when it comes out.

1616
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,580
You barf it out.

1617
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:31,100
It's America's barf is the style of Red Robin,

1618
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,740
which also includes like this American Gothic,

1619
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,580
the painting, but they speared a hamburger on the pitchfork

1620
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,380
or there's Whistler's mother,

1621
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,460
but the framed photo of on her wall

1622
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,340
is just the Red Robin logo.

1623
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,460
Inex, what is this all meant to convey?

1624
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:51,140
The Mona Lisa, but with a mustache.

1625
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,060
And then the Beatles.

1626
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:54,900
That's it.

1627
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,700
Cause you don't, cause some things are sacred.

1628
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,260
And the great took from my money,

1629
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,260
the greatest band that ever did it.

1630
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,900
No, and they already had mustaches in that photo.

1631
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,300
It's just a nice photo of the Beatles.

1632
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,180
No, not you put one of them upside down.

1633
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,340
Don't show that disrespect.

1634
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,140
John Lennon had a dream for this world.

1635
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,460
We let him down.

1636
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,900
You know, I think that's one of the things

1637
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,260
that always confused me about Robin.

1638
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,500
Sorry, I think about the dream.

1639
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,500
We miss you John.

1640
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,620
Is that it has the, what it's very, is it bright inside?

1641
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,860
Yeah, it's like bright, white and chrome

1642
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,140
in the way that a Ruby's diner is.

1643
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,260
Yeah, extreme, very Ruby's.

1644
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,340
The way I believe I heard this is that like,

1645
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:42,100
oh yeah, one of the things that got popular early on

1646
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,260
with diners was to have a lot of white and a lot of chrome

1647
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,700
so that it was like, look,

1648
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,980
we're not hiding any suspicious food.

1649
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,300
Like it's clean.

1650
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,420
This place is fucking clean.

1651
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,060
We're not going to poison you.

1652
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,900
There was a lot more poison.

1653
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,540
Look in the kitchen, look, right under that neon sign.

1654
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,340
This isn't a Listeria factory.

1655
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,700
You know, I'm talking about like Upton Sinclair

1656
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,580
jungle era of food.

1657
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,420
Oh, I see.

1658
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,260
Oh, interesting.

1659
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:11,140
So that design kept going with diners,

1660
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,620
even after it became easier and more common

1661
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,060
to like clean surfaces.

1662
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,620
So Red Robin has that.

1663
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:25,420
They also have the flair of a TGI Fridays or a Bennigan's.

1664
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,260
Yeah.

1665
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,620
The silly kitschy things.

1666
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,700
The kooky bullshit.

1667
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,380
And it feels like too much is going on.

1668
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,540
It feels like two disparate styles combining.

1669
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,380
Yeah.

1670
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,380
And it just seems confusing to me.

1671
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,220
And all this, and then a big bird lives here.

1672
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:43,780
It lives, or is like, what is, is he the manager?

1673
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,180
Is he a regional manager?

1674
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,220
So he's not there all the time.

1675
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,900
They've also taken this element away as well,

1676
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,940
which like Chuck E. Cheese,

1677
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,860
like they've taken the element of the mascot

1678
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,700
being the manager away, I feel.

1679
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,540
Yeah.

1680
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,380
So it's no longer the case.

1681
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,300
Story, clarity.

1682
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,140
Right.

1683
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,220
Chuck E. Cheese is like a rock star

1684
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,340
that hangs out at this place that is named after him.

1685
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,740
But he's not the owner.

1686
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,300
He doesn't pay the bills,

1687
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,100
but the old Chuck paid the bills.

1688
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,940
Yeah.

1689
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,380
And sometimes would stiff people on money.

1690
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,220
I see.

1691
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,540
And I think Red Robin probably also a similar situation.

1692
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,900
He used to run the books.

1693
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,180
Yeah, he used to do a balance sheet.

1694
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,500
Yeah, he would do the balance sheet.

1695
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,020
They made no sense.

1696
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,100
Cause that Seattle location, he doesn't know what,

1697
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,700
these aren't even numbers.

1698
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,860
These are just squiggles and drawings of naked boobs.

1699
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,540
And then he would be inappropriate

1700
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,980
with the wait staff and stuff.

1701
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,820
And now-

1702
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,820
We're $17 short.

1703
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,460
No one's going home until we figure this out.

1704
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,820
Locking the door.

1705
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,180
You're over pouring the drinks.

1706
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,940
It's Marty on that table.

1707
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:45,780
That was just-

1708
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1709
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,420
But now he's just like a greeter.

1710
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,540
He's a Walmart greeter kind of a situation.

1711
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,700
He's the Pope.

1712
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,300
He's just brought around a wave.

1713
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:55,980
We don't know what he is anymore.

1714
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,820
We've lost sight of what Red Robin is.

1715
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,660
We've lost sight of it.

1716
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,860
And I think we really need to bring back

1717
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,700
that the mascot is in the back

1718
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,900
working out the schedules for the staff.

1719
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,300
In the little room, the stressful tiny rooms,

1720
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,660
and restaurants that people have to do all that stuff.

1721
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,260
That's the narrative I want for all the mascots.

1722
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,100
Yeah.

1723
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,260
As you have this with the party,

1724
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,580
you want to know that it's the characters working.

1725
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,420
Yeah.

1726
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,820
John, look at this.

1727
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,660
Look at the iPad.

1728
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,900
Like the Red is touching the fries.

1729
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:25,700
He's touching the fries.

1730
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,540
He's touching the fries.

1731
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,380
That's not sanitary.

1732
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,540
Turn it down.

1733
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,780
That's a big Robin,

1734
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,380
and he's rubbing his wings on the fries.

1735
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,900
These are children.

1736
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,660
She's got gift certificates.

1737
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,660
We're turning away a gift certificate hammer.

1738
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,180
These are worthless now.

1739
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,380
Crumple, throw it in their face.

1740
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,380
They're messing up.

1741
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,580
Hey, stop messing up.

1742
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,780
Yeah.

1743
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,980
Are you ready to see your new bar?

1744
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,140
Are you ready to see your new bar?

1745
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,900
It's called Smashes.

1746
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,900
We took, we kept the baseball American flag

1747
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,260
because when you hit in a home run,

1748
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,860
you're hitting a smash,

1749
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,740
but we're pushing smash burgers.

1750
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,940
They're thinner, so it's less cost.

1751
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,020
Your margins go way down,

1752
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,860
but they're very popular right now.

1753
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,700
You put the pineapple on,

1754
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,620
you just get a little glaze on that.

1755
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,660
It's not complicated, okay?

1756
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,500
It's an aioli.

1757
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,340
I want to see you make five of them.

1758
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,140
It's a little bit of aioli.

1759
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,660
Your home menu can be made in a convection oven

1760
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,500
or a sous vide machine now.

1761
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,820
John, thank you so much.

1762
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,860
Thank you.

1763
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,420
Also, you've burdened us with an actual complicated menu

1764
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,380
that we can't handle

1765
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,820
and that if you look at the Yelp reviews,

1766
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,980
most of these bars go under six months later because-

1767
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,380
The smoke gun broke while this crew was still there.

1768
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,180
You've given us complicated cocktails

1769
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,340
that are actually like, our bartenders can't do them

1770
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,620
and they're actually not making some money

1771
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,460
because we're not selling enough

1772
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,620
because people want well drinks.

1773
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,500
John, what have you done to us?

1774
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,340
Yeah, I got to say,

1775
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,580
I'm feeling pretty good about the future.

1776
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,300
I think we're gonna be smashing for a lot of years to come.

1777
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,300
Title card, four days later, the character was back,

1778
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,460
putting his hand between the bun and the burger,

1779
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,940
pulling cheese off of it,

1780
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:02,020
putting the hand cheese back into the burger.

1781
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,140
No one has ordered John's patented Orange Sunrise

1782
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,980
$25 cocktail.

1783
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,900
They just want a Sprite and gin together, no ice.

1784
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,460
Promotional consideration by InBev and Esri.

1785
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,580
John ordered them 20,000 cuties for the stock room.

1786
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,460
The cuties have remained unused.

1787
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,980
They're rotting in the store room.

1788
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,580
There are mushrooms growing on each cutie.

1789
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,380
John has ruined yet another bar.

1790
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,820
We're back to check in on another success story

1791
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:36,460
and we found fungus growing in the quote cutie room.

1792
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:39,860
The still cuties from the first time we were here.

1793
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,900
John has only spread fungus across this country

1794
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,580
with his revamp ideas.

1795
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,180
John has taken an IQ test.

1796
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,420
It is shockingly low.

1797
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,580
So what did you get?

1798
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,380
I got their lowest calorie burger that I could find,

1799
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,780
which then I looked up later in the day on the website,

1800
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,020
eat this, not that.

1801
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:06,100
I got the this.

1802
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,860
I got what to eat.

1803
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,860
It was the Tavern Burger, which is smaller.

1804
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,300
And I didn't want it to be smothered in sauce

1805
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,620
that might make me feel bad.

1806
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:18,660
So I said, could I get Red's secret tavern sauce

1807
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,820
on the side?

1808
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,260
And the server said, great, Thousand Island on the side.

1809
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,460
Thank you, let the secret out of the bag.

1810
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,700
And I actually, I did like it and I liked bottomless fries.

1811
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,220
The best thing on the menu, verified by eat this, not that,

1812
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:35,980
it still made me feel like shit.

1813
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,300
I got tired immediately as soon as I ate it.

1814
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,140
And then Erin sat me down for a talk and she said,

1815
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,340
let's do some math here.

1816
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,580
You did the hot dog day and you felt very bad.

1817
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:49,300
Then you went to a Dodger game and had two Dodger dogs

1818
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,020
in cascading quality.

1819
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,180
You didn't get the premium the second time

1820
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,700
and you felt really bad.

1821
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,660
Then you did the, then you went to Red Robin for,

1822
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:01,140
I think you need to stop eating low quality beef,

1823
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,340
even if it is for content.

1824
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,660
It does not.

1825
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,260
So I'm gonna have to wrap it up.

1826
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:09,100
I mean, maybe I gotta make some go at Scrabble before.

1827
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,900
Oh yeah, before the party's over.

1828
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,740
I'm gonna blow out.

1829
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,580
No more bad beef bachelor party.

1830
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:19,140
But after that, Erin had a little mini intervention.

1831
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,500
Wow, interesting.

1832
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,220
Well, now it makes me feel bad every time.

1833
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:23,060
I just gotta stop.

1834
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,500
You have to force you to eat like us one day too.

1835
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,780
We'll do that and then I'm done.

1836
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,340
That's the bad beef bachelor party.

1837
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,540
Yeah, there's, and then there's a.

1838
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,700
Then I'm settling down.

1839
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,020
A little better beef.

1840
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,500
Yeah, better, hashtag better beef.

1841
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:40,460
There's a little, Biz told me about a double cheeseburger

1842
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,620
but put the Big Mac sauce on it.

1843
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,060
That's a hack.

1844
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,900
I can't do it.

1845
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,620
I've heard that for years.

1846
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:47,460
It's good.

1847
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,580
And it's not, but you have to order it at the window

1848
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,900
and then it has to be one where they'll do that.

1849
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,740
Yeah, you have to strong arm them into doing it.

1850
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,620
It's not like the in and out secret menu.

1851
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,900
Oh okay, okay, you gotta beg.

1852
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,900
I don't think it's so hard to do.

1853
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:03,300
But the double cheeseburger beef at least tastes better

1854
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,500
than I think Big Mac Patty.

1855
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,620
If I'm gonna retire from bad beef,

1856
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,620
then it cuts a lot of things on the menu off for me

1857
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,620
because what I learned for the first time

1858
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:16,860
is that Red Robin has partnered with Donato's Pizza.

1859
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,460
So now there's whatever that is.

1860
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:19,860
That's in Ohio I think.

1861
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,020
It was on undercover boss.

1862
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,540
That was the only reason we'd heard of it before.

1863
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,420
And there's several things.

1864
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,100
One thing I saw on the menu was a photo of a pizza

1865
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:33,060
that was very flat and that had full coverage of pepperoni.

1866
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,420
There was not one spot on it without pepperoni.

1867
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,540
There's not a rim.

1868
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,980
And that is a thing they do apparently.

1869
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,740
It is a pepperoni pizza that has 100 pepperoni slices.

1870
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:43,580
Wow.

1871
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,020
Not one millimeter.

1872
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,860
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

1873
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:48,540
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

1874
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,140
Jason lead on to pepperonis in one sitting.

1875
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:54,500
And they also have some kind of Mexican themed pizza

1876
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,540
with something on top that they call mariachi beef.

1877
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,940
Well there might be something wrong with that.

1878
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,700
There very likely is something wrong with mariachi beef.

1879
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,900
Just the other thing to say is that this Riddraven meal

1880
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,940
came after a general tour of the South Bay Galleria

1881
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,860
where there's two important things to note.

1882
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:15,660
One, a big glass atrium in the center

1883
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,780
that is soaked at the top in bird poop.

1884
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,980
There is so much caked on bird poop in this mall.

1885
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,580
You know, you like look way up.

1886
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:26,700
You have a view everywhere in the mall of this atrium.

1887
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,180
And there's birds sitting on top of it.

1888
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,780
So you can like watch the birds mid poop.

1889
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,380
If you ever wanted to do a glass, not a glass bottom boat,

1890
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:39,100
but a glass top observation box of bird shitting.

1891
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,340
You can go to the South Bay Galleria.

1892
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:45,140
They also, in this mall, there's a department store.

1893
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,180
I think the space was in Nordstrom's.

1894
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,980
Clearly the big space meant for one of the big tenants.

1895
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,020
And the Nordstrom's is gone.

1896
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,060
So now you walk up to it and just in giant letters,

1897
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,460
what it says is dinosaurs.

1898
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:00,100
And it's just big rooms full of dinosaurs.

1899
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,580
Of statues of dinosaurs?

1900
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,380
Yeah, some of them move a little.

1901
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,100
Some of them are simple animatronics.

1902
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,980
Like Jurassic Quest?

1903
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,740
Yeah, it's like Jurassic Quest, but jammed inside.

1904
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:12,940
And there's this one part where the ceiling goes up really high.

1905
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:16,140
And there's like a big window that's very tall.

1906
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,300
And they jam the brontosaurus in there.

1907
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,500
Because the rest of the Nordstrom ceiling is not tall.

1908
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,120
So there's one place they could put him.

1909
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,820
So it looks like he's in a trap.

1910
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:29,180
Like he got stuck in there like when a hummingbird got

1911
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,580
stuck in our apartment alcove once.

1912
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,020
This brontosaurus is stuck in the mall.

1913
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:34,980
Wow, I want to see this.

1914
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:35,780
We have no way to get him out of here.

1915
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,940
We've got to take the roof off, airlift him.

1916
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,180
It's the only way.

1917
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,540
So if you want to go to the department store called

1918
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,940
Dinosaur's, go to the South Bay Galleria.

1919
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,460
I do want to see that.

1920
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,060
That sounds good.

1921
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,100
I recommend the trip.

1922
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,940
If you're around there or if you're not,

1923
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,140
take a trip to the South Bay Galleria.

1924
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,940
At the time, there was a shady circus in the parking lot.

1925
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:54,700
Wow.

1926
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,820
There's a bunch of just exposed pipes.

1927
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:00,100
And you could just see installation falling out

1928
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,340
next to the AMC.

1929
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,100
I'm imagining Gene Wilder singing Pure Imagination

1930
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,900
hearing all this stuff.

1931
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,100
This is a thing at malls across the country,

1932
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,820
like simple Instagram opportunities

1933
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:16,100
or like experiential stuff like a bunch of statues

1934
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:16,940
of dinosaurs.

1935
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,540
What you're describing does sound like a miniature golf

1936
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,220
course without the putting greens though.

1937
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:24,500
Oh no, one of the things, one floor is a mini golf course.

1938
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,140
They thought of that.

1939
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,340
And then the other one's just like a bunch of blow up,

1940
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:30,620
just inflatables, like bounce houses essentially.

1941
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,540
But all under the general title of dinosaurs.

1942
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,340
I remember, it's posted this a few months back

1943
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,220
and I forget the exact context, but I

1944
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:43,380
think it was a presentation by an experienced theme design

1945
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:43,860
company.

1946
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:47,140
And they're like, OK, imagine these malls

1947
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,500
that are mostly empty.

1948
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:55,180
What if we put in them a food court, a period food court,

1949
01:09:55,180 --> 01:10:00,340
a working video arcade, a candy store, a video game store,

1950
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,980
I'm like, you are describing a functioning mall.

1951
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,100
You were describing what malls were.

1952
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:10,860
You want to turn this dead mall into the experience

1953
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,020
of going to a functioning mall, but not go all the way

1954
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,900
of making a functioning mall.

1955
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,220
I mean, that's very funny.

1956
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,140
I'm all for it.

1957
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,140
Yeah, I'm for it.

1958
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:22,100
Please, we want this.

1959
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,380
What else is there to do?

1960
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,140
It's hot now.

1961
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,420
It's too hot to be outside often.

1962
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,740
Let me go into the mall.

1963
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:31,580
I go to the mall with my son and we just

1964
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,260
ride the escalator up and down.

1965
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:33,900
It's a blast.

1966
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,420
It's fun.

1967
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,380
It's a great time.

1968
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,500
Maybe one day we'll run into Mickey Rooney's grandson

1969
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,740
or something.

1970
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,980
If you're lucky, you know what I really wanted to say real quick?

1971
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,700
The bird atrium, it sounds like if Red Robin, who

1972
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,620
was a guy wearing the red suit, wanted to leave,

1973
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,620
he could take a shit on the top of the atrium in the suit.

1974
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:55,140
And that would be grounds for firing immediately.

1975
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:55,660
Yeah.

1976
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,620
He looked up there.

1977
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,380
You saw his butt crack.

1978
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,220
The butt crack that I desired.

1979
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:04,220
And it's probably a human one because it's sticking out.

1980
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,700
So it's a little weird.

1981
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,100
Well, I'm all for it.

1982
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,860
If this episode was about what is red, who is red,

1983
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,700
a question people were dying to be asked,

1984
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,460
why not embrace it all the way?

1985
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,060
He's a guy who touches your hair when you don't ask.

1986
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,020
He touches your food and he takes a shit

1987
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,140
on the roof of your mall.

1988
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,340
That's right.

1989
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,900
Because we already have Chuck E. Cheese, who's kind of nefarious

1990
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,220
and a little bit of a jerk.

1991
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:29,820
Just make this guy, he's just all the way bad news.

1992
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:30,820
He's crazy.

1993
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:34,100
Turn him back into the, him with the glassy eyes

1994
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,900
and the joints should be, that should be the least

1995
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,980
of this guy's problems.

1996
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,500
The lightest of the drugs he's, this guy should be so fucked

1997
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,900
up on every pill and upper and downer.

1998
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,420
He doesn't make sense anymore.

1999
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,540
Yum, motherfuckers, yum.

2000
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:50,420
Do it.

2001
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:55,500
This is how you get your, make Red like an insane,

2002
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,420
not a person, an insane bird who's on death's door.

2003
01:11:59,420 --> 01:11:59,940
Yes.

2004
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,860
The way he's living.

2005
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,100
We're watching somebody in the last insane week

2006
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:04,780
of their life.

2007
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:08,380
Dennis Hopper's character from Blue Velvet, make Red that.

2008
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,580
Like fuck Heineken, Paps Blue Ribbon.

2009
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:11,820
With an oxygen tank.

2010
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,180
Yeah.

2011
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,100
Yeah.

2012
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:20,020
Tank of sucking oxygen with one tube and one blue curacao

2013
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,660
with another.

2014
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,780
All right, bitches.

2015
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,780
Red.

2016
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,220
My restaurants are going away.

2017
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,500
That's the Red we want.

2018
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,100
Get on that, Red Robin, and then I'll come back.

2019
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,020
Then they'll be back wherever.

2020
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,180
I don't have to drive to Redondo Beach anymore, but I will.

2021
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:36,740
But yeah.

2022
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:39,580
I want to give this, and now I want to hug this insane Red.

2023
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:40,780
I'm going to have to see dinosaurs.

2024
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,580
And see, yeah, well, we should all just go to dinosaurs.

2025
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:47,820
But for now, you survived podcast The Ride, The Second

2026
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:50,660
Gate, truly unhinged episode.

2027
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:52,420
I didn't even say really quick, one more thing

2028
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:55,860
about Red, I found a video from the local news

2029
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:00,700
where a soldier returns home and surprises his mother, who

2030
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,740
hasn't seen him in a year, who thinks

2031
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,540
he's still stationed overseas.

2032
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,460
Red comes up and starts again.

2033
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:08,100
He fell right into the character.

2034
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,540
He started touching her face.

2035
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,860
What?

2036
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,540
What's this?

2037
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:16,140
And then he took the head off, and it's her military son.

2038
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,700
All right, well, that's nice, I guess.

2039
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,820
It's nice, but weird.

2040
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:21,540
Like, how could I surprise my mom

2041
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,220
in the most heartwarming way by being her favorite character

2042
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,460
Red, the best restaurant Red Robin?

2043
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,740
I'm coming home.

2044
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,420
I'm coming.

2050
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:44,140
At this point, I'm like, I just want to like,

2051
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:48,180
even just a pure, is there an episode all about blue curacao?

2052
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,860
Yeah, just 100%.

2053
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,660
Oh, sure.

2054
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,020
Let's figure out the history of it.

2055
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,860
I love a blotcher of it.

2056
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,140
Is there alcohol in blue curacao?

2057
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,820
I've never been 100% certain on that.

2058
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,580
I don't know.

2059
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,500
Is it just the flavor?

2060
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,780
I wasn't sure if it was like tonic water and club soda

2061
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,220
or if it's a liqueur.

2062
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,980
I've never seen anyone just order blue curacao,

2063
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,460
but it's in everything that wants to be blue.

2064
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,180
Whether or not it has alcohol, imagine

2065
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,660
drinking only the blue.

2066
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:15,660
Dear God.

2067
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,900
I'll do it on the show live.

2068
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,380
That's a drink that they had.

2069
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,500
I forgot to say this.

2070
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,060
Tito's Blue Chill.

2071
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,660
Tito's vodka, blue curacao, club soda, sweet and sour,

2072
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,700
and pineapple juice topped with whipped cream.

2073
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,100
That's insane.

2074
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,900
And it's only $5.

2075
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,060
That doesn't seem right.

2076
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,900
You want to see low prices.

2077
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,140
You'd think that was nice, but that just

2078
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,340
makes me think there's no liquor in it

2079
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,500
and that it'll make me so sick.

2080
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,100
They can't charge that much because it'll be outside of me

2081
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,900
again within six minutes.

2082
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,420
Yeah.

2083
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,500
A beer is like a $5.

2084
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,980
Sometimes you get lucky at a place

2085
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,620
with it for a beer for $5.

2086
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,140
Yeah.

2087
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,340
I do not trust that.

2088
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,340
You'd like to see a deal, but no thank you.

2089
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:57,980
I guess I'll order it next time.

2090
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:01,180
I'll get a martini and hope that a Mickey Rooney

2091
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,060
relative is in sight.
