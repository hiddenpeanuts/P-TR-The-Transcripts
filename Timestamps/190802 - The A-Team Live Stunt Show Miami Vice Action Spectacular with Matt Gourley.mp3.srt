1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Warning, the following podcast contains talking trash can secrets, the sugar substitute stevia,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,800
non-specific smuggling, and a well rehearsed half speed knock down drag out dissection of

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,800
the A-Team and Miami Vice stunt shows with special guest Matt Gourley.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,960
I love it when a podcast comes together.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,560
It's Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,240
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by three guys who never get starstruck unless they are

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,040
meeting the voice of a theme park trash can.

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,040
I'm Scott Gertner, Jason Sheridan, Mike Carlson are here.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Hi, yes.

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,440
Yes, and that is what's happening today among other things.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,480
We're happily joined by a luminary of both podcasting and theme parks from Super Ego,

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,440
from James Bond, and from Colonel O'Brien Needs a Friend.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Matt Gourley is here.

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,440
Hi guys, I feel like this is a long time coming.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Yeah.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,360
I mean, if ever there are two wheelhouses for me, I'm excited to be here.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
No kidding.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,360
The list seems to rival your podcast list is the theme park list.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Sadly, yeah.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,360
No, these are the most excited, the funnest of areas.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm so glad we could talk about it.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
People have tweeted us a lot of like, you got to have Gourley on.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
You got to have Gourley on.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Yeah, I've seen a lot of those.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Yeah, we will.

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
Yeah.

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Well, and we got sort of like, I feel like we were almost like set up on a podcast blind

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,360
date by a listener who approached you somewhere and said, when are you going to do Podcast

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
The Ride?

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Yeah, I was thankful to hear about, which I think when, and I heard the response there

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,360
was that you were, you were curious about Waterworld, but Jordan Morris dove in and

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
got there first.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah, I saw that and that immediately hit me hard.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
That's real good.

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Oh, the podcast war started new.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Yeah.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
That was the real sea war.

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Yeah.

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
But I understood it.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,360
And I thought maybe that's an invitation for me to go one, maybe even two levels deeper.

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Yes, yes, both.

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,360
And these are, this is really the bones of the, like there could be no Waterworld alive,

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Sea War Spectacular without the essential building blocks of Miami Vice and A-Team.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Which are the burial ground, like the Poltergeist Native American stunt show Spectacular burial

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,360
ground on which Waterworld is on top of.

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Yes.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Sure, sure.

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
And any problems that they encounter, if anyone were to get hurt, it is probably stemming

51
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,360
from that they would dare to exile all the crock-it-and-tubbs.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Yeah, all the ghosts of the stunts that happened.

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
The bones of the poor man's B.A.

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Baracus will come out of the Waterworld lake because they were literally on the same grounds.

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I guess that's clear, but maybe some people don't know that.

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Waterworld's from around 95, 96, I think is when they made that switch.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
I don't want to say 95.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,360
But yeah, Miami Vice before that and A-Team before that, that's always been the sectioned-off

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:25,360
stunt area for, for the most part, properties that go longer than the thing that it is based

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
on.

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Well longer, yeah.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Yeah, because Miami Vice is still going in 94 when it's been off the air for four years.

65
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Four years, I think.

66
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah, both of them ran until after their show had gone off the air.

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
The show went till 1990?

69
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah.

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Oh my God, what did they do with their fashions?

71
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Did they update them or?

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
I don't know.

73
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Yeah, I don't know where they land.

74
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,360
And, and well, and seemingly the, in the live show, they started to get a little looser.

75
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Like they were like sort of like ponytail crockets.

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
That's right.

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,360
They let them hang a little bit, at least the ones you can see on YouTube.

78
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,360
So I guess they weren't being held to the, you know, the proper style standards.

79
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
There's no Crockett style standards.

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,360
But in 1995, like children watching the Miami Vice stunt show were just like, well, this is cool.

81
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't know what it is.

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Yeah.

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
It's just neat.

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Yeah.

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
And Waterworld's now like many generations deep.

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Oh, no idea.

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Yeah.

88
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Before we get into all these excellent topics that you got into, we got to ask you about the history.

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,360
The, I mean, there's a number of things.

90
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Push among them, the soap opera, Beast.

91
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
I'm not, I'm not sure where to start.

92
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,360
I think more than any guest we've had, you've been, you've logged a lot of time in the parks.

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah, I guess so.

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
So I think it all began in 2001.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
I can't remember.

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I think it was right, right after 9-11.

97
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Would you say that's why you got into food parks?

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Because of the transformation that happened?

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
It was an inside job.

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I got this job doing this thing called the Soap Opera Beast, Disney's California Adventure,

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
which was a soap opera themed restaurant based on the ABC soap opera.

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,360
So every room of the restaurant was a different set, like a mansion, a war for surgery room.

103
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,360
And so there was this group of improvisers and we were all, we all came from the same circle.

104
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
So it was like my best friends.

105
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
We were all doing this thing where you'd go in once an hour for about 10 minutes,

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,360
improvise a soap opera scene while people are eating.

107
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,360
You'd put your hand on the shoulders of some woman and go like, my wife, Monrovia here, left me.

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
And the people just ate it up.

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
You're wearing doctor's scrubs all day.

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
It was the easiest job I will ever have.

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
It was a union performers job.

112
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,360
And then also the park was doing so poorly that we'd come in for like a 10 o'clock shift

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,360
and they go, we're not going to open until five, so just go ride some rides.

114
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
And it was a union job, so you'd be paid for it.

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,360
And I mean, this is really how Super Ego started because we, I had already had like my friend Jeremy,

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,360
that I do Super Ego with, we were already friends, but Mark, we all kind of would just have so much downtime

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
that we would just goof off with each other and straight man each other for bits and things like that.

118
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
And we all became fast, close friends.

119
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,360
And then soap opera brister didn't last that long.

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I was going to say, I don't even know how that's like really that's opening day California Adventure early, early.

121
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Did you last till the end of it?

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Yeah, well, well beyond, well beyond because that closed fairly early.

123
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,360
And then basically everybody who was doing that job transitioned to a new show called Department of Untapped Hilarity.

124
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Duh. Duh.

125
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
For short.

126
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Yeah.

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
So I have questions about duh.

128
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,360
And actually that first was something called the, I think it was called the Wrong Brothers instead of the Right Brothers,

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
which took place in the aviation area.

130
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,360
And we were like airplane mechanics doing improv on the street.

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Yeah.

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm just remembering a lot of his notes.

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
What a narrow area.

134
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I know.

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Like an Aaron Hayes from all kinds of TV.

136
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
She was part of it.

137
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Wow.

138
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Chris Tallman, Jeremy Mark from Super Ego.

139
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm trying to think of other people that some people took off.

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
I forget.

141
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Was this a random, was it like sort of random auditioning for this or were they aware of your pocket of people as we should reach out to them?

142
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,360
It was random auditioning, but the guy who was basically running it all, Frank Maciel, was a friend of ours.

143
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,360
So it was kind of like he pulled from the talent pool that I think he knew.

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Okay, sure, sure.

145
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:34,360
And then that turned into Department of Untapped Hilarity, which was the big stage show in California Adventure where we dressed like Mormons on a mission and rode bicycles to set each set.

146
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,360
It was so strange.

147
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
But then we did like a Whose Line Is It Anyway type show for about 20 minutes.

148
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,360
And that was really fun and did fairly well.

149
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
But then they shut that down too.

150
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,360
And then I moved to like I did Laughingstock.

151
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I did Billy Hill and the Hillbillies briefly.

152
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,360
I did push the Talking Trashcan for years.

153
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,360
And then I taught improv workshops through their entertainment program and education program.

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
And that was basically my run.

155
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Wow, wow. Oh, geez.

156
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:15,360
So you like facilitated anything that was the improv-y around the party, which there is a lot of stuff when you add all that up and even like down to the like the characters or the walk around characters.

157
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
It's improv. Star Wars.

158
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
There's so much improv going on.

159
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
It is a you forget what a big hub of.

160
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah, it's like it's one of the maybe the only in a way like real world applications of here's a place where improv is needed.

161
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,360
And one of the few you get paid to improvise.

162
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Yeah, right.

163
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
And it was a great job because I was in my 20s when I started.

164
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,360
And I think it was like I want to say it was like 20 or 25 dollars an hour.

165
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
And you got full benefits.

166
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Pretty good. Yeah.

167
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Geez. Wow. Yeah.

168
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,360
And much better, by the way, than I will get to.

169
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,360
There were some labor disputes in the A-Team stunt show.

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
That's one of the only Google results.

171
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,360
There's not a ton online for the A-Team stunt show, but they were they would have been more than happy with those rates.

172
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
And they were like doing like they were like hurting themselves.

173
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
They were risking their lives every day.

174
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,360
And maybe Universal, I could I could speak to this as a tour guide.

175
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,360
I think maybe the Disney pay is for performers is superior to Universal potentially.

176
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Because there's also wasn't there a guy at least in the Wild West on show and there were two incarnations of that.

177
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,360
That one guy fell off the zip line and broke his neck.

178
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Oh, geez. I remember that happening, too.

179
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Really? Oh, man. I don't know that one.

180
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Wow. Wow. Yeah.

181
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
No injuries on the job for you.

182
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Just like emotional, I guess.

183
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:40,360
No, actually, that was a really good time of life because it was it was like the first time I felt truly independent, had some disposable income.

184
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
I was with my best friends.

185
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
We would go get a beer after every time.

186
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
And, you know, it was great.

187
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Was there a hangout spot you would have after getting off the job?

188
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
You mean in the park? Yeah.

189
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Well, anywhere, really.

190
00:09:51,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Well, around, we would go to the block at Orange, which, by the way, you take a street called Shop Pertainment to get into and go to this place called I think it was Alcatraz Brewery.

191
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Because a few of us lived in Long Beach.

192
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Most of us lived in L.A.

193
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I lived in Long Beach, and this is a place where we could go while we're all down there.

194
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
And we know traffic, which is considerable.

195
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
We're pretty trapped down there for sure.

196
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Wow. Well, block at Orange, solid.

197
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,360
They got the sagebrush cantina now.

198
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Oh, the creepy mannequins outside.

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Excellent alter-ito.

200
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
You know, the massive alter-ito.

201
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Have we been in that alter-ito?

202
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
I don't believe so.

203
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
We went to one by water.

204
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
We went to one by the John Wayne.

205
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Okay, we've been to a different alter-ito down in Orange County.

206
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Well, you got to hit them all because they're just vastly nuanced.

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
They're like the Fry's electronic store.

208
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
They're just way different.

209
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Oh, yeah.

210
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Hey, stay tuned for that one.

211
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,360
I can't build up our eventual Fry's episode.

212
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
We're doing a Fry's episode.

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Are you?

214
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
Oh, for sure.

215
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
It's themes.

216
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
That's the theme.

217
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
That's true.

218
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
There's a radical amount of theming in all of them.

219
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
They're all totally different.

220
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Like Roman space.

221
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,360
There's like, yeah, there's island ones.

222
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
There's like Alice in Wonderland.

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
What? Where?

224
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
The valley.

225
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Down the note.

226
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Oh my God.

227
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Kenoga Park is the...

228
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,360
But like scratchy Lewis Carroll era illustration, Alice in Wonderland.

230
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Oh my God.

231
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
So it's a little horrific.

232
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,360
That is so specific and strange for an electronic superstore.

233
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Really specific and really intense.

234
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Like they put more attention into theming than they do into their stock.

235
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
The new having stuff in stock.

236
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Yes.

237
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
There's so much missing.

238
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Everything I've ever bought from their breaks.

239
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
It's like not a good store, but theming.

240
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,360
But a surprising selection of snacks.

241
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes.

242
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,360
A very well stocked convenience store, a not great stocked electronics store.

243
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Yeah.

244
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,360
And every time I've been in there on display on the big TVs is always like the four woman

245
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,360
electronic violin ensemble playing like live concert DVD.

246
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Wow.

247
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I think they're called Bond actually.

248
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Oh really?

249
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Yeah.

250
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
But nothing to do with Bond.

251
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
I don't think.

252
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Right.

253
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Oh weird.

254
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
But like one of those, are they like the piano guys?

255
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Like all the guys who like together play piano and like deconstructed.

256
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Yeah.

257
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Piano guys like play Trump's inauguration I think.

258
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Oh boy.

259
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,360
They were one of the ones real, but like something around it is real.

260
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

261
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
But they're not political.

262
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
That's a thing.

263
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Like they would do any president.

264
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
They're apolitical.

265
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

266
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Thank God.

267
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
I think politics haven't gotten the four piano guys.

268
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Yeah.

269
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,360
They're harking back to a better time.

270
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Yeah.

271
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Bipartisanship ruled.

272
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Well, so Push.

273
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Let's talk Push a little bit.

274
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,360
I feel like I'm mainly aware of Push because of your association with that.

275
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I don't think I ever met Push when I was in the party.

276
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Do you guys interact with Push ever?

277
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Push was only out here.

278
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
No, it was pretty much every park.

279
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,360
I feel like I met, maybe I did meet Push.

280
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
What years were it?

281
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I forget.

282
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Well into like the, I think late 90s into the 2010s.

283
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,360
I remember a moving trash can, but not necessarily a talking trash can.

284
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Well, I bet that was it, but the intercom was broken because it was always breaking

285
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
down.

286
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Okay.

287
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
So perhaps in Florida, there was a moving trash can.

288
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Yeah.

289
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I mean, it was a lot of frequency issues all the time.

290
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Where were you, where were you do it from?

291
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
Where were you stationed?

292
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
They moved it around a lot.

293
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,360
So it was at one point in Tomorrowland, then it was in California Adventure in a few different

294
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
places.

295
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,360
It would move a lot and it was frequently moving because of frequency issues, like with

296
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
all their radios and stuff.

297
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,360
And there was two, there was one called Push and one called Shove and they looked identical,

298
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,360
but you know, one always worked better than the other, but even that.

299
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Also, even though it might've been working, there was some push operators, I'm not saying

300
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm one of them, who would like milk that it wasn't working to get off their sets a

301
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
little early.

302
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Oh, how would you just be like, I'm trying and it just doesn't, it's not going.

303
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Yeah.

304
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
And again, it was definitely not me.

305
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
But if you did it.

306
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I'm not saying it was not me.

307
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Fair, fair.

308
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
But when I did do that.

309
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,360
And were you far away in a room where you were watching a camera or were you close by?

310
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
No, you're very close by.

311
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
You got to wear your own.

312
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Oh, this is a great thing.

313
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
So this is another union job and you got to wear your own clothes and then they had to

314
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
pay you for wearing your own clothes.

315
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
So you got an extra bonus.

316
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Oh, wow.

317
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
You get a bump.

318
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Sure.

319
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,360
So you'd wear like a ball cap and you just wore like a lavalier mic, but instead of

320
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,360
putting it on your lapel, it would run down your sleeve, like under a watch into your

321
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
hand like this.

322
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Like you just kind of have a semi-closed fist and then a duffel bag over your shoulder with

323
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
the controller on your right hand.

324
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
And so I just kind of put my hand up to my mouth like this.

325
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,360
And then I would only have to talk like this and it would modulate my voice up.

326
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,360
And I was usually about, I could get as far away as I wanted, but if you get really far

327
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,360
away, you can't hear what the people talking to push are saying because push had no like

328
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
two way microphone.

329
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Oh, you had nothing in your ear.

330
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
No.

331
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
So I had to be close to hear them live.

332
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,360
And so I would usually just, whoever it was talking to, I'd stand somewhat behind them

333
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,360
and they couldn't hear me because the microphone or the speaker was louder.

334
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,360
But the parents all knew, you know, most people would, I didn't try to hide that much.

335
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Yeah.

336
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Yeah.

337
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
You looked like Serpica.

338
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
You looked like a plain clothes cop wearing a wire.

339
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Definitely.

340
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Yeah.

341
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
I mean, it definitely must have looked creepy with a guy in his hand in his bag.

342
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Maybe that's why they stopped doing it because it was probably like, oh God, who's this?

343
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Watch out for Push's friend.

344
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Yeah.

345
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I wondered because they have now we all were in Galaxy's at the same time.

346
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Yes.

347
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Oh yes.

348
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Day one.

349
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Day one.

350
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
And we had interacted with R2D2 and I wonder was there a guy?

351
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
I didn't see R2D2.

352
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
He's in the Droid Depot and I was just going.

353
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,360
He's available for purchase, but they also like turn him on and he'll like beep at you.

354
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,360
And he can tell if your intonation is a question or.

355
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Wait, you can buy a full sized R2D2?

356
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
$25,000.

357
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
$25,000.

358
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Wait, they're selling something for $25,000?

359
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Yeah.

360
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Got some weird press in that like there was almost like a weird, like a novelty bragging

361
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,360
point of the place that if you really want to throw it down, there's a $25,000.

362
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Yeah.

363
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Yeah.

364
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I think I saw him.

365
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
I saw the control.

366
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I saw the guy.

367
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh, because that's what I was wondering.

368
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Was there a person behind me?

369
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Because I believe so.

370
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I think he was fully in like a cast member garb.

371
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Because that's a tiny room.

372
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,360
It's in like a tiny room where you I bought Rex sitting over there.

373
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
There he is.

374
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
Oh, yeah.

375
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
He was bad.

376
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
He's in the corner looking at the wall.

377
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
Oh, my God.

378
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
He's Blair Witching it.

379
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Yeah.

380
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
The dog doesn't like him either.

381
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Oh, that's too bad.

382
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
He wheels around.

383
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Oh, yeah.

384
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I haven't done a lot of interacting with I have carpet too.

385
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
So Rex can't get far.

386
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
But yeah, Rex is really a pre or not a pre push is similar to push.

387
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
You need a BB8 for carpet, right?

388
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Oh, I guess so.

389
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
That's a good point.

390
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Oh, yeah.

391
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Because there's no part with wheels.

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Like it's all I don't know how they work.

393
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Really.

394
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Did you do a droid?

395
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Did you get a droid?

396
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
No, I couldn't even get in.

397
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
I couldn't get into the cantina.

398
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Couldn't get into the lightsaber thing.

399
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
I had a pretty bad experience at Galaxy's.

400
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
That was all right.

401
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
That makes sense.

403
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Well, you were part of you were the second group, right?

404
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
You were staggered.

405
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,360
So like now you're competing with every but like you're that was the first time that group

406
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
one and group two were all mission.

407
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,360
And yes, we fighting in your we were bad boys and caught in line with someone to get into

408
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
the cantina.

409
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Good for you.

410
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
We joined an existing party.

411
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
We were in the same group.

412
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
I just want to acknowledge it.

413
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,360
So if we had been if we had been more in communication, we may have been able to tell you what the

414
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
whole situation is, which is regrettable.

415
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I'm sorry.

416
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
You can just walk in now.

417
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
It's wide open.

418
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
You can make a reservation for the bar whenever you want.

419
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,360
The thing that killed me was that when we went to go into the cantina, there was this

420
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,360
young just as most Disney employees are just full of fear.

421
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Guy saying, you know, I'm going to go into the cantina.

422
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Bright Suns offworlder.

423
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
You can't you can't even you can't even get in line.

424
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,360
And so he had to continue talking in this vernacular that they make them talk.

425
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
But I'm sure they've given them a limited vocabulary of things to memorize.

426
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,360
So he didn't have the words to deal with people going, wait, why can't we at least get in

427
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
line?

428
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Like, it's our choice if we want to get in line offworlder.

429
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I regret to inform you.

430
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
The First Order has a.

431
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Oh, God.

432
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
I'm sorry.

433
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm sorry.

434
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm sorry.

435
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
I'm sorry.

436
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I regret to inform you.

437
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
The First Order has a.

438
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Oh, God.

439
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Oh, God.

440
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Oh, God.

441
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
And he was like near tears and I felt horrible.

442
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
We backed off for his sake.

443
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
But it was really strange.

444
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,360
You know, the word they what do they call lines or buzzers or apps?

445
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Right.

446
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,360
The cosmic cue that you get, the galactic cue is evolved at capacity.

447
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Oh, God.

448
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,360
And he was just like imploding and everybody was so stressed.

449
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Language, please.

450
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Yes, I'm stuck.

451
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Yeah.

452
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm going to turn to the universal translator on.

453
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Oh, please.

454
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
OK.

455
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Turn it off.

456
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
My job.

457
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
They're watching me.

458
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
You don't understand.

459
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
It's not the First Order.

460
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
It's the middle managers.

461
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,360
They're over there and chinos and bled shirts and straw hats.

462
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
They're after me.

463
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
An upsetting amount of casual middle managers there that day.

464
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
There is more of them than workers at Disney.

465
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
It is.

466
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
That's the unsettling thing about Galaxy's Edge.

467
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,360
When you work there and I'm not doing that thing where I'm like likening Disney to a

468
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
fascist regime.

469
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,360
However, they they do have a culture of fear and like cult there for their workers who

470
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,360
go there thinking like this is a dream job because it's paradise.

471
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,360
And everybody's so kind of afraid of messing up that nobody makes a decision.

472
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,360
So getting an answer from someone has to go way up the chain.

473
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Right.

474
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Yeah.

475
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
It's a strange place to work.

476
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
We were always separated as the union performers, but watching it happen.

477
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
And my wife was a princess there, too.

478
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
And she.

479
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Wow.

480
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
She.

481
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Yeah.

482
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
And Tokyo Disney, too.

483
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
God, you guys should have her.

484
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Oh, wow.

485
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Yeah.

486
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Yeah.

487
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Yeah.

488
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
She worked in Tokyo.

489
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Yeah.

490
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
For six months.

491
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Wow.

492
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
Did she start here and get like was offered?

493
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Yeah.

494
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,360
She was a Ariel, Mary Poppins and a Cinderella and I think a Sleeping Beauty, I think.

495
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Wow.

496
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Did she have to learn the same Japanese to do this?

497
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
No, I guess not.

498
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
I don't think so.

499
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,360
And there is a they do hire white people to portray the princesses.

500
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Right.

501
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Well, like in Japan.

502
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Yeah.

503
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah.

504
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Because, yeah, you do not see Japanese.

505
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Right.

506
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
They want to.

507
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Yeah.

508
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
They want them to look American.

509
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
I got be American.

510
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Not look American.

511
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Be American.

512
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
All the princesses are American.

513
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Yeah.

514
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Well, yeah.

515
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Right.

516
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,800
A Little Mermaid lives in the sea next to America.

517
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Yeah.

518
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Mulan is from Chinatown, San Francisco.

519
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Yeah.

520
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
America.

521
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
She speaks English.

522
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh, I listen to her.

523
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,720
We know they want American performers because I was trying to get Jason years ago to apply

524
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,960
to play Austin Powers at Universal Japan.

525
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
A British band.

526
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah.

527
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Yes.

528
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
I was like, come on, let's go do it.

529
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
We're not doing anything here.

530
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
We didn't have a podcast yet.

531
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Yeah.

532
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
In retrospect, I should have.

533
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Yeah.

534
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
I should have gone.

535
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Were you working there?

536
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
No, no.

537
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
I just saw it online and I go, hey, Jason, go do this.

538
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,040
It'll be funny if you go to Japan and play Austin Powers.

539
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
Yeah.

540
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,240
You're just checking job listings for Jason.

541
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah.

542
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Yeah.

543
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,840
Anytime you have ever sent me a job listing, it's not like, hey, this would be a good job.

544
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
This would be good pay.

545
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
It's like, this would be funny if you did this.

546
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, sure.

547
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And you have yet to apply to one of them.

548
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I know.

549
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah.

550
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,240
Your current one is like, you should apply to be artist director at UCB.

551
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Oh my God.

552
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Yes.

553
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,320
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're listening to this now, support Jason Sheridan to be

554
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,800
the artistic director of UCB.

555
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I support you.

556
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
We've had a great few years.

557
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Everything's going good.

558
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,080
I want you to be there as soon as the ship goes down.

559
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
I want you to get revenge on all of our enemies.

560
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
I want it to all happen.

561
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
I support this.

562
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Yeah.

563
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Okay.

564
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Yeah.

565
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Let's do it.

566
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Anyway, back to it.

567
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
And do it all dressed as Austin Powers.

568
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
Yeah.

569
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Oh, yeah.

570
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Like go in there for the interview going, I get comedy very, very.

571
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Yeah.

572
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Do I make you horny is not a question that any artistic director should be asking.

573
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,480
But it will replace don't think as the official phrase of the UCB theater.

574
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Yeah.

575
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Where were we?

576
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
What were we saying?

577
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Japanese princess.

578
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Oh my God.

579
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
So wait, so okay.

580
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,520
But because you were you were governed by the union, so you were outside of the you're

581
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,440
not saying Gestapo like tactics of the rest of the Disney.

582
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:46,380
Yeah, we were managed by them still, but they they didn't quite treat us like the characters

583
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,640
and the and the like ride operators and the regular employees.

584
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
I see.

585
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
I see.

586
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Was it equity?

587
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,400
No, it is in Florida, but it was AGVA, the American Guild of Variety Artists, which was

588
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,080
a useless union.

589
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,320
It has a no strike clause.

590
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
Literally, like there's no power in this union.

591
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000
We couldn't strike.

592
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,320
So negotiations were always like, oh, we got an extra vending machine for you.

593
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,000
You know, and I think like Phyllis Diller was the president for a long time.

594
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Really?

595
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
So it was like a reader.

596
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,000
No, it was like a holdover from Vaudeville, I believe.

597
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
Literally the union.

598
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Yeah.

599
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Wow.

600
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Well, we've had past.

601
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,160
I think if you pass guest, if he was talking about how there were different like clicks,

602
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,320
essentially, depending on what department you were like princesses.

603
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Do you remember this?

604
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,080
And there's like a whole social structure in the park.

605
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,000
Did you experience that or were you just doing your own thing?

606
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,960
I guess, yeah, I know that the face characters, because my wife, Amanda has told me this,

607
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,120
were kind of the top of the food chain in terms of characters.

608
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,720
And then the like the you know, like the fuzzy characters were below that.

609
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,280
And then we were disconnected from it all.

610
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,400
But I'm imagining we were higher on the food chain because I know all those people

611
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,560
wanted to be agvats like the goal was always to be an agvah.

612
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,960
That's what you're called an agvah because you got good pay and you got, you know,

613
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
respect.

614
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,440
And I say that loosely.

615
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,320
Respecting your aviator stained overalls.

616
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,880
Yes, riding a bicycle.

617
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Playing up.

618
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,520
Was there any job in the park that you were like gunning forever or was it just not in

619
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,880
the realm of it?

620
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,080
Well, were you even just like, I want to do a day of Haunted Mansion or something,

621
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
because that always seemed like fun?

622
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:42,200
No, I think it was the reason I think back on it so fondly is that it was the easiest

623
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,320
job. It required nothing like the job that you truly left behind the minute you clocked

624
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,840
out. And if anything, if you carried it with you, it was something like you're still

625
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,960
hanging out with your friends.

626
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,480
There was no pressure, no high stakes.

627
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,880
It was so breezy and like the stakes were so low because you I guess some people that

628
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,960
don't do improv, it would make them tense.

629
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,640
But anybody that does, it was the lowest stakes improv.

630
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,040
You were often reusing a lot of the same theme park jokes.

631
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,480
It was not high art in any way, but it worked so well that the people love like push

632
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,840
alone. People just ate it up.

633
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,920
I don't know why they still don't do push.

634
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,160
It's so it's one person on a job and it gets so much for its, you know, like

635
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,320
investment and like pulls people out of lines and crowds for a while.

636
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,080
Yeah, like this will eat up 50 people for this run of time and delight them.

637
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,040
And I would get these huge crowds and circles just surrounding this trash can.

638
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,560
And like the kids were in awe.

639
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
The parents were laughing.

640
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,360
I probably couldn't do a lot of the things I was doing at the time, because like I would

641
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,760
make the trash can like flirt with people or bump into the other trash can and go like,

642
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,840
Sheila, why did you divorce me?

643
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,520
You know, and like hound people for their churros.

644
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,360
I was like, you know, like to borderline harassment, throw your dish.

645
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,720
God dang.

646
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,920
So push would have been canceled.

647
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,480
Yes, I would have been fired today.

648
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,360
I would have been fired.

649
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,880
Push the problematic trash.

650
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,120
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,600
And I would like someone would throw away a beer and I would just do a whole set drunk

652
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,480
as push, you know.

653
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Yeah.

654
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Yeah.

655
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Were they poor, beerian me?

656
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,440
And I would just like go bump into things and then like roll up to women and go, hi,

657
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
how you doing?

658
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
It was horrible.

659
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,360
It feels like that would be you could get away with that now.

660
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Like horror nights.

661
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
Yeah.

662
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,920
They should push trash can and horror.

663
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Yeah, they should.

664
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
And then he could say what it would on the Sweden episode.

665
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,440
I guess it's actually coming out the star way.

666
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,360
And like they can mention weed on the announcements.

667
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,480
They can be like, don't smoke on the star way, even weed or something like they can

668
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,120
say weed, which is crazy.

669
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,200
So bold faced.

670
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,120
I know there were times where like kids would a lot of kids would kick it like preteens

671
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
would kick it.

672
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,000
And sometimes their parents were there and I would just flat up roll up to the parents

673
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,640
go, why aren't you doing something about your child?

674
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,120
Do something about your child.

675
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,920
And then I would get the rest of the crowd to shame those parents.

676
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Wow.

677
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,320
Sometimes it got tense.

678
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,200
People like a little comedy.

679
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,480
Like people like a little especially when it goes against the Disney type.

680
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Yeah.

681
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
They're relaxed.

682
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
They're on vacation.

683
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,840
They're like, oh, OK, yeah, I'm into this.

684
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,920
A lot of jokes about how expensive things were.

685
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Mm hmm.

686
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Yeah.

687
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Yeah.

688
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,040
I think I was sort of like part of me wanted to get fired because part of me at that point

689
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,280
pushes is a solitary job and my friends were gone and I would break with like a lot of

690
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,360
the characters and there was a handful of them that I broke with regularly that I loved.

691
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,760
They were like my family.

692
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,120
But then there were these others that would come in and just like eat a banana with their

693
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,960
mouth open the whole time next to you.

694
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,640
And it was just I was and they'd always like put on a Disney movie on your break in the

695
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,160
break room and you couldn't escape it.

696
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,240
And I started to go a little crazy.

697
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,960
And so there was part of me that was like, I want to get fired.

698
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Sure.

699
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Yeah.

700
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,480
But it was like being in a like bad relationship where you sabotage it rather than have the

701
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
balls to break up.

702
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,320
I was like the money is too good.

703
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,640
You know, so I was just kind of daring them to fire me and they never did.

704
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,760
When in the unlikely event that you're being supervised to such an extent that you like

705
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,720
that you actually you slip up and say something like they would have to line up, you know,

706
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,680
that would require like three different things to happen as opposed to you quitting, which

707
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
you'd have to like go do that.

708
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,360
You have to arrange a meeting.

709
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,460
Well, a lot of the middle managers were kind of afraid of the agvas for some reason.

710
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,380
I think because they knew the agvas didn't care.

711
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,740
So they didn't have the unspoken discipline of fear over them.

712
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,460
And I remember there's, you know, we would get away with saying weird things.

713
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,980
I remember there's a guy on the Laughing Stock show that got a little kid to come and volunteer

714
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,960
and he was talking to this character, Clem, and he's like, this kid's the only one with

715
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,140
nuts enough to challenge you, Clem.

716
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,900
I'm full Mike.

717
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,620
You know, I'm like, I remember another guy was like, Jesus Christ.

718
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,820
They never meant to do it, but it would come out or like we were doing an improvised song

719
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:25,300
about Aladdin and my friend Gail, she's like, I want you to come into my cave of wonders.

720
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,580
Like all this sexual, like we do a lot of sexual innuendo and it was funny.

721
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:36,620
We had so many regulars, like I hesitate to call them stalkers, but they were like anywhere

722
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,940
from just super Disney fans that would come to every show every day to like special needs

723
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,740
people that were dropped off as a cheaper way of care.

724
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,980
We'd see this at Universal as well, where special needs people were dropped off often

725
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:57,700
in groups of two and they were just given annual passes because it was cheaper to have

726
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,960
them be at the park all day than to have specialized care.

727
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,860
And they were lovely, wonderful, but you'd see them every day and they'd volunteer every

728
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,220
time and like or yell your jokes out before you could get them out.

729
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,180
But that was more my fault or our fault for reusing the same jokes.

730
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,980
We found a pattern.

731
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Yeah.

732
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,260
But this can also be rare in comedy is like an audience who's happy to be there or like

733
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,340
an audience who really wants to be because it's like, well, I already paid for that.

734
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
This is free.

735
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
I can sit down.

736
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
That's true.

737
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
At the very least.

738
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,140
And they actually somehow liked repetition.

739
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,300
They almost didn't like new things.

740
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:40,020
You could imagine your everyday Disney guest who comes every day is probably into things

741
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
not changing.

742
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,580
Like they like the stability.

743
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,340
The Internet makes that very clear.

744
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:51,100
Just move a plant or something.

745
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,980
Just peruse the mice chat message boards.

746
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,660
I can't imagine if we were working there in the days of Reddit because there was burgeoning

747
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,140
message boards and we had seen some of them.

748
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,420
I had an issue with a stalker there and she would post on some things.

749
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:15,780
By the way, she was in her seventies and she was a strange stalker that admitted to me

750
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,260
she thought I was sending her coded messages on stage and stuff like that.

751
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,260
Oh no.

752
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Yeah.

753
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,340
So retire those jokes, I guess, if you know what the code is.

754
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,940
She found my email and it was strange.

755
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,460
She would come with her middle-aged son who would wear cataract glasses and sit separate

756
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,060
from her, but they both would come to every show every day.

757
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
Whoa.

758
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
Yeah.

759
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,460
She was very sweet, but something was off.

760
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,660
What's the procedure for dealing with that?

761
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,260
That's a good question.

762
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,700
I'm sure there's a super protocol for that now.

763
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,700
I just walked up to her and she, because at one point she emailed me going, oh, I don't

764
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,780
like when you hug and kiss Gail on stage.

765
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,660
She came up to me after the show and I was like, I just want to clarify, A, that's just

766
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,940
an act and B, that's kind of not something you should say.

767
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,580
She's like, well, aren't you sending me these messages?

768
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,220
You're throwing references my way.

769
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,940
I went, I'm sorry, I'm not.

770
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,900
Then she reached in her bag and I hunkered down.

771
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Oh my God.

772
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,900
This is it.

773
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,780
Then she just said, I guess I'm just going a little crazy.

774
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,980
Then pulled her hand out of her bag and nothing was in it.

775
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,180
I was just like, what is happening here?

776
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,980
Oh my gosh.

777
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,900
You didn't ask for, well, by virtue of me being a performer, I'm putting myself out

778
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,020
there for things like this.

779
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,860
You should expect this kind of thing to happen.

780
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,060
It was really, really strange.

781
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,180
Oh my God.

782
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,740
Which is a little microcosm of if you were a very famous person, the kind of insanity

783
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,380
you would deal with that all the time.

784
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
I can't imagine.

785
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,820
That's the only time anything like that's ever happened to me.

786
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,860
I think even that was totally harmless.

787
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,980
She didn't have anything in her bag, but it's the first time that it gave you cause to ever

788
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,420
consider that kind of thing.

789
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,820
It was really strange.

790
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
Yikes.

791
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,900
I remember that happened when I was, I taught for many years.

792
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,220
The last couple of years was the first time I was aware of troubled students and the

793
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,540
surroundings of my classroom and thinking, I've never had to consider that something

794
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,620
tragic could happen here.

795
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,020
It kind of took the joy out of teaching.

796
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
It was horrible.

797
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
Yeah.

798
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Yeah, sure.

799
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
Oh God.

800
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,380
Well, that's a rough area, but if you're listening and you think you've been hearing coded messages

801
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,860
from us, you're absolutely right.

802
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,860
We're talking to you.

803
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,860
Please murder us.

804
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,820
That's me.

805
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,820
I've been hearing coded messages and I'm here to murder you.

806
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,820
We invited you.

807
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,340
We let the wolf into the hen house.

808
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,820
I developed Super Ego and podcast to get to this point.

809
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Wow.

810
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
You built up your own podcast.

811
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,820
Long game.

812
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,820
The Heath Ledger Joker is such a long con.

813
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,820
Such a long con to talented Mr. Ripley.

814
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
That's a longer one.

815
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,820
That's a better example.

816
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,820
I admire the strategy.

817
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,780
Matt, what did you, I have a guess, but what did you do with Universal?

818
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,060
Oh, I'm curious to hear what your guess is.

819
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,500
Were you a working class Brooklyn man who yelled from the windows?

820
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Close.

821
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,980
I was the spinoff of that, the short-lived spinoff of that, the British yelling person

822
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,780
up on a balcony on the British street.

823
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,780
So you should have been Austin Powers in Japan.

824
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
No.

825
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
Yeah.

826
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,100
Yeah, because there's this thing, the people up in the Brooklyn window just yell down at

827
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
the park guests.

828
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,620
They thought, let's do that with the English street.

829
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:53,340
And this was, I guess, I think this was 2011 and it was summer and I had come out of a

830
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,220
fairly long relationship and I was feeling like a lot of my friends lived in LA and I'm

831
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:02,180
like, I should get social again because I'm kind of like, I skew towards the reclusive

832
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,180
home body.

833
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,740
And so I decided I'll go, my friends are doing this.

834
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,500
Maybe it'll be a rehash of Disney where you're seeing your friends and you're doing improv.

835
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:18,180
And then I went that day and auditioned and then for the first day of orientation, we

836
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,220
all had to stand up and introduce ourselves and my wife stood up and I just, I remember

837
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,460
literally saying, uh-oh, like who is that?

838
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:31,180
And we hit it off that day, we hit it off and we're basically like, she's like, it was

839
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
crazy.

840
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,820
It was one of those true, like, not only say like love it for a site, but we both were

841
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,860
all in somehow.

842
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,580
I don't know how it happened or what.

843
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,980
And so we worked that summer together and we were the first ones to open that show the

844
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,260
first day together.

845
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,740
And just as soon as we were like officially a couple, I quit because I didn't really want

846
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,620
to do that job. And I'm like, my God, not only did I get to see my friends, but I think

847
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,660
I met my wife. And so like, I don't need this job anymore.

848
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,500
Wow.

849
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,540
Got out of there. She worked there a little while longer.

850
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:06,100
And then she also did the special effects show and the Jurassic Park dino expert or

851
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,500
whatever it is that walks around.

852
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,580
Yeah.

853
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,980
Wait, what was it? Was it were you with a dinosaur for that or?

854
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,380
I think there was like a cart that you had like animatronic puppet.

855
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,380
Oh, the egg. I think it was like the egg.

856
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,860
Yeah. The puppet hand puppet.

857
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,140
Hey, yes. Yeah, that's right.

858
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,460
And now it's much more advanced.

859
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,220
I like to say all the full sized raptor, full sized triceratops.

860
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,660
Yeah. I want to say it was called Dino Chasers, but is that something else?

861
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,900
That sounds like something else.

862
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,380
But maybe, you know, that's a cartoon I watched as a kid, I think.

863
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,100
Maybe you watched all three seasons and yet don't remember a drop of it.

864
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,940
I don't know. Yeah, anyway.

865
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,900
But anyway, there's a movie coming out, I'm sure.

866
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,780
I am the gateway to so many people if you want them like Mark, Jeremy, Amanda.

867
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,620
They all had so many jobs at theme parks like.

868
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,860
We were the mayor's of of Disney.

869
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,340
Disney. Yeah, probably.

870
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,820
We also all did a bunch of special events.

871
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,820
That was the other thing, like corporate special events, improv things.

872
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,980
I was also a thing called a swing, which if you did enough shows,

873
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,260
you would just come in for the day and in case they needed you.

874
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,860
So you'd sit around all day and maybe you'd do a couple of shows to keep fresh.

875
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,020
That was the greatest.

876
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:23,500
Wow. Wow. Did you guys then like sort of fall in love wearing like

877
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,980
monogles and bowler hats and she's got missing teeth?

878
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,180
And that. Yeah.

879
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,340
So originally, yes, it was like a tweety upper class British man and a posh woman.

880
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,820
But they for some reason wanted to do away with that.

881
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,020
So she was dressed like a Spice Girl and I was dressed like Keith Richards.

882
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,740
It was awful. It was truly awful.

883
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,900
How did it compare like work like I universal?

884
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,220
I don't think it's union. It was union.

885
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,300
It was. Yeah. Yeah.

886
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,740
Yeah. I don't. I they do have a small union section.

887
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,740
I was thinking when you were talking about the Disney Union,

888
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,340
that there was some I remember there's a lot of grumbling when I was a tour guide

889
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,860
of that at one point in time, like before 1995 or something,

890
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,900
the tour guides and the drivers were in the same union.

891
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,100
And then and then the guides were like, we need to be our own union.

892
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,900
And that caused the rates to go to like half of what the drivers make.

893
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,100
So there hadn't been the split because the drivers do great.

894
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,820
And they should, because that's real work.

895
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,260
Yeah, they're doing because if they aren't doing the tram,

896
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,380
they're like driving equipment around for the studio.

897
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,180
Real there. They should be good.

898
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,060
But for some reason, the like union happily walked off a cliff

899
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,820
and cut their wages in half.

900
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,340
I don't know. That sounds about right.

901
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,860
I bet you it was Agva.

902
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,620
Yeah, it could have been. Yeah.

903
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,780
Forget what I forget what I was then.

904
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,980
What were my tiny paychecks?

905
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,500
What TV legend was your head of your organization?

906
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,220
Well, there while there was, I don't know if I should say that.

907
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,860
Oh, I was just trying to.

908
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,140
Well, no, he was not a union person,

909
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,980
but they're like one of the higher ups at the in the tour

910
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,460
that program was the youngest son on the nanny.

911
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,420
Oh, really?

912
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Still there. He was at the Jurassic World.

913
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,620
Oh, I didn't say hi. Oh, my gosh.

914
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,420
You've been keeping the secret from us for years now.

915
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,580
We didn't know this. But he's not he's not a union.

916
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,420
He's not a person causing right.

917
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,020
He's not the man causing the wages to stay low.

918
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
So let me make that very clear. He was very nice.

919
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,620
He's not some some agvacrony.

920
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,340
But so this is insane.

921
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,260
The way specific Spice Girl or the general?

922
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,780
No, not. And no, it was never even you are a Spice Girls just modeled that.

923
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,940
And like I wasn't a Rolling Stone. It was just that kind of thing.

924
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,580
And Eric. Yeah.

925
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,420
So it was like a UK shirt, maybe like a flag.

926
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,380
I have a picture I'll show you.

927
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,660
Actually, I think in the picture, it was our first day working, I think.

928
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,940
I actually think she might have still been the posh lady,

929
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,700
but I was the rocker for some reason.

930
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,940
So I had like a wig with a headband and scarves and like a tight

931
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,780
shirt and tight leather pants. It was awful.

932
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,260
I'm tempted to ask, is there a chance you remember how the voice sounded?

933
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,420
I think it went a little bit like this.

934
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,420
Yeah. What are you doing down there on a street?

935
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,500
I go around, get me popping corn.

936
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
I mean, that's great.

937
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,140
I would enjoy it. Yeah.

938
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,300
Walked by today.

939
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,820
Would you make harmlessly make fun of people's clothing or hats?

940
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,260
Yeah, I think so.

941
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,220
Because that's blazing hot.

942
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,380
It was summer and we were in the direct sunlight.

943
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,780
Sure. Everything is entirely polyester.

944
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,900
Yeah. Nothing great. Yeah.

945
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,260
Yeah. It was happening to get them to the Greek mania.

946
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,540
Yes. Yeah.

947
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,580
Definitely had that feeling.

948
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,980
Yeah, I know.

949
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,660
That's one of my favorite theme park tropes is the look of rock

950
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,900
and roll entirely divorced from music.

951
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,180
It's like, all right, headband,

952
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,860
surly, cockney, British, emaciated guy.

953
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,540
No music, no music, but just that vibe.

954
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,460
Yeah, we know that to be rock and roll.

955
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,860
Semiotic said that's the symbol that communicates rock and roll.

956
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,300
And who's been that for a long time?

957
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,540
Who's been the big rock star who is British and shirtless?

958
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,020
You know, you know what the vibe you're describing is like Tom Cruise in

959
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,140
Rock of Ages. Yeah.

960
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,620
Like, yeah, Johnny Rock that or that or that Dennis Leary show.

961
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,380
Yeah. What name a new star since Oasis?

962
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,260
Who is of this nature?

963
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,980
That child band who sounds like Led Zeppelin.

964
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,180
What are they called? Oh, yeah.

965
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,980
Red Van Fleet.

966
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,940
Yeah. The child.

967
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,700
I hate it. I thought I thought he was a teenage girl.

968
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,900
No, yeah. Yeah.

969
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,180
So Red Van Fleet was like Joanna Newsome type.

970
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,580
Right. Oh, yeah.

971
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,100
I mean, it's like, yeah.

972
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,500
Yeah. And they're like in their early 20s.

973
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,940
And the little singer, he's adorable.

974
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,940
And he's just just so fresh faced.

975
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,860
He's like Annie. He's like orphan.

976
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,900
Yeah. Yeah.

977
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,820
The black smoke rises.

978
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,020
The death of.

979
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,300
And then I like that song is so goddamn catchy, too.

980
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,740
Well, I saw them on Saturday Night Live and I remember seeing feeling the same way

981
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,180
when I saw Future Islands on Letterman going, what is happening?

982
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,460
And I will I will investigate this hours for hours.

983
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,940
And I did.

984
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,220
I went down such a Future Islands rabbit hole after seeing that.

985
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,820
Do you have you seen that when he was on Letterman?

986
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,340
Yes. And he's doing that like speed skating dance and like this

987
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:33,260
and looks like Brando in the 50s, but not, you know, as well put together.

988
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,300
And I love him. Yeah.

989
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,260
I did a similar shorter research on Red Van Fleet.

990
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,260
The first article was like

991
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,980
Grandin and Fleet says they do not like to be compared to Led Zeppelin.

992
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,540
That's every article.

993
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,820
Yeah. And that's their own fault. Yeah.

994
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,260
I don't like to go to the grocery store, but look, some things are

995
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,580
can't avoid it. Yeah.

996
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,620
What do you want?

997
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,820
I get me. I'm like, I eat all the food.

998
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,540
I guess I got to find it. God damn it.

999
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,940
People know me as the grocery store guy.

1000
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,820
Shake it.

1001
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,140
If I'm at one, yeah, I can't avoid the.

1002
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,740
Garen does not want to be known as the grocery store guy.

1003
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,660
I don't know. I don't know. Why did I say that even?

1004
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,180
I don't mind going to the grocery store.

1005
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,340
You know, I hate the grocery store. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.

1006
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,700
I don't know why. Parking crowds.

1007
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,540
Sure. Well, if you're dealing if it's if it's Trader Joe's.

1008
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:31,300
Oh, yeah. I don't know why, because I'm also someone that like I won't eat.

1009
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,140
I'll forget to eat.

1010
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,540
So going to the grocery store is like

1011
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,580
going to do something that I may forget to use anyway later.

1012
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
Yeah. Yeah. I'll go.

1013
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,260
I'll be like, I should go to the grocery store and then I'll just go to McDonald's.

1014
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,020
Yeah. Which is next to the sprouts over here.

1015
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,780
Yeah. And then I'll just come home.

1016
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,820
I understand. I understand that.

1017
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,740
So I'm like, well, I took care of the immediate need.

1018
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,180
Yeah. Let's put it off.

1019
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,220
Yeah. Yeah.

1020
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,740
I'll go. And there's a very short window where it's all like in the fridge

1021
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,100
and the cupboards and I feel great. Yeah.

1022
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,260
And then after I've eaten a little bit of it, I'm like, oh no, it's going to be gone.

1023
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,860
So I go back.

1024
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,820
Oh, no. You have exactly how many of you guys live here?

1025
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,700
Just me and my girlfriend, Lindsey. Yeah.

1026
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,500
Lindsey Kate. I know. Yeah, of course.

1027
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,820
Oh, my God. Well, I'm curious.

1028
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,300
I want to see your refrigerator after.

1029
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,820
Oh, I don't think it's in good shape.

1030
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,780
No, I'm just kidding. You can't.

1031
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,180
You can't see it. No.

1032
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,820
You want to see it live on Mike?

1033
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,300
Let's see.

1034
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,420
Does it stretch that far?

1035
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,740
I guess it's like strangely intimate.

1036
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,940
You know, yeah.

1037
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,140
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1038
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,900
Even even if mine is clean and there's people over, it still feels like I don't.

1039
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,780
Yeah, it's like looking in your closet or something. Yeah. Yeah.

1040
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,460
I mean, we can peek in Mike's and see what fruit flavored soda he has this week.

1041
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,300
So I don't look a new artificial sweetener is out.

1042
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,100
No, I'm not. I'm more of a stevia man in general.

1043
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,460
But I don't have any Ziva, which is what you're referring to.

1044
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,220
Yeah. No, but I think there's going to be a hyper stevia.

1045
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,900
There's going to be stevia, too.

1046
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,500
You think I'm going to go all in on a new crazy stevia?

1047
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,140
Maybe there's stevia in that kombucha that I like that I drink. Oh, right.

1048
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,660
Yeah, I am a big stevia fan, but sometimes I drink too much and I get a stomach ache.

1049
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,740
Mike does not want to be known as the stevia guy. Incorrect.

1050
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,220
Fire away, he says.

1051
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,060
Mike starting a podcast about stevia soon headline.

1052
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,660
Mike loves being called stevia.

1053
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,820
Wait, that's stevia. No, it's stevia. Yeah.

1054
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,980
OK. Stevia artificial sweeteners.

1055
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,940
The thing that killed Lydia on Breaking Bad.

1056
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,700
Spoiler. Yeah. Stevia killed her.

1057
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,700
Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah.

1058
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,140
I guess not. Oh, you're right. Yeah.

1059
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,140
Other contents in a packet.

1060
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,100
OK. Yeah. Anyway.

1061
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,260
But you know, you don't have to worry about going to the grocery store with Hello Fresh,

1062
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,620
which I imagine we'll be having to read an ad for soon.

1063
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,820
Does this count? Do we not have to read one if we do this now?

1064
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,500
I don't think we hit the talking point, so I don't think it counts.

1065
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,100
Ah, shit. All right.

1066
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,660
We can cover both if you have one to read anytime soon.

1067
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,860
Sure, Blue Apron does.

1068
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,260
Yeah. I think this counts if you do it here. Yeah.

1069
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,300
Well, Miami Vice, I guess we should we could start.

1070
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,140
But we can make our way from Little Britain or whatever you call that.

1071
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,020
Yeah. Mostly unused UK zone over there.

1072
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:26,100
Yeah. Let's keep walking down to the down to the stunt zone, but also into the past.

1073
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,620
Oh, man. OK. So I grew up in Southern California in Whittier,

1074
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,540
which was fairly close to Disney, a little farther from Universal.

1075
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,420
So for my birthday, I always had my dad take me to Universal.

1076
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,860
I was more interested in that because also we got to go to Disney

1077
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,940
through his work once a year, like have the park just for the gas company.

1078
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,140
And that was cool.

1079
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,740
And I would end up at Disney probably two or three times a year.

1080
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,820
But Universal to me was like the movies.

1081
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,340
It was it was so exciting.

1082
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,380
It felt it felt more grown up in a little bit.

1083
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,740
Yeah. I talk about this.

1084
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,220
We thought it seemed like cooler, edgier up there. Yeah.

1085
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:06,100
And maybe more at the time, certainly in Miami Vice included more recent properties.

1086
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,260
You feel like you're, you know, going into your favorite show of right now,

1087
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,460
as opposed to like a fairy tale from the 50s.

1088
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,220
Yeah, there was no characters really.

1089
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,940
They didn't have like the Marvel.

1090
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,300
Well, they used to have the Marvel things and then the like of the Shrek.

1091
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,140
None of that.

1092
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:25,260
The only people they had walking around was Frankenstein, Dracula, Charlie Chaplin.

1093
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,100
I think there might have been a Maryland, a Lucio Ball.

1094
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,660
Yeah. Yeah.

1095
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,780
And there was a chaplain who would do warm up for the stunt shows.

1096
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,460
Camille Cassoon, I think, was his name, and he was like the lifetime

1097
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,340
chaplain impersonator. Wow.

1098
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,340
Yeah. Down in like especially the Western stunt show.

1099
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,540
God, there's also the Conan one.

1100
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,660
Yeah. At one time, there was five shows and the tram tour.

1101
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,700
And that's what you could go see at Universal.

1102
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,660
Oh, yeah. Oh, wait, let me see if I can name them.

1103
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,020
Yeah. Because it was the Wild West stunt show, the Conan stunt show,

1104
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,140
the animal actor stage, the special effects show, I think.

1105
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,100
Yeah. Yeah. Like when I remember it is like it was heavily based on like

1106
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,900
an airplane tragedy crash movie.

1107
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,420
Cool. And they would use people in the audience

1108
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,380
and then you could buy a videotape of it afterwards.

1109
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,740
Like you had to jump into water at one point. Yeah. Oh, wow. And then.

1110
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,820
Well, Miami Vice.

1111
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,100
Oh, yeah. Miami Vice.

1112
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,460
Yeah. Our A team. OK, yeah.

1113
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,100
So also we covered it recently.

1114
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,820
There's another thing where you could buy a video.

1115
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,380
Oh, yeah. And it didn't take it home.

1116
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,820
Do you recall the the Star Trek?

1117
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,940
Was it the Star Trek adventure?

1118
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,460
Was it called the Star Trek adventure?

1119
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,900
Yeah, it was like they remember that they would put you in like

1120
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,900
starfleet uniforms or a Klingon off.

1121
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,260
I forget what Starfleet is.

1122
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,420
Yeah, that does sound vaguely familiar. Yeah.

1123
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,820
And like it would be DeForest Kelly doing

1124
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,340
like they had done parts and then they would just cut it in poorly.

1125
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,100
So it's great. Yeah. Live shot on stage.

1126
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,980
But yeah, you're a Klingon.

1127
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,460
Yeah, it was all shows at a point. Yeah.

1128
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,060
No rides, no separate rides from the tram until ET.

1129
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,380
Yeah, I believe I think that was the first one.

1130
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,260
Yeah. So Miami Vice was my favorite of the three.

1131
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,460
And and don't get me wrong, I love all three.

1132
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,020
Well, a team isn't fair because I'll talk about it in a minute.

1133
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,500
But it was a weird version I saw.

1134
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,740
But Miami Vice, the set,

1135
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,260
just all the pains they took to preplace pyrotechnics,

1136
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,580
reloadable pyrotechnics, the feel of the fire,

1137
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,940
the smell of that heavily dyed water, you know.

1138
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,900
Yeah, for sure. Oh, yeah.

1139
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,860
And it gets splashed around and those bullets get shot up.

1140
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,020
Yeah. Big jets of it.

1141
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,900
And it kind of missed onto you. Yeah.

1142
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,260
Yeah. Smell of pyro, smell of water.

1143
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,740
God, I loved it. A lot of boats.

1144
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,540
There was a speedboat and multiple jet skis and a fan, but like miniature.

1145
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,220
Yes. Of all these things.

1146
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,380
Yeah, it was incredible.

1147
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,900
And I wasn't even a Miami Vice fan.

1148
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,380
Like I'd seen the show.

1149
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,260
Same thing with Waterworld. I did love A-Team, but

1150
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,260
those just something about the amazing technical achievement

1151
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,780
of those stunt shows, but also the cheesiness of the scripts

1152
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,140
and the the like you've got a shelf life once those stunts go in

1153
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,340
of about maybe three months.

1154
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,180
And then after three months, every actor is phoning it in completely.

1155
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,020
There's no energy in the punches.

1156
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,100
The delivery is like, get up there. You've got to save them.

1157
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,940
And then there's always like a stage manager and cut.

1158
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,900
This is a real Hollywood set, you know, and I just love that artifice of it.

1159
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,940
That's not in the Waterworld one. I wish there would have been.

1160
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,580
No, Waterworld kind of condenses the story into like 20 minutes.

1161
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,060
And then Miami Vice, a guy in a tucked in polo shirt comes out

1162
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,420
and it's like, I'm the director and we're going to walk you through this.

1163
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,380
And the stunt guys don't really talk besides doing bits.

1164
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:53,580
They do some. They do a lot of wacky, wacky and wholesome bits.

1165
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,420
That wasn't a thing on Miami Vice, the TV show.

1166
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,340
No, it wasn't stopped by the director.

1167
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,060
I know that that wasn't.

1168
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,020
Miami has some cool meta show.

1169
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,940
It was hard boiled.

1170
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,780
Jones does it, too.

1171
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,500
There's a stage manager that interrupts the action.

1172
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:15,860
Yeah. Yeah. And all under the guise of we're shooting a real Hollywood action film.

1173
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,500
And I just oh, God, I love that.

1174
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,860
Which is so like, why?

1175
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,540
Why would they be doing it here now with an audience

1176
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,140
with one direction that you can't see?

1177
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,900
I know. And the Indiana Jones one goes so far as to have fake cameras

1178
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,340
on Dolly tracks and a crew.

1179
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,060
Yeah. Yeah. That's the last one hanging on like that with like,

1180
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,180
you know, there's it's just them now.

1181
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,900
Like they they're the emcee.

1182
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,060
They move the action along and then the stunts happen.

1183
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,340
Yes. Waterwell.

1184
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,700
I mean, a lot of that dialogue is like queued from the booth.

1185
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,940
Yeah. And they have to hit every mark.

1186
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,140
Yeah. And then there's always the thing at the end now where they

1187
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,060
give the credits of the stunt workers.

1188
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,860
Who's like from CSI Miami.

1189
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,300
And it's just done some stunt work on there. Right.

1190
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,980
So like we do these series of stunt spectacular sketches on Super Ego.

1191
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,540
And they're all based on on just stopping the action

1192
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,740
and narrating it through the stage manager.

1193
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,180
That is just the most needless role.

1194
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,420
And there's they have that cadence to like in a Hollywood show.

1195
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,460
You've got to get ready for some action.

1196
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,940
There's danger abound.

1197
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,740
And it's just this weird cadence that must not be taught,

1198
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,060
but is somehow assumed.

1199
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,820
And I can't understand why.

1200
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,380
It's like the same thing as like modern prayer cadence of Father God,

1201
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,540
we just want to thank you.

1202
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,020
We only want to praise you.

1203
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,140
We just merely want to thank you.

1204
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,340
And it's the same vernacular.

1205
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,900
And it's like an unspoken dialect.

1206
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,260
And I'm fascinated by those like miniature subsets of society

1207
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,820
that speak in the same way, but no one ever acknowledges it.

1208
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,060
We're like one person genuinely talks that way, like 70 years ago.

1209
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,980
And everything's been an imitation of that person ever since.

1210
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,500
It exists in medical waiting room.

1211
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,020
People when they come in for Matthew.

1212
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,740
Right this way for for Jonathan or like hotel concierges, like,

1213
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,900
I'm sorry, we're fully committed.

1214
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,220
They don't say we're full, but like there's these weird

1215
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,380
vocabulary usages that just get set into it.

1216
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,820
And I know that's what you had me on here to talk about.

1217
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,300
Anthropology. Yeah.

1218
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,700
Bizarre. Seen Park talk is very fascinating.

1219
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,340
Yes. And and yeah, I think you're right that like,

1220
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,220
yes, someone early on was like, let's try it this way.

1221
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,940
And they're like, well, we did this way long enough.

1222
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,020
I guess we do the next one.

1223
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,740
Yeah, it's all come full circle.

1224
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,900
Actually, there is a reason to talk about it with with Galaxy's Edge,

1225
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,500
because they have a literal like list of things they're supposed to use,

1226
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,900
like Bright Sun's offworlder and how hello traveler or whatever.

1227
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,820
Yeah. Yeah.

1228
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:01,340
Maybe the first instance of a specific set of language and terminology.

1229
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,460
Only for the part. Yeah.

1230
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,020
They tried it a little bit with Pandora.

1231
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,020
Oh, really? But I think they gave it up very quickly.

1232
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,980
Yeah, I bet they do at this one, too.

1233
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,940
Yeah. Well, appear the first day there was already like a lady in the droid

1234
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,100
depot who was just like, all right, this is thirty dollars.

1235
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,420
Yeah. OK, here you go.

1236
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,860
She didn't say anything. Yeah.

1237
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,420
She like was like kind of trying to figure out what was even happening.

1238
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,660
I feel like so I feel like with my friend, he got the blue milk,

1239
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,940
which was the highlight of Galaxy's Edge for me.

1240
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,620
I thought it was amazing. It is good.

1241
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,620
Yeah. But they were like because I think someone in their party had

1242
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,820
dietary restrictions and so they're like, what's what's in this?

1243
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,500
Well, that's the blue milk of the bantha.

1244
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,660
Yeah. But what's in it?

1245
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,420
Well, it's the milk from the bantha.

1246
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,540
No, no, I need you to tell me or I will die.

1247
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,620
Yeah. And finally, the person because it's just rice milk with the fruit additive.

1248
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,500
I'm sorry. I don't mean to get us back off Miami Vice.

1249
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,740
They have no poisoning on this planet.

1250
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,700
Is that a thing you have?

1251
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,460
They have foaming at the mouth and you go to the hospital.

1252
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,780
We call that the Sith's revenge.

1253
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,420
Do you have the Sith's revenge?

1254
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:12,660
Come on. The middle managers all like I asked one for directions.

1255
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,260
They're like, the refreshers, the bathrooms are that way.

1256
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,060
Like they said it.

1257
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,020
And then they're just like, no, I just want you to just go.

1258
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,540
I have to go somewhere else. Yeah.

1259
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,420
The refreshers, the refreshers, the bathrooms are called.

1260
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,780
Really? Oh, my God.

1261
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,340
Oh, fuck.

1262
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:31,620
Yeah. Clearly not a fan of any of this.

1263
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,820
There's no but Batoovian magic

1264
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,500
coursing through your veins.

1265
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,300
I like that stuff when it's done tongue in cheek, but I don't know.

1266
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,660
I've said this before on a podcast or two.

1267
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,700
I don't even I don't want to get negative.

1268
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,140
Let's talk about Miami Vice.

1269
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,860
That's a show set in our world, set in the grindy world.

1270
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,980
They care of being drug smugglers.

1271
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,260
Here's the quality that you could compare.

1272
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,580
Oh, God. Have you guys watched it on YouTube or did you ever see it live?

1273
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,980
I watched it. The whole thing is available on YouTube.

1274
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,340
And this is one of my favorite

1275
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,140
things to pick up on of like when home video cameras caught on.

1276
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,700
Because that's really helpful for us doing research like, OK,

1277
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,460
I could see the whole Miami Vice show. Yeah.

1278
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,140
There is but a team little too early.

1279
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:26,180
There is 15 seconds of footage on YouTube of the show.

1280
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,900
Yeah. But there are multiple full versions of the Miami Vice one.

1281
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,860
And the footage is silent.

1282
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,700
Yeah, there's no audio.

1283
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,420
A pretty good sizzle reel. Yeah.

1284
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,940
But Miami Vice, you can see the whole thing from multiple years.

1285
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,740
I saw the 18 one in person and it was in its last days.

1286
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:50,220
And I I've told this story before, too, but it's really pertinent here.

1287
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,500
So we my dad and I went for I think I'm sure for my birthday again.

1288
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,620
And by the way, I also remember a merchandise booth outside the stunt show.

1289
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,860
And you could buy all of the 18 action figures.

1290
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,460
And they were the heads of the four 18 guys, but they had paramilitary

1291
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:13,740
primary color bodies that were pure ripoffs from first series GI Joe.

1292
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,140
Like the bodies were and they were cheaper plastic.

1293
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,060
And I bought those and you could also buy an AK 47 toy gun.

1294
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,420
That was really cool.

1295
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,980
But also, I remember in the show, they didn't have a K-47.

1296
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,900
They had M-14s with banana clips.

1297
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,700
I'm getting so nerdy here.

1298
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,580
But everybody at school was like, they got AK 47s like any gun with a banana clip.

1299
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,660
And I was, you know, junior high, Matt Gorley, like, pardon me.

1300
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,020
OK, hold on. I don't know.

1301
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,580
And so we go into the stunt show and it was like near its.

1302
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,060
It was already, I think, announced that it was closing soon.

1303
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,860
It was a rainy day and outcome

1304
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,300
B.A. Barakas and Hannibal in the 18 band.

1305
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,620
They do a little opening stunt thing.

1306
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:58,020
And so only those two characters come out.

1307
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,820
And then Hannibal excuses himself, goes back in the van,

1308
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,420
and the same guy comes out dressed as Murdoch and you never saw face.

1309
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,660
He was never in the show.

1310
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,260
What? And it was just like clearly they weren't putting money into it.

1311
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,820
They didn't want to hire all the people.

1312
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,900
People are sick or it was raining.

1313
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,460
The whole thing was so lackluster.

1314
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,300
It's like an Avengers with only Hawkeye. Yeah.

1315
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,980
And then so then when I came back to see Miami Vice, my mind was blown

1316
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,020
because it was probably newer and they were into it.

1317
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,900
And like it was a real step up.

1318
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,820
There was suddenly a lagoon and boats and explosions.

1319
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,700
And then the like helicopter comes up. It was incredible.

1320
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,900
I think there was a helicopter in the 1812

1321
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,140
because it then sold that to Magic Mountain for their Batman and Robin stunt show.

1322
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,900
I remember seeing the same helicopter.

1323
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure.

1324
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,500
I mean, that's only going off my own recognition of that.

1325
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,140
But I think you can take that to the back.

1326
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,780
I think you're right. I wouldn't dare.

1327
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,460
That's fact. Well, that is a fact.

1328
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:57,940
The Batman and Robin stunt shows at Six Flags would do for like three weeks a year.

1329
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,060
And then it would be like, oh, it's closed. Sorry.

1330
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,900
Yeah. It was a busy period.

1331
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,060
It was just done on the street.

1332
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:08,260
There was no real set except the helicopter was above a facade.

1333
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,180
So that would come up.

1334
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,340
But like the rest of it was just kind of like gymnasts on mats dancing.

1335
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,660
We're not dancing, fighting.

1336
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,580
And that's the other thing.

1337
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:20,460
They never they never seem to regiment stuff at Six Flags

1338
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,140
because I saw Batman's stunt show.

1339
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,780
And I think we talked about this on like the second or third episode.

1340
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,460
But that was in a whole amphitheater.

1341
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,060
What? Whoa. And then there was another there's another one

1342
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,060
where it's like the Batman stunt show was on the body of water.

1343
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,060
Yeah, there was a water show.

1344
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,300
And it looked like it just opened up into a swamp.

1345
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,660
Yeah. Like it just looked like there was a big body of water and there were boats.

1346
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,220
But there was no like like backing or anything.

1347
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,420
That's where the woods was behind it.

1348
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,060
Great Adventure in New Jersey had the lethal weapons

1349
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,660
stunt show, which was where that's where I got the bullet.

1350
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,060
Like at the end, they're like giving away the blank, the casings to kids.

1351
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,780
Like they were giving them out.

1352
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:06,660
Wait, was there a stage manager in that one, like a cut guy who would yell cut?

1353
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:12,140
I know. I think that one was more like water was more like story based.

1354
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,820
It was. It didn't break the fourth wall.

1355
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,260
These guys. Yeah, I like my realistic.

1356
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,460
It definitely was a lot of drug dealers getting shot.

1357
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,580
Like it was like a Miami Vice one.

1358
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,420
Like, well, this would never fly nowadays.

1359
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,700
I guess there's some gunplay in water world.

1360
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,660
But before like the Internet knew so much about people

1361
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,220
thought they knew so much about movies and announcements or movies.

1362
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,460
Were there people that probably went and were like, wow, they're shooting a movie today.

1363
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,140
I bet. Probably. Right.

1364
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:39,540
Some like, you know, international travelers of like, this is a big deal.

1365
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,020
Yeah, they must really be shooting.

1366
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,260
I feel like you were like, hey, honey, what happened?

1367
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,580
We saw that Indiana Jones movie shooting two years ago.

1368
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,100
That would come out. I think we're in it.

1369
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,980
I think, yeah. Like remember the guy next to us, he went down and he did a stunt.

1370
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,060
Like, when did that movie come out?

1371
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,460
My favorite thing was that you would see these stunts shows pop up on other TV shows quite a bit.

1372
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,380
So like if there was especially like a kind of low budget,

1373
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:06,780
syndicated show that shot on the universe a lot, they invariably did an episode

1374
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,180
where one of the characters would end up on the Miami Vice stunt show set, like

1375
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,340
out of this world. Do you remember that show?

1376
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,140
Oh, yeah. She one time was on that set.

1377
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,740
There was another one where they end up on it and they would just be like cheap

1378
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,620
sets and they would like use some of the pyrotechnics.

1379
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,700
If you're shooting on that lot, you'll find a way to use Flash Flood.

1380
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,700
Yes. You'll find a way to use even like something from a movie.

1381
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,900
Like I want to say Knight Rider went to the Psycho House twice.

1382
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,820
I'm sure. I'm sure.

1383
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,340
At least once. But there is a picture.

1384
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:40,540
There is an 18 episode where a fish man

1385
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:45,020
gets on the trolley that used to be up by where Seawalk is now.

1386
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,580
A guy in a fish costume.

1387
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,220
Like clearly like that sort of thing.

1388
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,900
Was it Hannibal in disguise?

1389
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
I couldn't. I just saw still pictures.

1390
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,180
It might have been one of them in disguise, but you can see Womp

1391
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:59,700
Hoppers in the background, the the long gone restaurant Womp

1392
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,620
Hoppers we talked about before.

1393
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,140
The two letters P something L Womp Hoppers.

1394
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:09,460
What used to be Sagebrush Cantina, the second Sagebrush mentioned today.

1395
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,020
There was this weird, like old timey restaurant called Womp Hoppers.

1396
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,620
There was a restaurant themed after a it was supposed to be a wagon

1397
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,380
wheel factory and a guy walked around.

1398
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:24,540
It was very much like a dream finder and literally played by the same guy

1399
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,780
who played Dream Finder, a guy in a beard like I'm H.L. Womp Hopper.

1400
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:31,620
Was that so that wasn't in the park that was outside the park?

1401
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,900
It was right outside the park.

1402
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,980
The picture of it somewhere online.

1403
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,940
We'll pull it up.

1404
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,780
It was right where Saddle Ranch was, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1405
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,700
It was like a big, honestly, a building I was thinking not.

1406
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,500
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1407
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,260
From the Miami Vice set.

1408
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,340
But it looks like it's rusted out warehouse kind of early, you know,

1409
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,900
like tin roofs and kind of collapse and sort of vibe.

1410
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,300
C.L. Womp Hoppers.

1411
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,180
Yeah, there you go.

1412
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:59,180
Wow. And we'd like to get the rights to that character so we can do things.

1413
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,100
We can make a movie.

1414
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,860
We're trying to collect all the unused IP.

1415
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:06,380
It isn't like nobody's doing anything with.

1416
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,980
How many rights can we hold at the end of this park?

1417
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,700
Yes, I hope we have yet to get one, though.

1418
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,060
So no, no, no. Or look into how to do it.

1419
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:17,540
Yeah. Well, I asked a friend once casually and he said, I don't know.

1420
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,100
So that's a very thrilling conclusion.

1421
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,220
Old friend.

1422
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,140
Well, he knows things.

1423
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,340
You know, he's into like looking up things.

1424
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,340
So that's as far as I went.

1425
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,780
That's as close to a lawyer.

1426
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,220
I asked about there's a character named Marvel McFay,

1427
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:36,300
who was a Six Flags character and he was also an old tiny beard.

1428
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,980
Like a Sherman.

1429
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,220
We love old timey beard cartoon character men in top hats.

1430
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,660
All three of these things we would describe.

1431
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:47,220
Dream Finder, Wampumper and and I said, hey, where do you think?

1432
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,340
You think where would like where would we even go about this?

1433
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,860
And he goes, that's probably like in the Warner Brothers vault.

1434
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:56,660
Probably you'd have to like find a lawyer to find it in Warner Brothers.

1435
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,340
Oh, my God. Because like they bought.

1436
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,860
Well, they know they owned it already when it was Marvel and Fay,

1437
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,260
but then they just got rid of him and then they just made it a Six Flags.

1438
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,980
Like a standard. Wow.

1439
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,980
That was Astroworld.

1440
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,500
And so we got to break in in an Ethan Hunt.

1441
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:11,460
We have to get it.

1442
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,580
It's like the Indiana Jones warehouse where the Ark of Covenant is.

1443
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:15,820
There's like all of these.

1444
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:19,020
There's like shells of like cartoon characters, comma racist,

1445
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,980
cartoon characters, comma not racist.

1446
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,340
I'd like to be in on this. Yeah.

1447
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:26,140
Join the heist. Please.

1448
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,260
Large bearded fantastical cartoon men.

1449
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,500
Yeah. And we'll only get chased out of this warehouse if we enter,

1450
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,300
not because they're hiding secrets,

1451
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,780
but because if we start poking around, they have to do work.

1452
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,380
Yes, right.

1453
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,580
I'm going to take the crew.

1454
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,500
We're going to take the crane.

1455
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,940
I got to put the gloves on if you have to.

1456
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,380
Oh, God, I saw something on YouTube.

1457
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:50,780
I was watching like a Disney history thing, and they had like the original print

1458
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:55,260
of the illustration of the Disneyland Park and a woman at the archive.

1459
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,580
This thing was handling it for him and she had white gloves on.

1460
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:01,060
But they had those three dashes like Mickey Mouse has.

1461
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,620
And I was just fuck off. Are you kidding?

1462
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,220
You have to theme your fancy archivist gloves.

1463
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,340
I might have been for the camera.

1464
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:12,140
I don't care. It's too much.

1465
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,380
If you're a Disney archivist, you're probably gung ho on that.

1466
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,380
I know I have a complicated relationship with Disney.

1467
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,180
How did it change working there versus?

1468
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,100
I never had a reverence for Disney.

1469
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,980
I loved going to Disneyland, but we're similar.

1470
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,100
It's not like we're so we don't love.

1471
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:35,940
But like, oh, you guys want to watch So Dear to My Heart, the 40s lamb movie.

1472
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,060
We know like we like the rise and stuff.

1473
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,220
Maybe the deepest reference I could have pulled.

1474
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,100
It's some weird old live action.

1475
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,220
It's like a family raising a lamb or something.

1476
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:48,420
That's not Lambert, the sheepish lion.

1477
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,300
No, because that's a cartoon.

1478
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,460
Yeah. I think So Dear to My Heart is a boring old.

1479
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,140
I've never seen So Dear to My Heart.

1480
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,860
Wow. I don't know where I've never heard of.

1481
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,620
That's a good quote, though. Yeah.

1482
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,260
As long as it exists.

1483
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,460
Let me look that up.

1484
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,340
If it's not real, it wasn't a good pull.

1485
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,540
And if so, I had a really specific dream.

1486
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,180
Oh, here we go. It's from 1948.

1487
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,900
The war combines animation and live action.

1488
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,060
And it looks incredibly boring.

1489
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,100
The war has been won.

1490
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,780
A generation comes home to the homeland,

1491
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,660
and this is what they're rewarded with for entertainment.

1492
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,820
Family raises a lamb.

1493
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,060
Now relax and watch.

1494
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,540
Now relax. Yeah.

1495
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:31,380
Jeremiah names do not address your PTSD.

1496
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,020
Watch the lamb.

1497
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,460
Watch the lives as Uncle Hiram.

1498
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,580
Oh, no, I mean, I mean, I know.

1499
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,900
I didn't realize fans.

1500
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,540
OK, so let me alter my previous statement.

1501
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,820
We didn't care about the movies until we found out about So Dear to My Heart.

1502
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,580
Yeah. You were you were a right person more than a Disney historian.

1503
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,820
Yeah. Yeah.

1504
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,620
And like I said, I think I was more into

1505
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,420
Universal.

1506
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,700
And then when I was a teenager, Magic Mountain was the place to be

1507
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,780
because it was hip.

1508
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,260
And I'd gone to Knott's a ton because I lived pretty close to Knott's,

1509
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,380
like 10, 15 minutes away from Whittier.

1510
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:09,860
Yeah. It's neighbors to Buena Park, basically.

1511
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,100
Do you still go? We love talking of Knott's as much as I haven't been in a while.

1512
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,060
I would love to go to Knott's again and not for I don't want to go.

1513
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,140
I don't want anything to do with the Halloween horror.

1514
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,820
And I know. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

1515
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,020
All right. I like that.

1516
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:25,620
This guy defected and started liking haunts.

1517
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:29,020
We went we went for the their their what's it called?

1518
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,540
Not scary farm. Yeah.

1519
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,420
And I got it. I'm into the mazes now.

1520
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,420
But we were all scared when we started this podcast.

1521
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:37,980
Yeah. I'm an excitable person and it scares me.

1522
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,820
But my friend Jeremy works at Knott's from Super Ego.

1523
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,500
He currently does. He does that Ghost Town alive thing.

1524
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:46,260
And then he does the Hanging show and all that.

1525
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,580
Oh, it's part of the hang. Yeah.

1526
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,340
And my friend Ken, I believe I can't remember if he's still

1527
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,140
directing and writing those.

1528
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,740
I'm telling you, I'm your connection.

1529
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:59,260
My ex-girlfriend was in the Waterworld stunt show.

1530
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,300
Wow. Helen.

1531
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,940
She was a Helen. Yeah.

1532
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,300
Wow. Yeah.

1533
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:08,180
Do we interact? We talk to Ghost Town alive people.

1534
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,060
We met a deputy mayor.

1535
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,540
We went to the opening of the new the reskinned rapid drive.

1536
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,260
Oh, my God. Oh, it's been reskinned.

1537
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:19,540
They they rethemed and they like incorporated into the Calico ghost town.

1538
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,740
OK, that's not so terribly nice.

1539
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:25,420
You got a crazy old lunatic on a porch with a musket.

1540
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,860
Is that animatronic? Yeah.

1541
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,980
Like not crazy. It just rocks back and forth.

1542
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,780
But you get a little bit of movement.

1543
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:34,420
You go to go check out all those robot rides,

1544
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:37,300
whether or not you do coasters, do that if you want or not.

1545
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,060
But we're just all about these charming robots

1546
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:44,020
and that Knott's Chicken Dinner restaurant, which they like hippified a little.

1547
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,980
And now it's like a little bit more like a gastropub or something.

1548
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,340
Should we just go straight there after this?

1549
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,860
Oh, my God. That boysenberry juice, too.

1550
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,020
Yeah. Yeah.

1551
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,180
For one very year.

1552
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,980
They got all the boysenberry beer.

1553
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,660
Yeah. Well, they have a whole boysenberry festival.

1554
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,740
That's right. In March.

1555
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,540
My dad went to high school with the Knott's, the Knott brothers.

1556
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:07,340
Also, he worked as an ice cream scooper at Disneyland early on and met Walt Disney.

1557
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:10,740
He was backstage and he and his Walt Disney, his wife came by

1558
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:12,820
and were like, how they treating you here?

1559
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:15,140
Why? Wow. Oh, crazy.

1560
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:15,940
I don't think so.

1561
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:20,020
I think Tony Baxter only met Walt once as a or did not meet Walt as a.

1562
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,340
I don't remember.

1563
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,260
I'm a second generation Disney employee.

1564
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,340
I just realized that.

1565
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,460
That is your grand.

1566
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,620
Your granddaughter better go to work there.

1567
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,900
You will work at Disney.

1568
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,060
You will. You will do the family line.

1569
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:33,300
You've a lady. It's the G-pop.

1570
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,820
You know what? I we talked to we were talking about knots about this new,

1571
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,900
you know, they did a lot of work on that rapids ride.

1572
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,260
And I think I forgot to bring up a fact I had found out about knots.

1573
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:48,020
Buena Park, in terms of an entity as like a town or a city,

1574
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,260
has only existed for like a couple of decades before that.

1575
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,020
It was kind of an unincorporated area.

1576
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:59,180
And as such, the knots security team was deputized

1577
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:04,140
like to assist with the was was deputized,

1578
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,860
was sis the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

1579
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,620
That makes sense.

1580
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:11,060
I also have a friend who was a dispatcher at knots for security.

1581
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,900
Yeah. So they would talk about that sometimes get

1582
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,860
dispatched to help with situations and stuff.

1583
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:21,020
And the head of the security for a long time was a knot, was a knot.

1584
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,500
A knot. So I thought you were going to say something else.

1585
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,020
Yeah. Keep that word going.

1586
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,180
It was a knot.

1587
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,260
Yeah, not.

1588
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,260
That's true.

1589
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,020
Is it myth or true that no one can be pronounced dead on Disney grounds?

1590
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:38,900
And so if someone dies, which they have, I think that's kind of urban.

1591
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:41,460
There's no record saying much. Yeah.

1592
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,780
But as soon as their soul leaves their body, that's technically not.

1593
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,580
Then it's a fairy land and it goes right to the haunted mansion.

1594
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,460
You're happy.

1595
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,100
Now, if you die on Disney grounds, they give you the option of

1596
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,420
when do you like to go to work as a grim grinning ghost?

1597
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,700
How's your baritone?

1598
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,340
Yeah, we don't say they passed away.

1599
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:06,060
We say they're now a happy haunt.

1600
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,740
Gone to a happier hauntier place.

1601
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,380
Oh, I.

1602
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:11,820
I OK.

1603
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,940
So does that mean that technically like a ghost town sheriff could?

1604
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,340
That's what my question was going to be.

1605
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,980
Arrest somebody. Oh, too.

1606
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,620
Yeah. And as a ghost town like bandit, breaking the law.

1607
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,820
Mm hmm. The knot stunt show.

1608
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:29,300
Oh, God. That was one that didn't change for years and years.

1609
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,620
It's different now. But I had that thing memorized.

1610
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,700
I loved that thing so much.

1611
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:34,700
Is it a Western one? Yeah.

1612
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,100
I wanted to be in it so bad.

1613
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,980
And I went and tried out when I was in college.

1614
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,420
I was I was a really little guy in high school

1615
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,940
and really wiry thin in college.

1616
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:46,220
And it was just like no way I could pass for a man.

1617
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:50,340
And I even wore like a plaid vest to kind of like butch myself up.

1618
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,020
But that doesn't do that.

1619
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,940
And I think I generally got laughed out of there.

1620
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:58,300
They didn't have like a nerd or a dorky barber who they could pull

1621
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,620
his pants down or something.

1622
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,820
Oh, they had an audience plant in Hawaiian shirt.

1623
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:03,980
But even that guy was like a bearded.

1624
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,820
They were all men.

1625
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:09,660
Like they were like the Beaumont Bear was like a big Hollywood stunt man

1626
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:12,020
that came down to the Berry Pick and Knots Berry Farm.

1627
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:15,060
And like the main guy was like a real fancy dude.

1628
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:18,380
And the Beaumont Bear was a Hollywood stunt man who would come bully him around.

1629
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,220
And then there was just those two guys in the audience plant

1630
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,420
who would like come on stage in a Hawaiian shirt.

1631
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:27,100
And the main dude was like, I'm going to throw a Hollywood punch to you.

1632
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,940
He's like, hold on. I just had a taco.

1633
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:33,540
You know, and you think he's really a plant because he's also got a wife

1634
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,860
he's sitting with.

1635
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,940
And then he's the one that ends up getting shot and doing a high fall at the end.

1636
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,340
And you're like, whoa, that's great.

1637
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:44,460
I miss that one, because now it's kind of like there's like a big Gatling gun.

1638
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,700
And it's just like trying to be a little bit more blockbuster like Waterworld.

1639
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,700
But it's somewhere in the middle and it doesn't work.

1640
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:54,740
There was something really quaint about just the three person stunt man.

1641
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:58,860
Yeah, we saw one a couple of years ago, which I think is the bigger scope.

1642
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,180
Probably one, I think so.

1643
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:03,020
Knots is getting back, I think, to the charm, though, with the ghost.

1644
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,580
I got to get out to that.

1645
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,900
It's slowly like trying to charmify the park again.

1646
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,820
I thought I think is my friend Ken, who went to work there, Ken Parks,

1647
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,060
who used to work at Disney and is responsible for a lot of that stuff

1648
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,620
because he's great.

1649
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,900
And he brought, I think, some of that Disney style stuff over.

1650
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1651
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,860
Geez. Well, yeah, mission accomplished.

1652
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,380
It is. It just get more and more charming by the year.

1653
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,060
That's what we want. Charm. Yeah. Same. Same here.

1654
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,100
We love charm. Charm.

1655
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,260
Chicken and charm. Tear down the coasters.

1656
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,220
Yeah. Bring up the charm.

1657
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,740
That's the main thing that this stunt show happened under the shadow

1658
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,220
of a roller coaster that just every 10 seconds. Right.

1659
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,260
Yeah. So that was that was not the case originally,

1660
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,180
because that's one of the fairly newer ones.

1661
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,900
I see. Yeah. Right. Right.

1662
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,260
Oh, I miss that stunt show.

1663
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:54,780
Oh, geez. My advice, though, I, you know, well, you know,

1664
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:58,500
you were also talking about you were talking about the set being cool.

1665
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,420
I want to give a little shout out to the I think.

1666
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:03,620
I think this I think the main thing was landscaped beautifully.

1667
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,740
So beautiful. Yes. Yeah.

1668
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,420
Lush vegetation looks like you're in the

1669
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:11,660
because you're supposed to be you're on some sort of like all drug smuggling island.

1670
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,380
Yeah. But do they ever mention drugs?

1671
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,700
You know what? I saw like copy in.

1672
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:20,620
Oh, wait, hang on. Smugglers and arms traders. Yeah.

1673
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,500
So smugglers could be it could be like rare exotic bananas.

1674
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,500
It could be just definitely that. Yeah.

1675
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,180
Yeah. I have the phrase, he says Caribbean crime boss

1676
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,500
and his gang of sleazy smugglers.

1677
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,460
I saw that. And action.

1678
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,540
So they're smuggling like gold teeth.

1679
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,340
Also, the sound systems on these things were amazing, too,

1680
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:45,060
because we can the music blares when they start and you get that like,

1681
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,020
what are they called? Timmons drums.

1682
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,220
I always get it wrong. Simmons or Timmons drums with those like,

1683
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:51,780
oh, yeah. Yeah.

1684
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,660
And those in the arena.

1685
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:56,180
Oh, God. He's sort of like tinny speak.

1686
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:56,860
It's like music.

1687
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:00,780
The Miami Vice theme is perfectly suited to be played on those kind of like.

1688
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,580
Yeah. Like not great car speak.

1689
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,260
It's cassette rock. Yeah. I think.

1690
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,860
And if I remember correctly, like Waterworld, they do use blanks in.

1691
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,180
They do use blanks. Yeah.

1692
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:13,540
In Miami Vice, it was sound effects and they had dummy guns.

1693
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,420
And they were doing the like recoil because I remember like there's a

1694
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,540
Crockett and Tubbs, especially maybe one or two of the goons

1695
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,260
have blanks at some point. Yeah.

1696
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,500
Crockett and Tubbs have like the same guns.

1697
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,100
They just keep tossing. Yeah.

1698
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,940
The whole time. And the sound doesn't know.

1699
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,140
It's not always 100 percent.

1700
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,580
It's either dead on or it's a little off.

1701
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,940
And the best part, again, is like you get into the zone

1702
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:35,860
where they're phoning it in.

1703
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,700
So even the recoil of the gun is just this like lackluster.

1704
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:43,260
You know, there was a thing where they pull back, shoot one guy with a shotgun

1705
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:47,300
and he's hooked up to an elastic cord and he gets like drawn back

1706
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,900
through these main two doors.

1707
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,700
And it's so slow and elastic.

1708
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,460
But it's so funny, like you shoot someone with a shotgun

1709
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,780
and then they fly back at like a medium pace through the air.

1710
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:02,300
It's so strange. And I just I just love the artificialness of it.

1711
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,260
I don't know what it was.

1712
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:07,060
How could you possibly go through those motions and not just get limper

1713
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,420
and limper? I don't know.

1714
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,620
As time goes on.

1715
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,780
I mean, I have that question about any.

1716
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,100
I've never been in a play or anything that ran for a long time. Yeah.

1717
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,620
I've done any performance more than once ever.

1718
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:20,420
So I don't know how anybody like gives it their all.

1719
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:23,660
Like, yeah, I imagine like doing Shakespeare 300 nights in a row.

1720
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:27,700
But I still want my theme park employees to, you know, give it all you got. Yeah.

1721
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:30,820
There's some like like

1722
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,820
Crockett does a flip at some someone does a flip.

1723
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,460
Someone kicks someone else in the face.

1724
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,740
Those are those seem like they're the fun ones to do because they they give it.

1725
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:42,140
They're all. Yeah, they have to to literally like get over to flip.

1726
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,780
And also not land on their head.

1727
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,060
But the faces are still dead.

1728
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,700
That's the crazy thing. They're doing all this stuff and their faces are dead.

1729
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,500
I will say this, and I worked at Disneyland for

1730
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,060
10, 12 years. I don't know.

1731
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,900
I never found it in that improv stuff.

1732
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:00,300
Even so, Papa Beast, or like I would give it my all because I think I was.

1733
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,260
I think it just came from doing theater in college.

1734
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:06,420
They're like, it's embarrassing if you're not convincing, you know.

1735
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,820
Yeah. Yeah. Stunt man.

1736
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,060
You're not really trained in acting.

1737
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:14,020
And so I and I guess there would be a drudgery to it, though.

1738
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,860
At the same time, I've heard the other complaint about stuntmen

1739
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:21,260
that they go so like I've heard people who have to say like,

1740
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,780
he does not be like what would a real person do?

1741
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:27,620
Not just like huge swing back and like, oh, right.

1742
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,980
Like like hammy deaths can be.

1743
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,420
I think maybe some men have a hard time like finding that.

1744
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,740
Yeah. That middle. Yeah.

1745
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:38,740
I went I remember taking a whole roll of film once of like, you know,

1746
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:42,700
Kodak film, just shooting pictures of the stunt show.

1747
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:47,700
And then I went home and tried to build a G.I. Joe stunt show.

1748
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:51,500
So I would like I had like as a young age, pretty much learned

1749
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,340
how to do like blood pack squibs.

1750
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,740
And so I'd set up these little model rocket igniters to batteries and put little

1751
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,540
I would drain Piccolo Pete powder out of Piccolo Pete's,

1752
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:04,020
put him in these like toothpaste caps and made this little diorama.

1753
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,060
And then I'd made like a little brass tube that I had my neighbor drill with like

1754
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:14,060
some holes that got smaller and hooked a little rubber tube up to like a big

1755
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:17,660
lighter and hid that so there could be like a line of flames that would come up

1756
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:18,380
and then hit the button.

1757
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,260
And they're like a little explosion.

1758
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,060
And I made little mattresses for my G.I. Joe.

1759
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,940
Whoa. Let them fall safely.

1760
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1761
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:31,220
And it was just like I wanted to play the stunt show, not the real,

1762
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,780
not the reality. Yeah.

1763
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,260
You're speaking our language.

1764
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:38,180
Oh, boy. And not even like I'm going to fuck up my toys and throw them hard at the ground.

1765
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,980
Like what they got to be because they got to do the show.

1766
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,660
Yeah. Yeah. They got to they got to redo it.

1767
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,740
And I'd have to clean the like white powder burns off them each time.

1768
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:48,380
But even so, on the set, I liked the powder burns because the Miami Vice thing

1769
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,860
was covered in white powder burns, you know.

1770
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:55,100
Oh, yeah. They reuse like any like time like there was a bullet hit on the walls.

1771
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,420
It was just like a little plug cap they put in there.

1772
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:00,900
And so I would sit there in the beginning of the show and go like,

1773
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,100
oh, that's a bullet hit.

1774
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,820
That's a bullet hit because it was just stained white from all the powder.

1775
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,340
You know. Oh, yeah.

1776
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:10,580
Which causes this set that's supposed to be rustic to begin with.

1777
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:16,260
Yeah. Age up as it goes, bearing the scars of its many performances.

1778
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:17,260
Yeah. Pretty cool.

1779
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:20,380
Would you watch movies as a kid and be like just kind of fascinated

1780
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,660
by the process more than the movie itself? Yeah.

1781
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:26,060
And any time I could take a peek behind the curtain, like in Die Hard,

1782
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:29,220
when they go up to the roof and the helicopters coming and John McClain

1783
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:32,700
shoots his gun up in the air to get the people to go back downstairs

1784
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,740
and then the helicopters shoot the roof.

1785
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:38,260
There's two shots where you can see the whole web of wires

1786
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,580
for the squibs on the ground, like they didn't even bother to hide them.

1787
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,900
They're just laid out.

1788
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,140
Well, bare wires with little squibs.

1789
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,460
I'm trying to remember. Oh, in Platoon, when

1790
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:51,140
Willem Dafoe's character is running out in that huge moment,

1791
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,660
he's wired with tons of squibs, but they didn't work.

1792
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:57,380
And there are so many it was such a major shot with so many cameras,

1793
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,700
helicopters and explosions that they kept going.

1794
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,860
And there's a couple of shots where you can see him pressing the button

1795
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:04,220
in his hand. Nothing's happening.

1796
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,220
And then he lets go.

1797
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:09,340
And then later the wires just dangling from his hand and like wide open

1798
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,740
shots. He's just you just a wire hanging from his hand.

1799
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:14,140
And did you notice that as a kid? Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

1800
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,420
Yeah. So you were really just paying attention to that.

1801
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:19,780
You're so into squibs. Well, I had this podcast called I Was There Too.

1802
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,980
And I would always ask these guests, have you ever been squibbed?

1803
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,940
And then on the 50th episode, I had asked so much that this special effects

1804
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:28,340
house reached out to me and I was going to be in New York for Super Ego.

1805
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,260
And we did a whole documentary on me getting squibbed.

1806
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,660
It's called The Squibbening.

1807
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:35,180
And I finally got to realize my dream.

1808
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:37,340
We did one individual squib.

1809
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,380
And then we did a shot of four machine gun squibs on me.

1810
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:43,900
And it was so fun. Wow. How did it look?

1811
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,780
It looked great. Yeah.

1812
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,660
I mean, you can just Google the squibbening and it's a documentary online.

1813
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:51,380
You can watch it. Were you happy with your your own performance?

1814
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,140
Do you think you rode the stunt man line?

1815
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,340
I don't think I did it well because I was too well.

1816
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:00,540
A, it was too new an experience and B, I was too relishing the moment to act.

1817
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,660
Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1818
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:05,220
You can't compare. You can't tame that smile down.

1819
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,860
No, I couldn't. I couldn't. I was too happy to get shot.

1820
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:10,380
Well, well, are there moments like that?

1821
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,700
Because you're a big James Bond guy. Yeah. Right.

1822
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:15,260
You have a James Bond podcast as well. That's right. Yeah.

1823
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,900
Are there any moments you ever caught like in the classic Bond movies?

1824
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,140
Like, well, there's I can see that.

1825
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:25,380
Oh, good question. I'm sure there is.

1826
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:28,460
Let me think, especially around those 80s ones.

1827
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,780
You also design.

1828
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:33,820
Did you design a hypothetical James Bond park or stunt show?

1829
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,220
I did. OK, so, yeah, this is slightly embarrassing.

1830
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,860
I did three.

1831
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:43,620
I've done three prints of James Bond theme park stunt spectaculars.

1832
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:48,740
So I did the Thunderball Aquatic Extravaganza, which is like in a big tank.

1833
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:53,380
And then I did Live and Let Die Stunt Spectacular and

1834
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,500
Honor Majesty Secret Service.

1835
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:59,660
And they all take place at fictional like Six Flags over Squaw Valley

1836
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:03,300
Snow Resort, Six Flags over over

1837
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,420
Baton Rouge.

1838
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,020
And then there was one in Florida.

1839
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:12,180
And if you go to MacWheely.com, you can see those or purchase them.

1840
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:13,500
Like, yeah.

1841
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,380
And I'm thinking about doing some other movies, you know, like

1842
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:20,980
like Friday the 13th or, you know, like stunt spectaculars or something.

1843
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,780
And wow. Wow. And what is that art?

1844
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,300
What's what's in? How do you convey what?

1845
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,820
I treated it like a poster from the time.

1846
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:32,420
So it's not like a drawing of what it would actually look like.

1847
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:35,700
But I remember the like newspaper ads for Miami Vice.

1848
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,460
And so you would see the elements of the actual set as they were.

1849
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:42,060
But it was still movie posterized where everything's kind of coming at you.

1850
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:46,220
And it was like kind of fictional looking and explosions.

1851
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,340
Like it's it's not meant to be linear.

1852
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:52,220
So it incorporates all the elements of the movie that would be in that stunt show.

1853
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,620
Yeah. Yeah. That's a great idea.

1854
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:59,500
Wow. Wow. So like there's sharks in the in the Thunderball one and a jet pack.

1855
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,780
And, you know, and then they're like this

1856
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:07,300
honor majesty secret service one has like a bobsled track and because also.

1857
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,420
Oh, sure. Did you all of you guys ever covered this?

1858
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:14,100
You probably know about this at Six Flags Magic Mountain in 1984

1859
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:17,020
when the Olympics were big and not the Los Angeles Olympics,

1860
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,380
but the Sarajevo, Yugoslavia Olympics.

1861
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:23,100
There was a ride called Sarajevo bobsleds at Magic Mountain.

1862
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,340
No never come across this.

1863
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,580
Based on the Olympics. Oh, my God.

1864
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,660
It's funny you say that because I was at

1865
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:37,300
Busch Gardens Williamsburg during the 96 94, which was the 90s Olympics.

1866
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,540
They was 96.

1867
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:43,220
And then Izzy, you remember Izzy, the little mascot.

1868
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:48,260
They had built a small wildcat roller coaster that was themed to Izzy.

1869
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,020
Really? So is he coaster?

1870
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:54,340
Yeah. Magic Mountain was big on just buying prefab

1871
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,740
roller coasters and loosely theming them. Yeah.

1872
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,420
But I believe they shut the bobsleds one down because it was dangerous

1873
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:05,060
because it was loose bobsleds in a like regular bobsled with wheels instead of

1874
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,260
blades blades. Yeah.

1875
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:10,060
And it was just in a U shaped like a water slide track.

1876
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,580
Whoa. Yeah. Which is the kind of ride that feels very action point,

1877
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,820
like the kind of thing where they would totally fuck you up

1878
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:18,020
and skin your knees if you fell off it.

1879
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,220
Yeah. Yeah. Jeez, that's a dangerous thing.

1880
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:27,180
You know, the Miami Vice Stunt Show was written and put together by

1881
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:31,540
the guy Phil Hedema, who's come up on the show before part of the Star Trek thing

1882
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,340
we talked about a little while back.

1883
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:37,340
But he got into theme park world after having designed the opening

1884
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:42,860
and closing ceremony of the 84 L.A. Olympics, which is totally insane

1885
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:47,020
where a UFO lands and a spaceman comes out and like, you know, he

1886
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,020
essentially it's not this.

1887
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:53,180
It's some message about like why I've seen you humans now, like your finest

1888
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:54,900
and your most harmony.

1889
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,820
And does that imply that he was like going to kill us?

1890
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,900
Right. And the Olympics convinced him not to.

1891
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:03,540
I did not remember that until you said that stuff, because I went to some of the

1892
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,340
84 Olympics as a kid. Oh, really?

1893
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,100
I didn't go to the opening ceremonies, but now I want to rewatch that.

1894
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,420
That sounds nuts.

1895
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:11,060
I only barely did it out the door.

1896
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,500
I got to sit and watch the whole thing.

1897
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,340
But also Lionel Richie killer all night long performance.

1898
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:19,340
80 for those. Those are.

1899
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,740
Yeah, I come in for solid. Yeah.

1900
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:24,100
Yes. Will it be as fun this time?

1901
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,460
It's like the destroy the city.

1902
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,500
Well, it may be. Yeah.

1903
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,860
No longer possible.

1904
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:32,740
Yeah, that feels like that Super Bowl halftime show before they would just get

1905
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,980
like an old rock act. Yeah. Yeah.

1906
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,140
Yeah. Yeah. When they when they had skits.

1907
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:40,220
I want skits in my sports entertainment.

1908
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,300
Start doing stunt shows at halftime, because actually, that's a lot more

1909
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:47,020
football based than, you know, putting like Justin Timberlake in.

1910
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,100
Like, imagine you do it.

1911
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,260
Action stunt spectacular at the halftime.

1912
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,100
Do you know about? Yeah.

1913
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,340
We all we're all challenged to tell you.

1914
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:55,860
We can't wait to tell you.

1915
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,060
Sorry, I got to go.

1916
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,380
No, please. All right. I'll write you a letter about it.

1917
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:04,060
There was a there was an Indiana Jones halftime show promoting

1918
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,260
the Indiana Jones adventure opening at Disneyland.

1919
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:10,980
And it was so the star of the stunt show is just a man you've never seen before

1920
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,740
as Indiana Jones.

1921
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:17,780
And it is it's stunts, it's passing of the Super Bowl trophy back and forth

1922
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:23,340
like Marion, it's Marion to amazing in between performances from

1923
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:26,100
Tony Bennett, Tony Bennett.

1924
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,660
Tony Bennett sings Can You Feel the Love Tonight?

1925
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:31,780
I believe the Lion King song and Patti LaBelle.

1926
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,820
Yeah, I think that's right.

1927
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:35,860
Yeah. Yeah. With a big shock and hair.

1928
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:38,220
Capsa in there singing Anything Goes.

1929
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:38,900
Oh, yeah.

1930
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,980
That's what it's kind of that vibe.

1931
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:44,660
It's a little bit of like the 40s cabaret club or whatever.

1932
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:45,460
I got to check that out.

1933
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:47,660
Indiana Jones falls from the sky.

1934
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,220
He skydives into the arena.

1935
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,700
Yeah, I got to see that.

1936
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,220
Oh, it's it's so nuts.

1937
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:56,820
And I think and that like I think it was for everything you read about it.

1938
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:59,140
It was a disaster. It like barely came together.

1939
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:01,500
And I think people did maybe get hurt.

1940
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,780
So there was some weird thing where like, or at least during the one run

1941
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,860
through, they had the Patti LaBelle's high heel got caught in a grate

1942
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:12,500
or something, and she almost tripped and fell down the stairs.

1943
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:14,660
Really insane.

1944
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,580
But it's like all the stuff like spikes coming up from the ground

1945
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,580
and India avoiding it, but live during the Super Bowl.

1946
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:25,340
Did you guys ever see the miniature stunt show they did in Disneyland

1947
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,620
for Indiana Jones?

1948
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,980
It was kind of in the like a jungle area.

1949
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:30,380
Bizarre. Oh, we talked about that.

1950
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,100
As a woman. Yeah.

1951
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,380
Yeah. Yeah.

1952
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,580
We never heard of it till we looked into. Yeah.

1953
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,420
Go to hell.

1954
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,660
I don't think he says go to hell.

1955
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,380
But if she possesses, he possessed.

1956
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,220
She's possessed. I saw it. So it's fine. Yeah. Yeah.

1957
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:46,780
He's really punching the devil via this woman's body.

1958
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,140
He doesn't want the devil.

1959
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,300
Then he throws her into the Cave of Wonders.

1960
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:51,420
Right.

1961
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:55,500
It's like a slightly disguised the old Cave of Wonders set.

1962
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:58,340
He does. He does kill her eventually. Yeah.

1963
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,220
Yeah. It's OK. He kills her.

1964
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,620
Killings fine. Punching.

1965
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,420
And he puts her out of her misery.

1966
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,140
Yeah. The humane thing.

1967
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,220
Right. Were you working there when that happened?

1968
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:10,780
I might have been, but I don't remember.

1969
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:12,820
That seems like that could have crossed over.

1970
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,140
I forget. What am I missing from?

1971
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,780
Miami Vice is a very I mean, there's some very impressive.

1972
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,340
The helicopters are impressive.

1973
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:23,100
I do wonder if the helicopter what worked more often,

1974
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,900
the helicopter or the water world Balsa wood plane?

1975
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,020
Yeah, Balsa wood plane gets canceled if there's too high a wind.

1976
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,500
Is that what it is? Yeah.

1977
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,740
Yeah. They don't do it, which would be a real bummer.

1978
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:35,380
What do they do? They just they just saw it once.

1979
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:37,540
They just set off all the fireworks, I think. Right.

1980
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:38,540
But I think, yeah, I think so.

1981
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:41,700
But then there's a weird thing, at least when I saw it when I was much younger.

1982
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,180
There's a weird part where the deacon goes.

1983
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:48,380
There's a crash. He hears a crash and he looks back where you can't see and says,

1984
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:50,300
Oh, no, my plane. Oh, yeah.

1985
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,500
No, I love I think I love.

1986
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,060
I don't know.

1987
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:57,020
Maybe it's not a theme park stunt show unless there's stuff that doesn't work.

1988
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,980
Acclaimed stuff.

1989
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:02,100
The other cool thing in Miami Vice was when they ride in that mine car.

1990
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,860
That's the mine. And it explodes and they go flying out.

1991
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:08,780
That just blew my mind. That's a crazy stunt.

1992
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:10,300
I don't know how they do that.

1993
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,420
That is like you can't half ass that.

1994
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,500
They get seems so whiplashy.

1995
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:18,300
They get just suddenly hard stops and they go flying out.

1996
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,460
And they do like a full flip, I believe.

1997
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,940
Yes. Both of them.

1998
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:25,180
That's what's also impressive to me is that they both flip out of it.

1999
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:29,180
Yeah. And you'd think they would like their heads would collide regularly.

2000
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:30,980
It would happen all the time.

2001
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,220
But maybe it did. I don't know. Yeah.

2002
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:36,460
They the articles when this was opening in the L.A.

2003
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:42,100
Times, the MCA's corporate safety program director,

2004
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:46,660
because MCA owned Universal at this time, said our industry quote,

2005
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:51,100
our industry gets a lot of publicity when things go wrong, said Paul Holhouse.

2006
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,780
I love it.

2007
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:55,580
I love it. All the whole house.

2008
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:58,420
I'm the director of the MCA's corporate safety program.

2009
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:03,460
But what are what are all the Miami Vice, at least like the water

2010
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,420
and the landscaping looks pleasant.

2011
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:07,900
It's aesthetically appealing to look at.

2012
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,900
The 18 look like a dirty field, like a dirty demolition,

2013
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,700
derby, monster truck show.

2014
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:17,460
Yeah, it was it was like a Mexican villa or something.

2015
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,460
Or I can't remember. I think it's the border.

2016
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:24,740
I think you're at the relevant US Mexico border and the like it's so it's

2017
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:30,100
and you're you're watching it through like there's a fence in front of you

2018
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,460
with barbed wire that like bends.

2019
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,340
That's like that feels like it's trapping in the performer side of things.

2020
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,500
So that was like a safety thing.

2021
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:42,380
There was like a chain link fence or it was theming or safety or maybe all together.

2022
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:44,820
I don't know. But it's so dreary.

2023
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:48,540
You're watching like a very depressing pen essentially.

2024
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:52,980
Footage of that has to exist, like archive footage of that thing.

2025
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,900
I wish they would release that.

2026
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,260
How could it only be?

2027
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:58,740
Yeah, definitely made it hard to find much about.

2028
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:01,420
But yeah, I saw a couple of photos that were really miserable.

2029
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:04,260
And then I read about this sort of miserable

2030
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:08,220
like union organizing situation.

2031
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:13,020
They there was a successful walkout by the A team.

2032
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,260
I guess not successful in the A team.

2033
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:17,060
By the A team. They did it.

2034
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,700
They banded together.

2035
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:19,980
Doesn't fight their way out.

2036
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,260
I love it when a plan comes together.

2037
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:26,620
I love when a union comes to collective bargaining.

2038
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:29,660
You don't got to solve everything with punches.

2039
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:33,540
By the way, I rewatched some of the A team originally in the first season.

2040
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:36,940
His catchphrase or at least the first few episodes that would just be the pilot

2041
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,740
because they actually recast face, I think, and did some recasting.

2042
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:44,900
His his catchphrase was not I love it when a plan comes together.

2043
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,900
It was Hannibal's on the jazz.

2044
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,300
Well, it's like I'm on the jazz.

2045
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,500
That was his way of saying, like, I'm I'm in the like the rhythm I'm in.

2046
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,180
I'm on the prowl.

2047
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:58,060
I'm making it happen in the pocket.

2048
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:00,260
I don't know what. But it's my catchphrase now.

2049
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,220
That's what I was thinking.

2050
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:04,140
It's on the jazz.

2051
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:08,660
We will we will find a proper moment to say it later on.

2052
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:12,660
Yeah, that was another IP that we can buy up because nobody's using it.

2053
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,740
They never made T-shirts of on the jazz.

2054
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,860
So it's ours now.

2055
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:20,460
So the yeah, they were like they seem to perform.

2056
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:24,300
They're very unhappy with what they were making on the thing.

2057
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:26,380
And they even quoted them like somebody says,

2058
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,820
we don't feel we should risk our lives for a lousy two hundred fifty dollars a week

2059
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,220
when I could go dump trash and get paid more.

2060
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:36,740
Gee, we assume that's a five day work week.

2061
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:40,460
So that's fifty dollars a day for stunt work.

2062
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:41,620
That's crazy.

2063
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,780
Is it around what I got paid as a tour guide?

2064
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:47,820
These guys are but this is but then, yeah, an eighty five and it's stunt people.

2065
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,340
Yeah, that's really shitty.

2066
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:55,340
They proposed to Universal a five dollar per performance raise.

2067
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:59,780
That's and Universal said, how about a fifteen dollar per performance cut?

2068
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:03,860
They like just they got the request and just said, fine,

2069
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:06,140
we're drastically cutting your salary.

2070
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,340
So they all walked out.

2071
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,140
And but the universe was like fine.

2072
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:12,700
And they just put up a newspaper ad for more, which maybe is what happened

2073
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,940
when you saw it. Maybe they were just like, well, we found three of the guys,

2074
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,020
but not all of them.

2075
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:17,940
You got to go back and forth.

2076
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:20,660
You're Murdoch to stunt scabs scabs.

2077
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,020
The lowest form of life.

2078
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,980
That's what Haim Saban did at the Power Rangers.

2079
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,340
Right. Yeah. Right.

2080
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,300
They're like, hey, we want some money because this is so popular.

2081
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,220
And he was like, no, I will replace you.

2082
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:33,660
And he did. And like as a kid, I was just like, oh, that sucks.

2083
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,940
I like them. Anyway, I'll keep watching.

2084
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:39,660
Weird that that cool doesn't like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

2085
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,740
That's weird. Yes, it is weird. I agree.

2086
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:46,780
They also released a statement, another bizarrely named universal person,

2087
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,780
Patty Casino.

2088
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:54,340
Whole house and casino are on the job.

2089
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:57,420
Another whole house casino production.

2090
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:03,340
Patty Casino took to the papers to say, you know, the stuntmen say that

2091
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,380
it's what this is.

2092
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,340
They choose one of our most popular shows, but actually, it's not as popular

2093
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:10,300
as the Western show or the animal show or kind of the barbarian.

2094
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,100
She went out of her way to say it's not doing well for us.

2095
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,820
So that's like when Disney was like, you know, Lord Miller,

2096
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:18,060
we're doing a very good job making this solo movie.

2097
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,420
That's why we fired them.

2098
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,420
Yeah. Yeah.

2099
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:21,820
I sent them away in disgrace.

2100
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:24,260
They must have had ghostwriters on all their other mega successes.

2101
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,380
Yeah. These guys were really shit in the bed on the set.

2102
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:31,700
It does seem a little claustrophobic to me, the idea of going to Universal

2103
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,980
and doing the tram and then five shows like that.

2104
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,060
Yeah. A lot of sitting.

2105
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:40,220
Yeah, because there was no lower like lot theme park area at that point.

2106
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,220
Yeah. Yeah.

2107
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:43,380
Until they installed the star way.

2108
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,420
Upcoming topic, the star way.

2109
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:47,020
The escalator. Yes. Yeah.

2110
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:51,100
We did. We got an episode in the can about the escalator.

2111
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,620
We had a lot to say. Oh, yeah.

2112
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,380
Who is that out yet?

2113
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:55,540
Not known in our world.

2114
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,900
That's familiar to me.

2115
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,500
Yes. Similarly, Monday.

2116
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,500
Earlier in the episode, I think.

2117
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,500
Probably.

2118
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,260
Although I think it will be up by the time this comes out.

2119
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,100
Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm doing the math in my head.

2120
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,620
The world will know.

2121
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:08,020
The world will have changed.

2122
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:09,980
It sounds familiar because of all the awards it won.

2123
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:13,380
You're getting like a future future flash.

2124
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:14,420
I think it's happening.

2125
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,620
That's the 84 Olympic ceremony.

2126
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:17,540
Yeah.

2127
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,140
One day you will have the world's greatest escalator.

2128
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,700
I believe in you, humanity.

2129
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:27,620
The same quote from the guy who does doesn't like his

2130
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:30,140
two hundred fifty dollars salary for some reason.

2131
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,060
He is the guy who plays Mr.

2132
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,580
T in the beginning of his his quote to the press.

2133
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:37,620
He says, I pity the fool who takes my money.

2134
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:38,980
Oh, my God.

2135
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:41,780
He did his newspaper quote in character that

2136
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,620
that helps his case a little bit.

2137
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,380
He should be out of here.

2138
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:47,380
He should be enjoying his fight.

2139
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:48,420
Or maybe he should.

2140
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,700
He's showing how good he is.

2141
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:50,420
Yeah, that's true.

2142
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,860
The probably unspeaking role in the show.

2143
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,140
Right. There was a Mr.

2144
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,940
T who worked for Universal until he died.

2145
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:59,700
There was a Baracus who could walk around character.

2146
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,100
Well, he became a tram driver after the show.

2147
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,940
That name on the studio tour, JJ.

2148
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:06,260
I don't specifically remember that person, but it does sound familiar.

2149
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:09,140
I'm going to head to the stronger union, I guess.

2150
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,580
He worked for Universal until he died in 2014.

2151
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:13,900
Oh, geez. That's nice.

2152
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,380
Lifer. Huh?

2153
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:19,180
Um, the what have I what have I missed?

2154
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,180
The there's sorry, I was going to say Miami Vice.

2155
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,540
Yeah, I have there was I watched it behind the scenes,

2156
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,340
which is like it was billed as like a making of.

2157
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,060
It's like two minutes long.

2158
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,940
I just see that there's a Conan one that's kind of our Conan.

2159
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2160
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:38,020
There's super tech going on with that, because if people don't know that show,

2161
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,580
there's a dragon that rises up from the lasers.

2162
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:43,100
Yeah. Yeah. And laser is the highest tech thing of all.

2163
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,540
Rain curtain.

2164
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:48,860
So somebody in the video is like, you know, there's 50 stunts in 18 minutes

2165
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,780
and it will be radical.

2166
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,020
I wrote that down, too.

2167
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,380
And I can tell you it was radical.

2168
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,740
Yeah, it certainly was.

2169
01:36:56,740 --> 01:37:00,220
And I wrote that guy who says that kind of looks like Randy Johnson.

2170
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:01,260
A little bit. Oh, yeah.

2171
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:03,060
Mustachioed baseball.

2172
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,540
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that is a great moment.

2173
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:09,540
My other favorite part of that video is a guy practicing doing

2174
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:13,500
practicing taking shots from like a zip line.

2175
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:16,420
So he's there choreographing when the shots would take place

2176
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:19,460
and watching a man slide down a zip line and go, what do you think?

2177
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,300
Really, really fun.

2178
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,900
Yes, that is good. Yeah. Yeah.

2179
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,500
Good video. Good video.

2180
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:27,300
It's a short one, though.

2181
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:30,180
They also then there's a part where a guy says, yeah,

2182
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,220
you got to be careful and choreograph these things, right?

2183
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,580
Because if not, this can happen.

2184
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:38,180
And he raises his arm and it's in a full cast like that.

2185
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:39,660
I had a crazy angle.

2186
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:42,620
And then the narrator says, but when it all works right,

2187
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,780
which is almost all the time

2188
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:49,500
in a casino whole house production, no

2189
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:52,460
spared no expense.

2190
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:55,020
Put the money on the screen.

2191
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:58,420
There is a way there is an odd joke in Miami Vice.

2192
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:01,860
The one joke where I'm like, well, that really wouldn't fly nowadays is the

2193
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:06,180
the director, MC guy picks up a rifle and he's like, of course,

2194
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,940
everything is the sound.

2195
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,980
These are fake guns.

2196
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:10,660
We never use live ammo.

2197
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,100
And then he points it at the ground.

2198
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,820
A bunch of squibs go off in the water.

2199
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,980
And he's like, whoa, I guess this thing loaded.

2200
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:20,180
And I'm like, 1995, when did Brandon Lee happen?

2201
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:24,700
Like, I was just like, oh, I don't this seems I don't know about this one.

2202
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,820
Yeah, right. That's right.

2203
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,660
The Crowe stunt show was not ultimately, you know,

2204
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:31,420
did not get off the ground.

2205
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:33,300
That's the thing with the show in general that I do.

2206
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:37,460
I think today, if a new theme park stunt show was put together,

2207
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,780
I don't think it would just be guns.

2208
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:43,140
It is a show all about guns and nothing but guns.

2209
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,700
And in the case of Miami Vice, like,

2210
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:50,300
you know, we're ignoring all of the like moral complexity

2211
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,260
and ambiguity of the show and all of that.

2212
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:56,500
That is mainly a show where people like talk very soberly and like, no, it's guns.

2213
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,540
They shoot each other. Big guns.

2214
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:01,420
I say bring it back, but 2006 Miami Vice.

2215
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:03,380
So it's a lot of like, I love that.

2216
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,540
Can you get the encore? Do you want more?

2217
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:10,180
And like, there's the weird Colin Farrell, weird haircut.

2218
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:12,220
They keep saying go fast boats.

2219
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:13,460
Get in the go fast boats.

2220
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:14,660
Yeah, get in the go fast.

2221
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:18,940
It's just the boats and a lot of lighting and digital video from the time

2222
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:21,820
and the Jay-Z, Linkin Park mashups. Yeah.

2223
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,860
Oh, right. That's what you get to see.

2224
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:25,860
I've never watched it. Just sound pretty crazy.

2225
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:27,460
I like it a lot, actually.

2226
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:31,140
I know I'm in the minority, but I think there's a growing appreciation

2227
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,980
for that movie again.

2228
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:33,540
It's come up a lot lately.

2229
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,020
And I'm like, I can rewatch that.

2230
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:36,500
Yeah, like I don't I don't think it's better.

2231
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,900
I think Collateral is still a better movie.

2232
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:42,660
But like that, it's we it's interesting to see what expensive digital

2233
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,580
film looked like at the time.

2234
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:49,460
What I remember about that movie is that somebody came to speak to my film school

2235
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,740
who was working in the post department of that movie and who's in.

2236
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:56,180
They said that during editing, Michael Mann would come in

2237
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:58,860
and watch the full movie every day.

2238
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:02,260
He would not just do a part of it when he got there.

2239
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:04,820
I love the thing.

2240
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,020
I'm not just me. I'm a fan.

2241
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:09,260
Look how cool that light looks.

2242
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:12,060
Crack of Dawn. Public enemies is dog shit.

2243
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:13,060
Don't watch public enemies.

2244
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:14,660
Oh, no. No.

2245
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,660
Dillinger one. Right. Too bad.

2246
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:22,140
I I should also say the

2247
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:26,140
you know, it's weird is that Universal Florida had this show

2248
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:29,020
that was on their lagoon.

2249
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:32,940
They had a stunt show for a long time that was not Miami Vice,

2250
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:36,540
but it starred like two Miami vicey dudes.

2251
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,420
And they played the Miami vice music

2252
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,740
through the whole show was all scored by Miami vice music.

2253
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:46,180
But it was not specifically the Miami vice stunt.

2254
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:49,100
It was called Dynamite Nights Stuntacular.

2255
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:52,740
Did you guys ever see to stay around for at night and watch Dynamite?

2256
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:56,180
Never. I miss that show.

2257
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:57,700
A non brand.

2258
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:01,060
If there's any way to make this better, making it a little less brand.

2259
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:03,540
Yeah. Yeah. Miami vice stunt.

2260
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,700
Spectator generica sizing it up a bit.

2261
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:08,220
I never remember seeing that.

2262
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:14,180
I probably saw it from a bad viewpoint only when I went in like 2012 or 2014

2263
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:17,100
where it like happened to be eating at dinner at Lombards,

2264
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,580
the seafood place on the water.

2265
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:21,900
And they're like, oh, you can go out on the patio and just watch.

2266
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:26,420
And at that time, it was Morgan Freeman telling you about the importance of movies

2267
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,020
like the magic of 100 years of movies.

2268
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:31,460
OK, that was less spectacular.

2269
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:34,500
Extremely dull. Yes. Yeah.

2270
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:39,180
But I guess like I should mention this with a gun thing to her as this question,

2271
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,980
like saying when there was this new Miami vice

2272
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:43,940
that sort of got back to the roots of what it was going to be like.

2273
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:47,380
I don't know the show unbelievably well.

2274
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:50,900
I have not watched the full run of the show, but it does not seem like

2275
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:54,260
I feel like I know so much more the the theme park version of it.

2276
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:58,540
But it does not seem like it was a show that was all ass kicking all the time.

2277
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:59,020
You know what I mean?

2278
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:02,660
Like and I even saw YouTube comment that said this is more like Rambo to me

2279
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,540
than Miami vice.

2280
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,660
So which I don't mind.

2281
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:10,940
I think it's cool that it just like takes all the top moments of the show

2282
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:16,300
and boils it down, but does not necessarily reflect its source material.

2283
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:16,980
Not at all.

2284
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:19,420
Yeah. Yeah. It was way more Rambo.

2285
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:20,420
Yeah. Yeah.

2286
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:23,220
Tango and cash kind of thing or so. Oh, sure. Sure.

2287
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:26,180
Yeah. Yeah. Which apparently in the same guy, I mentioned Phil Hedema

2288
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:29,780
who planned the things he said in the newspaper article.

2289
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:33,140
The tour had been planning a new live action edition to the studio since last fall.

2290
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:37,140
But the executives didn't decide on a Miami vice theme until February.

2291
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:39,420
And this article is from July.

2292
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,020
So wow.

2293
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:44,660
They were like they were building a stunt show without knowing.

2294
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,540
Oh, right. It was going to be.

2295
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,460
They probably knew it's it's guns and it's boats.

2296
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:53,420
They maybe they're building the lagoon, but not which maybe it was some other

2297
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:57,020
problem. They were toying around or keeping it generic in case the Rambo rights

2298
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:57,860
came through or something.

2299
01:42:57,860 --> 01:43:03,380
Yeah, I know that there was concept work done for a James Bond stunt show

2300
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,580
for I believe Universal.

2301
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:07,020
In fact, Ralph McQuarrie did the artwork.

2302
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:08,020
You can see it online.

2303
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:10,380
And it's the volcano set from You Only Live Twice.

2304
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:13,420
I mean, yeah, that's yeah, that seems awesome.

2305
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:16,820
Is James Bond reflected in theme park world anywhere?

2306
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:18,460
I don't believe so. Yes.

2307
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,460
Oh, yes.

2308
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:23,700
Briefly at Kings Dominion, when it was in the Paramount parks,

2309
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:26,820
they had a motion simulator theater for the longest time.

2310
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:32,380
It was Days of Thunder and it was slightly more movement than

2311
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:35,620
D box or 40 X.

2312
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:41,020
You kind of sat in chairs like that and it would be like the NASCAR race.

2313
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:45,340
And then in the mid 90s, they flipped it to Pierce Brosnan and James Bond.

2314
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:46,980
Oh, wow. I never got to see it.

2315
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:48,580
And that only lasted a year or two.

2316
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:53,420
And then they flipped it to like Stan Lee presents the age of heroes,

2317
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:58,780
like one of those generic superhero things that like they slapped Stan Lee's name on.

2318
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:00,820
Oh, no heroes you'd recognize.

2319
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:03,100
No. Oh, no, no, no, no.

2320
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:07,820
All new. It's the new universe of heroes like there's colors.

2321
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:09,780
Just blue man, yellow man.

2322
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:12,420
I feel like Stan made up as many character

2323
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:15,820
or had involvement with as many characters in Marvel as he did outside.

2324
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:18,500
Like he has 300 characters you never heard of.

2325
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,500
Yeah. Yes. Like just trying.

2326
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:23,100
There's some audible thing right now.

2327
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:25,380
Yeah. Yeah. There's all these different ways.

2328
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:27,900
I was I just when I was a comic and I was like,

2329
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:32,300
is Stan's most popular creation outside of Marvel strip orella?

2330
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:36,060
It is for me now.

2331
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:42,020
And at a TV show, there was a Pamela Anderson voice TV show on TV.

2332
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,980
It's recognizable. Right.

2333
01:44:43,980 --> 01:44:47,580
So like that might be it outside of anything he did at Marvel. OK.

2334
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:52,740
And final, final thoughts in Miami Vice related stuff, as you're saying,

2335
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:55,380
hearing that hearing that score blare through those speakers.

2336
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:58,060
Fantastic. The Jan Hamer Jan Hamer.

2337
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:01,260
Do you do you use I mean, your temptation is to say Jan Hamer.

2338
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:02,620
But I think it's I think you're right.

2339
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:04,100
I think it is. I think I got it right the first time.

2340
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,220
It just felt I felt pretentious saying it or something.

2341
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:12,620
Yeah. I was looking up the rest of the of the the Jan Hamer discography.

2342
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:14,940
I discovered that he was keyboard magazines,

2343
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:17,660
best studio synthesis for two years in a row.

2344
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,580
Jesus Christ.

2345
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:22,180
I'm surprised you had to look that up, because I assume you know that.

2346
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:24,420
I've got four years of synthesizer.

2347
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,300
Yeah, yeah, I've got him loaded up.

2348
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,660
Yeah, he took the reins from Greg Fillinggain.

2349
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:31,100
And so, you know, obviously the guy to beat.

2350
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:35,620
But, you know, I'm reading all the, you know, the the odds and ends about

2351
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:39,340
Jan Hamer, and then I get to the end of the most recent thing on June 25th,

2352
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:42,780
2019, the New York Times magazine listed Jan Hamer among the hundreds of artists

2353
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:45,700
whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 year.

2354
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:49,700
Fire. We this is how it's been a couple of times now.

2355
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,020
We talked about that with that crazy fire that burned up

2356
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,860
the music masters a little while ago.

2357
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:56,500
And then who was it? It was like some it was like the gentle band

2358
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,460
that does the Woody's roundup music like the night.

2359
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,540
These nice guys who play their fiddles,

2360
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:04,220
all their all their masters were destroyed in the universal fire.

2361
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:08,620
And now this is going to have to be like copy pasted for every episode.

2362
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:11,380
For any time we talk about a musician.

2363
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:13,420
Tragic. Deal with that fire.

2364
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:15,860
You know, anyway, horrible.

2365
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:19,940
But his music lives on in the best quality that you can find it,

2366
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:24,620
which is on camcorder videos of a stunt show.

2367
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:29,060
That is that's what probably if you're like programming drums,

2368
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:30,500
it's how you want it to sound.

2369
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,700
It's coming through several mediums at once.

2370
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:35,060
Yes. That crunch.

2371
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:37,140
It also has the music as like that pan.

2372
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,340
What is it like a flute of some kind? Right.

2373
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,900
Synthesize like a pan flute or synth flute or something.

2374
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:45,340
It's like it's like the intro to Thunder in Paradise, which I love.

2375
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:47,820
Oh, yeah. Syndicated show.

2376
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:49,980
Also, if there could have been a stunt show of any that.

2377
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2378
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:53,580
Thunder and paradise properties that jump out to you.

2379
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:57,060
If you I mean, Rambo, you mentioned Rambo would be amazing stunt show.

2380
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,020
I mean, they made a kids cartoon out of it.

2381
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:01,020
Was there really? Yeah, there was. Yeah.

2382
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:04,500
Well, how did they like handle all the Rambo enos of it?

2383
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:09,540
He was just it basically was a team format where he would go help some village

2384
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:11,660
every time, I think.

2385
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:15,660
And it was like a general villain that was after him or something.

2386
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:17,660
He was in like

2387
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:21,900
Tierra Libre was the the country he was in.

2388
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:24,700
I don't know how I remember this.

2389
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,500
They were the Robocop cartoon.

2390
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,060
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.

2391
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,420
Robocop show. That'd be good. Yeah.

2392
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:32,020
Oh, my God. That would be the best.

2393
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:34,860
Some of these might have existed in like Germany or Australia.

2394
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:39,540
Because there was a stray police academy stunt show in a couple of odd places.

2395
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:44,020
But Star Wars stunt show, an actual like stunt spectacular was amazing.

2396
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:45,460
They've never really done that.

2397
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:49,940
There's always some twist to it, like a Jedi academy or something that just shits it.

2398
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:51,420
Yeah, there are there.

2399
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:54,460
I feel like that the promise of some of Galaxy's Edge was like,

2400
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,900
and there's going to be like flash mob scenes and like,

2401
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,540
I don't know if they're going to roll that out eventually.

2402
01:47:58,540 --> 01:48:02,420
But you would feel like they could do a full, cool, awesome, like, yeah.

2403
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:04,980
Within the land stunt show somehow. Mm hmm.

2404
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,580
And it's a it's a property we're getting.

2405
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:09,740
Violent is not so it's fine. It's great.

2406
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,740
We have it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2407
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:14,340
No, it's a laser. Right now. Bullets. That's great.

2408
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:16,860
Oh, yeah. True. Yeah. And they're they're aliens.

2409
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:20,260
We don't have any attachment to the aliens or robots. Stormtroopers. Yeah.

2410
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:24,220
I wish they'd just do full on adult franchise themes

2411
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,820
like theme parks, stunts shows like a Saving Private Ryan stunts show.

2412
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:32,900
Platoon die hard, die hard stunts show.

2413
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:34,140
The series.

2414
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:37,100
You watch the guy getting his finger.

2415
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,300
Michael Clayton. Yeah, Michael.

2416
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:44,220
And that's a guy just fixing all the problems after the stunt show. Yeah.

2417
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:47,900
Yeah. Good. The car explodes in that car.

2418
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:51,580
Sure. Building that happened before the show. Oh, OK. Yeah.

2419
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,180
You just seem to go through everything.

2420
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:55,820
The theme park having to buy the property to have a full size,

2421
01:48:55,820 --> 01:49:00,060
an accurate size Normandy like to get the scale of the beach. Correct.

2422
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,500
They have to close down their adjoining water park.

2423
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:06,580
So it all becomes a much sadder beach.

2424
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:09,820
And then how do you handle the German soldiers or Nazis?

2425
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:12,620
Because wasn't didn't they used to have swastikas in the Indiana Jones

2426
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:14,060
stunt show and they took them all out.

2427
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:16,420
Now it's just kind of generally red and black. Yeah.

2428
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:19,140
That's just like, yeah,

2429
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:21,380
they're jerks. It's the jerk patrol. Yeah.

2430
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:25,020
Well, we're we might be on the the precipice

2431
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:28,180
of a new generation of stunt shows with those Marvel robots.

2432
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:31,380
Have you seen those, the stunt robots? Oh, yes. Yeah.

2433
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:35,820
These crazy things that fly through the air that like can make a super heroic pose.

2434
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,820
Yeah. So like we.

2435
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:41,260
I mean, they're obviously going to kill us eventually, but it's.

2436
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:44,020
The least they could do is do some stunt shows in the meantime.

2437
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:47,100
Do a little stunt show for us and then murder us in a couple of years.

2438
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:49,940
Get our defenses down. Right.

2439
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:52,780
Full sense of security. Warm our hearts.

2440
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:55,060
So just here to do stunts, spectacular.

2441
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:57,660
It doesn't matter that they're multiplying.

2442
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:59,380
They found a way to mate.

2443
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,900
It just means more stunt shows.

2444
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:03,780
There's more than today because that just means more stunts for us.

2445
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,660
Yeah. Right.

2446
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,700
Everybody gets a personal stunt team in their house now. Yeah.

2447
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,660
And they keep talking about two weeks to go time.

2448
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:13,900
It must be a stunt language.

2449
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,500
I don't know.

2450
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:18,940
Wouldn't it be very like apropos if we were all killed by a bunch of superheroes?

2451
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:21,460
Yeah. Like they took over our cinema.

2452
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:24,940
Now they're in our homes and like Spider-Man is just choking us all out.

2453
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:26,660
Like, yeah, we deserve it.

2454
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,940
I guess we just make me breakfast or something.

2455
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:32,660
Yeah. Some dweeb like his life being choked out of him going,

2456
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:34,740
Oh, who watches the watchman?

2457
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,660
See, so leave his body. Yeah.

2458
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:41,660
That's the way I want to go.

2459
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:46,380
I mean, for one, I welcome our robot stunts eventual overlords,

2460
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:50,500
but they would not exist without the the brave stuntman

2461
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:55,020
who literally did break their arms to make the Miami boys show what it was.

2462
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,340
Thank you for coming and talking to us about it for a while.

2463
01:50:57,860 --> 01:50:59,780
Matt Gorley Survive podcast.

2464
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:01,140
I do it all over again.

2465
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:02,860
I feel like there's more to talk about.

2466
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,900
Yeah, there's probably.

2467
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,060
Send us a send us like just send us like a voice memo addendum.

2468
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:11,100
If you're leaving here, just, you know, call me, leave me a message.

2469
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,420
Well, we'll just add it to the end.

2470
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,100
Sounds good. Should make that an option for all.

2471
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:14,940
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2472
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:17,420
Yeah. On the way home, if you just want to talk on your phone.

2473
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,460
Yeah, I forgot.

2474
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:21,100
Sometimes Tubbs would wear like a orange suit that looked cool.

2475
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:23,300
All right. That's it. Bye.

2476
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:26,340
Yeah. Hey, thanks so much for being here.

2477
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,540
And let's exit through the gift shop.

2478
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:30,300
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2479
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,540
Oh, gosh, I guess not.

2480
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:36,060
I mean, I said MacGorley.com so you can find everything there.

2481
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,020
Yeah, whatever social media.

2482
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:39,740
I know that now.

2483
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:44,540
Yeah. Any podcast I'm doing, I think Suprigo is coming back later this year.

2484
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,540
And so all that's there.

2485
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:48,220
Yeah. Thank you guys. Absolutely.

2486
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:52,580
And show from your days at the way.

2487
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,300
Which one? Wait, what did you all do to get soap with some of it with soap?

2488
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:57,700
I think most of it. Yeah, we started in soap opera bistro

2489
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:01,380
and then around that transition period, I think is when it happened.

2490
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:04,860
I'm sure it's saying, can we play parts that are not doctors or?

2491
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:09,860
Yeah, it was like we were doing such straightforward mainstream improv.

2492
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:10,860
We wanted to start.

2493
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:16,500
We get off stage and just start denying each other as a like venting thing.

2494
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,780
And so we wanted to just break the rules of improv.

2495
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:20,860
And that's how Suprigo was born, basically.

2496
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:24,380
Geez. Wow. It's like math related to the theme park experience.

2497
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:27,020
That's pretty crazy. Is there like an oral history of this yet?

2498
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:30,500
I'm like imagining like the Tom Shales SNL book where you're like talking about

2499
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:34,140
the soap opera bistro and like you guys are all there together and like

2500
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:38,140
people have asked us to do like this group of people to do a podcast about it.

2501
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:40,100
Like just the stories behind.

2502
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:42,260
I remember some middle manager

2503
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:45,460
took a picture of me with my shirt off in the dressing room and emailed it to me.

2504
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,540
It was a weird place.

2505
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:51,020
Yeah. He was a creepy Disney guy who'd come in every day

2506
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:53,940
with a giant Cheshire cat smile on his face going,

2507
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:57,220
are we all having a Disney day?

2508
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:59,420
Yeah, he was gross.

2509
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:02,700
That exists. That's like what you show in a movie about working.

2510
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:04,540
We used to have this running joke.

2511
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:07,220
We won't say I won't say his name here, but let's say his name was like

2512
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:11,540
Leonard Baratso, and we'd always go Leonard Baratso for a county molester.

2513
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,660
Vote Leonard Baratso for a county molester.

2514
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:20,820
Leonard Baratso, I think, first of these robots who are eventually going to kill us.

2515
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:21,980
Yeah, it was an early prototype.

2516
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:24,060
Oh, he was. Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

2517
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,740
You know, gentlemen, what else we got?

2518
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:30,900
Live show tickets still available for Anaheim.

2519
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:34,140
August 24th, Anaheim, October 24th, Orlando.

2520
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:39,140
Where are you doing the show at the Anaheim Hotel near D23?

2521
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:41,260
You Disney conventions. Yeah. Yeah.

2522
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:42,940
During that convention? Yes.

2523
01:53:42,940 --> 01:53:44,940
Yeah. Not affiliated.

2524
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:47,860
You know, legally not affiliated.

2525
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:49,340
And what's the subject?

2526
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,420
I don't think we know.

2527
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:53,300
We were just running ideas around yesterday, but we know.

2528
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,540
Yeah, we don't. We're not ready to say yet.

2529
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:58,620
I don't know. It's very.

2530
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:59,100
Yeah. Yeah.

2531
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:03,300
But if you're not if you're not all paneled out by the end of D23,

2532
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:07,740
please, please come to a different ballroom, a different sweaty ballroom.

2533
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:10,900
OK, that's good.

2534
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:13,540
I said yes to them having a person there with their cash bar.

2535
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:15,900
We don't get any money from it, but enjoy.

2536
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:18,780
But if I get booze from it, then I'm all set.

2537
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:20,620
And yes, it's good as money.

2538
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:23,660
Yeah, sure. Sure.

01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:26,940

He probably like all of that.

2542

Yeah. Yeah.

2543
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:34,300
You know, the things.

2544
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:36,300
Yeah. Thanks for thanks for listening, everybody.

2545
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:38,460
It's been radical.

2546
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:39,820
It has been radical.

2547
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:41,660
Jason was on that jazz.

2548
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:45,940
