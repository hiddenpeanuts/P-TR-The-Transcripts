1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,340
Welcome to podcast the Rye the Second Gate

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,820
where today class is in session.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,720
Please all rise for our national anthem.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,480
We pledge allegiance to all of the podcasts

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,460
the Rye characters, the bad boys of Boston,

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,900
and of course Josh Demaro, the hunkiest Disney executive

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,140
in the history of the company

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,280
and of hunky men in general.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,960
My name is Professor Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,440
Joining me as always Professor Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,200
That's right, Michael is tenured

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
and I'm his associate or adjunct.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,880
Yes, exactly.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,960
But you kind of are like more like a penny

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,680
on Inspector Gadget where you know more than I do

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,400
even though I'm sort of the guy in charge.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,200
I suppose that's right but you have more gadgets and such.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,920
I do have more gadgets.

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,640
But here let's bring in our star pupil Scott Gardner here.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,000
Well sorry, I'm hung up on the bad boys of Boston.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
Are you Aerosmith you mean?

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,720
Oh I'm talking about Aerosmith, yeah.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,120
I was pledging allegiance to Aerosmith, yeah.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,040
So Aerosmith is enough of a tenant of the podcast for you

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,800
that to just put it in, not say their name

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,640
despite the fact we've never used that phrase.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,720
Like that's clear, that's fine, people know.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,720
I think I used that phrase on the last episode with Mookie.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,480
I think I said the bad boys of Boston,

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,080
or I could be wrong, I used it once I'm pretty sure.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,560
I guess it being recent might help.

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,820
But I still take issue with bad boys of Boston

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,840
being like well of course,

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
if when you listen to podcasts,

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,560
one of the main things you're gonna hear about

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
is the bad boys of Boston.

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,720
Well if you hear about the bad boys of Boston

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
from the bad boys of Burbank.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,920
I can't argue with that.

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,960
I also texted Jason like two minutes ago and said,

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
who should we pledge allegiance to when we start class?

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,200
And he was like, I don't know,

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,640
the Boulevard of Broken Dreams?

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,280
And I was like, yeah I don't know, I'll say something.

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,640
Well you were mixing up national anthems and pledges

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,840
I realize in this moment.

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,320
You know what, we should honestly,

49
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,280
this looks kinda like this,

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,460
we should honestly just pledge

51
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,840
that we should be true to our school.

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
That is really what we should be saying.

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,960
As his heroes, the bad boys of.

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Every girl or guy, yeah.

55
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,160
But not allegiance to loud braggarts.

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
Exactly.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360
We don't like loud braggarts.

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,380
This might be genuinely true

59
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,920
that that is my least favorite Beach Boys song.

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,960
That's maybe like an indefensible one.

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,880
And I like the crap.

62
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,960
I like their 1985 self-titled album

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
from the producer of Culture Club

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
where they started using drum machines.

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,480
Really, you don't like to be true to your school.

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,440
Be true to your school is a tough one to defend.

67
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,360
As I've said, my wife does not like the Beach Boys

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
and she'll bring that one up.

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Like what about be true to your school?

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
And I'm like, yeah, I can't help.

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,120
I look, there's no defense there, I got no defense.

72
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,560
It's funny, it's like a funny novelty Beach Boys song.

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,400
I think that's the key.

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Imagine if that had been done by something

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,880
by like the Summer Singers

76
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,400
and you never heard of the group again.

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,320
That would make sense.

78
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,280
Like that could be like a Monster Mash anomaly

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
from some crap band with no more hits.

80
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Interesting.

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I know what you're saying, but it's funny

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
because yeah, there is a lot of garbage in the catalog.

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,080
And I think that song is not offensive.

84
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,680
It's just maybe kind of, yeah,

85
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,280
it does feel a little more like a novelty song.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,400
It's not as good as the good 60s music,

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,840
but it's not as funny bad as what they did

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,080
as they got older and crazier.

89
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,440
Right.

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,600
That's interesting.

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
Yeah, I need it to go either way.

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,720
I need one type of meat on that bone.

93
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
That's stuff you need to talk about

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,400
on your upcoming Beach Boys podcast.

95
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,520
Cause that's an interesting take I hadn't thought about.

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm working the serious angle

97
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,720
cause I do think this has to be traditional radio

98
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,920
or else nobody's listening.

99
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes, I agree.

100
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,720
Yes, that's probably right, but I don't know.

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,760
I think people would follow you from here.

102
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,920
I think there are some,

103
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,440
some people don't necessarily want to hear

104
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,600
about all this old music crap,

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
but I think we have some people that like that.

106
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,240
You're saying people would get in the T-bird

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
follow me for some fun, fun, fun.

108
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,720
Before the keys are taken away.

109
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,760
Yeah, hurry up before those keys get taken away.

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
Is that daddy?

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is that the line?

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
Daddy takes the T-bird away?

113
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
That'd be it.

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,120
Okay, so Josh, before Josh Demaro takes the T-bird away

116
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
is kind of how I think about it.

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,200
Cause he is daddy.

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
We all think of him as daddy, yes.

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,920
But you know, let's get actually to the topic, right?

120
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
Let's get in the mix.

121
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,600
Well, yeah, I guess I'm not rushing to.

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,520
If listeners can imagine this is not,

123
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,520
uh, I know that it'll be fun to do it,

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,880
but it is in some regards,

125
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,880
my worst nightmare of an episode.

126
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,800
This is because we're going over the ins and outs

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,440
of the magic key program,

128
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,040
which is the new annual past situation.

129
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,160
And I've already tweeted some stuff about this

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,880
and how it makes me insane genuinely.

131
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,400
And thus we, but people did say they would love to hear

132
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,040
an episode where this is explained to me.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
You called your shot.

134
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,320
By my more knowledgeable co-hosts.

135
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,360
And I, yeah, yeah, yeah.

136
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
And that's correct.

137
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,040
That makes sense.

138
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,920
But I did, when you guys checked,

139
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I did text a moan back to you.

140
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
That's right.

141
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
Not a good moan, an annoyed moan.

142
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
That's right.

143
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,080
And I did say, I don't have to do any prep, right?

144
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,920
That's right.

145
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,440
And we agreed and we agreed that,

146
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,760
loosely agreed that the end of this episode will be,

147
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,600
there will be a quiz.

148
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,440
Oh, I guess, oh God, I kind of remembered that.

149
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,280
There is a 20.

150
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,040
I knew you would take it literally.

151
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,400
Jason and I have put together a 20 question quiz for you

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
at the end. 20?

153
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
What do you mean?

154
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
Nice even number, you know?

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,480
And the listeners at home. That can't be true.

156
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
It is very true.

157
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,960
We have all the questions written.

158
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,280
I just went through them and ordered them in the right way.

159
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
And yes, the listener.

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,000
That is more than has ever been in any sort of

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,560
questionnaire segment on any podcast.

162
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,200
Some of them are pretty quick.

163
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,640
There's some that like, you know, some are multi-part.

164
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
Yeah, a lot of true false.

165
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
A lot of true false.

166
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
So it'll be quick.

167
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
If you know it, you don't, don't worry.

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
We'll count, we whatever.

169
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
And then there is one essay question,

170
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,520
a verbal essay at the end that you'll have to answer.

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,400
And this is gonna be fun

172
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,120
because the listeners will get to do it at home.

173
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
They will get to get, you will need, by the way, Scott,

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
you will need a pen and paper

175
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,480
because there is some math on the test.

176
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
Oh, gee.

177
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Probably good.

178
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,240
And you may need to work on it.

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,080
Yeah.

180
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
I do have those.

181
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,800
We really should have, yeah,

182
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,560
I should have told you before we started recording.

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
Oh dear God.

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,920
That is coming at the end.

185
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
And forgive me,

186
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,680
because we may not go over all the things

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,120
that are on the quiz.

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
So it might not be.

189
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,800
Yeah, so wait, how am I supposed to,

190
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,960
I might do some educated guesses.

191
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,160
No, no, we're gonna go over a lot of it,

192
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
but there might be one or two things we missed.

193
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,680
So I apologize if that happens.

194
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,760
It's like the SATs, you know,

195
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,920
they're not necessarily testing you on knowledge.

196
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,120
They're testing you on, you know, ability to like,

197
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,160
eliminate like, well, I know it's not that,

198
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
I know it's not that, so I narrow it down

199
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,360
and then take my best guess.

200
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,000
We need to know like how good you are

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,400
in sort of knowing Disney in general.

202
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,480
That's really more what we're testing versus actually

203
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,120
knowing the fine print of the Magic Key.

204
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,800
Why do you need to know anything about me?

205
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,720
You know, that's just what the college board says.

206
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,400
It's good to have testing once in a while for each other.

207
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,200
I mean, I think we should be testing each other

208
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
periodically over the, you know,

209
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,880
every couple months running drills.

210
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,640
Running drills to know that we're still sort of, yeah,

211
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,880
knowledgeable on top of all of this stuff.

212
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,720
Yeah, so.

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,360
That is at the end of the episode.

214
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,560
The thing is, I think this is required because like,

215
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,920
look, people have, no, because I'm people's like,

216
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,720
friend who likes theme parks,

217
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,160
I have been turned to in a couple of texts

218
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,480
for explanations about this stuff.

219
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,360
And really for the first time in a long time,

220
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,000
I have had to say, I don't fucking know.

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,880
This thing is so confusing to me.

222
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,000
And so when you say like,

223
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,120
how many reservations can you hold?

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,400
And when does that run out?

225
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,720
And when do you get to put a new one in?

226
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,040
I don't know.

227
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,000
Maybe I just haven't put in the time.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
Maybe it's all too annoying to put in the time.

229
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,320
But I would like to think that there are some listeners

230
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,040
out there who are Scott's.

231
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,800
I know this is true because on Twitter,

232
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,040
there were people who said,

233
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,960
I think people were even like,

234
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,480
I don't know if I want to side with Scott.

235
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,760
I'd prefer not to, but I have to admit,

236
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm baffled by all of this.

237
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,080
So I think I am a stand in for, you know,

238
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,800
if not half the audience, then maybe, you know, 4%.

239
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
Yeah.

240
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,640
And just to be clear in case listeners, you know,

241
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,400
kind of are lost,

242
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,840
the Magic Key program is Disneyland's replacement

243
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,120
for the old annual pass holder program,

244
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,120
which they use the pandemic excuse to totally wipe out

245
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,040
and just start from zero with a new annual pass holder program,

246
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,000
which is called Magic Key.

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,320
A reference back, a reference to the coupon

248
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,720
that used to come in A through E ticket books,

249
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,400
the Magic Key coupon could be turned in for any attraction.

250
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,560
It's a reference to what?

251
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Who, this is, no one knows this reference.

252
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,960
You're learning already.

253
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,480
Does anyone know that already?

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,080
I had a feeling it was something like that

255
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,120
because I think Key to the World used to be something

256
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
they would use in Florida.

257
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,480
So I thought it was something like that here.

258
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,880
You can see that you've seen this picture before.

259
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
You've seen this image before.

260
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,360
I don't think I have.

261
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,480
You're showing something that is the style of the E tickets,

262
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,000
the old tickets that you used to use on rides

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,600
when you paid per ride at Disney.

264
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,040
And I recognize that pattern,

265
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,920
but no, I've never seen this big pink key

266
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,720
and it says Magic Key coupon.

267
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,000
Magic Key coupon.

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,560
I did not know this reference.

269
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,080
I'm not gonna pretend I'm some genius.

270
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,920
This is a fresh new old reference to me.

271
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,480
Pull that back up, Jason, real quick.

272
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,320
Sure, yeah.

273
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,080
This is a screenshot of a website

274
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,160
that you pulled that explains what this is.

275
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,840
Yeah, I pulled this screenshot from the Disney tourist blog.

276
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,720
Disney tourist blog and theme park insider

277
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,920
have pretty good explainers about how this program works.

278
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,040
Well, here's what I'm noticing is on a fun note,

279
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,800
the name Magic Key is a nice nod to the past

280
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
with the E on a fun note.

281
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,280
I found one error in the beginning of this paragraph.

282
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,120
This is not a fun note.

283
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
That's commentary from the blog

284
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,640
and they know their audience.

285
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,880
There's a reason they're the first result

286
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
on a lot of searches.

287
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,840
I'll say, Jason, sorry, I cut you off.

288
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Oh, go ahead.

289
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,800
I was just gonna say, yeah,

290
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,720
I will, like a Magic Key coupon is fun to me

291
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,840
because it's like kind of an anything goes,

292
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,560
an anything pass, which sometimes you get,

293
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,440
if you go to guest services and complain

294
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,400
or you have something special,

295
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,960
you get an anything pass essentially.

296
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,920
And that is fun.

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,240
I completely agree.

298
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,720
Using it for the name of the annual passes in general

299
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,520
feels a little less fun to me

300
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,120
because there's a lot of restrictions on annual passes.

301
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,400
It's not some sort of Magic Key to get into Disneyland.

302
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,760
It's like a key that like only works on certain days

303
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,960
and in certain parks before certain times,

304
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,520
as long as you have reservations.

305
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,400
It is not some sort of access everything kind of thing

306
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,040
like this pass is.

307
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,160
In fact, I would say it's the opposite.

308
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,600
I would say it's the ticket offering that most says

309
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,200
we have contempt for our customers they ever offered

310
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
because it's so actively confusing.

311
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,760
I mean, the big takeaways are that they've applied

312
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,160
the old flex pass, which I used to have,

313
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,400
which gave you like a mix of days you could go

314
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,760
if you made a reservation and days that were good to go,

315
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,200
you could just show up.

316
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,280
No pass has good to go anymore.

317
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,800
And Magic Keys, no single day ticket,

318
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,760
no multi-day ticket has good to go.

319
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,400
Everyone has to make reservations.

320
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,640
Yeah, it's a reservation based system.

321
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,240
Now I will say this, I was sounding the alarm

322
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,360
on being very fearful that the pass program was changing

323
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,800
because of a thing Bob Chapek said earlier in the year.

324
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,840
He called it a rewards program.

325
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,160
Oh, that's scary sounding.

326
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
It was a scary sounding thing.

327
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,920
I don't know if they decided against that

328
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,920
because a rewards program is different than a program

329
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
where you can go to the theme park.

330
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,440
Like it's different than annual pass.

331
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,640
I don't know if he misspoke.

332
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,280
I don't know if they had an idea in their head

333
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,040
that they were gonna do a rewards program.

334
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
But I will say this is actually much closer

335
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,400
to the old program than I was expecting.

336
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,040
I was expecting literally like buy five days,

337
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,080
get one half off.

338
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,240
That's like kind of what I thought was gonna happen

339
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,760
other than unless you paid like 10 grand or something.

340
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,200
So I am relieved that even though this is

341
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,680
a little more complicated,

342
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,440
it is closer to what we had before.

343
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,000
Rewards program does seem like the Wendy's app.

344
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
If you buy a few spicy chicken sandwiches,

345
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,360
yeah, we'll toss you another sandwich every now and then.

346
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,280
Yes, the Dunkin' Donuts reward,

347
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,280
which of course they are still making me pay

348
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,800
$10 at a time to use.

349
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
They will not let me use just a transaction.

350
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,840
Ah, yes, it's been years

351
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,520
and you're still concerned about this.

352
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,360
They're still doing it.

353
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,840
But I go enough and I do enjoy the rewards program there.

354
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,000
It gives me a free drink after so many purchases.

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,600
How many are all you guys in?

356
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,680
How many rewards programs do you serve?

357
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,520
Oh my God, too many to count.

358
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,640
I've lost track, especially during the pandemic.

359
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,840
When companies like double their emails,

360
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,640
like I keep having to clear out.

361
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,400
My Gmail keeps getting full.

362
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,960
I keep having to delete stuff.

363
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
They all added it too.

364
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,080
Taco Bell added it in the last year.

365
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,000
McDonald's just added it in the last couple months.

366
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,560
Everyone now has a full rewards program

367
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,600
where you can redeem stuff.

368
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Wendy's has it.

369
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,080
Wendy's had it longer, I think.

370
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,480
Wendy's has had it for a little while.

371
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,800
Wendy's and Burger King, probably the best right now

372
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
in terms of giving you garbage, giving you free garbage.

373
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,200
Yeah, for sure.

374
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,480
So no, there's too many to count

375
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,760
as far as rewards programs.

376
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,280
But this is not a rewards program, as far as I can see,

377
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,200
unless that's in the fine print and Jason found it.

378
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,240
No, not really a rewards program.

379
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,760
Some of the levels, kind of a lateral move,

380
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,360
some kind of scaled back in prices.

381
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,360
A lot of these are like the Enchant key is almost one to one

382
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,360
for the old FlexPass key.

383
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,960
The Imagine key almost one to one for the SoCal Select.

384
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
You've just lost some perks.

385
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
You've lost the ability to just show up

386
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,240
whenever you feel like it.

387
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,640
So yeah, I think that's what Disney lunatics like us,

388
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,680
the one thing we are a little bit upset about is like,

389
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,240
it was really nice to be like,

390
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,800
hey, you wanna go down tonight for dinner or something?

391
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,080
And then come back, that seems to be gone,

392
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,000
unless you can make a reservation same day,

393
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
and maybe if it's not busy.

394
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,360
We have yet to see how that will work.

395
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,400
But that's maybe the only thing.

396
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,920
I understand that that is better for COVID,

397
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,320
and it is better for tracking the amount of employees

398
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,640
to bring on in a day.

399
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,240
We're expecting it to be this busy,

400
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
so we need this amount of people, functionally better.

401
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,120
Yes, as an audience member, it's the greatest thing

402
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,880
to wake up, not know you're gonna be at Disneyland,

403
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,920
and then be suddenly in the thick of it,

404
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,360
having a great time at Disneyland.

405
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,520
I saw a tweet or two that were a little judgy

406
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,040
about people losing this ability.

407
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,320
Does it really take that much to plan in advance?

408
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,600
And like, no, it doesn't.

409
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,680
However, what I described, starting a day,

410
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,400
not knowing Disneyland's in the day,

411
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,000
and then it ends up in the day, is the greatest thing.

412
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,880
It's the ticket to some of the greatest days.

413
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,040
Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,760
It's a bummer, and I do hope it comes back,

415
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,360
especially post, however many fucking variants are left.

416
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,320
There's many left.

417
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
I think it's dead, though.

418
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,920
I think going in is dead, unfortunately,

419
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,760
at whatever you want.

420
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,600
Yeah.

421
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Forever? Why would it have to be forever?

422
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,440
I think it's forever.

423
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
I think they like this managing,

424
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,480
because they can manage the park much better now,

425
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,040
as far as crowds.

426
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,560
I think, unless it's really low traffic days,

427
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
maybe eventually they'll let it happen.

428
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,240
But I think they really like knowing

429
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,120
how many people are coming on average,

430
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,520
to know how to staff,

431
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,960
to know how to move people around in the parks.

432
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,400
I just have a feeling that it's never coming back,

433
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,680
but I hope I am wrong.

434
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,800
Yeah, they had already kind of been doing this a lot

435
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,840
in Florida.

436
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,160
And that, I mean, Florida, they need it less,

437
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,560
because they have so many parks and hotels and stuff

438
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,200
to just eat up crowds.

439
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,120
Everything is getting a little bit,

440
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,400
and I'm not mad about the,

441
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,240
I mean, I am mad about not being able to go in and stuff,

442
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,440
but everything is going a little more of the way of,

443
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,720
we wanna, if you could, could you plan everything out

444
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
down to the T, which I do not like.

445
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,840
Even virtual queues, which I like in general,

446
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,880
it feels like they're working on a thing for Florida,

447
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
or I think both parks, what's it called, like Genie, Jason?

448
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,120
Do you remember this?

449
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,400
Yeah, so Genie is sort of like,

450
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,960
I think it's AI, maybe even machine learning based.

451
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,880
It's like a program, it's an app that'll tell you,

452
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
like, you're looking for something to do right now?

453
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,560
Here's what's really empty,

454
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,640
or here's what a restaurant with no wait.

455
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
But Genie will like program your fast passes for you.

456
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,880
Like, they really would like to get people

457
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
on a rigid schedule, which is not how the three of us like

458
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,360
to do this, unless it's a very long,

459
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
like somebody's coming in town, you're going with them,

460
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,200
or we're doing a full 14 hour day with family or something.

461
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,320
If not even Mike likes this,

462
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,080
because you do like planning and checking and precision,

463
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,960
but if you're saying like, yeah, you don't, like,

464
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,920
yeah, I think freedom of, and figuring out your day,

465
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,520
it's a nightmare to me, this whole thing of like,

466
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,320
when you go to Disney World,

467
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,640
make sure that 60 days in advance you're booking,

468
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,400
that sucks, I hate it, I want that.

469
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,920
Anyone who's excited about that, I do not understand.

470
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,840
Yeah, I like, because being in a place

471
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,640
where you can like improvise,

472
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,400
and I don't know what the day is in store,

473
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,400
and not like, well, we better, we gotta be over here

474
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
by 3.15 or else.

475
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,760
Yeah, and fast, we don't even know necessarily

476
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,360
what the future of Max Pass or Fast Pass is at this moment.

477
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,240
There are signs from other parks, which are not good signs,

478
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,240
are scary signs of like per, like, a la carte fast passes,

479
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,920
where depending on how busy a ride is,

480
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,000
just like Scott, you learned with Orlando's

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,120
full express pass system, there might be a situation

482
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,960
where Toy Story Minimomania is like way crowded,

483
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,320
and you have to pay $20 per person to skip the line.

484
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,920
Because that's kind of what- I would welcome $20,

485
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,040
that Universal situation, that like, again,

486
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,960
how are people so mad at the park in Paris

487
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,160
that they aren't even at, when here in our country,

488
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,440
in the state of Florida, Universal is charging

489
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,880
an ungodly amount to, you know,

490
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,360
I feel like you break that down,

491
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,240
it's like potentially like $40 a ride.

492
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Well-

493
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,960
Vexed 12 grown adults, a bunch of fathers,

494
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,480
didn't understand what they were buying.

495
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,640
That's insanity.

496
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,560
So let's point the finger at Universal

497
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,760
before we start getting mad at Disney.

498
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,400
Sure, that's true.

499
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,720
But yeah, Disney, I think is headed into,

500
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,960
hopefully not as severe of a system as that,

501
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,720
but I think we're getting close to that.

502
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
And yes, the spontaneity, the fun of all of that,

503
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,320
I think they would like that to go away.

504
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,960
I don't think they can fully push that off the cliff,

505
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm hoping, fingers crossed.

506
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,920
Yeah, Jim and Len had been talking about this

507
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,240
on recent episodes where like,

508
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,840
there are signs that they're dusting off the FastPass,

509
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,480
like queues and stations and stuff in Florida.

510
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,480
And all of the like guest comments are, you know,

511
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,760
Disney tracks that data meticulously.

512
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,880
And it doesn't seem like it's pointing to Florida

513
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,160
getting like paid, you know, a la carte FastPasses

514
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,000
because people have been coming down there, you know,

515
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
for decades now doing the FastPass system

516
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,280
when it was set at the price of free

517
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,640
and suddenly pivoting from going to free

518
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,520
to cost a lot of money will piss people off

519
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,200
who are already annoyed that they're not available

520
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,440
at all at the moment, you know.

521
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,840
So I hope there'll be enough pushback on some of this stuff.

522
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,880
I loved MaxPass, I mean, that gave me a new thrill

523
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
as far as Disneyland was concerned,

524
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,800
getting to pull FastPasses and if they were ready,

525
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,880
like on 9 p.m., I could, you know, frantically

526
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
keep refreshing for 20 minutes and pull something

527
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,280
within the next 10.

528
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,880
The biggest people you aren't even with,

529
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,400
you're doing it from your apartment.

530
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,680
I've done it for my apartment, yeah,

531
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,640
I can do it anywhere, it doesn't matter.

532
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
A little easier sell, 10 or 15 bucks extra a day,

533
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,560
then you just do the FastPass on your phone.

534
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,440
Oh yeah. That's one sentence,

535
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,720
that's an easy. If you're doing a full day

536
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,920
no brainer to do that. No brainer, yeah.

537
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,840
Yeah, it's well worth it.

538
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,760
Florida's has been kind of weird,

539
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,160
but there is a good trick with Florida

540
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,280
is if you can get all those three FastPasses they give you,

541
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
if you can stack those very early,

542
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,000
then you can surf the thing like MaxPass

543
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,440
the rest of the day, which is very fun.

544
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,760
Yeah.

545
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,400
So we'll see, we don't know exactly

546
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
how that thing is gonna shape out,

547
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,560
cause they're not, I would, I would,

548
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,880
spoiler alert, there's no MaxPass,

549
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,880
FastPass involved in any four of these.

550
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,600
Boy, oh boy. There's no anything,

551
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,880
cause they used to be, yeah,

552
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,600
it used to be in at least the top two passes,

553
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,480
where you'd get MaxPass involved.

554
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,000
It was part of it and not anymore.

555
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,760
Yeah, so MaxPass is gone,

556
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,600
PhotoPass, that was always something that,

557
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
the top passes would have,

558
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,880
I think at least the top passes would have,

559
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,040
where you would get, which was really fun,

560
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,200
cause you'd never get, like if you go to Disney a lot,

561
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,560
I feel like everybody gets out of the habit

562
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,000
of ever buying a photo from a ride,

563
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,720
but you would get a Tower of Terror or a Guardians photo,

564
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,920
and that's fun, it's now I have like years

565
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,760
of like ride photos, which is cool,

566
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,240
cause I had the pass that had it,

567
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,680
but that's gone, that's not in here either.

568
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,800
Yeah, I agree, I missed that.

569
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,600
Yeah, that was the only thing ever getting me

570
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,720
to keep a ride photo.

571
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Yeah, and I have like all these fun ride photos now,

572
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,920
which I never would have bought, like on my own,

573
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,400
so that was kind of a thing that I covertly,

574
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,920
I wouldn't have said that before it started,

575
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,080
like I need that PhotoPass, but now that that's gone too,

576
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm like, oh, I missed the PhotoPass,

577
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,000
that was fun to have.

578
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,640
So yeah, those are gone.

579
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,720
We're losing our perks.

580
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,360
Yeah, some of the perks.

581
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,720
Should we talk about the names of the keys?

582
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,240
I think this might be the biggest thing

583
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,600
Scott was getting upset about.

584
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,400
I think this is 80% of the rage on my part is the names.

585
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,880
It's gobbledygook, it's nonsense.

586
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,760
Okay, I didn't sense that you guys were enthusiastic

587
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,000
about the names.

588
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,840
No.

589
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm not sure anyone is.

590
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,560
There's that pile of words that Disney,

591
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,160
all levels of Disney corporate has approved,

592
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,560
like 20 words, 15 words, they put them in a hat

593
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,040
and they pull the name, the words out of a hat

594
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,440
when they need something real quick

595
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,800
and that kind of seems like what this is.

596
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,760
It's unreal how many, we're already doing,

597
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,040
now magic is in the main thing

598
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,880
and now it's these four others.

599
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,400
And maybe like, I don't know if this is one

600
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
of the quiz questions already, maybe it is,

601
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,800
maybe I'm getting ahead of myself,

602
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,600
but can it's, and I might know it already,

603
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,760
I did just have it in front of me,

604
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,880
but can somebody say the four names, not in order,

605
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,960
not from most expensive to least expensive

606
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,720
and just see if it's possible to figure out

607
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,480
based on the, because this is what drives me insane,

608
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,000
is that there's no, there's no ranking within the words.

609
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,840
Exactly.

610
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,120
It's just a bunch of words.

611
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,960
Right, because before it was,

612
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
Southern California Select, Southern California Pass,

613
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,280
Deluxe, Premium, Premier.

614
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,840
Like there is- Like a car wash.

615
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,240
They kind of tell you something a little bit.

616
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
It's still a little bit confusing,

617
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
but if you sort of know connotations,

618
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
you know that if you see the word platinum

619
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,320
or something or diamond,

620
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,120
that that's gonna be up at the top.

621
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,120
But these, I don't know, somebody say them if you got them.

622
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Yeah, you want them in a random order?

623
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
That's what I'm thinking, yeah.

624
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,120
Okay, Enchant Key, Dream Key,

625
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Believe Key and Imagine Key.

626
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,160
Okay, I think I might know it.

627
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,400
Let me go up.

628
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,480
Okay.

629
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,760
And this is only because I just had it in front of me

630
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,000
and then I blocked it, but Imagine Key is the lowest.

631
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,240
Correct.

632
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,400
Then Enchant Key.

633
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,640
You got it.

634
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,680
Then what's more than Enchant?

635
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,640
Believe Key.

636
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,920
You got it.

637
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,400
And then Dream Key is the most.

638
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,240
That's right.

639
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,200
We're gonna get you a point of extra credit

640
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,040
already on the quiz for that.

641
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,000
All right, I voluntarily did a test.

642
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,760
Now that said, it's stupid.

643
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
It's so stupid and particularly Enchant Key.

644
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,840
Enchant Key is insane.

645
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,280
The other ones I understand.

646
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,400
I know that we're going with verbs basically,

647
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,400
but when is Enchant used without meant after?

648
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
When do you in your life say

649
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,880
that you're going to enchant someone

650
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,440
or that you hope that something enchants you?

651
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,480
This is not like I'm gonna,

652
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,320
I would like to do some enchanting tonight.

653
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,760
It's just not, the word enchant on its own doesn't exist.

654
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,120
No, this is never enchanted, maybe,

655
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,720
but to enchant, this is not, it looks insane.

656
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,880
You don't even know what you're like.

657
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,200
I almost wanna read it as ancient

658
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,760
as if it's like some obscure car part or something.

659
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,520
There's trouble with the ancient.

660
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,360
They said it a lot on the TV show, Loki.

661
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,800
The one character said it an upsetting amount, but.

662
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,160
Oh.

663
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,360
Usually it was kind of in a sinister,

664
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,520
I'm possessing your body and mind fashion.

665
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,360
Yeah, what's that?

666
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,480
Is there an example of a sentence

667
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,680
with an enchant in it without meant?

668
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm hoping, okay, how about this?

669
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I am hoping for a romantic partner

670
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,480
to enchant me tonight with their.

671
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,320
Yeah.

672
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,760
That is a sentence and that makes sense.

673
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,800
And it's weird as hell.

674
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,200
That's the only, you're only using enchant

675
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,720
when it involves romance and a child's idea

676
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,720
of what sex will be like with a bunch of curtains flapping.

677
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,120
And you don't really know what the sex is.

678
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,320
You just know there's bodies.

679
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,360
Something's happening down there.

680
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,800
I'll figure it out someday.

681
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,600
But that's, yes, oh, please enchant me.

682
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,120
Take me away, enchantrix. Enchant.

683
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,960
Crazy.

684
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,760
And it is like, I think it's completely like

685
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,640
weird PG-13 romance is the use of it.

686
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,080
So to see it in this Disney list is really weird.

687
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
I know, I guess it's one of the words

688
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
in its enchanted tiki room,

689
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,640
but something about that pure enchant just weirds me out.

690
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,280
Well, look, you're gonna be enchanted by the ability

691
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,160
to make up to four park reservation holes at a time,

692
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,240
two asterisks, 10% off select merchandise, three asterisks,

693
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,160
and 10% off select food and beverage, also three asterisks.

694
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,560
Yes. Pretty enchanting.

695
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,360
That is very enchanting. Enchant.

696
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,440
Can we try to rationalize,

697
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
and we'll get into the perks and all,

698
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,360
can we try to rationalize,

699
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,840
let me say the ranking again.

700
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,560
Dream is better than believe,

701
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,000
which is better than enchant,

702
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,720
which is better than imagine.

703
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,880
What do you mean?

704
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,160
Why is imagine, a dream and imagine are a world apart?

705
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,320
To imagine is basically shit.

706
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,440
You're in the gutter,

707
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,760
but dream is the ultimate height to try to attain.

708
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,040
What are you talking about?

709
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,120
I'll say my thought, the dream key,

710
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,960
it's dream on motherfucker,

711
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,920
cause it costs $1,399.

712
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,200
Dream on asshole.

713
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,920
Speaking of the bad boys of Boston.

714
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,000
Wow. Yeah.

715
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,640
I think, yes, there's no hierarchy to it.

716
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,320
I mean, it should be like,

717
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,920
the top one should be like achievement,

718
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,280
or like achieved your goal or something,

719
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,520
or like the achieve key.

720
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,560
Came true, come like fulfilled, the fulfill key.

721
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,360
The ever after key.

722
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,280
Ever after, okay, now there you go.

723
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,480
Now you're onto something.

724
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,200
If you start it with the,

725
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,280
you know, the basics of a story, like a fairy tale,

726
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,800
you know, an ever after.

727
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
The wish come true key.

728
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,880
Wish come true key.

729
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,760
Wish the wish come true key.

730
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,000
How is it not wish?

731
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,440
How is wish not on here?

732
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,200
Yeah.

733
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,040
Maybe because wish is unattainable.

734
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,080
Although imagine.

735
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,920
Is that a boat?

736
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
That's one of their boats.

737
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,600
But not all dreams come true.

738
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,480
Yeah, most of them don't, let's be honest.

739
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,040
Yeah, yeah.

740
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,520
But wishes are even more so,

741
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,480
like wish, maybe that's too like wishful thinking.

742
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,920
It's that's like completely what Jason is saying.

743
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,200
Yeah, and you don't have to wish.

744
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,280
You just need to put down a $179 down payment,

745
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,240
a normal even number,

746
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,240
a number we all know and love, $179.

747
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,880
And then your monthly payments go up

748
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,640
depending on which key you get.

749
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,280
And if you have to live in the state of California

750
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,560
within a certain range of zip codes.

751
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,400
Right.

752
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,000
And it's not even every, oh, really?

753
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,320
Okay, okay.

754
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,760
Southern California residents, not Northern California,

755
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Southern California residents.

756
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,920
Well, hold on a second.

757
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,720
Well, so the imagine, you're kind of right.

758
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,520
So the magic key, the lowest level key

759
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,880
is only for Southern California residents.

760
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,240
Any California resident can do the monthly payment program,

761
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,040
but only people who live in California

762
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,680
can do the monthly payment program.

763
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,600
Oh, so anyone else, if you're coming in from Ohio,

764
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,080
you can get a dream key, but it's, you have to pay,

765
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,800
it's all at the top.

766
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,640
It's all at the top.

767
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,560
Yes, so I think that's how they're limiting

768
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,960
the installment.

769
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,080
They don't want to send their goons to Colorado

770
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,920
to get the money.

771
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,080
It's basically what it is.

772
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,320
California, that's close by,

773
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,280
but if they got to go send some goons to Colorado to collect,

774
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,800
then that's not cost effective for them.

775
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,600
Yeah, so I don't, I mean, part of this is

776
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,200
they're looking for people,

777
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
they want people to come to the parks.

778
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,360
They always want people to come to the parks,

779
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,640
but they want people who will spend money

780
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,640
and be engaged in their, you know, coming to the parks.

781
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,480
They also would like guests to do,

782
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,560
help them out a little with the work of like metrics

783
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,040
and crowd numbers.

784
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,280
And that kind of sucks that they're putting

785
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,920
a little bit of this work of this, you know.

786
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,760
Do you mean with reservations?

787
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,600
Is that what you're saying?

788
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,800
Yeah, with reservations and like think about,

789
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,720
like really think about what day you're coming, you know.

790
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,760
Really think about what day you

791
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
and how many in your party are coming.

792
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,360
Here's what I'll say.

793
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,560
If we do this reservation thing

794
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,800
and we know all the COVID stuff is gone

795
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,600
and fingers crossed in a year,

796
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,760
we're enjoying the parks in a similar way

797
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,240
to the way we have.

798
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,880
If the park is pretty like,

799
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
it's less crowded, it's more spaced out,

800
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,760
I will begrudgingly say, okay,

801
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,640
the reservation system, fine.

802
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,800
It's working.

803
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,520
It's making this much more pleasant

804
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,280
because sometimes you would go down

805
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,800
and the park would be jammed.

806
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,400
Like just like, especially New Orleans Square,

807
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,560
that would always be where it would be.

808
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,320
It's like an insane sea of people.

809
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,800
If this thing works and it is able to make

810
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,040
that whole experience much more manageable

811
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,920
and seem like cool and fun,

812
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,800
like make the day a little bit better or breezier,

813
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,480
then I will say, all right, fine.

814
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,600
That worked.

815
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,440
I'm not so bothered.

816
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,800
But if we're doing reservations,

817
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,920
it's a big pain in the ass.

818
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,240
And then we go down and it's just as jammed it

819
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,160
as it always was, then this sucks.

820
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Then I'm not as happy about it.

821
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,800
Yeah.

822
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,080
When I had the FlexPass,

823
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,440
I never had a problem making a reservation.

824
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,000
I think I can remember if I used it

825
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,760
for opening day, Galaxy's Edge,

826
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,360
or I switched it over right after that.

827
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,960
I never had a problem making reservation.

828
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,800
I think some people,

829
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
a lot of the speculation I saw is people going like,

830
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,800
maybe get these keys, get your key in the first month or so

831
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,960
because as more and more people get used to it

832
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,520
and more and more people sign up,

833
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,280
the reservations might be harder to get.

834
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,920
But there's still a lot of questions about like,

835
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,280
how many reservations are they going to make available?

836
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,400
How many of any level of pass

837
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,440
are they going to sell?

838
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,640
I did see something confirming that like,

839
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,640
the pool for reservations for single day

840
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,920
and multi-day tickets is different

841
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,120
than the pool of reservations for the keys.

842
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,600
How did any of you look up any of this

843
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,120
and not lose your fucking mind?

844
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,760
How did you not just like fall asleep,

845
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,600
need to like take a big shot of whiskey to keep going?

846
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,560
Or just look outside, go do anything else but this?

847
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,360
Jason and I both do really enjoy on some level

848
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,600
looking through the fine print of,

849
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,920
whether it's a new like food event

850
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,960
or a new like Disney announcement,

851
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,840
or yes, it's a pass system.

852
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Jason, I did actually not, did not know that with,

853
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,640
I don't know where Jason found that information.

854
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,480
I'm trusting him.

855
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,120
Again, he's the penny here.

856
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm the inspector gadget.

857
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,960
I'll get the credit, but he did the work.

858
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,120
But yeah, yeah.

859
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,840
I just start to,

860
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,560
I turn into Homer with like turkey in the straw

861
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,400
in his head.

862
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,480
I like, I can't do it.

863
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,840
I cannot focus on these ins and outs.

864
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,680
Well, I know.

865
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,720
I mean, it's happened when I just was,

866
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,440
I was lightly explaining to you what the Disney,

867
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,280
what the hotel or the, what's it called?

868
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,720
The club, vacation club is.

869
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,560
And I wasn't trying to,

870
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,400
Oh my God, I can't.

871
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,240
And I wasn't trying to even tell you to,

872
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,160
I wasn't like, you know, you gotta do the vacation club.

873
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,000
I was just saying, well, the video's like,

874
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,680
and you're like, well, why would I wanna do that?

875
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,520
And I go, I wasn't telling you to do it.

876
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,780
I was just telling you what it was.

877
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,080
But like, I just gave you some dry facts

878
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,480
about a Disney program.

879
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,960
And you're just like,

880
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
there's something in your brain that's just like,

881
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,120
get it out.

882
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,960
You're like,

883
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,800
I think so.

884
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,640
No.

885
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,600
There's like, you have antibodies that attack.

886
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,880
It won't allow, I can't get past, yeah.

887
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,080
If there's too much of a fine print load,

888
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,520
then my antibodies in my ears work

889
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,720
to fight the information away.

890
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,400
You have sterilizing immunity when it comes to fine print

891
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,040
in as far as a Disney program is concerned.

892
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,920
I just, you know, like,

893
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,200
I'm one of the hosts of this podcast,

894
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,880
but this all teaches me so much.

895
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,040
I like going on a ride and saying, we,

896
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,240
and I don't like all of this.

897
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,880
This all is such a,

898
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,600
I think this all is the worst part about being

899
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,760
into this stuff.

900
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,920
I love logistics.

901
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,480
I love like how cities are managed,

902
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,880
how like the wisdom of crowds.

903
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,240
I did a lot of sociology classes in college.

904
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,360
Like, this is extremely my shit.

905
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,040
You love to read.

906
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
You found some stuff I did not find.

907
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,680
Crowd flow is your shit.

908
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,760
You love crowd flow.

909
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,720
The combination of dry statistics and

910
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,280
hip hop terminology.

911
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,120
That's like a cool,

912
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,160
that is the thing a cool teacher would say.

913
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,400
That is a thing a cool teacher would say,

914
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,240
and no one's cool there.

915
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,920
He would turn the chair around and he'd say that, yeah.

916
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,800
That assistant professor Jason.

917
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,280
If I'm being a student,

918
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,840
I'm not being a very well-behaved student.

919
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,120
I'm arguing instead of,

920
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,840
this is like when all the kids in the choir

921
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,400
in Sister Act back in the habit fought Whoopi Goldberg

922
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
instead of realizing that maybe if we focus,

923
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,680
we can be the freshest choir that ever existed.

924
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,160
So let me, how about,

925
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,440
let's engage with the professors and let me ask,

926
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,800
holding reservations, is this me?

927
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,920
Is this for other people?

928
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,560
This is vexing me.

929
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay, here's what I assume,

930
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,480
because there are still some questions

931
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,000
about this reservation system.

932
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,320
Every different level gives you

933
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,600
a different amount of park reservations.

934
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,960
And the way I understand it,

935
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,640
so say it's Imagine Key, the lowest key,

936
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,520
the shittiest key of all the keys.

937
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,360
The Imagine Key.

938
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,200
It's fucking Imagineers.

939
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,600
Imagine Key is just gross.

940
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,280
It's a gross key, if you ask me.

941
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,120
No Saturdays.

942
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,960
No Saturdays.

943
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,800
No one Saturday.

944
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
There's very few in a chant key as well,

945
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,720
but there are some at least on off-season.

946
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,880
There's 11 Saturdays on the chant key.

947
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,320
Yeah, but imagine, okay,

948
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,760
so Imagine Key, it says you can make two park reservations.

949
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
The way I understand it is two park reservations

950
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,840
per one pass.

951
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,880
So you, Scott, can say,

952
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,760
I think I'm going to go next weekend.

953
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,640
You get one for that,

954
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,200
and I'd like to go the following weekend.

955
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,960
By the way, you couldn't do it,

956
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
because it's Imagine Key.

957
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,120
So you would say, I wanna go on a Wednesday

958
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,440
and then off-season.

959
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,720
So you'd make that reservation,

960
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,200
and you'd say, I wanna go that following Wednesday,

961
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,040
and then you could do that.

962
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,080
And you'd have two reservations there,

963
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,000
and then those two would be the only ones

964
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,760
you could make until you either cancel one of those

965
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,240
or went on the day,

966
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,800
and then I think you could make another.

967
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,240
Jason, am I correct with this?

968
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,640
Yes, so if you, once you pass through a turnstile,

969
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,880
once you claim one of those reservations,

970
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,200
you can immediately then make another reservation.

971
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,480
Or if you cancel the day before,

972
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,520
you have an open slot again.

973
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,960
If you no show,

974
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,120
careful, careful.

975
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,720
You will be penalized

976
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,360
if you no show. If you no show.

977
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,960
I was told about this.

978
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,440
There's a punishment.

979
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,320
You're punished by this program.

980
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,160
That's right, Scott.

981
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,520
If you don't use the reservation.

982
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,480
That's right, because nothing says resort,

983
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
quality amenities,

984
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,920
like being punished for doing a no-no.

985
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,080
Ta-na-na-ta-ta-ta.

986
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,080
If my, I forgot to pay my car lease,

987
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm getting a car on three strikes, no, no, no.

988
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,640
Can Disney actively hurt your credit score

989
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,400
if you don't?

990
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,520
Can they like harm your ability to rent a nice apartment

991
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,160
or buy a nice house?

992
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,080
Well, if you stop paying for your monthly payments,

993
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,360
I think they could penalize you

994
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,880
because it is essentially a no interest alone.

995
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,920
For the no show, the restrictions are,

996
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,840
if you just don't show up for three reservations

997
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,560
within a 90 day window,

998
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,040
you're gonna be locked out

999
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,760
from making any reservations for 30 days.

1000
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,600
That's right.

1001
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,360
It takes three, it's a three strikes policy.

1002
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,000
It is a three strikes policy, yes.

1003
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,880
And it's not three strikes, you're out,

1004
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,000
it's three strikes, you're out for a month.

1005
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,440
You're in a time out for a month.

1006
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,920
You're in a time out for a month.

1007
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,640
I guess that's not the worst punishment.

1008
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,560
I can't imagine doing that three times.

1009
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,320
I guess it sort of makes sense.

1010
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,440
As silly as it is that a punishment is anywhere within

1011
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,040
something called the Magic Key program.

1012
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,240
Jason, when can you cancel?

1013
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,560
Do we know?

1014
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,640
You can cancel at any time up to the day before.

1015
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,240
You can even cancel the day before you have the first one.

1016
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,840
So like 11.59 PM the day before.

1017
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,440
I think that's right.

1018
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,480
Either 11.59 AM or PM.

1019
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,640
I don't have it in front of me.

1020
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,480
It might be PM.

1021
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,560
I would think it would be PM if it's the day before,

1022
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,240
but maybe not, maybe they want it earlier.

1023
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,080
I don't know.

1024
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,560
We'll have to look into it.

1025
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,480
I don't mind that.

1026
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,640
We're not so far away from,

1027
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,040
it's not spur of the moment,

1028
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,040
but you're not locked in.

1029
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,960
They're not monetarily paying,

1030
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,640
they're not like, you're not paying fines to Disney.

1031
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,480
Yeah, that's true.

1032
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,960
They're not, you're not going to Disney jail.

1033
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,000
Bob Chapek is not calling like your family

1034
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,640
and complaining about you or anything

1035
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,680
or telling your mom and dad what you did.

1036
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Forcing me to say pro Disney propaganda on television

1037
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
at knife point.

1038
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,240
Now they haven't said like maybe if you get like

1039
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,680
three timeouts in a year, what happens?

1040
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,800
We could test that.

1041
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,000
We should really be testing that,

1042
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,640
like getting a pass and then just

1043
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,040
no showing constantly for a year.

1044
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,080
Well, could we make up a false person

1045
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,520
so that none of this is on us?

1046
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,840
We use some of the Patreon funds

1047
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,800
to create a fourth host, a bad boy,

1048
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,120
the baddest boy who fails to show up

1049
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,440
for any of his assigned days.

1050
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,920
His name is Alan Smithy.

1051
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,320
He's made some of the worst movies of all time.

1052
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,120
Uh, I was just going to say,

1053
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,000
just use the same name as Nick Mundy.

1054
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,400
All right, great.

1055
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,520
So if Nick Mundy, who first of all lies

1056
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,760
about his residency.

1057
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,600
Yes.

1058
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,920
And then fails to show up three, yeah.

1059
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,560
Like, okay, so we do three no shit.

1060
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,360
It would have to get up to four

1061
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,480
for us to see what the real punishments are.

1062
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,320
Yeah, exactly.

1063
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,400
So then see that.

1064
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,720
Then in three years,

1065
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,680
because we're talking about this behind the paywall,

1066
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,280
Mundy doesn't know what we're talking about.

1067
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,320
This episode would have lost Mundy within 40 seconds.

1068
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,640
You'd be so mad, you'd be furious, yeah.

1069
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1070
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,880
So deep, deep in this episode

1071
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,800
that'd be unlistenable to Nick Mundy,

1072
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,720
he would not know that he's like,

1073
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,560
basically what I'm saying is in four years,

1074
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,880
he tries to take his daughter to Disney Land

1075
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,760
and it's stopped at the gate

1076
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,960
because of something we did years ago.

1077
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,600
And put in handcuffs.

1078
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,880
Put in handcuffs and dragged to Disney jail.

1079
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,160
With a representative from Experian Credit Reporting.

1080
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,280
He has to now fight for the custody

1081
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,520
against Donald Duck.

1082
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,400
And then they bring in Tweedledee and Tweedledum

1083
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,400
from the Mad Tea Party,

1084
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,920
those two guys that were walking around

1085
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,880
to try to rough them up a little bit.

1086
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,680
Meet your cellmates.

1087
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,560
Like with Danny Ocean in Ocean's Eleven

1088
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,720
when they brought that big guy in.

1089
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,680
Although Danny Ocean had that guy on the payroll,

1090
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,920
so it was okay.

1091
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,680
So yeah, we'll do that.

1092
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,000
We have to test, we do have to test these systems.

1093
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,360
When the systems go live, we will be testing them.

1094
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,200
I don't know that we'll all get the same pass level.

1095
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,280
We'll be seeing exactly what's going on.

1096
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,480
We'll obviously update as we go.

1097
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,480
And as someone who rode the last boat of the night

1098
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,080
from the Boardwalk Hotel to Disney's Hollywood Studios

1099
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,880
to catch the last bus out of there,

1100
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,400
you know I'm gonna be love testing these.

1101
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,720
I'm gonna be love testing these.

1102
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,200
I'm gonna be love testing these.

1103
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,560
Did you call it love testing?

1104
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,560
I'm gonna be love testing them.

1105
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,480
Well yeah, and love, you have to take a love test

1106
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,520
to get a Dream Key.

1107
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,200
Scott, I'm sorry, do you know,

1108
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,800
Scott do you know how to become a charter member

1109
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,920
of the Dream Key program by the way?

1110
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,400
No.

1111
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,040
What's that?

1112
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,880
All right, so.

1113
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,040
Charter, that doesn't fit within the theme.

1114
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,280
Well, key holders, Scott.

1115
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,840
To become a charter member, you have to,

1116
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,240
charter members become magic key holders

1117
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,320
within the first 66 days of the program.

1118
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,040
To celebrate the 66th.

1119
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,600
So you're a charter member if you're doing it for,

1120
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,480
like we could all be charter members.

1121
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,040
That's right, celebrating 66 years of the Disneyland Resort.

1122
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,640
Who is thinking about it being 66 years?

1123
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,720
If it's not like a round number.

1124
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,080
We all know 66 is looming large this year.

1125
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,240
Oh boy, happy 66.

1126
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,680
Just devil, the devil is thinking of it.

1127
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,040
The devil himself, well there's an extra six.

1128
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,760
He wants an extra six please.

1129
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,600
It's quiet.

1130
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,480
Shhh, Disney sicko's at it again.

1131
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,160
You get stuff too if you're a charter member.

1132
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,880
You get a little like package.

1133
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,240
Which is. What's in it?

1134
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,960
Okay, you get a premium branded pin, normal phrase.

1135
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,200
Celebratory button, magnet, and more.

1136
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,560
And more, it means you get an envelope

1137
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,720
that holds all of those things.

1138
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,520
And a handy pin and badge holder.

1139
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,360
Also, magic key holders, this is off the Disney Parks blog.

1140
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,920
Magic key holders who enter Disneyland Park

1141
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,760
will also be celebrated with access

1142
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,760
to a limited time experience at Stargate in Tomorrowland,

1143
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,720
which begins September 1st,

1144
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,120
where they can enjoy charging stations,

1145
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,640
a special photo opportunity, and fun surprises.

1146
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,520
You get to charge your phone.

1147
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,360
That's right.

1148
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,520
Is your reward for doing this quickly?

1149
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,040
Correct, yes. That's right.

1150
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,200
Bring your own cable and power brick, I would say.

1151
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,360
Cause I think it's just USB outlets or wall plugs.

1152
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,840
I would imagine.

1153
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,560
Boy, the charter program seems like

1154
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,200
it's too good to be true.

1155
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,320
I'd better rush down as soon as I can.

1156
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,760
Starting August 25th, if I'm not a member

1157
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,920
of the charter program, I will feel like a fool.

1158
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,880
Scott, I will also say there's another thing

1159
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,920
that will happen when you're a magic key holder.

1160
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,920
Your beloved Alfresco tasting terrace is being re-imagined

1161
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,600
as the magic key terrace.

1162
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,640
The Alfresco, what was it called even?

1163
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,200
I love it and I don't know the name.

1164
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,320
The Alfresco tasting terrace.

1165
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,320
The Alfresco tasting terrace is now the magic key terrace.

1166
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,200
That's right.

1167
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,360
Oh, magic key terrace.

1168
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,720
I mean, I love it up there and whatever I have to do

1169
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,800
to get back up there.

1170
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,320
I can't remember however many keys I have to get.

1171
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,320
And how many, I just, as soon as that,

1172
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,440
I don't have to be a charter.

1173
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,560
Maybe I'll try to be a charter just in case.

1174
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,120
For a charter member, they really should give you

1175
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,360
a rusty key on a big key ring,

1176
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,880
like what the pirate's dog has in its mouth.

1177
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,520
That would be fun, wouldn't it?

1178
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,240
That would be better.

1179
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,480
You gotta wear it around your neck to get into the park?

1180
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
Yeah, and then when you go to the magic key terrace,

1181
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,520
there's a door and you have to put it in and turn it

1182
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,480
like it's an old time key.

1183
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,320
That would be fun.

1184
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,920
I think a lot of this whole conjuring up keys,

1185
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,760
I think there's a real magic to old keys,

1186
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,160
but to some thing that's in your wallet, not magical.

1187
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,360
Or on your phone. You're right.

1188
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,520
I want a big brass key.

1189
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,840
Yeah, they should at least for the charter members.

1190
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,600
I mean, I think we're probably all gonna be

1191
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,360
charter members, I'm guessing.

1192
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,120
Oh, I think so, yeah.

1193
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,960
So we should all get like a big rusty old key.

1194
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,520
But maybe, you know what, let's, you know what I'll do?

1195
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,720
I'm gonna find three rusty old keys for us

1196
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,400
and we'll carry them around as charter members

1197
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,760
just so we kind of know like we were one of the first.

1198
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,160
You know, so we'll always get that.

1199
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,880
That's gonna get us sent to Disney jail.

1200
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,800
Some guys are trying to bring some kind of rusty weapon

1201
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,640
in here.

1202
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,960
I think that's possibly true.

1203
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,040
I think though it'll kind of finally differentiate us

1204
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,480
from some of the other Disneyland gangs

1205
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,360
and assert kind of our dominance there finally.

1206
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,960
We've talked about starting our own for a long time,

1207
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,240
but I think these rusty keys will be the start of something

1208
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,960
very special.

1209
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,800
I think that-

1210
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,200
Rusty charters.

1211
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,400
The rusty charters, it's, I was gonna say it's

1212
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,440
an enchanted idea, but I was trying to use just enchant

1213
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,360
without the ED and I can't.

1214
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,960
I've been trying by the way for the last 10 minutes

1215
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,680
to try to slip in enchant somewhere and it's really hard.

1216
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,480
Yeah, it's not a word that anyone uses.

1217
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
I'm gonna do it by the end of this podcast

1218
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,160
and it's gonna make sense.

1219
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,880
The rusty charters are here and ready to enchant.

1220
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,720
There it is.

1221
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,560
Pretty good.

1222
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,680
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1223
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,960
That's our catchphrase now.

1224
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,400
Yeah, we all walk into the park and then say that in unison.

1225
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,480
And then we punch out the nearest jean jacket wearing

1226
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,480
like, you know, dune buggy boys, like remember we see.

1227
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,520
Scott, there's other perks that you don't even

1228
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,960
probably know about yet.

1229
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,400
I don't, tell me the perks.

1230
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,840
Wait, there's more?

1231
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,520
There's more, that's right.

1232
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,360
Magic Key Holder Month, a whole month celebrating magic.

1233
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,200
Holder month.

1234
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,040
Magic Key Holder Month.

1235
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,160
We're excited to announce it's Holder Month.

1236
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,440
That's right.

1237
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,000
Magic Key Embroidery, special, you know,

1238
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
embroidery options just for Magic Key holders.

1239
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,480
Embroider, like what do you mean?

1240
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,000
I bring in a shirt and they put something in it?

1241
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,840
They make it rusty charters?

1242
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,520
Like you can buy mouse ears, they'll embroider your name

1243
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,400
on the back or something, you know.

1244
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,960
I'll put it this way, it's very unclear

1245
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,600
what they mean by embroidery.

1246
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,120
It's very, they're not saying, they're not saying

1247
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,920
if you like, they'll like use a special color for you,

1248
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,120
but you have to pay for it.

1249
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,600
As far as I saw, I'm not really clear on exactly

1250
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,160
what they mean by embroidery.

1251
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,160
Yeah, I'm not either.

1252
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,000
Or like the Magic Key Photo Pass opportunities,

1253
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,640
like different, you know, special photos.

1254
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,960
Sell us the rusty keys for God's sake.

1255
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,800
I don't, there's no mention of keys.

1256
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,960
Yeah, give us some rusty keys.

1257
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,280
We're embroidering a special barcode into your wrist.

1258
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,480
That way we can track everything

1259
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,440
that our most beloved holders do.

1260
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,960
We are, the three of us will become beloved holders.

1261
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,640
I mean, we were beloved holders before.

1262
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,440
We're gonna be the most beloved charter holders.

1263
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,440
Yeah, and you know, once we purchase Magic Key Passes

1264
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,200
in order to unlock visits, we're gonna be pretty,

1265
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,760
you know, charter holders.

1266
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,120
You're telling me you still call them Magic Key Pass,

1267
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,080
it's still, we've gone all the way, we're not,

1268
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,560
no, it's not an annual pass.

1269
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,440
It's not, it's a Magic Key.

1270
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,080
And with your Magic Key Pass,

1271
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,440
what pass is still in there?

1272
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,240
You don't call it, so you don't call it a Magic Key,

1273
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,520
it's a Magic Key Pass.

1274
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,880
It's a Magic Key Pass, and in the fine print,

1275
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,560
they're still saying pass holders.

1276
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,840
They haven't adjusted the language in some of the fine print

1277
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,040
to reflect the new Magic Key, so it is confusing still,

1278
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,800
because they are still using pass a lot.

1279
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,080
Yeah, I saw multiple people going like,

1280
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,920
are they gonna stick with this language?

1281
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,320
Everyone's just gonna call it annual passes.

1282
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,440
They've been calling it annual passes for decades now.

1283
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,320
This is the fine print language on how to purchase

1284
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,640
a Magic Key Pass from the parks block.

1285
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,760
Starting August 25th, 2021, parentheses,

1286
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,240
no earlier than 10 a.m. Pacific time,

1287
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,000
guests will be able to purchase

1288
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,920
their preferred Magic Key Pass type,

1289
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,920
their first opportunity to quote,

1290
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,200
to unlock a visit to Disneyland Park

1291
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,120
or Disney California Adventure Park

1292
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,280
with a theme park reservation will be that same day.

1293
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,400
Okay, so.

1294
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,280
So, you do it at 10, and then now you're late.

1295
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,400
That's not very early.

1296
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,280
So, you do it at 10, can you do it at 10 online,

1297
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,600
and then immediately make a reservation?

1298
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,600
I'm not sure if you can then turn around

1299
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,040
and make a reservation to go that same day,

1300
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,960
because I'm also not confident that they get processed

1301
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,880
that many purchases and that many reservations

1302
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,680
in one day back to back.

1303
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,240
If their infrastructure cannot handle a few thousand people

1304
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,480
buying like Halloween party tickets,

1305
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,200
or it's designed not to handle that

1306
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,800
to artificially inflate demand.

1307
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,440
Oh, conspiracy theory here.

1308
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,160
Conspiracy theory, it's also the reality of

1309
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,360
they hire a lot of contractors to build websites,

1310
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,160
let them all go when the project is done,

1311
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,200
and then just let it chug along

1312
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,680
at whatever speed it'll go at.

1313
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,440
One intern figure out a problem

1314
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,880
when the whole thing crashes.

1315
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,200
Yeah.

1316
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,520
That's interesting, I mean, we'll see.

1317
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,200
I mean, as we get closer, you would think

1318
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,720
that they would allow you to pre-purchase it before online,

1319
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,680
but I don't know, I'm not sure

1320
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,000
what they will have the keys, the future holders do.

1321
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,040
I guess all those holders are gonna have to wait

1322
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,600
until August 25th at 10 a.m. to find out.

1323
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,640
I'm looking out my window where we were recording this

1324
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,280
and my son is out there playing and learning,

1325
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,280
enjoying the daylight, and there's a wall between us,

1326
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,040
like a prison wall.

1327
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,960
He's saying words, new words, fresh words.

1328
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,400
Enchant, imagine.

1329
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,360
Enchant, enchant me.

1330
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,720
Pass holder type.

1331
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,840
Daddy, will I be a holder one day?

1332
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,920
Will I be a charter holder?

1333
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
Well, no, son, you're too young.

1334
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,200
No.

1335
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,280
I will never forget those charter days with you,

1336
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,240
when I was charter holding you for the first time.

1337
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,600
The first 66 days of having a precious little baby.

1338
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,240
A charter father.

1339
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,000
There were so many perks to it.

1340
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,920
Lounges and embroidery and generic embroidery.

1341
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,280
General embroidery.

1342
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,640
At some point, there's gonna have to be a,

1343
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,320
because if we're gonna get through 20 questions,

1344
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,520
what is the timing that makes that not okay?

1345
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,760
We're almost done with the basics of this, I think.

1346
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,120
I'm trying to think, yeah, I mean,

1347
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,440
as you go up the list, the perks,

1348
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,920
it's basically how many reservations at a time

1349
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,520
do you wanna hold, do you wanna go on the weekends,

1350
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,920
and what discounts or parking do you want?

1351
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,480
Because only the top two levels,

1352
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,360
the dream key, the most expensive, includes parking.

1353
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,800
Believe key throws you for a loop

1354
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,320
and gives you half off the bar parking.

1355
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,600
Now that I like, I like that there's something,

1356
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,440
that it's not just all or nothing,

1357
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,800
like a little bit of something ain't so bad.

1358
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,800
So yeah, those are the only,

1359
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,080
the top two give you something

1360
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,840
for as far as parking is concerned.

1361
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,360
They used to have the top two passes

1362
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,960
would give you free parking.

1363
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,240
The parking adds up, because parking is,

1364
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,960
it's not as Seaworld expensive yet,

1365
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,880
I don't think it's $30, but it is like 25.

1366
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,280
It's 25, I think, the last time I was there.

1367
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,120
So that stuff adds up, and then depending on

1368
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,560
how many times you go, because there's about $400

1369
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,920
between the top two passes, is that right?

1370
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,520
400, yeah, yeah.

1371
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,600
Sorry, go back to it.

1372
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,880
So you gotta factor in that $25,

1373
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,280
if you're gonna go 32 times, which is a lot,

1374
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,040
you may as well just get the top pass.

1375
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,160
There's a question I still don't get.

1376
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,880
How do I go with people I know?

1377
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,800
Well, you make a reservation for yourself,

1378
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,880
and then they have to make reservations for their tickets.

1379
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,840
You gotta sync it up.

1380
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,120
Yeah, I think you just have to sync it up

1381
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,000
like the old system, where if they have passes,

1382
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,720
you put them in your phone, but if they have tickets,

1383
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,280
you can just scan their tickets,

1384
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,320
or you get the number and you put it in your phone.

1385
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,760
I don't think it's gonna be that hard,

1386
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,200
because we kinda did the same system

1387
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,840
for when we went the last two times.

1388
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,600
That should be relatively simple,

1389
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,720
although if it's parents, it'll be easier if you do it.

1390
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,840
You just may as well buy them in your app

1391
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,280
if they don't have an annual pass.

1392
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,920
The people who are gonna be most inconvenienced by this

1393
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,480
are less technologically savvy people,

1394
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,800
and older people, if they're not tech savvy,

1395
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,760
of the people who are like, I have an annual pass

1396
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,320
because I like to go to Disneyland with my grandchildren.

1397
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,920
It's like, okay, grandma, so we're gonna get believe keys,

1398
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,640
and now hop on your phone, hop on your jitterbug,

1399
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,440
and you have to make a reservation.

1400
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,080
But I thought I had a ticket.

1401
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,880
Well, okay, tickets are different than reservations.

1402
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,120
And it, so.

1403
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,600
You wanna go on Spider-Man, grandma?

1404
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,760
We gotta get up early,

1405
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,800
because you have to help us pull a virtual queue.

1406
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,280
Can we just get in the queue?

1407
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,520
Can we just stand in line?

1408
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,840
No. Well, no.

1409
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,120
No. No.

1410
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,120
No standby line for Spider-Man, for web.

1411
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,360
Any ride?

1412
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,320
Is that for all the rides?

1413
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,120
That's the way they want it, but not yet.

1414
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,960
Yeah, so.

1415
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,800
That's the way it is.

1416
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,240
Might be headed, grandma, but we'll see.

1417
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,240
Can I cross the Esplanade before 1 p.m. or not?

1418
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,080
No.

1419
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,160
Well, no.

1420
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,000
First off, you've had to make reservations for both parks,

1421
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,440
and then at 1 p.m., you're allowed to park hop.

1422
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,280
Yes. Wait a minute.

1423
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,240
You have to make, wait, I don't think I knew that one.

1424
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,760
I'll break out of the grandma character.

1425
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,600
You have to, so I have to reserve, among my,

1426
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,360
all right, I have six holds in my name,

1427
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,440
in my gun, in my hold gun.

1428
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,560
In my hold chamber, there's six hold bullets.

1429
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,400
Right.

1430
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,920
And I fire one of them at Disneyland for next Wednesday.

1431
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,680
And I fire, do I also have to fire another one

1432
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,680
at California Adventure for next Wednesday?

1433
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,840
Probably best to just make reservations for both.

1434
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,240
I'm assuming.

1435
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,520
Why should I lose two for, that's what?

1436
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,360
Oh no, no.

1437
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,200
No, no, I don't think you have to do that.

1438
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,000
No, no, that's not it.

1439
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,200
No, it's not the reservation.

1440
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,040
So I only lose one bullet.

1441
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,440
Yeah, you only lose one bullet.

1442
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,360
It seems like, remember when we were buying tickets

1443
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,720
to go down to the Marvel, there was a lot of days

1444
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,800
where it's like, okay, you can start at Disney,

1445
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,040
you can't start at Disneyland,

1446
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,600
you can start at California Adventure.

1447
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,880
I think the only concern might be,

1448
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,040
and we'll see as the reservations come online,

1449
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,960
is if there's maybe like,

1450
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,320
and I guess you're saying it's a different pool,

1451
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,160
but if it's just like only California Adventure

1452
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,240
is available for one day,

1453
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,840
we'll see if stuff like that happens,

1454
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,680
or if the only stuff we can pull from

1455
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,680
in the reservation pool are days with both things open.

1456
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,000
Like, I wonder if say like Disneyland

1457
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,880
is too full of reservations for one day,

1458
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,800
and then does that just shut down

1459
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,720
the entire annual pass pool?

1460
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,560
That's possible.

1461
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,160
We don't know the answer to these questions.

1462
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,800
And I assume we won't really know,

1463
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,160
because they're not gonna tell us fully all the numbers,

1464
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,400
because they never even wanna tell us

1465
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,160
like full capacity on the parks.

1466
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,920
Yeah.

1467
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,120
So we'll see how that's gonna work.

1468
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,440
And again, we'll update you as we start to surmise

1469
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,600
what is actually going on.

1470
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,040
Believe me, there's gonna be a lot of discussion about this.

1471
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,920
Believe Key, there's gonna be a lot of discussion on this.

1472
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,400
There's gonna be.

1473
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,520
So what are you guys thinking about buying?

1474
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,280
Because I was originally thinking about

1475
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,160
just buying the lowest level pass,

1476
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,800
and when I saw it had no like weekend availability,

1477
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,640
I was like, all right,

1478
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,560
I guess I'll just go back to the Enchant Key.

1479
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,280
It's like a one for one almost with the Flex Pass.

1480
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,720
I guess I'll just do that.

1481
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,760
Well, yeah, I was thinking about Enchant Key,

1482
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,400
but then I was looking at like,

1483
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,760
and it's not like we're working weekday jobs.

1484
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,640
Lindsay and I are now working weekday jobs right now,

1485
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,840
but the possibility of that happens, that's possible.

1486
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,480
And I was looking and there's no October weekend days,

1487
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,320
which I know that's coming up quick.

1488
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,120
That's kinda when we're gonna feel pretty good

1489
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,760
about being bad weather's gonna be better.

1490
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,400
I would love to do a lot of theme parking in October.

1491
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,880
And I was like, I would really not like to have to pay

1492
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,120
that much money for this obviously,

1493
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,960
but that might be the deal breaker

1494
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,880
because the Halloween season is so great.

1495
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,120
The lighting and all the stuff we like there.

1496
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,840
So it's like just for that insurance of like,

1497
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,280
just so we can go, say by some miracle,

1498
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,680
we both start working like regular jobs,

1499
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,500
we'll be able to go.

1500
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,600
So I am leaning toward Believe Key.

1501
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,960
They have a half off parking, yeah.

1502
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,880
Are you gonna buy any?

1503
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,720
I don't know.

1504
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,240
I think it'll be whenever there is first an opportunity

1505
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,360
to go or like we all wanna do something.

1506
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,280
I think, let me see.

1507
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,760
I might be able to get away with an Imagine Key

1508
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,960
cause I'm like, I got the kiddo, it's gonna be less.

1509
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,600
I think it's all, I gotta look at blackout dates.

1510
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,560
Do you have information?

1511
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,200
Do you know amount of blackout dates offhand?

1512
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,600
Is that anywhere in your calendar?

1513
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,160
There are some questions about that

1514
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,280
and we didn't go over that as much as I would have liked to,

1515
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,680
but you'll just have to guess

1516
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,680
on some of those questions on the quiz.

1517
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,600
But I think I would have to make it one of the bottom two.

1518
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,840
I think I'll be going sort of seldom enough, unfortunately,

1519
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,080
where I would be in the bottom half.

1520
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,800
Yeah, and those aren't so bad.

1521
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,280
It's just the parking is the only view.

1522
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,440
It'd be nice to add parking to one of those.

1523
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,280
That's real, but though, honestly that's not.

1524
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,080
Well, you know what's the move, oh, sorry, I gotta go.

1525
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,760
I was just gonna say it's not so bad

1526
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,760
cause I was worried some of these low passes,

1527
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,560
especially would just shoot up price wise

1528
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,080
and that did not happen.

1529
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,960
It's still not what we were paying a decade ago,

1530
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,600
but it's not as bad as I was worried it would be.

1531
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,800
You maybe do the move, this depends on like if you're,

1532
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,080
you know, maybe you and Lindsay are going more together.

1533
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,200
I end up maybe like maybe I'm going more with you guys

1534
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,520
or for random odds and ends than I am with Aaron, my wife.

1535
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,960
So like, I like the move of somebody gets the pass

1536
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,720
with parking and the other person does not.

1537
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,440
We might be doing that at Universal.

1538
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,920
I think that's a good little like.

1539
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:24,760
That's a good hack.

1540
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,080
Like you don't have to both get the parking.

1541
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,520
That's what Lindsay and I did last time.

1542
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,680
She got flex and I got the one with parking.

1543
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,520
So we're saving on money overall.

1544
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,920
And she might do that actually.

1545
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,480
Well, it depends, we gotta talk about it

1546
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,520
if we want the Halloween.

1547
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,680
So we may have to both do that one, but we'll talk.

1548
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,040
Well, there's a lot of discussion to be had

1549
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,680
in the household yet.

1550
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,080
I don't want to record it.

1551
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,320
Put it on the show.

1552
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,160
I'll secretly record it.

1553
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,440
That is pretty funny.

1554
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,280
Yeah.

1555
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,760
And guess what?

1556
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,960
You're on Hidden Podcast.

1557
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,640
Everyone's gonna like that.

1558
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,680
This episode became a lot more who's afraid

1559
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,960
of Virginia Woolf than I expected.

1560
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,160
Screaming matches about the different keys.

1561
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,480
Like in the bedroom style plate shattering.

1562
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,400
What is going on?

1563
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,600
They're just screaming about keys.

1564
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,120
I want, just yelling and chant over and over again.

1565
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,240
Okay, yeah.

1566
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,800
I mean, that's, yeah.

1567
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,720
That's tentatively what we're looking at.

1568
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,120
Do we want to get to the quiz, Jason?

1569
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,960
Do you have anything else?

1570
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,880
I know some of the stuff on the quiz we didn't go over,

1571
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,080
but Scott, you're just gonna have to do your best.

1572
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,480
You're gonna have to guess and that's all right.

1573
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,800
Just gonna have to free ball it.

1574
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,640
Yeah, yeah.

1575
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,480
Process of elimination.

1576
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,600
Yeah, I mean, a lot of this is,

1577
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,040
some of the language is a little nebulous.

1578
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,720
I mean, I don't, there's some,

1579
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,120
I found it a little complicated in terms of like,

1580
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,080
if you're holding a one day pass,

1581
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,360
you can upgrade it to a key.

1582
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,760
Can you do that before you go?

1583
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,120
Or do you have to do it there at the ticket booths?

1584
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,560
There's some scenarios that people have been able

1585
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,040
to suss out.

1586
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,080
What I was wondering, let's say if I got the enchant key,

1587
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,080
and then I wanted more weekends,

1588
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,240
could I upgrade that to the believe key

1589
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,600
for the difference later on?

1590
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,520
Or will they be like, no, you have to wait

1591
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,520
until your next year to do that.

1592
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,480
Well, in the past, you've been able to upgrade,

1593
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,080
but then you're not getting any pro rate there.

1594
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,560
You're just all the way.

1595
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,400
Yeah.

1596
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,000
And you can't go down.

1597
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,880
You can't go from dream to believe.

1598
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,720
No.

1599
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,440
You don't even dream of it or believe that it could happen.

1600
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,320
You could probably when it's time to renew,

1601
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
you could in a way where you would get money

1602
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,600
handed back to you.

1603
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,800
Usually they're like, oh, you can upgrade.

1604
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,920
You're gonna hand us a little more money.

1605
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,840
Absolutely, you could do that.

1606
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,480
Right, right, right.

1607
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,560
Wait, but you are saying, you said in there that,

1608
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,240
cause this is my scenario, I do have a one day pass

1609
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,920
from when I did not get to go to Marvel with you guys.

1610
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:49,920
And that can go to the, that can be part of the down payment

1611
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,920
for my enchant key or more.

1612
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,760
I believe so, but you probably wanna call and ask

1613
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,720
before the 25th.

1614
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,280
Like I wouldn't try to do it immediately on that day.

1615
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,960
Call, I think just call.

1616
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:05,880
Yeah. Okay, okay.

1617
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,600
I heard some stuff about if you've done this,

1618
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,760
they're doing a SoCal pass and you get three days

1619
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,040
that you, and you can apply that to the cost of the thing,

1620
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,440
but it makes you start from back in July

1621
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,920
when you started using those three day passes.

1622
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,360
I actually didn't hear this.

1623
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,200
So your enchant key starts from whenever you first did

1624
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,440
one of those three days.

1625
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,720
Oh. That's what my friends told me.

1626
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,960
Now the student has become the teacher on the podcast.

1627
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,480
I did not hear that at all.

1628
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,320
That's interesting.

1629
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,160
I don't know.

1630
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,000
That's their cat.

1631
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,280
I don't know, unless they're getting some wrong info,

1632
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,120
but they're not.

1633
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,120
That's a very specific scenario.

1634
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,520
I mean, that three day Southern California pass

1635
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,360
also has the fine print of like,

1636
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,360
you have to use these three days within 90 days.

1637
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,520
So you have to go, like, I guess that's once a month.

1638
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,680
That's not totally unreasonable if you're a local.

1639
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,960
Yeah. Yeah.

1640
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,800
Huh.

1641
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:01,880
Weird, I don't know.

1642
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,120
Okay. So this fine print, the stuff we don't know,

1643
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,720
but is it time to put my knowledge to the test

1644
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,400
and become a magic key champion?

1645
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,240
That's right.

1646
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,560
That's right.

1647
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,280
So yeah, if there's gonna be a couple of math,

1648
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,000
a little light math for you.

1649
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,680
I'm gonna make sure I get mine.

1650
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,960
Try not to cheat, but that's okay.

1651
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,280
I mean, yeah, try not to cheat.

1652
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,120
And that goes for everyone listening now.

1653
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,520
Get a piece of paper out and just do your best.

1654
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,040
And then we can grade.

1655
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,880
We'll see.

1656
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,960
Can you be a champion?

1657
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,200
Can you be a magic key champion?

1658
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,760
All right, I found a paper.

1659
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,080
Okay, great.

1660
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,400
And Jason, I will read each the questions

1661
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,400
that we came up with.

1662
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,320
I think that's what we've decided we're gonna do

1663
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,480
just because we didn't work through the bit that thoroughly.

1664
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,640
So Jason, I think you are first here.

1665
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,480
I'll start.

1666
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,600
I think it's every other one.

1667
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,920
I think that's what I tried to do.

1668
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,120
Okay.

1669
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,440
All right, true or false?

1670
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,520
Parking is included at the believe key level.

1671
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:02,360
True half parking.

1672
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,160
That's true.

1673
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,440
He, oof, I think you gotta give it to him.

1674
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,280
I think you gotta give it to him.

1675
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,120
Yeah, we gotta give it to him.

1676
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:08,960
You gotta give it to him.

1677
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,960
It is false because it's not included,

1678
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,560
but you're right, you knew the information.

1679
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,400
Yes.

1680
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,240
There is parking, yeah.

1681
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,080
That's right.

1682
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,240
Parking is half off at the believe key.

1683
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,840
That is, with that, he gets that one right.

1684
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,680
Okay.

1685
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,520
All right.

1686
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,600
For the new magic key pass, what is the APR on the loan

1687
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,120
if you decide to utilize the Disney payment plan?

1688
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,840
Sorry, say it again.

1689
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,760
What is the APR on the loan

1690
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,000
if you decide to utilize the Disney payment plan?

1691
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,280
On any of them?

1692
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,120
Yes.

1693
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,200
It's the same percentage.

1694
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,040
Yes.

1695
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:37,880
Yes.

1696
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,720
Sorry, yes.

1697
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,320
I feel like I've seen this before in these scenarios.

1698
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,880
Is it 18%?

1699
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,120
No, it is 0%.

1700
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:47,960
Yes.

1701
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,000
Well, now that's a steal of a deal.

1702
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,920
That's right, and then we did,

1703
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,800
Jason briefly went over it on the episode.

1704
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,080
He said it's a no interest loan.

1705
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:55,920
Oh.

1706
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,040
Yes.

1707
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,880
Okay, well I missed that one.

1708
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,120
Okay, so that's okay.

1709
01:06:59,120 --> 01:06:59,960
That was me looking at it.

1710
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,480
That might've been when I was looking longingly

1711
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,440
at the window at my side.

1712
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,280
And then he got like had his hand against the window

1713
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,240
like calling to you.

1714
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,360
Please, Daddy.

1715
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,200
Holding up like a Beats pill speaker

1716
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,320
playing Look Into My Father's Eyes.

1717
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,560
All right, Jason.

1718
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,400
All right.

1719
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,320
Which of these is not a key type?

1720
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:26,600
Imagine, enchant, wish, believe.

1721
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,000
Well, this we ended up going over.

1722
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,520
We discussed the possibility that there would be wish

1723
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,960
and there's not wish, so wish is the answer.

1724
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,800
Incorrect, of course.

1725
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,480
A good student after all.

1726
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,120
A good student if ever there was.

1727
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,160
Jason, this is yours too.

1728
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,840
Okay, what time can you park hop?

1729
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,760
1 p.m. still.

1730
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,680
Correct.

1731
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,520
Great.

1732
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,000
Correct, this is great.

1733
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,120
Which, I'll just do this one.

1734
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,520
Which level includes photo pass and max pass?

1735
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,400
There is no level that includes these things.

1736
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
Great.

1737
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,240
Correct.

1738
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,080
Doing pretty good so far.

1739
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,160
Pretty good here, yeah.

1740
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,480
Yeah, pretty good.

1741
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,880
True or false?

1742
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,720
Guests under 13 are called Mickey's Little Key Kids.

1743
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,880
It's true.

1744
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,520
True if you mean us.

1745
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:22,480
We say that, but it's not official park policy, so false.

1746
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,840
False, you are right.

1747
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,160
That is correct.

1748
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,080
Which key is only for Southern California residents?

1749
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,320
The imagine key.

1750
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,840
That is correct.

1751
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,680
Great.

1752
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,520
Jason.

1753
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,720
Which key is for Northern California residents?

1754
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,560
Aren't the rest of them.

1755
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,720
Correct, all others are available

1756
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,680
to Northern California residents.

1757
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,520
You're doing great.

1758
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,920
Either in a one time payment or a monthly payment

1759
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,680
after $179 down.

1760
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,520
This is great.

1761
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,360
True or false?

1762
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,560
There is a special lounge for key holders

1763
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,040
called the Magic Terrace.

1764
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,320
False, it's the Magic Key Terrace.

1765
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,120
Very good, very good.

1766
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,080
Look at this.

1767
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,720
Well, that's the only thing I care about in any of this.

1768
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,480
So I'm in the details on that one.

1769
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,760
Jason, go ahead.

1770
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,800
True or false?

1771
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,400
Dream key holders who previously held annual passes

1772
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,280
and utilized their legacy pass holder status

1773
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,600
are now called Golden Keysmiths.

1774
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,680
Keysmiths is too much like what Jason would want

1775
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,000
and not what they would actually do.

1776
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,520
So false.

1777
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,840
That is correct.

1778
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,680
Great.

1779
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,520
I like it.

1780
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,000
I would like it to be called that.

1781
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,080
Okay, now I'm gonna read these next three.

1782
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,360
Does the imagine key allow you to visit the park

1783
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,440
on Mickey's birthday, November 18th, 2021?

1784
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,000
Am I allowed to look up what day of the month that is?

1785
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,840
Yes, I'll say yes, I'll allow you to.

1786
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,800
That matters, you know?

1787
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,800
It does matter.

1788
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,680
Unless they're blacking it out because it is

1789
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,480
Mickey's birthday and they know the demand will be high.

1790
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,800
We're getting close to Thanksgiving,

1791
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,560
but it's not Thanksgiving.

1792
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,760
I'm gonna say yes, you can.

1793
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,560
You're correct, yes, the answer is yes.

1794
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,360
Does the imagine key allow you to visit the park

1795
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,120
on Felix the cat's birthday, November 9th, 2021?

1796
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,480
That's not election day, is it?

1797
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,120
No, okay.

1798
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,560
I think you'd be allowed, yes.

1799
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,200
You are correct, yes, you are allowed.

1800
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,840
Does the imagine key allow you to visit the park

1801
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,240
on Hot Stuff the Little Devil's birthday

1802
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,360
on October 1st, 2022?

1803
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,000
What's Hot Stuff the Little Devil?

1804
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,200
The Harvey Comics character Hot Stuff the Little Devil?

1805
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,280
Yeah, he's got a slot machine in Las Vegas.

1806
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,720
I just played it and I won his wheel bonus.

1807
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,520
He's one of Jason and I's favorite character in fiction.

1808
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,040
When is it?

1809
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,160
April 10th. October 1st.

1810
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,240
No, sorry, October 1st.

1811
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,560
And by all me, you guys should go to Las Vegas

1812
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,880
to celebrate this together.

1813
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,720
Go play, both of you put your hands

1814
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,720
on the slot machine together to celebrate Hot Stuff.

1815
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,680
Sorry, April what?

1816
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,080
No, October 1st, 2022.

1817
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,920
Oh my God.

1818
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,880
Wait, is he not having a birthday this year?

1819
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,000
Oh, I forgot, there's an error on the test.

1820
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,560
Teacher's mistake, I'll count that.

1821
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,760
Teacher's mistake.

1822
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,760
I'll keep clicking, I'll keep clicking 2022.

1823
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,800
I realize I fucked that up.

1824
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,600
That's a Saturday, so no.

1825
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,840
No is correct.

1826
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,880
No is correct.

1827
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,720
Very good.

1828
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,360
Although I wasn't being, that was all imagined,

1829
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,320
that never changed.

1830
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,160
That was just all imagined, yes.

1831
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,160
I was lucky I kept tracking that then

1832
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,760
because that could have been a way to trick me.

1833
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,840
All right, Jason, go ahead.

1834
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,640
I think my count is that I have 12,

1835
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,960
unless I missed a tally.

1836
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,120
I think that's pretty good.

1837
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:45,960
Yes, you have 12.

1838
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,160
12 out of 13 and you have that extra credit point

1839
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,000
from earlier.

1840
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,400
So right now you are actually doing perfectly on this test.

1841
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,240
Wow.

1842
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,080
Pretty good.

1843
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,080
Can't believe it.

1844
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,440
All right, the questions start to get a little hard.

1845
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,600
Oh boy.

1846
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,440
Palm Sprint, Palm Sunday commemorates

1847
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,560
Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

1848
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,120
It is traditionally celebrated the Sunday

1849
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,040
before Easter Sunday.

1850
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,160
In 2022, it falls on April 10th.

1851
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,440
Which keys are valid for April 10th, 2022?

1852
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I'm gonna say the, I mean, I almost said magic key.

1853
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,240
There's no magic key.

1854
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,720
They're all magic keys.

1855
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,320
Believe key and,

1856
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,120
damn hell is the other one.

1857
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,320
Magic, what am I missing?

1858
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,440
No, oh, dream, dream.

1859
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,720
That's it.

1860
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,720
Your final answer is only dream.

1861
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,080
No, no, no, dream and believe.

1862
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:57,920
I'm so sorry.

1863
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,160
It is only dream.

1864
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,800
Only dream is valid.

1865
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,120
You were trying to help me in a way.

1866
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:02,960
I missed it.

1867
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,520
Oh my God, that's the only one.

1868
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:05,360
Only one.

1869
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,200
Spring break and Easter see that thereabouts in the spring.

1870
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,200
Very busy time at the theme parks.

1871
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,040
Very busy.

1872
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,000
I should have thought the entire spring is tough,

1873
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,440
regardless, but you shouldn't be in Disneyland.

1874
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:20,720
You should be at church where there is a giveaway of a palm.

1875
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,120
Everybody gets a palm to hold.

1876
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,120
That's the most,

1877
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,240
going to church every Sunday, every year for 18 years.

1878
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,840
That, I look forward to that one big time.

1879
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,480
Lot of time kills by passing out the palms.

1880
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,520
And then after church,

1881
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,640
you can just whang each other with those palms.

1882
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,760
Children just left and wail on each other with those palms.

1883
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,600
They sting.

1884
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,440
Yeah, yeah.

1885
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,640
Ooh, let's have a palm fight.

1886
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,200
Okay.

1887
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,800
Next one is also me.

1888
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,720
True or false?

1889
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,320
When making reservations in the Disneyland app,

1890
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,200
you will be asked, how many in your key party?

1891
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,520
I think no, because we were saying

1892
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,040
you don't get to reserve for other people.

1893
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:00,960
That is false.

1894
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,680
Also the term key party is very loaded in popular culture.

1895
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,520
Oh, right.

1896
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,560
Oh yeah.

1897
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,400
They better make sure they stay away from that.

1898
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,640
Oh, with this phrasing.

1899
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,200
I'll read this next one, even though Jason, I think he's yours.

1900
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,040
How do you become a charter member of the program, Scott?

1901
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,960
You have to sign up in the first 66 days.

1902
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,000
That's correct.

1903
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,840
All right, here we go.

1904
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,880
This is a tough one.

1905
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,760
Okay, you've just been given a briefcase

1906
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,440
with $1 million from a good friend

1907
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,480
who's recently sold his tequila company.

1908
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,600
You take this briefcase to Disneyland ticket booth

1909
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,520
and pay for one dream key pass.

1910
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,360
You pay in full, no payment plan.

1911
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,000
How much do you have left?

1912
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,800
Ah.

1913
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,320
All right, pencil and paper

1914
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,240
are not gonna do it for me on that one.

1915
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,080
I'm going- I think you could do it

1916
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,440
with a pencil and paper.

1917
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,920
To the calculator.

1918
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,120
I hope I calculated this correctly.

1919
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,280
Okay.

1920
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,200
Very important, this scenario.

1921
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,160
Now the question gives you the first half of this equation.

1922
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,800
Okay.

1923
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,640
The first number.

1924
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,280
You would have, I believe,

1925
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,400
remaining in the special briefcase,

1926
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,240
$998,601.

1927
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,240
That is correct, yes.

1928
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,080
That's right.

1929
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:24,920
That is right.

1930
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,360
All right, hey.

1931
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,240
Give it up for that.

1932
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,080
Got it.

1933
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,440
This is a lot of elements for me to not be frustrated by.

1934
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,520
Math on top of Casamigos and-

1935
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,160
No, this has nothing to do with Casamigos.

1936
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,360
This is just a totally random question.

1937
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,720
If somebody in a tequila,

1938
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,560
you're right, that word is never said.

1939
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,760
Nothing to do with, yeah.

1940
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,000
Jason, go ahead.

1941
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,160
Okay.

1942
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,960
David Lowry, director of the critically acclaimed film,

1943
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,080
The Green Knight, is directing the live action

1944
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,240
Disney movie, Peter Pan and Wendy.

1945
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,840
While an exact release date is not yet scheduled,

1946
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,640
the film is set to premiere in 2022.

1947
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,800
Which Magic Key gives you the best chance

1948
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,160
of being able to visit Disneyland on opening day?

1949
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,160
Well, it would just be what gives you the most,

1950
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,360
which is the dream key.

1951
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:25,160
That's right, and that's some great test taking skills

1952
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,160
put to use.

1953
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,000
That's right, yeah.

1954
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,320
You're just trying to comb through all the details

1955
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,520
to find what essentially is the most basic version

1956
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,360
of the question. The pertinent info to you.

1957
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,200
And you got it.

1958
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,480
The pertinent information.

1959
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,240
I mean, I know for you, the pertinent information is,

1960
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,720
what day is Peter Pan and Wendy coming out?

1961
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,600
I wanna know.

1962
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,840
It's my most anticipated movie of 2022, said Scott.

1963
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,320
I have nothing to look forward to in 2022

1964
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:54,320
until some boy surrounded by a bunch of CGI

1965
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,960
weaves his, when he proceeds to enchant me

1966
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,480
with his flight and tights.

1967
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:07,440
Starring all your favorite children of Hollywood legend,

1968
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,120
Jamie Tobak, Kevin Riefenstahl,

1969
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,840
all the children of Hollywood.

1970
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,840
Kevin Riefenstahl.

1971
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,640
I think that Peter Pan might be a good first theater

1972
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,880
movie experience with your son.

1973
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,720
Oh God.

1974
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,840
Or are you waiting for Zemeckis Pinocchio?

1975
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,000
Are you waiting for Zemeckis Pinocchio, maybe?

1976
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,160
I could see that happening.

1977
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,160
I could see you wanting to do that, yeah.

1978
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,080
I say keep the theaters closed.

1979
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,320
Too much of a risk.

1980
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,880
You were mad about that AMC stock

1981
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,280
when they got their stock price boosted.

1982
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:45,920
Okay.

1983
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,760
I'm fighting it.

1984
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,560
These people doing these shorts on these stocks.

1985
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,440
It's not funny.

1986
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,880
People pay a price.

1987
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,520
Okay, true or false?

1988
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,880
The design of the Magic Key Pass is the same design

1989
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,840
as the Key Wards and Key Bits,

1990
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,120
which are the name of the like end of the key,

1991
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,720
that's official names, Key Wards and Key Bits.

1992
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,840
They're the same design as the key hanging off

1993
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,600
of Ben Franklin's kite string

1994
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,440
in the Disney animated classic, Ben and Me.

1995
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,320
True or false?

1996
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,560
Is the key based on the key from Ben and Me?

1997
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,400
One side of it, because one side is Mickey

1998
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,200
and the other side is not.

1999
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,080
Oh, the War, but it's not the Mickey part.

2000
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,240
The wards and bits of the key.

2001
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,480
I would love this to be true,

2002
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,400
but I don't think anyone is paying attention to this.

2003
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,320
I'm gonna say false.

2004
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,440
It is false, sadly.

2005
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,640
It would have been a great idea to tie that in,

2006
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,480
but they did not do it.

2007
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,600
Okay, here is the tough one,

2008
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,800
because this is the verbal essay question.

2009
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,360
Okay, but you're doing fantastic.

2010
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,720
You've missed one, I think, on the whole.

2011
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,560
I think two.

2012
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,400
Sorry, sorry, two.

2013
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,360
So it's really only one,

2014
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,880
because you have one extra credit point.

2015
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:49,720
Now, if you pass this,

2016
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,760
That's right, thank you.

2017
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:54,600
This is gonna be like basically an A plus at this point,

2018
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,720
I would say, maybe an A, if you're really being technical.

2019
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,440
All right, here we go.

2020
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,400
Al G Rhythm has trapped you inside a Disney computer

2021
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,080
to compete against a team of basketball playing characters

2022
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,960
created by your son.

2023
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,480
Which team of Disney characters

2024
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,400
do you assemble to play this team,

2025
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,360
and which pass do you buy each of them

2026
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,040
after successfully winning the game

2027
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,280
and earning back the love of your son?

2028
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,800
Oh, God, hang on.

2029
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,080
There's a lot in this question.

2030
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,400
You have to assemble a team of Disney characters,

2031
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,800
then we assume you win against the team of characters

2032
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,240
created by your son.

2033
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,280
You win back your son's love,

2034
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,080
and then you have to buy each person,

2035
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,680
each character on your team a different pass,

2036
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,720
and you have to explain each pass

2037
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,240
and why you bought it for them.

2038
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:41,240
Okay, so, all right, so I'm in Disney 3000,

2039
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,280
I'm in the Disney server verse.

2040
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,280
That's correct.

2041
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:48,160
Which means that I have access to any characters

2042
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,320
past and present.

2043
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,560
Correct.

2044
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,440
Anything that Disney owns.

2045
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,440
So that includes Fox, it does not include Casablanca,

2046
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,680
or the Clockwork Orange Droogs.

2047
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,880
No.

2048
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,680
But, and also, just to be clear,

2049
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,000
whoever I don't pick, the other characters

2050
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
will all come to the game and cheer in a looping fashion

2051
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,400
that is too sharp and too well-lit

2052
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,000
and very distracting from the game

2053
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:17,960
that I'm trying to play.

2054
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:18,800
That is correct.

2055
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,400
If you want, I know you wanna get out there

2056
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,280
and hang out with your son, but if you want,

2057
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,760
you can also name all the characters

2058
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,640
that are watching you in the stands.

2059
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,160
But I'm not gonna make you do that for this test.

2060
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,360
It's just five, you're playing on the team,

2061
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,640
and there's four other characters, Disney characters.

2062
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,040
If I turn and look and he's like, you know,

2063
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,200
diarrhea-ing onto the window or something,

2064
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,000
it seems like a mess, I don't want any part of it,

2065
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,240
maybe I'll stay here and name everyone in the crowd.

2066
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,760
But until then, so, all right.

2067
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,760
And who am I playing against, Al G-Rhythm?

2068
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,680
Well, no, you're playing against,

2069
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,600
your son has come up with characters.

2070
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,720
Oh, right, yes.

2071
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,760
So he's come up with generic sort of

2072
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,840
video game style characters.

2073
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,920
And you're playing against that, those characters,

2074
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,960
and you're trying to win that.

2075
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,160
Everybody's gotta be good at basketball

2076
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,040
or bring some other skill to the table,

2077
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,520
because I think creativity is part of it in this scenario.

2078
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,200
Yes, for sure it is, yeah.

2079
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:15,200
Okay, well, just to get basketball skills in there,

2080
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:20,440
I will get Professor Brainard, the absent-minded professor.

2081
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,680
Perfect, great.

2082
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,240
To be there and bring, wait, no, not him, wait.

2083
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,760
I want, ugh.

2084
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,440
Well, maybe he should come and play,

2085
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:36,320
and can he bring Flubber that everyone on the court uses?

2086
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,640
As we saw in Space Jam 2,

2087
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,800
there are no rules to any of that game.

2088
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,600
So yes, you can do almost anything you want.

2089
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,760
And yes, he could bring Flubber,

2090
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,400
and everybody could be utilizing Flubber, great idea.

2091
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,600
Then for sure Brainard's coming with Flubber.

2092
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,640
I don't wanna use two slots on Brainard's.

2093
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,880
Like, should I use, should I get Robin Williams

2094
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,240
and Fred McMurray?

2095
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,680
Is that overkill?

2096
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,400
There are no rules that say you can't get

2097
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,840
two different characters.

2098
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,800
Are they both Brainards though?

2099
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,480
That's a good question, I don't know.

2100
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:11,600
Let me just make sure on that, absent-minded professor.

2101
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,040
Because if they're different characters,

2102
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,320
then I think maybe you're covering different ground.

2103
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,360
Yeah, Brainard is one, and then that's the,

2104
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,960
oh, no, okay, I think it's the same character.

2105
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,040
Although there were multiple jokers at the Space Jam game.

2106
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,200
That's true.

2107
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,720
I don't know, the other one should sit in the crowd.

2108
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,320
I should, am I just building out a starting lineup?

2109
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,240
Yeah, just build up a starting lineup, yes.

2110
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,240
Am I in it?

2111
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,480
I was assuming you were, but if you'd like to take

2112
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,280
your slot and give it to some other Disney character,

2113
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,120
you can.

2114
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,120
I'd better, I'm fighting for my son's love.

2115
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:48,120
So Scott Gardner, professor Brainard.

2116
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,880
Which one specifically?

2117
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,160
I think Fred McMurray's.

2118
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,000
The classic.

2119
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,960
Yeah, that's the one I'd most wanna meet.

2120
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,800
Great.

2121
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,800
So, let's see, who else would be good at basketball?

2122
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,880
Like who can, oh, maybe Tarzan.

2123
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:09,680
I think, yeah, 99 Tarzan is gonna be there.

2124
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,720
That's one of the most fit characters.

2125
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,960
I think if you're also talking fit,

2126
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,680
you gotta go King Triton.

2127
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:18,600
Great, do you mean Tarzan or Georgia the Jungle?

2128
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,640
No, I mean Tarzan.

2129
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,480
Oh, animated Tarzan, I'm sorry, go ahead.

2130
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,120
The Georgia the Jungle, not a bad thought either.

2131
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,760
King Triton, though, he has to like,

2132
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,360
well, he can wave his thing and give himself legs, right?

2133
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,440
Can he?

2134
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,880
Can he wave his thing and give himself legs?

2135
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,800
I mean, if it's on the line.

2136
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,160
Does he give Ariel legs with his thing?

2137
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,920
Is it Triton?

2138
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,960
Yeah, he does it, right?

2139
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,720
Cause he has all the powers that Ursula has.

2140
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,960
What an asshole that he wouldn't just do that immediately.

2141
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,960
Can Ursula be there?

2142
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,440
And I don't, you know,

2143
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,280
now that you wanna be in business with Ursula,

2144
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,320
but she could transform herself

2145
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,960
into a really good basketball player probably.

2146
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,160
Like she just, you know, matches the body of,

2147
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,000
I don't know who's a big,

2148
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,280
Would she have to make a deal?

2149
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,120
Would she like make a deal with Scottie Pippen

2150
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,400
and steal his abilities like the original Monstars did?

2151
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,040
Or like crossing over Space Jam rules and like voice stealing.

2152
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,120
Yeah.

2153
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,520
Yeah, she'd be able to, huh.

2154
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,560
I mean, can she, can, is Michael Jordan automatically,

2155
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,840
no, he's not in the servers,

2156
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,600
but he's also not, hmm.

2157
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,600
Can Ursula travel out of the server first,

2158
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,840
steal Michael Jordan's basketball powers

2159
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,640
and then only a true love's kiss

2160
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,560
can give Michael Jordan his abilities back?

2161
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,640
I don't see why not.

2162
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,080
I don't see why not either, yeah.

2163
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,360
All right, so King Triton is out

2164
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,160
because I don't think he would agree to any of this.

2165
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,000
Right.

2166
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,920
Like what, I wouldn't, it's preposterous.

2167
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,280
Ursula's down with what,

2168
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,560
should I maybe not go Jordan though?

2169
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,640
Just like who's a current, I mean,

2170
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,120
now LeBron's already kind of in league with,

2171
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,440
I don't know, Kevin Durant.

2172
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,920
Let's go, cause you don't want Jordan now probably.

2173
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,400
So let's, Ursula's gonna take Kevin Durant's powers

2174
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,160
and bring them back into the server first.

2175
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,000
Yes.

2176
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,960
And give herself legs, there's a lot of work to be done.

2177
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,320
And she'll also get Flubber from Brainerd.

2178
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:20,560
And then, I mean, you want like creativity.

2179
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,400
Who's just like gonna like come up with some

2180
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,000
like bizarre thing that works out?

2181
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,560
That's just like, you know, funny and clever.

2182
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,600
Like Goofy, you probably can't depend on.

2183
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,360
I mean, do you want just Mickey Mouse just to like?

2184
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,680
I mean, you bring star power to the team, certainly.

2185
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,080
All around player probably, like playing.

2186
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,120
And kind of a motivator.

2187
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,960
Yeah.

2188
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,120
Unless you want like a Muppet.

2189
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:48,960
You do have the Muppets.

2190
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,880
You can get, you got Marvel, you got Star,

2191
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,880
you can do Captain Phasma if you want.

2192
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:54,720
What am I saying?

2193
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,200
Mazanada.

2194
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,360
Bullwhip Griffin, you know,

2195
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,200
but basketball may not have been invented

2196
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,040
or was just being invented. Jock Lindsay

2197
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,440
from Indiana Jones.

2198
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,280
Sure.

2199
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,600
Mutt Williams.

2200
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,360
Mutt Williams is tempting.

2201
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:14,360
Like what if I put in like 20th century Fox basketball movie?

2202
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,000
Yeah.

2203
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,760
Pretty much the only things you can have

2204
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,480
are like butts or cigarettes.

2205
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,240
Like those are not existing in the Disney server first.

2206
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,760
Those have all been deleted.

2207
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,560
Yeah, those are blurred out.

2208
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,880
Who's, is like, I've never seen White Men Can't Jump,

2209
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,040
but apparently Disney owns that now.

2210
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,440
Is, who's a good player?

2211
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,280
Is one of them good and one of them isn't?

2212
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,560
I assume they're all, they're both good.

2213
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,880
I actually have not seen that movie either.

2214
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,480
I'm just gonna take a swing

2215
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,640
and get Wesley Snipes from White Men Can't Jump.

2216
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,480
Okay.

2217
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,160
And Woody will obviously be in the audience.

2218
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:54,160
And just to clarify his character's name is Sydney Sid Dean.

2219
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,320
Okay, great.

2220
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:01,760
So the team that I have assembled within the servers

2221
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,760
is me, Scott Gardner, Professor Brainard, Tarzan, Ursula,

2222
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,440
who has stolen Kevin Torrance powers,

2223
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,280
and Sid Dean from White Men Can't Jump.

2224
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,120
So the team.

2225
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,280
And I think that all together,

2226
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,760
yeah, that's pretty stacked, right?

2227
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,600
And I think regardless of who my son,

2228
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,960
whose video game abilities,

2229
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,600
which are the greatest of all time,

2230
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,640
I deny, I hate them.

2231
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,040
I guess, is it because,

2232
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,280
I don't want him to be a basketball player.

2233
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,280
I want him to be a theme park podcaster.

2234
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,120
That's right, yes, yes.

2235
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,280
You were upset with him.

2236
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,120
Cause he was doing-

2237
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,360
And I'm upset that instead,

2238
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,240
he's the greatest video game developer

2239
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,800
of his or any generation.

2240
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,200
So.

2241
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,360
Right.

2242
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,760
But anyway, so I hate him and like,

2243
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,480
fuck that and his video game skills,

2244
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,560
but also I love him and I want his love back.

2245
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,400
Exactly.

2246
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,400
So, and I think this basketball game is gonna go great.

2247
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,480
I think it's gonna go great.

2248
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,760
Is there a yes, is there a right or wrong answer on this?

2249
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,320
Well, you need to also buy each one a pass

2250
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,720
now that you've won the game.

2251
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,400
Oh, okay.

2252
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,800
Well, I will buy, I think, you know,

2253
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,720
that's gonna get up there,

2254
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,560
but I,

2255
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,680
I mean, I could save a little money

2256
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,960
by only getting Tarzan the Imagine pass

2257
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,560
because like, he lives in the jungle.

2258
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,000
He's not gonna know what's going on.

2259
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,240
He's gonna be impressed by,

2260
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,680
he's just gonna look at the pass itself.

2261
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:22,360
Like, whoa, key turn into card.

2262
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,880
But I think I should be nice and just treat everybody,

2263
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,120
except for Ursula.

2264
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,240
She goes back to the sea.

2265
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,840
She only gets the pleasure of getting to have

2266
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,480
basketball powers for a little bit.

2267
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,360
Okay, so everybody gets the best pass

2268
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,000
because of big victory.

2269
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2270
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,760
And I'm gonna wanna hang out at the park with all of them.

2271
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,560
So we're all getting the dream key.

2272
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:49,080
Well, I have to say that is an incorrect answer, sadly.

2273
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:50,960
Damn it.

2274
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,680
You know, it felt a little weird the whole time.

2275
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,400
I mean, there was, there's only one answer.

2276
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,760
It's of course the basketball team

2277
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,400
from that new John Stamos Disney Plus show,

2278
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,160
the high school high schoolers that he coaches.

2279
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,680
That's the, Big Shot is the name of the show.

2280
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,080
But they're not gonna be better than

2281
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,400
what I put together. He plays Marwin.

2282
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,360
And Sid Dean.

2283
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,560
I mean, that's a, look, it's great.

2284
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,120
I like the creativity, but sadly,

2285
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:16,560
you're not gonna get the point for that one.

2286
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,720
You have to- What pass am I supposed to get all of them?

2287
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,200
Well, they would all be getting the top pass

2288
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,040
because they won as well.

2289
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,480
So the, I guess, you know what, that was right.

2290
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,720
That part of the question was right.

2291
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,560
Partial credit, partial credit, yeah.

2292
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,120
You get half parking.

2293
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,080
Right. Okay.

2294
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:32,440
So do I win, maybe get half of my son's love back?

2295
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,280
That's true.

2296
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,440
Yeah, you got half of your son's love back.

2297
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,640
I'll give you that.

2298
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:36,480
All right.

2299
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,160
So he will, I'll have joint custody.

2300
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,760
I will be with him half the time.

2301
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,920
And the other half he will spend in the server verse

2302
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,000
with algae rhythm.

2303
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,360
That's correct. Yes.

2304
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,640
So anyway, that's still a very, very good showing

2305
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,480
on the test.

2306
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,400
I wanna see- Thank you.

2307
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,000
Everyone at home, show us your work.

2308
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,280
Show us who you decided would be on your team.

2309
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,640
Oh yeah, poster lineups.

2310
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,760
That's pretty good.

2311
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,640
Yeah, I would like to see everybody's all star,

2312
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,720
your Disney server verse starting lineups.

2313
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,040
So be sure to send us those.

2314
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,560
I mean, like, is there a, do I get a grade on that?

2315
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,040
Is that like, that ends up being like a 17 and a half.

2316
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,200
Although when you put it that, I don't know, out of 20,

2317
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,240
that's not the greatest.

2318
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,000
I mean, it's like a B plus of a team.

2319
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,920
Yeah, still pretty good.

2320
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,760
Okay, yeah.

2321
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,760
Still pretty good.

2322
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,560
Especially for somebody who came in and was so upset

2323
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,080
about the Magic Key program in general,

2324
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,920
you seem kind of like you're pretty close to being an expert.

2325
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:29,760
Wow.

2326
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,000
Well, you know what?

2327
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,560
It's, when you have good teachers,

2328
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:38,560
you can overcome any anger you have about the topic

2329
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,440
or the names that you're talking about.

2330
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,560
Yeah, hey, you guys did it.

2331
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,120
And my professors, I love you so much.

2332
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:55,120
And I feel like I need to tribute you by saying,

2333
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,000
if you wanted the moon, I would try to make a start,

2334
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:07,320
but I would rather you let me give my heart to sirs with love.

2335
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,040
That's the thing you sing to professors, right?

2336
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,560
Yeah, that is.

2337
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,400
That is.

2338
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,920
Yeah, well, we did at least when I was younger.

2339
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,840
Yeah, you ever at the end of the school year,

2340
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,240
the whole class learned to sir with love.

2341
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,520
Yeah, for sure.

2342
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,800
Well, that's from the heart.

2343
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,640
And that's to you guys.

2344
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,480
Thank you very much.

2345
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,320
Thanks for teaching me.

2346
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,240
Thanks for getting me to that B plus.

2347
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,640
We're getting me half custody of my son.

2348
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,560
Hey, you know what?

2349
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,400
Not so bad.

2350
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:40,400
You guys put the medicine, you hid it in a sweet treat,

2351
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,680
in a brownie.

2352
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:47,240
And now you've fed the sin, as Jeremy Renner has taught us.

2353
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,720
Beautiful.

2354
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,560
All right.

2355
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:55,640
You survived podcast the ride, magic key edition.

2356
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,840
And you know, the math on these things is all pretty crazy,

2357
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:07,840
but at $5 a month to stay subscribed behind the paywall,

2358
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,160
there's no more magic key than this.

2359
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:15,080
And you can hold as many episodes as you want,

2360
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,800
three new ones a month,

2361
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,840
but you keep all the ones that you have.

2362
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:24,120
Do we have enough perks?

2363
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,120
Do we need, I guess, I don't know, free parking,

2364
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,960
if we ever give you a place to go.

2365
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,080
I would like to announce to become a charter member

2366
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,920
of the Patreon, you have to buy a Patreon subscription

2367
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,720
within the first 5,000 days that it exists.

2368
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,320
And you will be one of our charter Patreon members.

2369
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,520
So that's right.

2370
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,800
So that's everybody so far.

2371
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,040
So everybody so far is a charter member.

2372
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:46,880
Yes.

2373
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,840
So you only have a couple,

2374
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:51,200
you only have a few thousand days left to sign up.

2375
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,360
You won't hear about it here, I guess,

2376
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,840
because if you haven't signed up,

2377
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,160
you won't hear this message, but.

2378
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,480
It's glowing away fast.

2379
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,480
So act now, be sure to become a podcast,

2380
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,520
the right charter holder.

2381
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,800
And if we can figure out all of this

2382
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:11,480
and how to get our holds, then we'll see you at the park.

2383
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:13,960
Bye bye.

2384
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:14,780
Bye bye.
