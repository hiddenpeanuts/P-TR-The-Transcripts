1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Forever, dog.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Morning.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Like an old episode of Double Dare, the following podcast will take you for a live studio audience in Orlando, Florida.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In five days, the three hosts have walked a combined total of 286,770 steps, and yet thanks to a diet consisting entirely of treats, we are in extremely poor physical health.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If this theater crashes into an adjacent theater, you'll find emergency toilets under every scene.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Live exactly seven miles away from Botanicus.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You know, it's Podcast the Ride.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Podcast the Ride!

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wow!

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wow!

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you so much!

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wow!

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi! Hello!

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh my god, so many folks!

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hi folks! Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks that is finally being recorded in the theme park capital of the world!

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, my name is Scott Gardner, hello!

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm Jason Sheridan. Thank you.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My name is Mike Carlson. Thank you.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wow!

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go ahead.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Honestly, I really didn't have anything to say.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was going to say we're...

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll say, yeah, we're happy to be here.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Also, the thing with our phone...

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, you were supposed to be able to cue keynote from an iPhone, and both of our...

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't tell, don't bore them with this.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Both of our phones failed at the same time.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We have a topic that has a lot of meat on the bone, and you're wasting their time.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, it's fine. For once. For once we do.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
People love it. People love a little, you know...

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here's what happened. Sure, yes.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Here's the... Well, here's what's happening, or here's what's been happening this week, is that we all, for the first time as a podcast host trio, have been to Disney World together, to Universal Studios together.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's been amazing. We actually all, for the first time ever, the three of us, entered Disney World exactly two years to the day we released the first podcast, The Ride.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah!

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The day of!

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And now we've got all you folks here, which is incredible.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And actually, to that end, we have some questions for you folks.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
How many people work in the parks?

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, yeah.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's a ton. Oh my god.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, so let's divide it up then.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Where's the Disney folks?

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Universal?

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sea World?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes!

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Good.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Good.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We asked for this specifically.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No Sea World employees were allowed to purchase tickets tonight.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, after what they've done.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So, the other thing, I mean, we are here specifically because of SAC Comedy Lab, which is an incredible venue.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you, SAC!

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Everybody here has gone just above and beyond in making us feel welcome and given us a lot of fun.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's been such a fantastic place.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And hey, other comedy podcasts, come here. It's been wonderful.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And another thing that I really like about SAC is that we are, so we're sort of in the Church Street Station area in Orlando,

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
which is the, like, what was the more vibrant nightclub region of Orlando until Disney stole the idea and built their own.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But my favorite thing about the area that we are right now is that we, just two blocks west of this theater,

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
is the former office of boy band mogul Lou Pearlman.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He worked right around here.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He ran a $300 million Ponzi scheme in this very neighborhood.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And incidentally, his organization is where we got these headset mics from.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's kind of a sort of a garage. These used to belong to O-Town.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now we get to use them.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If anyone, by the way, has any information on the location of O-Town, please, the authorities are standing by.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They have not solved Lou Pearlman's riddles yet.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, okay. And we, you know, while also while we're talking about, you know, asking what you folks are up to,

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think there's somebody in the audience who we'd like to point out specifically.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is the person around who was at the Chicago show and the Orlando. Is that you, sir?

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Water here. Wait. You know, come up real quick.

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, come up.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay. Hey, come on up. Oh, my God. Hello. What's your name?

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Brian. Brian. Okay.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Brian. Brian's here. Brian was at our Chicago show we did recently.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And we were doing a little like we were tossing out prizes and we realized you came from the furthest.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But there's somebody else who really wanted to give something to you, too.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we've had a week in the parks and we've thought this through and Jason, take it from here.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sure. Yeah. Brian, you know, you go to two states to see our show.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's only one word to describe that family.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The concept that Dominic Toretto of Fast and Furious Supercharged.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Which according to a game in the app, the Universal app is the character that I am closest to.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So, you know, we got something to honor our family member.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is a beer koozie that says family forever on the front.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And on the back, it says cars come and go.

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But respect lasts forever.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right. And also, I wedged some hotel shampoo and conditioner in there.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because when I asked for a couple more, they left me a bag of eight because I guess they knew I was coming.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So here you are. Yeah. Thank you so much.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you. Thank you, Brian.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Brian, if we need to if we need to put a crew together, we're going to call you.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Just letting you know. Are you going to ask him if he was a good wheel man?

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We know he is.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So with all that past us, we should talk about our trip a little bit.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah. Sunday. All right.

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Highlights, gentlemen.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, who wants to start? So well, too many visuals.

98
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you have those ready to go? Of course, I have those ready to go.

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I was just going to say, I just want to get a little bit of a gauge because there's people we post a little bit on the Twitter, the social media.

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So people have been asking. And I think the first question they have for you is count on how many scoops of ice cream.

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Great. And how many hot dogs?

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hot dogs only at one scoops of ice cream in the last two days, up to five.

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And one truffle that they like scoop out the chocolate and then dip in liquid nitrogen.

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah. Some people know they know it's great.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Epcot food and wine.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And a lot of people I've been look, I've been I kind of was mingling about and I could hear people asking this question.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How many times did Jason Sheridan go to Chicken Guy?

108
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And the answer is, well, we went one night.

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes, we did. I've been once.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And the following day, after a brief nap, I went back.

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Two times.

112
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You try to find a six dollar property, six dollar sandwich somewhere else on Disney property.

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And we are we are now members of the Sauce Squad.

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The Sauce Squad. We are in the Sauce Squad.

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who here is a member of the Sauce Squad?

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah, they all came together.

117
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If we're going to do a mission, we're going to call on you.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're going to be our Sauce Squad.

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So great. So two chicken guys.

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Any sauces you'd like to name check?

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Donkey sauce.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Avocado crema.

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The blue cheese, honestly, was great.

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, audience.

126
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Descent, descent on this issue.

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Fair enough.

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wow, you're really making them.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Did somebody shout out one habanero?

130
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Who's that? What's everyone's favorite?

131
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Nasha Ha.

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They're all good.

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, that's nice.

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is now clear this could have been the main topic.

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We worked too hard. We over got it.

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes, we did.

137
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So, yeah. So highlights.

138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How's your trip going?

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My trip's going great because I've been a very brave boy.

140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Seeking applause on this. I did it for you.

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I've done it for you.

143
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let me do the list.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Rides I've been afraid of my entire life.

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I have done this week and had a great time.

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Tower of Terror.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now I know the thing crawls.

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You go through and the line opens up. It's really cool.

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Expedition Everest.

151
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes.

152
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Close my eyes.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We're still cool.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Rock and roller coaster.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Revenge of the Mummy.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hagrid's.

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We managed to do it.

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We did it.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Too much to say about it, but we did it.

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But with that and the sheer amount of launches between all of these things,

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think I genuinely get to call myself a launch queen.

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you.

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now can I just pull out my phone and just have you,

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
can I just call my mom and just have you guys all vouch that I'm doing well?

165
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Everything's like, okay, okay.

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Please do not tell my mother about this show.

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
My mother today, just today emailed me and said,

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
what's up with this picture of you and a goat?

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Because I went to Rafiki's Planet Watch and I went,

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
oh no, she figured out Google.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She figured out how to look up what I am doing.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And the thing that you're worried about is being pictured brushing a goat?

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, I'm just saying like the machine have come alive.

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The machines have gained sentience.

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
She's figured out how to search for it now.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So she can like look at your old lewd tweets.

177
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh yeah.

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Uh oh.

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Get deleting.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No, no.

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No time.

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, we should.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We should just do that in general.

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, me too.

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Everyone should.

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I have one more thing to say about, you know, all of that was very thrilling.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But you don't just come to theme parks for the thrill,

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you come for the emotion, you come to watch something stirring.

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There's nothing more stirring in any of the parks than the American Adventure.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So amazing to see and especially amazing to see the new movie at the end.

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you don't know this attraction,

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
there's a little film that they update every once in a while with some of the greatest Americans,

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
the people who really represent the American story.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I was just so happy to see that they have recently updated this attraction

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
with everyone's two favorite Americans, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Mark Zuckerberg.

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, they put this in 20 months ago, I believe,

198
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and the imaginers are thinking, all right, cool, should be fine, should be set.

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's not like 20 months is enough time for everyone to decide that they despise Mark Zuckerberg.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's not like this week everyone will start despising Mark Zuckerberg even more.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
A hell of a week to see it.

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah, yeah, wonderful.

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Very emotional.

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think there's many highlights of the trip, but I do think I hit a peak very early.

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The Epcot series Eat to the Beat.

206
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh.

207
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I was lucky enough to sit and watch 20 minutes of The Baja Men.

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I will, I'm look, I'm full of irony.

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm so sorry.

210
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's the way my brain processes everything.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Love, kindness, it all comes out with irony.

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That being said, The Baja Men were awesome.

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And I mean that sincerely.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
One of The Baja Men does backflips.

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And not just a backflip and stops.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Backflip, backflip, backflip, backflip.

217
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And it is a show stopper.

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And people were there.

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Like I saw Mickey Thomas and Starship like last year at Eat to the Beat.

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So they're always there.

221
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And they have some hits.

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We love those hits.

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The audience was asleep.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And they kind of came to life during We Built This City, which is a great song.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Not the mannequin song?

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Not the mannequin song.

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Something's going to stop us now?

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They were asleep?

229
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, honestly that might have been in one of the like the eight o'clock set.

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh sure.

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You got to mix it up.

232
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They do three sets at Eat to the Beat.

233
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So like Everclear spaces out their hits.

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That all sound very similar.

235
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Now do The Baja Men space out their hits?

236
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I believe they play Who Let the Dogs Out every set.

237
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So people were loving it.

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They were on their feet.

239
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
They were getting everyone.

240
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They were so excited.

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
People were so excited by The Baja Men.

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Someone recognized me later from just enjoying the concert.

243
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was sitting down eating in the dark.

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And a woman with her husband and daughter were like,

245
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, you were the one on Instagram during The Baja Men.

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I said, Oh, yeah, yeah.

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And she's like, Oh, what's your Instagram?

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And I was like, Well, it's podcast.

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And I was like, I don't know if this is your thing.

250
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She's like, Oh, well, check.

251
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
She looked at her daughter.

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
She's like, Do you know that one?

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And they're here tonight.

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah.

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So and she, the daughter was honestly very nice.

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
She's like, Oh, I think so.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You love to see it.

258
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You love to see.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah.

260
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So anyway, next time they're in town, check The Baja Men out.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Want to do our backflips now?

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We're doing it.

265
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The listener can't see, but we're doing it.

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh my God.

267
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So you know.

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah.

269
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Six and six and seven and eight.

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Great.

271
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah.

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We all did eight.

273
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Jason, Jason got something.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He won.

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, right.

276
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,240
I was very excited this trip because I had a couple of chances to go hang out at the Boardwalk

278
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Resort.

279
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,440
My family always loved that hotel and I just read about a thing at the Boardwalk and I was

280
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,000
so excited to see it in person.

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Mike, can you bring up that bad boy?

282
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Great.

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,600
So some of you clearly know what this is.

284
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,000
Some of you are rightly horrified.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,720
These are called nanny chairs.

286
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,440
These are theme park history.

287
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
These are obviously replicas.

288
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,880
I believe they used an original mold though.

289
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:57,040
These were what were on carousels for adults to ride while children rode horses.

290
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,680
This is before they figured out they could just bolt a bench in.

291
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,880
So there's two of these usually in the lobby and then there's two I don't know where but

292
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:17,040
somewhere else and they have names on the back Paul, Todd, Carrie and Alexander.

293
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Did I get those right?

294
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Yes.

295
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,200
You're a fan of the chairs.

296
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,880
But apparently they do move around.

297
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
Like Paul isn't always upstairs.

298
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
Carrie isn't always down.

299
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:40,000
So like check out the ghoulish chairs the next time you're at the very expensive hotel

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,040
tour right under the tiny replica of Lucy the elephant, the elephant drinking.

301
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Yeah.

302
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,600
So nanny chairs.

303
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Good luck sleeping tonight.

304
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sorry.

305
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,520
Huh.

306
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Creepy chairs.

307
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Creepy chairs.

308
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,240
And that people knew and applauded for.

309
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Incredible.

310
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Wow.

311
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Okay.

312
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,280
So with all that out of the way it's time to talk topic.

313
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,040
Now we you know we talked to there's so much stuff you know in this week alone we've done

314
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,240
300 things that we hadn't done before.

315
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,320
There's so much to do here.

316
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
It could be creepy chairs the whole time.

317
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,080
It could be chicken it very well could be could have been the Skyliner.

318
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,120
That kind of wanted it to be.

319
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,640
We all loved the Skyliner.

320
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
I loved it.

321
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,480
I was a little bit scared.

322
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,360
Those landings and those takeoffs.

323
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,440
But like when it gets to that high height I kind of like there's a little something

324
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,480
in my brain that says no.

325
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
But anyway it's nice.

326
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
I like it.

327
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
I do like it.

328
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Yep.

329
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
But not the topic.

330
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,920
Definitely today we're thinking maybe the topic could have been the street that we named

331
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,480
at Margaritaville Resort Orlando where we walked around.

332
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,000
For anybody who doesn't know way before the podcast Dustin our friend Anthony Gio who

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,480
we should have on more often.

334
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
More yeah.

335
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,920
Sent a list of a hundred street names unprovoked to this resort.

336
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,040
And they took one and that is Dreamsicle Drive.

337
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Yes.

338
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah.

339
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,080
It was thrilling to go to a place where the leftovers had happened.

340
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,000
People had been called up to heaven.

341
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,640
But not not every other person.

342
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,360
Every person had been disappeared by some sort of force.

343
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,760
We were walking around this Margaritaville whatever resort and Jason kept going I don't

344
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
feel good.

345
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,120
I did not.

346
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,360
I want to get out of here.

347
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,600
The one character in the big short goes to like a town where every like it's just unfinished

348
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,000
developments and I'm like oh no I'm living that weird scene.

349
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We all love the big short.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,640
We all remember it very well.

351
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Yeah.

352
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Yeah.

353
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
So we'll cover that.

354
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
We'll cover everything.

355
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,600
We'll cover every like house on our streets.

356
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,120
It's a lovely place.

357
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,160
You know what ultimately at the end of the day we couldn't do some obscure little thing.

358
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,440
This is a this is a big city for us to be in.

359
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,280
This is a big show for us to be doing and we had to do a legitimately big topic which

360
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,760
is scary for us because we love to parse them.

361
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,640
We love to do the little micro topics.

362
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,160
But we wanted to do something big for you guys.

363
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Even though we're scared we thought what we need to do is rise to the challenge.

364
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Oh.

365
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Yeah.

366
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
I got it.

367
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,840
I believe Scott I believe the yeah the word you're looking for is.

368
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Seva.

369
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Seva.

370
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Seva.

371
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Seva.

372
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Seva.

373
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Seva.

374
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Let's do that.

375
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,320
Do we want it again.

376
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
We would.

377
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
One more.

378
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
One more.

379
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
We're all shaving the song.

380
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Here we go.

381
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:43,280
Now remember folks you can't do cultural appropriation if it's space aliens.

382
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,360
So yeah we're in the clear.

383
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
That was fine.

384
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,440
We were all waving our it started as a back and forth sway.

385
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,920
Started and then we started doing the.

386
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,800
We were doing shame in a song.

387
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Arms really is what we were all doing.

388
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Switch to SpongeBob arms.

389
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
It's kind of a mass happening.

390
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,320
Can you imagine if anyone in the world saw that?

391
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,440
Like no context for what is happening in this room.

392
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,200
So when we were setting up earlier someone walked in and was like oh is there a show

393
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
tonight.

394
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,520
They went not to 930 and I was like oh bless God bless if they come back.

395
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,920
What they're going to walk into sight unseen.

396
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,840
Comedy.

397
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,480
So let's wait let's be clear though what we're going to do we're talking about Avatar Flight

398
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
of Passage.

399
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:51,680
Though as you'll see it may really be Avatar Flight of Passage the pre show.

400
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,360
We're keeping our eyes on the clock and that'll help dictate that.

401
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,560
OK so welcome to the Avatar episode.

402
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Can everyone see me OK?

403
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Good.

404
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
OK.

405
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,640
Now.

406
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:19,880
Now before we can begin our journey we almost honor the Navi by undergoing several important

407
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,400
rites of passage.

408
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,840
First using powerful psionic amplification equipment we will blend our usual podcast

409
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,640
the ride logo with the sacred font of Pandora.

410
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:43,840
OK and the font you'll recognize of course as Papyrus.

411
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840
Mike is it working OK?

412
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,640
Mike can you get it working?

413
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,560
I'm working on it.

414
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,600
Mike Mike Mike Mike.

415
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,920
One second one second.

416
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,360
Can you hold on hold on everyone move your arms around.

417
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Yeah.

418
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Great.

419
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Great.

420
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
OK.

421
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Whoa.

422
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Whoa.

423
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Wow.

424
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:16,080
I never knew our logo could be so.

425
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Oh no.

426
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,080
The computer rejected it.

427
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
OK it's back.

428
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Oh phew I can never go without Papyrus in our logo again.

429
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Wow.

430
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,080
Should we change it permanently?

431
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Yes.

432
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Erin our graphic designer did this at gunpoint.

433
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
Let me be very clear about that.

434
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,200
OK so OK next.

435
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,760
We have to establish a link between us and the main imagineer responsible for the world

436
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,760
of Pandora Joe Roady.

437
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,160
And I think a lot of you know Joe Roady but if you don't.

438
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,360
Joe Roady is an Imagineer who's very culturally versed he's very worldly and he has a very

439
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,280
particular fashion sense.

440
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Mike you want to remind people just what Joe Roady looks like.

441
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,760
OK.

442
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,240
So that is why to honor this man and the land that he created the three of us shall now

443
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,240
don Joe Roady earrings.

444
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Hold that hold that hold that.

445
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
OK.

446
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Here wave your arms a little bit.

447
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Help Mike.

448
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
Oh it's not working.

449
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Move around a little bit.

450
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
The link's not.

451
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
There's no match.

452
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
You don't have a match this year.

453
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,320
I put it on earlier but now it's a problem.

454
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
Oh boy.

455
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,840
If this was a very different kind of podcast we would have just pierced our ears live on

456
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
stage.

457
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Oh I got it on working.

458
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Hey there we go.

459
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,000
All right.

460
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,560
Now it's now it's set now we're ready to do it.

461
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,620
And you know what like Joe Roady I should say Joe Roady likes to gather you know trinkets

462
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,600
and totems from places that he visits all over the world.

463
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,320
And in keeping with that I want to say that these earrings all came from a store called

464
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Icing at the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg Illinois.

465
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
The habitat of Mike Carlson.

466
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Yes I was born and raised there.

467
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,320
And you'll get to hear all about it in five hours.

468
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Driving home.

469
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Driving home.

470
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Oh my god.

471
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,320
When we take our inner mission.

472
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,320
I hope everyone bought their pajamas.

473
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
Well that's it.

474
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
We're ready to we're ready to do it.

475
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:03,320
We are ready to talk about Avatar Avatar flight of passage.

476
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Now this is just as we get going I just want to say this is one of those attractions.

477
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,320
There's this newfangled thing in Disney attractions of the last few years where everything is

478
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
multiple things.

479
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,320
You're in Star Wars Galaxies Edge which is in Batuu and specifically Black Spire Outpost.

480
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,320
You're in Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout where you visit the Tyvon collection

481
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
which is housed inside the collector's fortress.

482
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,320
And in this one you are in Pandora the world of Avatar in the Valley of Moara visiting

483
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,320
the Pandoran Conservation Initiative working in tandem with Alpha Centauri Expeditions.

484
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,320
And in this you're going to fly on a banshee which is also known as an Ikran.

485
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,320
You will who you will fuse with Ikran in a process known as Ikni Maya.

486
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Ikni Maya.

487
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Ikni Maya.

488
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Now that is the flight of passage.

489
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,320
But do not confuse it with Ikni Maya a region in the heavenly mountains.

490
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Context is important so make sure you know what's Ikni Maya you're referring to.

491
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
You know what this actually brings up a good point.

492
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,320
I think there's going to be a lot of terms we're going to be throwing out during the show.

493
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,320
You better bit a verse.

494
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,320
So I mean obviously like everyone scan this will have 30 seconds to learn it.

495
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

496
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
So like all Nagati kami is I see you.

497
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Okay.

498
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Obviously if you want to thank us at any point during the show for all this wonderful content.

499
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Ereo thanks.

500
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Yes.

501
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,320
And what we would say to you is Frufian.

502
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,320
We're happy to visit.

503
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,320
So just obviously five more seconds and then you'll have this memorized.

504
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,320
One two three four five.

505
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Got it.

506
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
All right.

507
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
We're good.

508
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
And then.

509
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Well do we also.

510
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Is this a good time to talk about some of the characters who you meet.

511
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
Yes.

512
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,320
This is another thing you guys are going to have to know before we start.

513
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
Yeah.

514
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,320
So let's just we're going to bring up some of the famous characters from this ride.

515
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,320
And it's going to be it's a little bit of a quiz.

516
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,320
So we but we just want to make sure you're on the same page with us before we get into the queue of Flight of Passage.

517
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,320
So OK here.

518
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,320
This is Dr. Stevens.

519
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
That's Dr. Stevens.

520
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
OK.

521
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Yeah.

522
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Yeah.

523
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Keep going.

524
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
OK.

525
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
The Mighty Akron.

526
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
And I'd like to do a quick side note.

527
00:30:38,320 --> 00:31:00,320
If you are all to Google the Mighty Akron the phrase the Mighty Akron the first two results are me.

528
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,320
It's possible I made up the phrase the Mighty Akron.

529
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I didn't know this until this morning.

530
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,320
You Mandela effect yourself.

531
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
I thought that's something from the movie.

532
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
It might not be.

533
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,320
I may have created that phrase anyway.

534
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,320
So the Mighty Akron aka the Banshee.

535
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,320
And then I've already forgotten this character this creature's name Scott you have it.

536
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
I think I know it somewhere.

537
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,320
That is the Leon Lianna Tarex the great Leon Tarex or Leon Tarex Rex.

538
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Yes.

539
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Got it.

540
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Great.

541
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Got it.

542
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
All right.

543
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,320
Now this is this is Dr. Jackie Ogden.

544
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:49,320
Now I want to make sure that you don't confuse her with Avatar movie character Dr. Grace Augustine.

545
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,320
Never never.

546
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Dr. Ogden is not Dr. Augustine.

547
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,320
Please remember that.

548
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,320
So let's recap.

549
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:10,320
This is Dr. Ogden and then this is also Dr. Ogden.

550
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,320
She's on the contraption that would eventually be the queue the right excuse me.

551
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
All right.

552
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Now this is Dr. Augustine.

553
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,320
A CGI replication.

554
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Why you don't have an answer for why that one.

555
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
I don't know.

556
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,320
You have an answer of where that is from.

557
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,320
I Google searched it and I just threw it into the presentation.

558
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,320
This is Dr. Augustine as an avatar.

559
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:52,320
And of course this is also Dr. Augustine who does not appear in the queue at all.

560
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
So make sure you don't confuse her.

561
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Remember this.

562
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
It doesn't matter.

563
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Yes.

564
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,320
And then a couple of two quick other characters Parker Selfridge.

565
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,320
No pop for Parker Selfridge.

566
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,320
And then I think what it would.

567
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
I guess that's it.

568
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I think that's it.

569
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
No I saw something else.

570
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
What do you mean?

571
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
That character looks cool.

572
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Parker Selfridge?

573
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
No it wasn't Parker Selfridge.

574
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
He was looking for the unobtainium.

575
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Parker Selfridge is great.

576
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
I love him.

577
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
I saw something else.

578
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
No it's not.

579
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
That was it.

580
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
That was it.

581
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
That was all of it.

582
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
No.

583
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
No.

584
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,320
It's Parker Selfridge.

585
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
God damn.

586
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
I will leave.

587
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,320
I could be on these rides right now except not because they close around 10.

588
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
I could be near them.

589
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
I don't know what.

590
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Look maybe there's just maybe there's some sort of parasite in my system and we'll look at it later.

591
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Uh oh.

592
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Yes.

593
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
There might be a parasite in all of our systems.

594
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
We shall see.

595
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,320
I mean I guess you could describe our insane theme park as a parasite.

596
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
And you know what?

597
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,320
You've all got it.

598
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
That's okay.

599
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,320
It's pretty common around these parts.

600
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:19,320
So I mean like before we get before we get in there is there anything we'd like to say about the queue before you meet all these these colorful characters.

601
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,320
It's an amazing queue as everybody knows.

602
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Yeah it's very it's a it's very long.

603
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Sure.

604
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,320
There's no bathroom.

605
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,320
But they have a system now I believe.

606
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,320
And correct me if I'm wrong where you can like get out of line and come back.

607
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Yes I'm hearing a yes.

608
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,320
So there's that I hear they've corrected that on the rise of the resistance.

609
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Is that correct?

610
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Someone back me up here.

611
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
Oh hopefully.

612
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Okay.

613
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
Okay.

614
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Now now am I just I'm confused maybe is flight of passage the ride where the like barbershop quartet sings at you until you're allowed to go on the ride.

615
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I think you're thinking of Jimmy Fallon.

616
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Oh okay okay.

617
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Grace Augustine Dr.

618
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Ogden Jimmy Fallon.

619
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
And again you will not hear anything about race through New York with Jimmy Fallon.

620
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,320
Unless you go behind the paywall.

621
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Coming soon coming soon.

622
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
The queue is the queue is faint.

623
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Let's let's drop the jokes for a second.

624
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
The queue is fantastic.

625
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
It's great.

626
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Yeah.

627
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,320
We got through it pretty quickly as we were like there at rope drop.

628
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,320
We were very yes we were very shocked at how quick it went.

629
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Early but yeah and it's got you know I like it's got a move it's got movement.

630
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,320
It's got you know there's the outside then there's the you know you have different settings.

631
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,320
There's the lab with the scariest Navi in a tank.

632
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Yeah.

633
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
There is it does everyone obviously knows this right.

634
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,320
There's a eight foot tall life size Navi floating in liquid and it's just bobbing there.

635
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Good point.

636
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
It's an avatar.

637
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
It's not a Navi.

638
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Oh yeah.

639
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
That's a body.

640
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
You absolute dullard.

641
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Boo.

642
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Yeah boo this man.

643
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Boo this man.

644
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,320
What a foul.

645
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Oh my God.

646
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,320
James Cameron is going to be upset.

647
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:24,320
He's got a transmission to his sub right now that I'm maybe not the big avatar fan he thought I was.

648
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:31,320
You're going to be on the no iknemaia list.

649
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Never again.

650
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Yeah it's all very cool.

651
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
That's that's extremely creepy.

652
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,320
You're right because if you don't know any if you if you somehow you don't know the mythology of avatar very well.

653
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,320
You might think that that thing is dead.

654
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,320
You're being preserved in a way similar to what people think happened to Walt Disney.

655
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Right.

656
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,320
I mean maybe it's possible they did model the tank after his tank.

657
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Uh huh.

658
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Is that a little Easter egg like in the way in the part like oh yeah that's where Walt used to live or this is the kind of chili he liked and that's the tank that he still is preserved in.

659
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Yeah I've been in the three of us.

660
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,320
I'm the only one who's been in Walt's apartment over on Main Street.

661
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,320
All right.

662
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,320
I'm just saying of the three of us who's the biggest fan you know.

663
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,320
I've been to the apartment and I've seen him in this tank.

664
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
That's what I'm saying.

665
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
You saw it.

666
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
You saw all.

667
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
That's the secret.

668
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Ah.

669
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Head attached or not.

670
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
What's that?

671
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Head attached or not.

672
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,320
The head is attached but he has that long navi braid.

673
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Oh for the link.

674
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,320
For the link yes.

675
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:55,320
I will say I am a rare bird in that I have never seen the movie Avatar but through osmosis I have learned a lot about the mythology from Mike Carlson.

676
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
I don't know what that is.

677
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
That's a shout out for not seeing Avatar.

678
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,320
How many people have not seen Avatar?

679
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Wow pretty good.

680
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
And you're proud of it too.

681
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:15,320
You did not take out a small personal loan in 2009 because you got to see it in IMAX and 3D and like 4K IMAX.

682
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Did you not see it because it was too expensive?

683
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,320
It was too expensive.

684
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
I wasn't working a lot.

685
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
It was 2009.

686
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
High to the recession.

687
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
You know right.

688
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,320
And everyone's like well you can't just see it in the regular movie theater.

689
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,320
I've almost watched it on a plane once or twice.

690
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,320
The ultimate version.

691
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,320
I think you should watch it on the ride back to Los Angeles.

692
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Oh yeah maybe.

693
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Yeah.

694
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Let's all go home and watch it tonight.

695
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Quick viewing.

696
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,320
You know what's fair we were like trying to think of Avatar music to when we revealed the topic and then like there's no like score.

697
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
There's not like the theme.

698
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
If you look theme for Avatar.

699
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,320
There's a there's that Celine Dion song.

700
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
No it's not.

701
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,320
It's like Leona.

702
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
Oh yeah you're right.

703
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Yeah but it's written by the isn't written by the same person who wrote Heart Will Go On.

704
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Am I wrong.

705
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Am I crazy.

706
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Heart Will Go On.

707
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Did I say that.

708
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Something like that.

709
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
It worked at short end.

710
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Gee clean up your fucking life man.

711
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
What's going on over there.

712
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
You're the guy who couldn't afford to see Avatar.

713
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,320
It was 10 years ago.

714
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,320
It was 10 years ago.

715
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,320
You were wearing a barrel with straps.

716
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
You took improv classes with me.

717
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
The Upright Citizen Brigade which was three.

718
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,320
I know I cleaned the toilets to do that.

719
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,320
Now you have sympathy again.

720
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,320
But who knows how many recessions will happen before Avatar 2 comes out.

721
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
We got time for a lot I think.

722
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,320
One of you said when we were at the Margaritaville Resort that it seemed like it was the place.

723
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,320
They're prepping for financial collapse.

724
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Why wait for the collapse to get in collapse mode.

725
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Getting it early.

726
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:14,320
They've already done that thing you see in old movies where they put their suitcase up and they just throw every item in it and they jam it closed.

727
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Speaking of that, I was thinking we should try to tell people everybody go see our sign.

728
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,320
But I don't think I want to punish people and make them go to Dreams of a Drive.

729
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:32,320
The Lyft driver drove us in and he goes, huh.

730
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,320
He was like, I don't know, did he say I've never been here before?

731
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,320
This is new.

732
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,320
We roam the mall too around there which is just desolate.

733
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,320
But there isn't it's sugar.

734
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,320
And the candy urine is in stock.

735
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Look under your seats.

736
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
That's not true.

737
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
What were we talking about?

738
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,320
The queue was very good.

739
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,320
The mercury sort of thing was really cool.

740
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Oh yes, all these wonderful little things.

741
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:21,320
If you're getting to rush through the line, which we were moving very quickly, all the little lab effects that seem to be done with magnets or some, they're all practical and physical.

742
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Yes, different like funguses.

743
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Someone has an idea of how it's done.

744
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Parafluins?

745
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Whoa.

746
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Therafluins?

747
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Therafluids I believe.

748
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
Therafluids, magnetic fluids.

749
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
Wow.

750
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Okay.

751
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Geez, thank you for doing our work for us.

752
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Yeah, can you just come to Mike's apartment sometime and just help us out.

753
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,320
But then, but you know, all right, so that's all very cool.

754
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:06,320
But obviously we are so much here to talk about the pre-show and the video with Dr. Stevens, who's instantly indelibly one of my favorite characters in Theme Park World.

755
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
In Theme Park World.

756
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,320
And I want to say something about Dr. Stevens.

757
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Dr. Stevens is played by a guy named David Danapour.

758
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,320
And David Danapour is an improviser.

759
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
He was on an improv team with my wife, Farron.

760
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,320
I saw him in a number of shows.

761
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
He was funny as hell.

762
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Just like really naturally, everything he said was really, really funny.

763
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,320
And so just shout out to David Danapour.

764
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,320
And I'm sorry, we're going to talk like you a bunch tonight.

765
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
But super, super funny guy.

766
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Yeah, congrats on booking that gig, man.

767
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
That's cool.

768
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, seriously.

769
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:49,320
So because this is like one of the longest eight minutes or so of Q informational material.

770
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,320
This is I think we've talked about before and I haven't done it in a couple of like a year and a half.

771
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,320
And it is so much longer than I remembered it being.

772
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,320
Yeah, it is.

773
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Yeah, I don't know exactly.

774
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
I don't have a time count.

775
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,320
Does anybody know the exact amount of time Dr. Stevens is talking to you?

776
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Does anyone work on Avatar flight?

777
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Oh, yeah.

778
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
No.

779
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,320
Because also obviously like they have the thing which is new in the rides where if there's something going wrong,

780
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
they have an extra little piece of the video to play.

781
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
They do it with Millennium Falcon.

782
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,320
And yeah, did I hear a boo for the Millennium Falcon?

783
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,320
Well, you know, yeah.

784
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,320
You know, what's pretty weird is that thing where Hondo says, Oh, wait, what's that?

785
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,320
There's an alien that's land and then nothing happens.

786
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,320
Yeah.

787
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
What is that about?

788
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,320
You really I get that they were like, we need a little story beat here to keep it, you know,

789
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,320
moving in case that there's something wrong, but make it a lot less interesting.

790
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Yeah.

791
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Very intriguing.

792
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Like, yeah, like, oh, the light bulb is broken on the outside of the ship.

793
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
Let's fix it.

794
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Let me and he goes and gets it or something and takes it out.

795
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Like, instead of like there's a monster on the outside of the ship.

796
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
That is that sounds thrilling.

797
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
And we're about to go back on another adventure.

798
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
A war is breaking out.

799
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Wait, never mind.

800
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Oh, my God.

801
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
The most interesting thing is happening right now.

802
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Back door opens.

803
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
All right, everybody.

804
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Let's go.

805
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
You did a bad job.

806
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,320
Come on out.

807
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Everyone does a bad job.

808
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
You're all losers.

809
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Let's go.

810
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
Come on.

811
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:31,320
OK, so but you it's very long because you need there's so much you need to know.

812
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,320
I mean, you need to know that you are being put into the body of an avatar and you're linking to an

813
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Ecrin and you're going to fly on it.

814
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
That's it, right?

815
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,320
I mean, I get it.

816
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
I get it.

817
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Fine.

818
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,320
But the ride decides that you need to learn a lot about the history of Dr.

819
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Jackie Ogden.

820
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,320
Using avatars to fly this way was all figured out by my boss, Dr.

821
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Jackie Ogden.

822
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,320
She leads our science team, which is part of the Pandora Conservation Institute, the initiative.

823
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,320
And we're here in the Valley of Moara studying banshees and their environment.

824
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Uh huh.

825
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Is that all it is, Jason?

826
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
Keep reading.

827
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Over a generation ago.

828
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Let's make it.

829
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
Jason has the full script at the ready.

830
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Should we need it?

831
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,320
This enormous company called the RDA created a lot of damage to the area through their bad mining

832
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,320
practices and conflicts with the Navi.

833
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,320
Just like on Earth, it can take decades for ecosystems to recover.

834
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,320
So it's very important we know the name of the company.

835
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,320
It's very important that we know that it is enormous.

836
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,320
It is not some rinky-dik mom and pop company.

837
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,320
Enormous company.

838
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Wait, let me see it again.

839
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,320
It's very important that it is bad mining practices.

840
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Yeah, we've been walking around for a few days and Scott just keeps saying bad mining practices.

841
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Bad mining practices.

842
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Damage to the bad mining practices.

843
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,320
If they've done good mining practices, we're in a problem.

844
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,320
But mediocre mining practices, maybe I let it slide.

845
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
But bad, I can't stand it.

846
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,320
That drives Dr. Stevens up the wall.

847
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,320
You could do a one-man show as Dr. Stevens.

848
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
Oh, yes.

849
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,320
Whoa, laboratory assistant interviews today.

850
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,320
Got to put on that classic Dr. Stevens charm.

851
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Disney Plus.

852
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
Here we go.

853
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
Disney Plus series.

854
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
Yeah.

855
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
Well, Danapour's got to play, but I'll run for it.

856
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,320
I'm the show runner.

857
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,320
I'm the writer.

858
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,320
Yeah.

859
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,320
You have his voice down.

860
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
Thank you.

861
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Not his literal voice.

862
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
Well, yeah.

863
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
It's a lot of fun to do.

864
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,320
It's fun to talk about bad mining practices.

865
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,320
It's fun to talk about keystone species.

866
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Every culture has keystone species.

867
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,320
They're not fun like keystone cops.

868
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,320
They don't run around in fast motion, make hijinks.

869
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
They do bad mining practices.

870
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
Wait, no.

871
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Keystone species are endangered.

872
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
They're good.

873
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
They're good.

874
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Mining practices are bad.

875
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,320
I was confusing the keystone species with the miners.

876
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
Yeah.

877
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
And there's an incredible thunder story.

878
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,320
There are haunted mansion effects being pumped into the air.

879
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
Yeah.

880
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
That is fun.

881
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,320
What's that?

882
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,320
Motorcycle.

883
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,320
That's what I thought, right?

884
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
Is somebody just outside revving their motorcycle?

885
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
No.

886
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,320
God damn right.

887
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
Church Street Station is right there.

888
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,320
And that's where the cool guys go.

889
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:36,320
When we, by the way, when we drove by Church Street Station, one of the...

890
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
Oh my God.

891
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,320
We get the message.

892
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,320
One of the entrances was closed off, which really didn't matter because no one was on it.

893
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
It was empty.

894
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
More empty spaces.

895
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Okay.

896
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,320
Jason, did you get into a fight with someone, a chicken guy?

897
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
And they're calling you out now?

898
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,320
Oh.

899
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
Uh-oh.

900
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,320
He told me I had to register before I could get the two free sauces.

901
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
And I'm pissed.

902
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
All right.

903
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
Anyway, back to the script.

904
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
Yeah, back to the script.

905
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,320
I mean, I will say, I mean, this was our first time going on it.

906
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
First time in the land.

907
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,320
The land is great.

908
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,320
It's beautiful.

909
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:33,320
I saw a Joe Roady lecture back in LA a month or so ago, and he just talked about like looking at classical paintings to try and figure out how they inspired awe.

910
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,320
And he applied.

911
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:44,320
They tried to apply that with like things of this nature, things of this scale, and the floating mountains were great and the foliage was great.

912
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:50,320
I took some pictures and like did a double take later in the day where I was like, my God, that looks really good.

913
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Yeah.

914
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Yeah.

915
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,320
But what's fun is saying these things.

916
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,320
Anyway, back to the cue.

917
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
Back to the man.

918
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,320
It's also important to know that banshees live high in rookeries.

919
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,320
Is it?

920
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,320
Is the whole thing killing time?

921
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Is that what this entire thing is about?

922
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
It is?

923
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,320
So that's what we're getting.

924
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,320
But wait, oh wait, you have specific information.

925
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
Oh, that's interesting.

926
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
The restaurant's very good.

927
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,320
But I would also say, so who's been on Guardians of the Galaxy in California?

928
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,320
Mission Breakout.

929
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Yeah.

930
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
That's another Joe Rohde ride.

931
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,320
And I would also say there's a lot of information you're told.

932
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,320
You got to get your my hands don't scan.

933
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,320
You're a student.

934
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
So you got to get in.

935
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,320
There's a gantry lift.

936
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,320
When you get into the gantry lift, scan your hands because again, my hands don't scan.

937
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
You know what?

938
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Do me a favor.

939
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Stand on your number.

940
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,320
Move your arms around.

941
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,320
The collector's got bad mining practices and you got to know that.

942
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,320
So when the collector comes here, scan your hands.

943
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,320
He lives up in a rookery.

944
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,320
You get in the gantry lift to get to the rookery.

945
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,320
So it feels like maybe he also likes a little plot.

946
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,320
That's all I'm saying.

947
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,320
I think so.

948
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:20,320
And in all of this, Dr. Ogden has brought up so much that I start to think that it's a scenario where Dr. Ogden was hurt or is missing.

949
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,320
And what the ride is about is rescuing Dr. Ogden, our beloved Dr. Ogden.

950
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:32,320
But then it becomes like, so proceed to the next room where you can watch a video with Dr. Ogden.

951
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,320
I think I said to you, we're not done with Dr. Ogden yet.

952
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:42,320
And you laughed like, haha, how could we possibly have more?

953
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,320
And then there she's like, I think she's on a bike in that.

954
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Do you have more here?

955
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:52,320
I was going to say about Dr. Ogden, you know, we mentioned we were there when the park opened.

956
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,320
So it's very early.

957
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,320
And, you know, on and off all trip, we've all been saying like, oh, I'm tired.

958
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,320
My back hurts.

959
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,320
My feet hurt.

960
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:07,320
Apparently, the way my being tired expresses itself is I thought that was Sigourney Weaver for about 20 minutes.

961
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,320
I was like, yes, of course, Sigourney Weaver.

962
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
She was in the movie.

963
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
I know she's in the movie.

964
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,320
I haven't seen it, but I know she was in the movie.

965
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,320
So now you understand why we put you through that tough quiz.

966
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,320
Yeah.

967
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,320
Tough exercise.

968
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,320
So you didn't know what can we get a refresher?

969
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,320
Do you have that?

970
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,320
Refresher.

971
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,320
We're not going to help you this time.

972
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,320
Training wheels are off.

973
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,320
Yes, Jason.

974
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,320
Thank you so much for doing this.

975
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,320
The audience, I could tell they wanted it.

976
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,320
Yeah.

977
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,320
All right.

978
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
This is Dr. Ogden.

979
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,320
All right.

980
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,320
This is Dr. Augustine.

981
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
All right.

982
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,320
This is Dr. Augustine.

983
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
Terrifying.

984
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,320
All right.

985
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,320
That's Dr. Augustine.

986
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,320
And this is Dr. Augustine.

987
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,320
No, no, stop it.

988
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,320
They don't need that part of the quiz.

989
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,320
What are you talking about?

990
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
This is a thing.

991
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
I saw a thing.

992
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
What are you talking about?

993
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
It's an action thing.

994
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,320
It's a sci-fi thing.

995
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,320
They make action figures.

996
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,320
Maybe I'm just tired.

997
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
I've been walking so much and sleeping so little.

998
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
All right.

999
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,320
Anyway.

1000
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:17,320
Are there any other choice selections, Jason, in this, what could have been just a live

1001
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,320
reading of the free show?

1002
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,320
Sure.

1003
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,320
Banshees live in Rookery.

1004
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,320
It's muttering.

1005
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,320
We'll all be muttering this before we die.

1006
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,320
Humans can't get anywhere near them without becoming their lunch.

1007
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,320
But the Navi and the avatars can.

1008
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,320
In fact, the Navi have been riding on the backs of banshees since their earliest history.

1009
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,320
Thanks to science, avatars can ride on banshees too.

1010
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,320
That's why you're linking to an avatar.

1011
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,320
It was Dr. Ogden who restarted the avatar program.

1012
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,320
Uh-huh.

1013
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
Is that it?

1014
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:58,320
It's because of her that you're able to go through this rite of passage today.

1015
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
And that's it.

1016
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
And then we move on and then we get on the ride.

1017
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,320
That's the ride.

1018
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
And then the ride begins.

1019
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,320
Pandora is a breathtaking natural world.

1020
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,320
I cannot wait for you guys to see it for yourselves.

1021
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:16,320
So he says, but then nine more tests unfold.

1022
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,320
And you know what?

1023
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:22,320
We've been doing this show for a little bit and we want to give you guys a chance to limber up.

1024
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,320
So go ahead and move around a little bit.

1025
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
Move your arms around a little bit.

1026
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,320
That helps us out.

1027
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,320
Okay, don't you feel better?

1028
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,320
I literally question this, not a bit.

1029
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,320
Is that it?

1030
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,320
Well, do you want the delayed version or not?

1031
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Oh my God.

1032
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
Here.

1033
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,320
All right, fine.

1034
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,320
Read the delayed version.

1035
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,320
This is parenthetical.

1036
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,320
In case of a loading delay ahead of you, these extra lines may be added at this point in the video to take up some extra time.

1037
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,320
So let's get ready for our next, huh?

1038
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,320
Huh?

1039
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,320
Huh?

1040
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,320
I'll be right back.

1041
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Put the standby system on quickly.

1042
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Standby.

1043
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Yeah.

1044
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,320
And then you even get it.

1045
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:07,320
And then so then one more room where there's even a ton more explanation about like sliding your thing into the back of the cubbies.

1046
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:14,320
And you get to meet Dr. Ogden who tells you again, you'll be getting on a...

1047
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:22,320
You really think like you're going to be on the right and she's going to all of a sudden you're going to look to your left and she's going to wave to you from the back of it.

1048
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,320
Like at least something.

1049
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,320
Or like, thank you.

1050
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,320
You saved me.

1051
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,320
Yeah.

1052
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,320
Your healing touch saved me.

1053
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Yeah.

1054
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Thank you.

1055
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:42,320
And isn't now, of course this is all wonderful, but you're in that queue and you're in the world of Pandora and aren't you thinking, isn't this really just a plused up green planet at the end of the day?

1056
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,320
Isn't it really just the home?

1057
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
Yeah.

1058
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
They got there first, the OG.

1059
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:55,320
So you want the... you're expecting to see the flop, glop, glop, glop.

1060
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Come on, man.

1061
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
I'm trying.

1062
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
Get it together.

1063
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
I'm sorry.

1064
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
Just for...

1065
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Okay, so we read all of that.

1066
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,320
Just to compare, this is what you hear before Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

1067
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Howdy, partner, for your safety.

1068
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,320
Remain seated with your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside the train and be sure to watch your kids.

1069
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:18,320
And you folks are wearing hats and glasses, best remove them because this here is the wildest ride in the wilderness.

1070
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
That's it.

1071
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
That's it.

1072
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:28,320
That's the whole spiel before, can you imagine if it was the length of that?

1073
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Howdy, partner, welcome here.

1074
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,320
Let me tell you about the company that built the train, all right?

1075
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,320
It's a long story, so sit down.

1076
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,320
First things first, Barnabas T. Bullion is not a nice guy to work for.

1077
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,320
Take a look at those houses, those businesses over there.

1078
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,320
Let me tell you one by one who owns each one and what the business does.

1079
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,320
First one's a saloon, you want a sarsaparilla, you can get it there.

1080
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
But you're paying in company script.

1081
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,320
See, company script is like money, but it's not money.

1082
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,320
You can only use it at the company.

1083
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,320
Let me tell you a little bit about my kids.

1084
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,320
There's five of them and I only like three.

1085
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
There's only ten more minutes of this.

1086
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,320
The two that were left died of typhoid.

1087
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,320
Yee-haw!

1088
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Hell yeah.

1089
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
Now on to the next room for more.

1090
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,320
Wiggle your arms around a little bit.

1091
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,320
Helps me out.

1092
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,320
I'm just getting on that train and I'm wondering how was I able to get on this?

1093
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
Did my hands stand or not?

1094
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,320
You got to link up to the train engine, my man.

1095
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,320
Usually you need a ticket for a train.

1096
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,320
You can't just walk onto it for free willy-nilly.

1097
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,320
Link up your bindle to the train.

1098
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,320
Yeah, so it's a contract.

1099
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,320
That's how we do things now.

1100
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
They did things differently back then.

1101
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,320
All that being said, then you get on the ride and the ride's really cool.

1102
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,320
We all like the ride, right?

1103
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:14,320
You fly and it's great.

1104
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,320
We established a link using powerful psionic amplification equipment.

1105
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:24,320
A human driver is connected to an avatar, which would be physically hundreds of kilometers away.

1106
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,320
There is another page of this.

1107
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,320
But it's really cool when you do it.

1108
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,320
You know there's one part where it flips upside down?

1109
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,320
This is Dr. Ogden.

1110
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,320
Once the link takes place, you'll be connected to your avatar and sitting on the back of an acron.

1111
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
It'll feel like you're really there.

1112
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,320
This is the point where I'm going to say, as we were waiting in the queue, Mike just kept saying,

1113
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,320
you can feel it breathing between your legs.

1114
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,320
You can!

1115
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,320
And you just can't. You said it so much.

1116
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,320
I think I said, to be fair to me, I said it.

1117
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,320
You can feel the great beast breathe between your legs.

1118
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,320
I use flowery fun language to excite them. They hadn't been on before.

1119
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:12,320
And then we're on the ride. We go down the first drop.

1120
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,320
We're taking it in. It's the most immersive ride we've ever been on.

1121
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,320
I'm not on earth anymore. I'm in Pandora.

1122
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:24,320
And until I am pulled out of it by you saying, hey, feel the great beast breathing between your legs.

1123
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,320
I think it's possible you miss it on your first time.

1124
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:36,320
And I honestly, I like to just sort of maybe one hand out and one hand on the beast.

1125
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,320
What?

1126
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,320
I love it. That's not a joke.

1127
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,320
Like it's a fucking Clydesdale?

1128
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
Like, yeah, good.

1129
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
I'm not slapping it.

1130
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,320
Good fella. Good boy.

1131
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,320
I'm just sort of like, I'm caressing it.

1132
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,320
That'll do. That'll do.

1133
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,320
Like you're checking it for testicular cancer.

1134
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
I'm not doing this.

1135
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,320
I'm not squeezing it. I'm like Black Beauty or something. The horse.

1136
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,320
I'm just petting its mane.

1137
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,320
That sort of, I guess I have a connection to the animal. I'm sorry.

1138
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Well, the connection is established by a link with a powerful psionic energy.

1139
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,320
Unbelievable. I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm getting banshee shamed.

1140
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:30,320
I think it's fair to say you are the most, three of us, you're the one most wrapped up into the kingdom of avid. Is it a kingdom?

1141
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,320
Yeah, I live my life by sort of the Navi code.

1142
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,320
That's sort of what you're talking about. Yeah.

1143
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,320
You could very well be the forthcoming character, the seed bearer.

1144
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,320
We're all psyched for the seed bearer.

1145
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
Is that the next one or is that?

1146
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,320
I think that's two more. Is that four?

1147
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
That's the fourth one?

1148
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
We don't get to meet the seed bearer.

1149
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,320
Well, we might meet the seed bearer.

1150
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,320
Yeah, that could be the seed bearer's movie.

1151
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:07,320
Seed bearer might be like Supreme Leader Snoke and then gets killed in the fourth.

1152
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:12,320
But we won't see the full story of the seed bearer until our lives are drastically different.

1153
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
We have grandchildren.

1154
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,320
I'm back in the barrel because there's another recession.

1155
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,320
Hey, hey, hey, brother, spare a dollar so I can see Avatar six.

1156
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:33,320
Spare a future dollar because it's 3022.

1157
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,320
Yeah.

1158
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,320
So, oh, you know, we missed this.

1159
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,320
Oh, yeah. Oh, the groundbreaking.

1160
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,320
Yes, indeed.

1161
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:49,320
Yes. Well, for the listener, what we're showing you, we've admired this photo for a long time.

1162
01:00:50,320 --> 01:01:03,320
There are six human beings and one Navi and all of them are breaking ground on Pandora using giant blue shovels

1163
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:17,320
because that is what a Navi person would use to dig in the way that we all use, you know, skin colored like tannish shovels.

1164
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,320
I mean, sort of, wood, I guess.

1165
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,320
You know, I got a honey.

1166
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,320
I'm sorry. I got to run to Home Depot.

1167
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,320
I got to get a new flesh shovel, the shovel that looks like flesh.

1168
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,320
We will find out more about these shovels in Avatar eight, the shovel user.

1169
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,320
So we will see the blue shuttles again.

1170
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,320
But this is, of course, like you can this picture is hanging in Pandora.

1171
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:53,320
You can see this in the land, but it is like gaslighting us because they photoshopped out an executive who is no longer.

1172
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,320
I don't have the other photo. Is this the photo with the taken out block?

1173
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,320
The person who's blocked this.

1174
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,320
The original. So they said they take stags out.

1175
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,320
Yeah. Oh, because they were both gone.

1176
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
This is gone.

1177
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,320
Stop. Okay, that's it.

1178
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:15,320
That's it. So as if he's frame just like over here.

1179
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,320
Did they?

1180
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,320
They fucking deepfake this photo.

1181
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:36,320
This is what is the this is what they do because they're like we saw the Disney Plus Twitter stuff where it's like miracle on 34th Street, a Disney film.

1182
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,320
No, not true. I remember I was there.

1183
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,320
It's like you briefly showing Chucko.

1184
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,320
I know you did it.

1185
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Come on.

1186
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,320
This is always made national geographic.

1187
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,320
You've always been the caretaker.

1188
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
Or it's similar.

1189
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:02,320
We've you know, we've we've talked before we've been talking this week about the photos where the cigarettes are photoshopped out of Walt's hand.

1190
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:09,320
Well, it's famous. Yeah, which fortunately he did found a company where a lot of people have to do a two finger point.

1191
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,320
So it looks weird, but it's kind of justified.

1192
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,320
Who everyone here who has to do that for their job put two fingers in the air.

1193
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,320
All right.

1194
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
Like you just don't care.

1195
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,320
Wow. That's a lot.

1196
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,320
Oh my God.

1197
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,320
Well, they can't.

1198
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,320
That's not right.

1199
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,320
They can't lie to us.

1200
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,320
We remember this man, Tom Skaggs.

1201
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,320
Tom Staggs.

1202
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,320
Staggs.

1203
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,320
And we remember the other person.

1204
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,320
We know.

1205
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,320
And we know.

1206
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,320
I see you.

1207
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,320
I see you.

1208
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,320
Which way?

1209
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
Wait, this one?

1210
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,320
That's Staggs.

1211
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,320
That's Staggs.

1212
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,320
Okay. I see.

1213
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,320
No!

1214
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,320
Surely someone else saw it.

1215
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,320
Am I going mad?

1216
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,320
Yes.

1217
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,320
Yes. Yes.

1218
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,320
We don't know what that is.

1219
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,320
Let's gaslight Scott.

1220
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,320
Yes.

1221
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,320
No.

1222
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,320
Everyone was so nice to me about the scary rides.

1223
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,320
Now you've turned.

1224
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,320
Are you being mean just because we read instructions to you for half an hour?

1225
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,320
Yes.

1226
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,320
We're being told yes.

1227
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:25,320
We did Rock and Roller Coaster and Tower of Tower like in one hour, within one hour.

1228
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,320
Yeah.

1229
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,320
The bravest tower.

1230
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:35,320
The thought of doing that like back to back with that little amount of time to recover

1231
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,320
for the first time compared to like the 90s where it's like, all right, you waited an

1232
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,320
hour, you rode it, you had another hour to wait.

1233
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
Like, good job, Scott.

1234
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,320
Thank you.

1235
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,320
Wow.

1236
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,320
Keep getting applause for that.

1237
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,320
Also, the mummy launch is not scary at all.

1238
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,320
What was my problem?

1239
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,320
No idea on that one.

1240
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,320
Okay.

1241
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:01,320
But so now is it time to talk a little more in depth about the ride?

1242
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,320
Okay.

1243
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,320
Yeah, yeah.

1244
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,320
The ride itself.

1245
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,320
I mean, yeah.

1246
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,320
Okay.

1247
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,320
So it's like when there's a lights part.

1248
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,320
Oh, yeah.

1249
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,320
It's the part where you land and then you really feel the breathing.

1250
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,320
It's beautiful.

1251
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,320
And yeah.

1252
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,320
You stop and you look at the lights appear.

1253
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,320
That's cool.

1254
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,320
The lenses and the glasses are rectangular, but my glasses are more circular.

1255
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,320
So there was one or two things that were a little blurry.

1256
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,320
How am I expected to see Vaco if I cannot see Vaco?

1257
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,320
Wow.

1258
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:44,320
I wrote that down in the line for the boat ride.

1259
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,320
Wow.

1260
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,320
Like right afterwards.

1261
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,320
I was like, I gotta write this?

1262
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,320
Yeah, geez.

1263
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,320
And a great job to you as well.

1264
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,320
Thank you.

1265
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,320
Great.

1266
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,320
The line is cool.

1267
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,320
It's fine.

1268
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,320
Yeah, it's fine.

1269
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,320
It's cool.

1270
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
And then a big whale pops up and you go through a wave and then your words can be scary and

1271
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,320
it's not.

1272
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,320
And that's the ride.

1273
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,320
And that's what we have to say about the ride.

1274
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,320
It's great.

1275
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,320
It's really good.

1276
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,320
That's Avatar Flight of Passage.

1277
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,320
Yeah.

1278
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,320
Yeah.

1279
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:12,120
We may revisit this at some point, but this is a rare thing where we're actually going

1280
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,320
to fit in a segment.

1281
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,320
Yes.

1282
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,320
Yeah.

1283
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,320
One of our famous segments.

1284
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,320
Yeah.

1285
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,320
That we committed to doing beyond episode three.

1286
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,960
Which of our three segments have we ever done?

1287
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:32,320
When we were first formulating this show, we wrote down so many segments.

1288
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:38,360
We had meetings about segments and then we just started talking and haven't stopped for

1289
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,360
two years.

1290
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,360
Yeah.

1291
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:44,320
But there's a fun thing.

1292
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,800
I've sort of put together this.

1293
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,680
Scott and Jason don't really know a lot of the details, but I've put together our famous

1294
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:57,800
segment, Souvenir Smackdown.

1295
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,320
One of our early finds.

1296
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,120
Oh yeah.

1297
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,240
Pooh and his human girlfriend.

1298
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,240
It's common law wife.

1299
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,240
On a shirt?

1300
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,240
Oh yeah.

1301
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,240
You got a shirt.

1302
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,240
Yeah.

1303
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,240
We got a shirt in the house.

1304
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,240
We got the shirt.

1305
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,240
Wow.

1306
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,240
Thanks for house lights.

1307
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,240
Yeah.

1308
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,240
Amazing.

1309
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,240
Go, go, go.

1310
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,240
Wow.

1311
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,520
Again, we did not make that shirt.

1312
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,520
Someone else did.

1313
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,160
Izzy cannot come after us.

1314
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,160
We love to see it.

1315
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,760
But since here's the thing.

1316
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,040
Usually we're playing against each other.

1317
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:34,720
The game sort of works best with three people.

1318
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,120
We can't just do two?

1319
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,120
That doesn't matter.

1320
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,120
It's not as fun.

1321
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,840
I mean, I think it would be fun if we played with someone else.

1322
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:46,080
Somebody who might have like experience collecting collectibles and also might have Smackdown

1323
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,080
experience.

1324
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,080
Oh.

1325
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,080
What do you mean?

1326
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Who could that be?

1327
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,080
What is it?

1328
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,080
What?

1329
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,600
What are you talking about?

1330
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,600
What's any of this?

1331
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,680
Well, if the slide would work.

1332
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,680
Is it the collector?

1333
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,680
Tyvon?

1334
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,680
Woo woo woo.

1335
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,680
You know it.

1336
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,680
What?

1337
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,680
What's going on?

1338
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,680
Are you on your way?

1339
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,680
Oh.

1340
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,680
Oh.

1341
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,680
What's up?

1342
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:22,120
We got to pretend we didn't take hands for that.

1343
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
What's up?

1344
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,120
Ladies and gentlemen.

1345
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,120
What's up, big man?

1346
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,120
Zach Ryman.

1347
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,120
All right, I'm here.

1348
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,120
Wow.

1349
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,120
Hey, man.

1350
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,120
What's the deal, man?

1351
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,720
So we're playing souvenir Smackdown.

1352
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
Okay.

1353
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,720
Yeah.

1354
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,760
So basically you're going to what the what are you wearing, dude?

1355
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Oh, it says we're all.

1356
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,760
Oh, yeah, we all got it.

1357
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,760
It's very nice.

1358
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,760
I have my Uris Pierce.

1359
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,760
Can I get one?

1360
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,760
You know what?

1361
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,760
I have the spirit of kindness.

1362
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,760
I have this like it's a clip on.

1363
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,760
It's a clip on.

1364
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,760
So even better.

1365
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,760
All right.

1366
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Wow.

1367
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
How do I look?

1368
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Oh my God.

1369
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
All right.

1370
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
So we see you.

1371
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,760
We see you.

1372
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,760
We see a Sivako.

1373
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,760
Right.

1374
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,760
Well, I know you'll rise to the challenge like the Navi people say.

1375
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,800
So basically the game is going to work like this.

1376
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:10,800
I'm going to show some items I found on eBay and you're all going to guess how much this

1377
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,800
person is selling the item for.

1378
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,800
Okay.

1379
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Okay.

1380
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,800
So you let's you know what?

1381
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,800
Let's we can move this chair over here.

1382
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,800
Okay.

1383
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,800
Or if you want to sit.

1384
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,800
You know what?

1385
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,800
I'm going to pop down on the lid.

1386
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,800
Okay.

1387
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,800
So I sit here?

1388
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,800
Yeah.

1389
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,800
Sit there.

1390
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,800
All right.

1391
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,800
I was.

1392
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,800
Oh, here's a piece of paper.

1393
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,800
So we're going to keep you.

1394
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,800
Okay.

1395
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,800
So we're going to keep you.

1396
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,840
Okay.

1397
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,840
So we're going to keep score.

1398
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,840
So we're going to keep score.

1399
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,840
There we go.

1400
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:44,360
I feel like maybe we won't care about the score after a few rounds, but we'll see.

1401
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,600
So okay.

1402
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
So let's get started here.

1403
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,760
I have 10 different items from eBay.

1404
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,760
Okay.

1405
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:57,360
And we don't have to do all of them if you need to go somewhere.

1406
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,400
You can see why we didn't talk about flight of passage more.

1407
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,400
Who cares?

1408
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,400
10 items.

1409
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:11,000
So for item number one, 1982 very rare Epcot Center Canada Pavilion serving tray prop.

1410
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Oh, sweet.

1411
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Are we booing or wooing?

1412
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I had a Labats.

1413
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,360
There was a horrible thunderstorm and we ran to where to seek refuge and we ended up in

1414
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:29,400
a little Canada store and I got a Labats and it calmed my jangled nerves.

1415
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,720
I'm still scared of some stuff.

1416
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,720
Nature.

1417
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,720
Labats rules.

1418
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:38,680
All right, Jason, how much do you think the person on eBay is selling this for?

1419
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:39,680
$50.

1420
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,680
$50.

1421
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,080
Scott, how much do you think?

1422
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,320
Ooh, maybe I'll take it lower to 30.

1423
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,320
30.

1424
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,360
Now we're talking like buy it now or their bids.

1425
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,840
This is just what it starts out as.

1426
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,240
Oh, this looks like junk to me.

1427
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,240
Five bucks.

1428
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,240
$50.

1429
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,240
Good, good.

1430
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,240
Okay, now.

1431
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:02,280
It might be all just Canadian so I can say that.

1432
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,280
That's right.

1433
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,280
Is anyone Canadian here?

1434
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,880
Oh.

1435
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,440
Anyway.

1436
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,800
So the answer to how much this item is going for on eBay, $600.

1437
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
Jason.

1438
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,800
Wait a minute.

1439
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,160
Are there any bids or it's just?

1440
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,520
Well, I will tell you this.

1441
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:32,840
Unlike the other items on this, this sold for $600 and was the starting bid.

1442
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,840
That's unbelievable.

1443
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,840
$600.

1444
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,840
Jason Sheridan gets a point on the board.

1445
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,680
All right.

1446
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,680
So next up here.

1447
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:49,480
Oh, these are great.

1448
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,400
Walt Disney cartoon VHS collection volumes one, two, and three.

1449
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,360
I will show you what the VHS itself looks like.

1450
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,360
Dirty label.

1451
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,600
It's a dirty label Walt Disney Home video.

1452
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,600
I remember it.

1453
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,120
Scary rotating Mickey inside.

1454
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,240
You know that logo with the multiple color?

1455
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,240
Yeah, it's terrifying.

1456
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,240
Okay.

1457
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
Now, what?

1458
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,240
What was that?

1459
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,240
Oh, guesses?

1460
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,240
Guesses.

1461
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,240
All right.

1462
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,240
Let's go.

1463
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,240
Jason.

1464
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,240
$10.

1465
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,240
$10.

1466
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
$10.

1467
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Scott.

1468
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,080
It's all three?

1469
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,160
It's all three tapes.

1470
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,560
This is what it starts out as on the eBay auction.

1471
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,520
Well, it wasn't there like jewel case or whatever you call it.

1472
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,400
The clam shells were starting to go for a lot.

1473
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,760
So like, let me go high 400.

1474
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,760
400.

1475
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,280
I'll go 300.

1476
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,280
So 100 free for me.

1477
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,280
All right.

1478
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:46,280
The person is selling this for one million.

1479
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,280
What?

1480
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:53,480
400 and it must be a joke or a drug front.

1481
01:12:53,480 --> 01:13:00,440
Honestly, you must like pay for it and you get like a crate full of drugs.

1482
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:05,960
I got to wonder what is the FBI have to say about all that?

1483
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,720
Do not reproduce.

1484
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,720
I don't know.

1485
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,720
Don't resell.

1486
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,720
Yeah.

1487
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,440
So, wait, who was that?

1488
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,440
That was me.

1489
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,440
That's you.

1490
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,440
Yeah.

1491
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,440
Okay.

1492
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,640
What's going on here?

1493
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,640
Thank you.

1494
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,640
Oh, Kohler.

1495
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,640
All right.

1496
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:31,120
This is Kohler Disney Mickey Mouse playful as a mouth bathroom remodel complete set.

1497
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:38,480
And this comes with this and this.

1498
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:45,480
So for the listener at home, Mickey hands can hold your paper towels and I think maybe

1499
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,920
your toilet paper down there as well.

1500
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,520
In this photo, it's like Mickey's been torn apart.

1501
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,520
His limbs all asunder.

1502
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,520
Yes.

1503
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:03,480
I buy a lot of shit on eBay, but this is absolute shit.

1504
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:08,600
Do you have any, you of course are the Michael Jordan of professional wrestling action figure

1505
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,600
collecting.

1506
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,600
Something like that.

1507
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Yeah.

1508
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
I think I got it a little bit wrong.

1509
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,880
Is there any, have you bought any sinks that feature professional wrestlers?

1510
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,120
No sinks, but I just bought the Macho Man workout set.

1511
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,920
It's this weight bench, like almost like a ghetto Bowflex.

1512
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,400
It's the Macho Machine.

1513
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,200
Oh, wow.

1514
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,400
Google that.

1515
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,400
Google that.

1516
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,400
The Macho Machine?

1517
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,400
The Macho Machine.

1518
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,600
Just got it last week.

1519
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
It's old though.

1520
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,600
Like mid nineties.

1521
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,600
Wow.

1522
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:42,960
Also, if anyone knows where to find the accountant behind the Macho Machine, please call in the

1523
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,960
attorney.

1524
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,960
The authorities are concerned for missing for years.

1525
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,960
I think it was Kurt.

1526
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,960
I think Kurt Hawkins got a shout out.

1527
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,960
Your tag team partner.

1528
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,960
I love that.

1529
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,960
So all right.

1530
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:04,560
How much is the person selling this on eBay for the Mickey Polar Disney Playful as a Mouse

1531
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,560
bathroom set?

1532
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,560
Yeah, a hundred bucks.

1533
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,560
A hundred bucks.

1534
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,560
Jason.

1535
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,560
I'm going to guess 500.

1536
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,560
500.

1537
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,560
I'm so confused.

1538
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,560
I'll say a thousand.

1539
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,560
Okay.

1540
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,560
9,000.

1541
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,560
What?

1542
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:26,720
I saw in sold there are people that have paid upwards of thousands of dollars for other

1543
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,320
Kohler Mickey bathroom sets.

1544
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,360
So this is apparently a hard to find item.

1545
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,560
Does anyone have a sink with Mickey on it?

1546
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,560
Hey buddy.

1547
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,560
Don't use too many squares.

1548
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,560
All right.

1549
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:50,560
Oh no.

1550
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,560
I would like to read.

1551
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,560
Okay.

1552
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,560
I would like for the listener at home.

1553
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,560
These are two.

1554
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,560
There's a Mickey and a Donald toy.

1555
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:07,560
They look like they went into like the machine from the fly, the movie The Fly, and they

1556
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,560
came out wrong.

1557
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,560
Like they were cloned wrong.

1558
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:18,560
And the description on this is vintage Mickey and Donald Ben's 1950s, 60s, beautiful and

1559
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,560
rare.

1560
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Sometimes dead is better.

1561
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,560
How much does the person want for this?

1562
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,560
I heard 350.

1563
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,560
2,000.

1564
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,560
2,000 says Jason.

1565
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:44,560
But maybe if you're crazy enough to think this is beautiful, you also don't know that

1566
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,560
you could get money for this kind of thing.

1567
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,560
So maybe it's like $70.

1568
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,560
I hear 70.

1569
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,560
I'm going to go low and say 15.

1570
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,560
$15.

1571
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,560
10 grand.

1572
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,560
Holy shit.

1573
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,560
We're going to post all of these online.

1574
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,560
So if you're listening, well, these are all be on Twitter.

1575
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,560
Do you have you?

1576
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,560
If you bought you have a Disney collection as well.

1577
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,560
You have a ton of action figures, mostly wrestling, but Star Wars, Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters,

1578
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,560
Disney, Disney.

1579
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,560
But what is the is there a prized Disney collectible you have?

1580
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,560
Not really.

1581
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,560
My big thing is like I like take things out of the package.

1582
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,560
I hate them in the box.

1583
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,560
There's a phrase you say, breathe, let them breathe about when it comes to toys.

1584
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,560
But if I'm buying something off eBay and it's out of the box, we call that loose.

1585
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,560
I don't trust the person who had it before.

1586
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:37,560
So I got to give it a fig bath, which means I give my toys like a bubble bath.

1587
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,560
There's nothing.

1588
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,560
There's nothing weird about that.

1589
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,560
Because you have to disinfect the figure.

1590
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,560
You know what I'm saying?

1591
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,560
Like what if someone had like dirty hands and was playing with the figure, packaging the figure, you know, right?

1592
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,560
God knows what they were doing with the figure.

1593
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,560
So you got to get it and you got to disinfect it.

1594
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,560
Give it a fig bath.

1595
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Sometimes, you know, the lights might be off.

1596
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,560
A candle might be lit.

1597
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,560
There's nothing wrong with that, though.

1598
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,560
Waste not, you know.

1599
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,560
For this audience and for us, that is not weird at all.

1600
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,560
I get that totally.

1601
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,560
Let me ask you a question.

1602
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,560
Are you in the bath with the figure?

1603
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Sometimes.

1604
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,560
Sometimes.

1605
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,560
It's a lot easier that way.

1606
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,560
Of course.

1607
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,560
Let me ask you this question.

1608
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,560
Sometimes when you're bathing the figures, do they ever fight?

1609
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,560
100 percent.

1610
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,560
Honestly, sounds like a lot of fun.

1611
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:30,560
I have the Bash of the Beach ring.

1612
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,560
It's meant to float.

1613
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,560
Is that true?

1614
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,560
That is true.

1615
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,560
Wow.

1616
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,560
I have an unboxing video on YouTube.

1617
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,560
Check it out.

1618
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,560
But I'm in the pool for that one.

1619
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,560
I'm in the pool for that one.

1620
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,560
Sorry, guys.

1621
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,560
Yeah, Bash of the Beach was an outdoor WCW pay-per-view.

1622
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,560
And it was, yeah.

1623
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,560
So there's a toy of a wrestling ring that floats in water.

1624
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,560
But that's not in the game.

1625
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:59,560
These current creatures, I wouldn't like, maybe you give them a fig bath and let them drown.

1626
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,560
All right.

1627
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,560
Who won that round?

1628
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,560
I did.

1629
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,560
Jason.

1630
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,560
All right.

1631
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,560
Jason's winning.

1632
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,560
He's up two.

1633
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,560
Yeah.

1634
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,560
I'm doing horrible.

1635
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,560
I'm embarrassed.

1636
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,560
All right.

1637
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,560
Here we go.

1638
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,560
These are all crazy.

1639
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,560
This is pre-named Duffy Duffy.

1640
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,560
What?

1641
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,560
Oh.

1642
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,560
Uh-oh.

1643
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,560
He has red eyes and he looks sick.

1644
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,560
Oh.

1645
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,560
Duffy Duffy.

1646
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,560
Duffy Duffy.

1647
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,560
Duffy Duffy.

1648
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,560
Duffy Duffy.

1649
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,560
Duffy Duffy.

1650
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,560
Duffy Duffy.

1651
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,560
Duffy Duffy.

1652
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,560
Duffy Duffy.

1653
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,560
Duffy Duffy.

1654
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,560
Duffy Duffy.

1655
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,560
Duffy Duffy.

1656
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,560
Duffy Duffy.

1657
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,560
Duffy Duffy.

1658
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,560
Duffy Duffy.

1659
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,560
Duffy Duffy.

1660
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,440
That is being chanted by somebody in the audience.

1661
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,440
It's a, which character?

1662
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,440
It's Jelatoni.

1663
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,440
Jelatoni.

1664
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,440
With the shirt.

1665
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,440
With the podcast the ride shirt.

1666
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,440
In a podcast the ride shirt.

1667
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,440
Wow.

1668
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,440
They said they were going to make it and they made it.

1669
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,440
Thank you.

1670
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,440
Wow.

1671
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,440
Wow.

1672
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,440
Bonkers.

1673
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,440
I went to Tokyo Disney.

1674
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,440
Uh, Tokyo Disney.

1675
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:55,440
See, I got that and Duffy for my fiance.

1676
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,440
She wasn't impressed.

1677
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,440
What?

1678
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,320
That's what happened to my girlfriend and I.

1679
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,320
Where's Lindsay?

1680
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,320
Where are you?

1681
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,320
Oh she's, where?

1682
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,320
Somebody's pointing here.

1683
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,320
Get him.

1684
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,320
Get his ass.

1685
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,320
Drag him queen.

1686
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,320
Lindsay K Sy.

1687
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,320
Oh wait, what?

1688
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,320
No, he was pointing at you.

1689
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,320
Oh.

1690
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:27,320
It would be really funny if someone was like, oh, you're pointing at me.

1691
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,400
And I'm like, that's me Lindsay.

1692
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,400
We have kissed before.

1693
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,400
I'm Lindsay.

1694
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,400
Oh, take me to your hotel.

1695
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,400
See you in Los Angeles.

1696
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,400
All right.

1697
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:48,540
Anyway, so weird red eyes, non-named Duffy Duffy.

1698
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,540
How much going for?

1699
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,540
$1500.

1700
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,540
$1500, says Jason.

1701
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:54,540
$700.

1702
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:55,540
Scott says $700.

1703
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:56,540
$500.

1704
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,760
$500.

1705
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,760
I hear $500.

1706
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,760
All right.

1707
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,760
$7,337.

1708
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,760
$14.

1709
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,760
Me or not?

1710
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,500
I just got a good one.

1711
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,080
They have all the Duffy's, all the pre.

1712
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,940
They have purple Duffy, they have green, so they have the whole collection of pre-Duffy

1713
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,780
Duffy, which is a thing.

1714
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:19,460
I feel like you, when the episode came out about Duffy, you were like, I don't do Duffy,

1715
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,740
and then you went to Tokyo Disney and you were like, I gotta get Duffy.

1716
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:22,740
You gotta get Duffy.

1717
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:23,740
You had more there.

1718
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:24,740
You were anti-Duffy.

1719
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:27,940
But I didn't buy any clothes, so Duffy's naked in my house.

1720
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:28,940
I think.

1721
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:29,940
Oh.

1722
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,940
Oh.

1723
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,940
All right.

1724
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:37,940
Obviously, all Duffy's should have podcast the right shirt.

1725
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:38,940
Yes.

1726
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,940
You've proven the only real way to do it.

1727
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,940
All right.

1728
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:43,940
So, what's his name?

1729
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:44,940
Jason.

1730
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,940
Is he my name yet?

1731
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:46,940
Oh, no, we're good.

1732
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:47,940
We're good on time.

1733
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,940
So, Jason again.

1734
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:49,940
Yeah.

1735
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,940
All right.

1736
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,940
So, Jason's up three.

1737
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:52,940
Yeah.

1738
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:53,940
And then, okay.

1739
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:55,140
So, here's the speed round.

1740
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:58,140
And when I say speed, slightly faster.

1741
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:59,140
All right.

1742
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:05,140
Is this a good time to say that you will be linked to an avatar via link chair?

1743
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,140
Yes.

1744
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,140
Has Dr. Octon helped with that?

1745
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:13,140
This is a speed round that I like to call the Michael Eisner collectible round.

1746
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,140
Wow.

1747
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:15,140
What?

1748
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:18,140
Oh, baby.

1749
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:19,420
I didn't.

1750
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,140
I was teasing this all day to them like I got some good stuff in here.

1751
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,340
Oh, my God.

1752
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:30,340
And there are a surprisingly large amount of Michael Eisner related items on eBay.

1753
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,340
Whoa.

1754
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,340
Oh, yes.

1755
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,540
You said you tapped a vein that you'd never tapped before.

1756
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:38,540
I never tapped a vein and I did today.

1757
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:39,540
Yeah.

1758
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:43,540
You found your own private unobtanium.

1759
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:48,540
But like Parker Selfridge, I obtained my Obtanium.

1760
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,540
Hello?

1761
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:50,940
Hello.

1762
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:51,940
All right.

1763
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:52,940
All right.

1764
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:57,940
So, the first in the Michael Eisner.

1765
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,540
Get to that sweet Eisner meme.

1766
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,540
Michael Eisner speed round.

1767
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,540
A Mighty Ducks.

1768
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:07,540
Mighty Ducks puck.

1769
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:13,040
Mighty Ducks, Michael Eisner sign, Anaheim, Mighty Ducks, 1994, global authentics.

1770
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,340
How much is this puck going for on eBay?

1771
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,340
Starting out price.

1772
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,340
Price or heaven?

1773
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:22,140
Hold on.

1774
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,140
I'm going to go lower 800.

1775
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,140
800.

1776
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,140
Scott?

1777
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:31,140
I'm just going to go way higher from that pattern and say $20,000.

1778
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,140
That's what I would pay.

1779
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:35,140
Not what you would pay.

1780
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:39,140
I'm going to go the total opposite way and say 15 bucks.

1781
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,140
15 bucks.

1782
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,140
Jason Sheridan, $400.

1783
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:45,140
Geez.

1784
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,140
God.

1785
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,940
Next up, young Michael Eisner headshot.

1786
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:50,940
Whoa.

1787
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:54,940
Hello.

1788
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,940
I see you.

1789
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,940
My man up here looking like a whole damn meal.

1790
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,940
God damn.

1791
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:07,940
Geez.

1792
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:09,940
Let me ask you this.

1793
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:14,940
We've talked a lot about on the show about buying, if they made like a premium Michael Eisner figure.

1794
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:15,940
Right.

1795
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:18,740
Or would you do it?

1796
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:19,740
I think I'd have to do it.

1797
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:20,740
Right.

1798
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:24,740
Are we talking like a plastic figure with articulation or like a stuffed animal figure?

1799
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,740
Oh, I haven't covered that.

1800
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:30,740
Well, as you'll hear on the episode that's dropping in like a few hours, we've come up,

1801
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:34,740
we like the idea of sort of a premium format hot toy style.

1802
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,740
With a soft good shirt.

1803
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:38,740
Soft good shirt.

1804
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:42,740
A recreation of the desk where he says hello.

1805
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,740
That's what we like.

1806
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:49,540
But also we think the idea of sort of making a baby Eisner plush is also good.

1807
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,540
So either or.

1808
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,540
Yes, you're in.

1809
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,540
I don't know about the baby.

1810
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,540
No, I don't know about that.

1811
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:57,540
All right.

1812
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,540
But the one with the nice shirt you're in.

1813
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,540
Yeah, the soft good shirt I'm in.

1814
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,540
All right, great.

1815
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:04,540
How much do we think this is starting out on eBay for?

1816
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,540
Unsigned?

1817
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,540
On autograph?

1818
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:10,540
It is press photo Michael Eisner, vice president.

1819
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:11,540
It's unsigned.

1820
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,540
$3.

1821
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,540
$3.

1822
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:16,340
Yeah, I gotta go.

1823
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:19,340
I'll say like 15.

1824
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:20,340
15.

1825
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,340
Jason.

1826
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,340
25.

1827
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,340
25.

1828
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,340
Oh, we are.

1829
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,340
It's tied between.

1830
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,340
1999.

1831
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:29,340
Oh, wow.

1832
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:32,340
Oh, so technically Scott wins.

1833
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,340
Yes, by a cent.

1834
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,340
Yes.

1835
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,340
That's some prices right shit.

1836
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,340
Oh, yeah.

1837
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,340
Here we go.

1838
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:40,340
Sneaked in there.

1839
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:44,140
A photo of Sylvester Stallone, Michael Eisner and John Travolta.

1840
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:47,140
It's in Annie Leibowitz.

1841
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,140
Look at the fine print.

1842
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,140
That's Annie Leibowitz.

1843
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,140
So you got Eisner here.

1844
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,140
You got Sylvester Stallone.

1845
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,140
You got John Travolta.

1846
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:54,140
Wow.

1847
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:59,140
How much is this photo starting out for on eBay?

1848
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,140
Jeez.

1849
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:01,140
In what?

1850
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,140
Yeah.

1851
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:05,140
And that's a scan of it?

1852
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,140
8 by 10.

1853
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,140
What's the size of this thing?

1854
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:11,740
It's a 12 by 18, 1983.

1855
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,740
You guys guess.

1856
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:13,740
I'm just interested in the article.

1857
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:14,740
I'm just gonna read it.

1858
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:15,740
It's a little pixely.

1859
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,740
Those pixels seem to say Jeffrey Katzenberg.

1860
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:24,100
I felt like I didn't want to look into it because our own imagination is so much greater

1861
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,820
about what they were all doing.

1862
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:30,740
I'm sure it was like Hollywood moneymakers of like 1983, right?

1863
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:31,740
Yes.

1864
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,740
Probably.

1865
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:36,820
We can all go home and write our own little short story about this.

1866
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:39,220
I think you three need to recreate that photo.

1867
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,220
Yeah.

1868
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,220
Oh yeah.

1869
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:42,220
Absolutely.

1870
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:43,220
Thank you.

1871
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:50,220
That's a good cover of the podcast.

1872
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,220
Yeah.

1873
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,860
We don't really have a script for that.

1874
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:54,660
Who's gonna wear the white suit though?

1875
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:55,660
Jason.

1876
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,660
Jason.

1877
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:02,340
You know, I had to do it to him.

1878
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:03,340
Right?

1879
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,900
Scott, I think you can do the Eisner pose there.

1880
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,980
Thank you.

1881
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:07,980
Yes.

1882
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:08,980
Sort of hand draped.

1883
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:09,980
Do you guys want to?

1884
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:10,980
Yeah.

1885
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:11,980
Yeah.

1886
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:12,980
There it is.

1887
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:13,980
All right.

1888
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:14,980
That would do it?

1889
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:15,980
Great.

1890
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:16,980
Hey.

1891
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:24,860
You guys want to come over?

1892
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,300
I'll put sheets over all the furniture.

1893
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:31,100
You can sit on it in an unorthodox way.

1894
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,060
Oh guys, you're here.

1895
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,060
Hello.

1896
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,060
Hello.

1897
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,220
You want to try a hello?

1898
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,220
Michael Eisner hello?

1899
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,220
Hello.

1900
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,220
Yeah.

1901
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,220
Oh yeah.

1902
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:43,220
Pretty good.

1903
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,220
All right.

1904
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:49,220
How much is this on eBay starting out?

1905
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,220
$7.

1906
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Jason.

1907
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,220
$20.

1908
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,220
$20.

1909
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,220
Yeah.

1910
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:55,220
Sir Rider.

1911
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,220
$15.

1912
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:57,220
$15.

1913
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:58,220
$49.99.

1914
01:27:58,220 --> 01:27:59,220
Geez.

1915
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,220
$20.

1916
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,220
So that's Jason, right?

1917
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,220
Yeah.

1918
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,220
All right.

1919
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,220
Good.

1920
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:10,580
I say good because I'm forgetting everything already.

1921
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,580
All right.

1922
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,380
Now we get to some good stuff here.

1923
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:20,620
A Michael Eisner trading card.

1924
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:25,620
So it's Michael Eisner owns Tops.

1925
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:26,620
Oh.

1926
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,620
Does he really?

1927
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:29,180
Owns Tops trading cards.

1928
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,180
What?

1929
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,180
Yes.

1930
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,180
Yeah.

1931
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,180
Wow.

1932
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,140
Not Breck.

1933
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:36,140
The other one.

1934
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:37,140
The other one.

1935
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,140
But we don't like the other one.

1936
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,140
We like Breck.

1937
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,140
Yeah.

1938
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,140
Breck had all the right ideas.

1939
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,140
Breck.

1940
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:43,140
Breck.

1941
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,140
Breck.

1942
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:45,140
Breck.

1943
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,140
Breck.

1944
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:47,140
Breck.

1945
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:48,140
Breck.

1946
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:49,140
Breck.

1947
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,140
Breck.

1948
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,140
All right.

1949
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:53,620
So this is Michael Eisner 2014 Tops.

1950
01:28:53,620 --> 01:29:02,620
Alan Ginter code breaker autograph auto 1 slash 1 Disney.

1951
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:06,060
What's up with the personalities?

1952
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:11,060
Again, we can make our own short story.

1953
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:14,060
All right.

1954
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:17,060
It's 70.

1955
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,060
70.

1956
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,060
Yeah.

1957
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,060
25.

1958
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:21,060
25.

1959
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,060
Jason.

1960
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:23,060
200.

1961
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:31,380
Jason Sheridan again wins $400 for this signed Michael Eisner.

1962
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:35,780
The presence of an autograph immediately bumps it up.

1963
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:39,580
Now here is the last thing.

1964
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:42,580
Jason has already won, so who cares?

1965
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:43,580
Yeah.

1966
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,580
All right.

1967
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:48,820
This is by far the weirdest thing.

1968
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:56,500
This is another trading card and it was made by the opposing trading card company, Not

1969
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,500
Tops.

1970
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,320
And upper deck, thank you so much.

1971
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,800
And it is a parody card of Michael Eisner.

1972
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,800
Whoa.

1973
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,800
Oh.

1974
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,800
Called Michael Beisner.

1975
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,800
B-U-Y.

1976
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:18,960
And it's for listening at home, it is like a distorted face, eye patch wearing backward

1977
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:26,480
baseball hat like Dick Tracy villain of Michael Eisner.

1978
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:30,280
The disrespect of the backwards baseball cap.

1979
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,240
And let me read the back of the card.

1980
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Here it is.

1981
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,240
What in the world?

1982
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:40,920
Upper deck welcomes this season's newest rookie, Michael Beisner.

1983
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:45,920
After humble origins as a page for a top TV network and stints that included crashing

1984
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:52,440
a Zamboni machine in an Anaheim hockey arena, he is now the top dog searching for a way

1985
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:57,080
to bring Bazonka Joe into the 21st century.

1986
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:02,800
As big cheese of his own cardboard kingdom, he is enthusiastically searching for the baseball

1987
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:08,240
cards his mom threw away and no one will be surprised to see a new big budget film titled

1988
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:12,440
Bazonka Joe and the Temple of Lost Trading Cards.

1989
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:19,880
In the very near future, upper deck wishes Beisner well in the candy business.

1990
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,000
I don't think I understand this beat.

1991
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,920
I don't know what they're getting at.

1992
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,920
I certainly don't.

1993
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,920
Yeah, I'm totally fucking confused.

1994
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,800
Guys, work it out amongst yourselves.

1995
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,000
But I wanted to end the show more on a tease.

1996
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:42,920
We have to investigate the feud between Michael Eisner and upper deck the trading card company.

1997
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,920
Yeah, yeah.

1998
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:50,920
And a good mood, like if I wanted to accuse Zack of being greedy, you'd be Zack Byder.

1999
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,920
Okay, yeah.

2000
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,160
How much does that sting?

2001
01:31:54,160 --> 01:32:00,160
Which honestly, if you've seen the amount of toys you buy, kind of works.

2002
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,160
It's a compliment.

2003
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,160
Before I came here, I was reorganizing my Star Wars stuff.

2004
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,160
Have you got anything cool?

2005
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,160
Who likes Star Wars here?

2006
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:13,160
I just finished the original Kenner vintage collection.

2007
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,160
Whoa, whoa.

2008
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:19,160
My last one in the mail this week, Luke Skywalker as a stormtrooper.

2009
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,160
Minty white, minty white.

2010
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,160
People are like in pain.

2011
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,160
All out of the box though, loose.

2012
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,160
No fig baths.

2013
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,160
Okay, so is that the most cherished part of the Star Wars collection?

2014
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,160
Of all your Star Wars stuff?

2015
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:37,160
Definitely, yeah, because I obviously wasn't born when those came out.

2016
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:42,160
So I didn't grow up with them, but I had to go back and get them, and it took me a while because they're pretty pricey.

2017
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,160
Sure, well, congratulations.

2018
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,160
Yeah, you got it.

2019
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,160
You're happier than we'll ever be.

2020
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:55,160
All right, so just for the hell of it, how much is Michael Beisner?

2021
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:57,160
Who would need this?

2022
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,160
There's no autograph.

2023
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,160
Michael Beisner didn't autograph it.

2024
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,160
Is it big?

2025
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,160
It's a regular card.

2026
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,160
Is it a regular card?

2027
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,160
I don't know, $8.

2028
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,160
Jason, are you on your phone?

2029
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,160
Yes.

2030
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,160
Is he cheating?

2031
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,160
It does not matter because I just bought it.

2032
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,160
Whoa!

2033
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,160
Yeah!

2034
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,160
Whoa!

2035
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:26,160
Yeah!

2036
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,160
Wow!

2037
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:29,160
Unbelievable.

2038
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,160
Good answer.

2039
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,160
Wow.

2040
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,160
Did you make an offer or buy it now?

2041
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,160
I did buy it now.

2042
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:38,160
Because it was 99 cents.

2043
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,160
Holy shit.

2044
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,160
You look so happy.

2045
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,160
I am so pleased with myself.

2046
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,160
Yeah!

2047
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,160
Jason Sheridan.

2048
01:33:55,160 --> 01:34:01,160
Except for the fact that I paid four times as much for shipping as I did for the item.

2049
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,160
Wow, wow.

2050
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,160
So Jason Sheridan, the winner of the game and the winner of life.

2051
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,160
Of Michael Beisner.

2052
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,160
What a good idea.

2053
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:15,160
Well, Mr. Ryder, do you have any parting words?

2054
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,160
Thank you again for coming here to participate.

2055
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,160
I love you.

2056
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,160
I'm just glad that you're wearing some fucking shoes.

2057
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,160
What was I wearing?

2058
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,160
I heard your story on Splash Mountain.

2059
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,160
You go in...

2060
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,160
Oh yeah!

2061
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,160
What?

2062
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,160
Oh man.

2063
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,160
With your bare feet.

2064
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,160
Tell your thoughts.

2065
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,160
It's fucking disgusting.

2066
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,160
Yeah!

2067
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:40,160
I don't want your sweaty, hairy feet anywhere near me.

2068
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:45,160
To be polite to explain, anybody who doesn't know, you have a thing that you like to do on Splash Mountain.

2069
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:50,160
I've done it like three times in the log.

2070
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:57,160
I will very quickly and subtly and not invasively remove my shoes and socks, put my socks away...

2071
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,160
It's disgusting.

2072
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,160
...and pull my shoes back on.

2073
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,160
Look, I will stop doing it.

2074
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,160
But sometimes I don't...

2075
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,160
I'm not like Jason.

2076
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,160
I don't want my feet and my socks soaking wet.

2077
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:13,160
That was great after Dudley Do-Right at 6 p.m. yesterday, the coldest day of the week.

2078
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:18,160
Feeling like I had just gotten hit by three buckets of water simultaneously.

2079
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,160
So I will stop doing that.

2080
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:25,160
Is there any other grievances you have with me on the phone?

2081
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,160
Oh yeah, good point.

2082
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,160
I think that's it, really.

2083
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,160
All right.

2084
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,160
Well, you want to exit through the gift shop?

2085
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,160
Which way is that?

2086
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,160
Which way is that?

2087
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,160
Well, you like to plug.

2088
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:38,160
Oh, I wrestle for WWE.

2089
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:42,160
So you can follow me on Twitter, at Zack Ryder.

2090
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,160
At Zack Ryder.

2091
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:48,160
If you are a wrestling figure fan, I have a podcast called The Major Wrestling Figure Podcast.

2092
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,160
So there's a little plug ski for that.

2093
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:56,160
And I'm kind of embarrassed that I lost this eBay game, because that's my whole like, real, like, you know, wrestling school.

2094
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:58,160
But my real job is collecting toys.

2095
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,160
So I'm upset with myself.

2096
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,160
But that's happening, guys.

2097
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:05,160
When you're getting thrown curve balls like Michael Weisner, you have no scale on which to judge that.

2098
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:09,160
Would you bathe a Michael Weisner toy in a fig bath?

2099
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,160
Only if you were there with me.

2100
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,160
Take those shoes off.

2101
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,160
Take those shoes.

2102
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,160
I'm out of here.

2103
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,160
Yeah.

2104
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,160
Thank you, Zack Ryder.

2105
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,160
Zack Ryder!

2106
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:31,160
Zack Ryder has survived Podcast The Ride, and you all have survived Podcast The Ride!

2107
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,160
Thank you, everyone!

2108
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,160
Wow!

2109
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,160
That was a blast.

2110
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,160
Thank you so much for having us.

2111
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,160
Thanks to SAC Comedy Lab.

2112
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:44,160
What a venue.

2113
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,160
What wonderful people.

2114
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:49,160
Hey, thanks to Sean and Pat for helping us out this week.

2115
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,160
Thanks to Adam and Ashley from Universal.

2116
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:55,160
Thanks to Emily, John, and Diana here at SAC.

2117
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,160
And thanks so much to all of you for coming out.

2118
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,160
