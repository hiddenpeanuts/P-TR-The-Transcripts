1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,760
Warning, the following podcast may include unpunctual robotic housekeepers, masturbatory

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,360
drop rides, and a special appearance by the Huffs.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,520
Then we're going to level with you.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,360
There's something to talk about that is actually kind of serious, but don't worry, it'll be

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,520
hopeful and we'll get through it together.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,520
Let's dive in.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:48,600
Orlando Trip Report on Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,300
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, where we're back from Florida and can finally produce a long-awaited

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,620
episode about a major attraction, the Orlando Airport Trams.

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,860
I'm Scott Garner joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,860
I've got an ooh out of you.

14
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:07,620
So excited because I text people I know that I'm on the tram at the airport.

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
Oh, that's when you've seen it.

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
I did it.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
I texted like three different people.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,620
I made it.

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,620
I landed.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,620
I texted three different people.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,420
Some people did not know what I was showing them.

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,420
I will say that.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,940
So you only sent just picture or video and you're waiting for a like, hmm?

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,940
Yes.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,460
Like, what is I got one?

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,460
What is this?

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,060
I was like, I'm on the tram at MCO.

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm at MCO.

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,020
Don't you understand?

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,540
This is a cousin to when you were you were going into Bare Naked Ladies, schtick, to

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,940
Nate, to Mr. Morrow.

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,940
And just diving in with like, no, you're going to have to help me.

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,980
I don't remember the drummer's name, but you just go like, you know, and I've met Jim

34
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,700
and silence.

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,580
Like I don't know if he was a player.

36
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
So OK, OK.

37
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,340
Oh, wait, who's the drummer?

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,140
Tyler and Bare Naked Ladies.

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
Oh, then I was OK.

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,620
Jim is the one I remember hearing.

41
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,060
Jim Cregan is the bass player.

42
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
I have met him.

43
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,180
You know, and while we're naming names, Jason Sheridan, I mean, to like box you out due

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,180
to intro man.

45
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,180
Not at all.

46
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,180
Not at all.

47
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,180
Mike, do you do the point when Orlando Mayor Buddy Dwyer starts welcoming you?

48
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,180
I certainly do.

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,700
Now we know that's the meat of the episode when we do, which I actually think is a good

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,700
episode.

51
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,500
But clearly we're going to have to explain it from the ground up because some fools out

52
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,700
there don't know the Orlando Airport tram on site.

53
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,500
I mean, this is an yeah, the Orlando Airport tram is definitely it's the first ride, the

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,580
first and last ride of your trip.

55
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,380
Yeah, you get greeted with a ride right when you get there.

56
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,060
I got to you know, we're sort of like this.

57
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,260
This will be kind of a grab bag.

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,540
We'll talk about a lot of Orlando stuff.

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:48,780
And while we're doing that, just the way things worked out and the age that my son is at,

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,900
this was the first trip where I've been away, like basically phone conversations work.

61
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,540
And I told you guys about that while I was there, which was and I'd have to slip away

62
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,500
and then get to talk to him on the phone and he understands.

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,260
And it's like a good, tight little conversation.

64
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
And we actually like understand each other.

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,700
And I get some really sweet I love you, daddy.

66
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,020
And I it was really wonderful.

67
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,060
But that was I was also sending little videos and I sent a video from the Orlando and I'm

68
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
explaining like I'm taking a train to go to a plane.

69
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,620
And and he saw that and like, whoa, cool.

70
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,700
He's very transportation minded right now.

71
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,420
So it read to him.

72
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,940
Yeah, he got it.

73
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,220
The three year old. Yeah.

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,540
MC. Oh, wow.

75
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,260
Mayor Buddy Dwyer.

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,460
Did you get off at Terminal B or A?

77
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,260
Or the brand new C that doesn't I didn't I didn't end up taking the monorail to see.

78
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,860
I don't even know if it goes there necessarily.

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,260
They're not. Do you not get a ride?

80
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
If you're well, I took a lift right up to Terminal C.

81
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,540
So maybe it does actually.

82
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,980
Oh, but you get to go right up to the terminal.

83
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,420
Yes, exactly. So I was actually surprised with that.

84
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,660
But yeah. OK.

85
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,340
Yeah. Well, I'm setting up a good, you know, a

86
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,340
Orlando hyper specific transportation minded kid.

87
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,460
I'm I'm I'm already on the way.

88
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,060
And one of the toys I got on the way out the door was a really good toy,

89
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,420
I would say, of the Disney World parking lot trams.

90
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,020
A vehicle I'm unfamiliar with because I never parked there.

91
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,100
So it's not iconic to me.

92
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,980
But nonetheless, I see that and I'm like, oh, well, that's a toy.

93
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,820
You can only get here. Love that.

94
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,420
Do they look like the ones at Disneyland?

95
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,860
Similar that it's white.

96
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,940
It's a little more. It's very 90s.

97
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,140
It's very like because I feel like I remember at that time a lot of like

98
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,940
just the big word Disney in like purple or green, kind of a 90s

99
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,140
purple and green splashed diagonally across the tram

100
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,660
and kind of like too big where it's getting like cropped a little bit.

101
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,980
But that's the fun. It's been a great text.

102
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,780
I have learned a little about the purple and green signs recently.

103
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,260
I was reading about them because they've been taking

104
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,300
they've been replacing a lot of them.

105
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,340
OK. And does that mean the road signs?

106
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,460
The road signs specifically, I'm talking.

107
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,180
Which I definitely like.

108
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,220
Those are those are some of those things that take me

109
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,140
not just to Disney World, but to childhood Disney. Absolutely.

110
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,820
I love to see it, but they're going away a little.

111
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,460
They're slowly going away, as I think partially an aesthetic change

112
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,540
and partially like, well, these have been up for 30 years

113
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,140
and they're starting to fall apart.

114
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,140
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK. Well, you can't find you know, that's

115
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,700
that's a kind of retro that I don't like.

116
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,260
It's so yeah.

117
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,220
No, you get hit by enough hurricanes.

118
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,860
So starts to wear down.

119
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,260
Oh, yeah. They get they get battered there for sure.

120
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,700
Well, OK. So we're you know, we're going to talk about some

121
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,500
some Orlando stuff and I think and some other stuff going on with us.

122
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,340
It's been kind of a hectic time, I would say.

123
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,420
And and a lot going on, especially with these these live shows

124
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,300
we've been doing as we record this.

125
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,820
We're not that far out, not just from the Orlando shows, but the the L.A. shows.

126
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,100
For haunt cast, the Fright at Dynasty typewriter.

127
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,980
And here's why I'm going backwards to that, because I think we left a thread

128
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,460
loose in those and understandably because

129
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,980
Fright Fest with Gio was a jam packed episode.

130
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,540
That is one that would have been an hour longer.

131
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,260
Yeah. We didn't have to worry about the staff of a theater.

132
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,500
And so regrettably, a couple of things fall by the wayside.

133
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,780
And I feel like I've picked up on listeners maybe noticing that something

134
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,180
one thread was dropped and I don't want them to be worried about you, Mike.

135
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,620
So I ask you now as set up in the show,

136
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,820
what happened to your wallet and identification

137
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,660
which were lost during the evening at Fright Fest?

138
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,220
Yeah, that's a good question, because we set it up early and then we ran out of time.

139
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,220
So I think what happened was Gio and I went over

140
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,500
by the fire where we could smell gas, which is where that very tall

141
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,940
stilt alien was hanging out.

142
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,780
And we were we were getting so excited about the stilt alien,

143
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,820
because I took a big photo with a couple of photos, really.

144
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,380
And then we're sort of roaming around trying to figure out what to do next.

145
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,100
And then we see that there is a like cash register list

146
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,820
Amazon store in Six Flags.

147
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,660
Excuse me? Telling what? Snickers?

148
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,340
Not Snickers, not Snickers, but like so does.

149
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,540
Evening Snickers. Yeah, like soda.

150
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,820
Just it's like a convenience store in the Six Flags, like one of those like

151
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,420
grab what you like scan your phone on the way in, grab what you want and leave.

152
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
And that's it. And it charges you.

153
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,220
This is this is absolutely one of these set up by corporations

154
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,580
that it just needs to check a box and they don't actually care if anyone's using it.

155
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,660
Yeah, I don't know.

156
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,700
I don't know. They made a deal with Six Flags to test.

157
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,180
Like, I'm not exactly sure why it was here.

158
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,540
Yeah, but I'm proud to announce this.

159
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,180
Do you care if any, no, any human being goes in there?

160
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,260
No, that's not what it's about.

161
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,420
There was going to be proud to announce something. Right.

162
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,700
There was no one in there.

163
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,780
I don't think it was pretty small, but there was no one in there.

164
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,820
I think people were confused by it.

165
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,460
And I said, OK, I have to try this.

166
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,060
I have I've never done one of these before.

167
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,220
Not that it's that amazing.

168
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,460
But so I went in there and I opened up my phone.

169
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,380
I've recently gotten a new

170
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,700
phone case that claims to block the EMF signals,

171
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,540
the electromagnetic frequencies that a phone gives out.

172
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,180
So I said, oh, I need that.

173
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,260
I need to be blind. I need the energy.

174
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,940
Is that the kind of thing you worry about, Mike?

175
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,340
To some degree, I do. Yes.

176
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,260
OK, I guess that scans.

177
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,820
It's not it's not necessarily Michael McKeehan on Breaking Bad situation yet

178
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,380
for me, but maybe it gets there. I don't know.

179
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,820
So that's you with checking.

180
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,060
That's you. Yeah, that's a different.

181
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,980
Yeah, you retrofit your house and kick everybody out of it

182
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,740
so you can just be a full time checker.

183
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,580
There's like 10. I have like 20 phones like and I'm just kind of doing it all in a row.

184
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,740
You have like poles attached to each finger.

185
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So they all are with like with like skin on them.

186
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,260
So they're kind of like they are.

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,140
They can all kind of like fingerprints. Yeah.

188
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,260
Yeah. So every single finger can be checking.

189
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,220
And there's a head on each one to to unlock the phone that way if I need to.

190
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,500
So my face is perfectly recreated

191
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,980
so that the face ID will open the phone as well.

192
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,380
Some dummy companies. Yeah.

193
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,660
We're too prepared for this scenario.

194
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,020
You've thought about this before.

195
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah, I know. Oh, I've planned my checking house. Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,060
So I open it and I'm realizing I'm looking in it.

197
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,860
And the way it holds like cards is shitty.

198
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,580
It's great at blocking radiation.

199
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,380
It's so good. Look, the thing you buy it for.

200
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,700
Great. But holding items.

201
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,980
But holding items. It's terrible.

202
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,380
And I look and I go, holy shit, my cards are gone.

203
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,140
Everything in here is gone, except for maybe one thing.

204
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,820
And I forget even what it was.

205
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,780
And I come outside and I go, gee, I

206
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,060
this is going to sound like I did this on purpose.

207
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,980
I lost my driver's license and my debit card.

208
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,740
And I think I had one credit card left.

209
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,380
And I was like, there's another card in there.

210
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,940
I don't remember what I had.

211
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,060
And he's like, what?

212
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,100
I go, yeah, I think I he goes, well, did you take it out?

213
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,980
I go, well, I don't I didn't show my ID at like a like a house or anything.

214
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
And then I paid mobile.

215
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,100
I mobile ordered the Johnny Rockets.

216
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,460
So I go, I don't small miracles.

217
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,100
Rockets is a mobile. So wasn't that so much?

218
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,060
I didn't use my debit for Rockets when I was taking the photo with the tall alien,

219
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,420
I think my cards must have fallen out.

220
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,540
I just didn't notice.

221
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,660
Were you like, was there something about that?

222
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,860
You were looking up high, you're craning your head and perhaps the rest of your body.

223
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,780
And it just caused kind of a big lean of all of you and all of your items.

224
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,900
Yes, it's possible that the crane I crane so much that the cards fell out.

225
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,260
The angle was so great.

226
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,940
It's such a steep angle that the cards fell right out.

227
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,420
I didn't notice I was so like taken by this alien performer that I just didn't hear

228
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,940
the sound of the cards falling on the ground.

229
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,380
Or there was some sort of explosion by the sort of the fire machine, whatever it was.

230
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,740
And I just got distracted.

231
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,380
Is this a Six Flags scheme?

232
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,820
Are they like we need stilt walkers out there so people drop their wallets.

233
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,180
I thought about...

234
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,100
And then we can use their debit cards to fund the purchase of Cedar Fair.

235
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,380
I thought...

236
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,620
You've been really scrounging for pennies and times.

237
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,620
I did think like maybe there were like roving gangs of like Oliver Twist's roaming Six Flags.

238
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,340
I have to say, I've been wrongfully assuming this whole time

239
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,940
since this was left open that you were Picpah.

240
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,660
I've been blaming Valencia Teens.

241
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,220
Oh, oh.

242
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,700
Or street urchins.

243
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,340
I don't think so.

244
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,300
When here it was just a horrible phone case.

245
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,540
I think it was a poor design, poorly designed.

246
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,620
I've actually just changed.

247
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,500
I still have the case, but I've moved all the cards into this like thing here.

248
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,660
But it used to be here.

249
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,020
And these things just slip out.

250
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,620
If you pull it out and you're upside down, I think they just slip out.

251
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,580
It's really badly designed.

252
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,660
But again, those...

253
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,820
You are...

254
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,580
You've put by avoiding the signals.

255
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,500
Right, what is it? The waves?

256
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,140
EMF?

257
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,420
Yeah.

258
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,780
Electromagnetic frequency.

259
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,980
OK, so you've added, you know, four hours to your life by avoiding the frequencies.

260
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,500
Right, but I had to cancel the card, the debit card immediately.

261
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,060
I went to Lost and Found.

262
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Very nice person there.

263
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,780
And she's like, I go, I lost my driver's license and debit.

264
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,460
Because she's like, oh, like she was like, oh, man.

265
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,860
You fucking idiot.

266
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,180
But she goes, let me take a look.

267
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,780
What's your name?

268
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:42,780
And then she came back and she had my like medical ID, like my medical insurance card.

269
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,780
So that was in there.

270
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,420
So somebody obviously found it.

271
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,060
Maybe I lost it much earlier.

272
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,460
I don't know, because this was probably like 30 minutes after the alien photo.

273
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,820
So somebody had returned my insurance card to Lost and Found,

274
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,300
but not my debit card license.

275
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,420
So teens made off with those.

276
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,780
They couldn't make heads or tails of that.

277
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,380
Yeah. So I...

278
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,100
Group number.

279
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,660
What the hell is it?

280
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,420
Can we use this to steal anything?

281
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,060
I don't think so.

282
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,180
They could have picked up some free COVID tests maybe from Kaiser,

283
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,780
but that would be about it, I think.

284
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,500
But I don't know.

285
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,900
So, so yeah, I wanted to know if it was like somebody took the driver's license,

286
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,540
debit card and then just left that.

287
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,900
And then somebody else grabbed it and brought it to Lost and Found.

288
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,740
Or somebody was like, well, I'll take these two, but I'm going to return this card for him.

289
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,980
So I went there and then I checked at the end of the night.

290
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,100
No, no luck.

291
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,420
I called a day or two later and it went.

292
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,020
It literally went to like someone's answering machine.

293
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,500
The official Six Flags phone number goes.

294
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,620
This is Daffy Duck.

295
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,300
It was not that fun.

296
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,660
You've lost any item.

297
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,420
It was not that fun, but it was like I went to like on the menu.

298
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,860
I was like going, you know, press three for this press for like beep, beep, beep.

299
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,660
And then it took me right to like an old school sounding answering machine of somebody.

300
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,780
It's like, hey, this is Barbara.

301
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,220
If you've got a question, leave the leave the message here and I'll try to get back to you.

302
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,380
And I was like, I'm not seeing these again.

303
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,820
So I went to the DMV and I paid you have to pay like forty dollars or something.

304
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,780
And yeah, sat and waited and did it.

305
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,460
So I never got them back.

306
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,580
Somebody in Valencia, though, has them and I hope they're using them well.

307
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,140
You don't you haven't sensed any activity.

308
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,500
You haven't caught anything.

309
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,780
I haven't seen anything.

310
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,180
It's possible my identity could be stolen, though.

311
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,340
Do you this might be a point of this is a cool thing.

312
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,740
Maybe maybe you've helped some Valencia teens buy some beers.

313
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,180
Yeah, by John Taffer's brown butter.

314
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,540
Do you think that's what they're buying? Yeah.

315
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,780
Yeah, they love it. They love celebrity alcohol.

316
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,620
Oh, OK. That's a Valencia teen.

317
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,820
Valencia teens love it.

318
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,100
Well, you're the one who's always on TikTok.

319
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,260
So like maybe you were seeing like, hey, we're in Valencia.

320
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,740
We're drinking John Taffer's brown butter bourbon or whatever the hell is.

321
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,820
I have restrained myself from getting a TikTok account

322
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,100
because I know I would just get sucked in.

323
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,580
But you always seem to know the terms.

324
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,940
So that's why I know you're going to pick up so many young person terms.

325
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,220
I see the Instagram, you know, people upload stuff to Instagram Reels.

326
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,620
They'll make the important terms will make their way.

327
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,620
Yeah, the terms will make their way.

328
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,020
Yeah. Yeah.

329
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,500
So I I hope I helped.

330
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,420
Yeah, yeah, yes.

331
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,100
You've you've you've helped so many needy teens get the brown butter bourbon.

332
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,700
Valencia has given me so much and given the show so much.

333
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,260
I'm glad to give back.

334
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,820
That's what I feel.

335
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,500
You've you've always you give yourself to the show,

336
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,180
and now you've literally given yourself to some 14 year old,

337
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,420
some 14 year old handing over my license like and then like the shopkeepers like.

338
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,380
So he holds it. He's like, so what's your name?

339
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,780
Oh, my girl.

340
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,740
Michael Carlson.

341
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,140
Just the talkies and the digits bourbon, please.

342
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,980
This is your six three.

343
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,300
Yeah, he straightens up immediately.

344
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,420
That's right.

345
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,300
Hey, look over there.

346
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,540
He knocks some cans over, stands on top of the cans.

347
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,420
OK, yeah, you are taller.

348
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,660
I just I didn't see it.

349
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,260
My eyes too long of a day.

350
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,260
Let's see. Well, OK.

351
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,860
Hmm. You look young.

352
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,540
And so does the person in this photo who definitely looks like somebody

353
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,020
who likes young people's music, like, let's say, Olivia Rodrigo's guts.

354
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
At least half of it.

355
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,020
All right. Your story checks out.

356
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,380
Hey, what Ninja Turtle photo what Ninja Turtle toy are you holding in the photo?

357
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,060
Answer that question.

358
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,100
Ray, fillet.

359
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,340
OK, story checks out.

360
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,860
You always sneak. That's your driver's license move.

361
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,660
It's the sneak just like right before they take the picture.

362
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,460
Get to get at least the eyes up there.

363
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,340
Yeah. Ray, what's the character?

364
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,940
Ray, fillet is Ray, fillet.

365
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,380
You might know him as man Ray because he's had different names in different media.

366
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,980
So like a stingray.

367
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,020
Yes, Ray, fillet is in the new turtles, but he was the name of the toy was Ray, fillet.

368
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,940
But they called him man Ray in the comics and other other media.

369
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,660
But yeah, you've seen him. I think you've seen him.

370
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,260
It sounds kind of familiar.

371
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,460
Post Malone does his voice in the new movie.

372
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,740
And when that's cool, that's right.

373
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,260
That's that's a young person's person to like.

374
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,940
That's right. OK.

375
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,100
Well, I wanted to to get through that.

376
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,940
Let's just as we clear things out in order here.

377
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,860
Now we move to Orlando, where I think we've got enough kind of stray bits

378
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,180
to talk about and to do a little bit of a trip report.

379
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,580
Now, not to be redundant, because obviously, listeners,

380
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,660
you will be hearing a lot of Orlando trip reporting,

381
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,060
a lot of the adventures that we went on in the event that you now know is coming.

382
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,140
The City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness, coming Q1 2024.

383
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,460
Just want to keep that excitement level up about it.

384
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,380
Yeah. You know, because we've already you know, we're already a little bit out from the trip.

385
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,300
And I you know, it's up to us to keep the City Walk magic in our hearts

386
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,500
and in our in our stomachs, in our intestinal lining.

387
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,180
I'll never forget.

388
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,340
Yeah, I think we did a good job of making sure that it stuck with us.

389
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,980
It's you know, City Walk was the main reason to go,

390
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,420
which was an insane thing to do, an abomination

391
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,740
in the eyes of the Lord to spend that much time at City Walk.

392
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,940
But of course, we made time for for other things,

393
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,460
because I think the degree of depression we would have had

394
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,340
if we didn't slip away for some other stuff.

395
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,220
So we had a great time at at at food and wine and at Epcot in general.

396
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,140
And OK, to step all the way back,

397
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,900
if you see if you see if you guys agree with this statement,

398
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,980
I was just thinking how I don't think it ever feels better to be

399
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,740
the host of this show, to be hosting a theme park podcast than when we are in Orlando.

400
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,300
I mean, oh, yeah, how great was just like everybody we get to run into,

401
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,140
like the just the the the kindness of people, the spirit of everybody,

402
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,500
the the audience at these shows and people who were meeting,

403
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,540
who feel like we've been friends of them for years,

404
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,540
even though we're just meeting them for the first time.

405
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,180
I got so much joy and positivity out of going there.

406
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,620
I hope you guys did, too.

407
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,980
Yeah, it is.

408
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,500
It is like the cheers of states or cities, I suppose.

409
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,220
Cheers of state is not.

410
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,620
No, not if we walked in the governor's mansion or something, but

411
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,620
Orlando specifically.

412
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,140
Yeah, it's true.

413
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,860
There's a lot of probably a lot of parts of Florida where we would not find ourselves.

414
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,180
Yeah, but it were Orlando specifically.

415
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,860
Oh, my God.

416
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,900
From the welcome of Mayor Buddy Dwyer as soon as we arrived,

417
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,540
Jason got the key to the city from Buddy Dwyer upon on the tram.

418
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,500
Yeah, he was waiting for me.

419
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,540
Yeah, but it happened.

420
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,860
That's happened to you so many times.

421
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,020
You're like throw it on the pile.

422
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,100
I got so many keys to the city.

423
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,020
The key, your big key ring that you have every day now.

424
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,260
But yes, it's it's it's very it feels very warm.

425
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,140
It feels very nice.

426
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,980
Kidding.

427
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,900
There's I look there a couple of times you go, maybe we should just move down here.

428
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,060
Yeah, we fool in here, you know.

429
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,380
Maybe this is where we belong.

430
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,460
Yeah, yeah, I know.

431
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,860
It's it's fun, although there's also there's an aspect to it.

432
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,820
I mean, what I would say to you almost in some ways was a taste of that of like,

433
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,740
well, let's let's take our time.

434
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,460
Let's go to these establishments that we usually just just rush past

435
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,300
in the, you know, in the mad dash to get on a ride or something.

436
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,660
But to be able to stop and take in a take in a film,

437
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,980
take in some fine dining, of course.

438
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,340
Yes.

439
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,020
Yeah, it showed us what it's like to be a local.

440
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,660
Now, that's probably incorrect and probably Orlando locals who we met

441
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,940
or were at our show were thinking, I don't ever step foot in that place.

442
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,740
Yeah. But you guys are the only freaks who go to City Walk all the time,

443
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,100
living in Hollywood.

444
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,780
Los Angeles, a fair amount of people either work in the parks

445
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,900
or tangentially for the companies.

446
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,940
And they're like, yeah, I'm just here.

447
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,100
You know, you get the employee discounts or you get, you know,

448
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,300
passes or whatever.

449
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,380
And especially Universal, there's residential neighbor like chains.

450
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,700
Like that's Dr.

451
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,180
Phillips High School, as we're like pulling on the strip.

452
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,220
I've thought about that, how there is a high school like that's

453
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,340
across the street from Jurassic Park, the ride. Yes.

454
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,380
That's pretty fun.

455
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
They must be very distracted over there.

456
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,460
I know I would be.

457
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Yeah. You mean like they're imagining like, oh, we could be on the ride right now.

458
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,020
If you if you're in a classroom with a view of that building,

459
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,020
they imagine you're if you were me, I would be thinking about it

460
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,260
full time not to jump around too much.

461
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,420
Maybe this will be a jump around kind of conversation.

462
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,780
I've never been until this trip.

463
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,460
I'd never been on Jurassic Park, the ride there.

464
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Oh, really?

465
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,140
Or what Jurassic there it's called Jurassic Park River Adventure.

466
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,940
Right. Because it's it's newish that I've gotten a little braver.

467
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,780
All right. Right. Of course.

468
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,620
With these things, I think, you know, I'd only done the original in Hollywood

469
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,940
one time, so it was kind of fun to do that.

470
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,900
Now that we have Jurassic World here

471
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,380
with our pals from the ride.

472
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,940
Why am I forgetting their names all of a sudden?

473
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,260
Claren. Claren.

474
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,380
Yeah, Claren. I'm so apologies to Claren.

475
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,980
Owen Dennis.

476
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,620
It was Owen Dennis.

477
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,420
Owen Grady. Owen Grady.

478
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,180
What's Owen? Claire Dearing.

479
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,900
Owen is the creator of Infinity Trap.

480
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,460
Oh, that's right.

481
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,420
I knew that was a name floating around our world.

482
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,940
Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK.

483
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,580
But anyway, fun to do that, to go to kind of the you know,

484
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,980
it's there's just a little bit of a 90s, a little bit of a throwback to it,

485
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,820
much like the signs, like the colors are a little bit like

486
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,580
you feel the 90s of it and I like the bright yellow of the vehicle.

487
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,580
And you know what's the thing?

488
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,700
I didn't have it memorized at all.

489
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,900
And I didn't know that there was this gag with dropping the crate

490
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,780
on you right before the lift hill.

491
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,300
Oh, oh, because I didn't go on it this time.

492
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,380
I have been on it, though.

493
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,580
You're saying right before you go to like where the car was in Hollywood.

494
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,540
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

495
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,500
Was there never a car in Florida?

496
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,540
I actually don't know the answer to that. I'm not sure.

497
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,140
So was that gag in Hollywood ever that there's a big does this even say

498
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,460
because I didn't know this at all that just like I think there's a there's a Raptor

499
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,300
or something in it and it's a really heavy looking crate

500
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,340
and it doesn't drop until you're right under it and it drops a distressing degree.

501
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,260
It actually does freak you out.

502
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,300
Oh, yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,060
I think it's supposed to be a Raptor cage. OK.

504
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,020
Well, if they ever had it in Hollywood, they shouldn't have taken it out.

505
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,060
Maybe it was a replacement for the Jeep dropping, which never worked great.

506
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,580
Yeah. I mean, I've seen the Jeep drop many times, but I think toward the end,

507
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,780
it was not always functioning.

508
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,020
They certainly don't have it in Orlando now.

509
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,540
I don't. That's my question now is if they ever did.

510
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,900
Apologies. I'm just flying into this conversation without having done the research.

511
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,420
I do another full episode on the old ride.

512
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,460
I guess so. It's got a different crate.

513
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,740
There's a crate in the new crate.

514
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,700
Yeah, we don't have memorized.

515
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,140
Anyway, that's that's a straight bit. Let me kick it to you guys.

516
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,140
Any big like stories, revelations,

517
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,460
highlights of your time in Orlando?

518
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,380
You know, I.

519
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,580
Well, I want to give a big shout out.

520
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,580
I didn't expect it to like this much.

521
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,780
I thought it was more utilitarian, but Sapphire Falls, the hotel.

522
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,980
We had a great time. Great.

523
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,220
Like it's really nice.

524
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,980
That's a that's a universal hotel.

525
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,740
Yeah, it's on. It's one of the boat connected ones.

526
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,220
It's one of the boat connected ones,

527
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,540
but it doesn't automatically come with express like Hard Rock

528
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,260
or Portofino Bay or Royal Pacific.

529
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,260
So you there's an upcharge there for maybe a few reasons,

530
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,900
but one being that you can skip lines.

531
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,780
Yeah, yeah. Automatically was so.

532
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,540
But this was it was great.

533
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,340
The food was all great.

534
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,700
The boats, I don't think we waited more than five minutes ever for a boat.

535
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,100
And the thing about the boat hotels is you do security there.

536
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,460
So you don't have to do it at City Walk.

537
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,500
Yeah, I was unfamiliar with the boat system until now.

538
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,700
I've been saying for a long time,

539
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,820
I've kind of only done Disney World hotels or even like peripheral

540
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,100
like Lake Pointe of Vista, right?

541
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,900
Or a very memorable time at a Radisson just outside property

542
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,220
where I would not go back probably again.

543
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,700
But I've been saying for a while, and especially with City Walk

544
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,380
as our the main thing we were doing, I was very excited to do

545
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,460
Universal as the base.

546
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,380
And let me tell you, I think this is the move forever.

547
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,460
I loved Universal as the base. Yeah. Love the boat.

548
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,860
I was an ad a boat connected one, but I was at Aventura,

549
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,860
which is just a quick walk through Sapphire Falls.

550
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,380
Yeah. You might as well be on the boat line.

551
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,780
And it's like it was the Aventura is a really good

552
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,980
I don't know if it's where I'd stay with with my family.

553
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,460
I don't know if I'd take my son, but as a, you know, as a person there,

554
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,140
as a business traveler, as someone there for work, you know, to check out

555
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,460
all the establishments at City Walk Orlando for for like a room

556
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,740
that you're not really going to be in and what you pay for it.

557
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,420
And then it's a little like quieter and away from the,

558
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,180
you know, like the the noise and theme parkiness a little bit.

559
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,860
I loved it.

560
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,940
I don't Mike, how do you feel you were you were also at a universal

561
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,340
to a little bit further. Endless summer, which is on the bus.

562
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,140
There was no boat.

563
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,340
I couldn't take a boat, but it still was a really quick bus ride to City Walk.

564
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,700
I think I think when it comes like the thing that I'm really still excited

565
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,900
about with Disney World is just like hanging out on the boardwalk

566
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,980
or going to the contemporary or the Polynesian.

567
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,460
That's the only I would I've never done.

568
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,860
Well, no, I did it as a kid, but I've I've never as an adult done.

569
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,100
I mean, look, I let me not be around the bush.

570
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
I know where I want to stay.

571
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,700
I want to stay at the Swannadolphin.

572
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,500
Well, never done it.

573
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,220
Being able to like, yeah, that has its own appeal.

574
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,580
I guess that's the but all of these hotels now have tripled,

575
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,940
quadrupled in price from eight years ago, five years ago.

576
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,420
So it's like if we're going to try to just do a regular trip

577
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,300
that is not going to be a million dollars, universal is the way to go.

578
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,220
Yeah, because it's not too far.

579
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,660
If you rent a car, I rented a car this time, like not too far of a drive

580
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,260
to go to Disney.

581
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,460
Yes, the only scenario where I think I want to stay at Disney is if

582
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,420
like a great aunt leaves me millions of dollars

583
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,900
and I'm going to spend like a thousand dollars a night

584
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,100
to stay at like a Polynesian or something. Sure.

585
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,100
So, yeah, I think that it makes a lot of sense because like the all

586
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,180
I like the ulcer resorts fine and there's some perks to being there.

587
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,380
But I don't know, there's an energy universal now.

588
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,020
It feels like maybe the energy has moved around a little bit.

589
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,180
Yeah, the vibes are just better at university.

590
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,260
It's more relaxing.

591
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,620
I mean, my family discovered this years ago of like, oh, it's really nice

592
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,340
to stay here. It's so much more manageable and everything.

593
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,980
You walk to or take a boat to. Yeah.

594
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,060
As opposed to look like Disney World, no matter where you are,

595
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,260
there's going to be a bunch of transportation hassle.

596
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,860
Yeah, it's just going to like being at Boardwalk or whatever

597
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,220
doesn't really help you when you're going to like to the outs.

598
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,660
If you're if you're going to Animal Kingdom or Animal Kingdom lot,

599
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,900
like you're still possibly getting really lengthy bus rides.

600
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,660
Yeah, a really lengthy lifts or whatever.

601
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,620
So I'm kind of like, well, if we're going to be lifting,

602
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,500
we just lift over to there in general. Right.

603
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,020
And then like, like, stay, make my base

604
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,060
at the parks where like per capita, the amount of amazing rides

605
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,260
you're going to get within walking distance of each other is really, really high.

606
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,500
Yeah. Just getting like, I don't know.

607
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,580
I'm getting more and more universal centric.

608
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,060
We went to the Epcot Food and Wine the one day.

609
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,220
Another day, we all went to Disney World,

610
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,460
but we're kind of doing our own thing and split up.

611
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,700
And I ended up at Animal Kingdom

612
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,860
and then Magic Kingdom with some friends of Jane's who live down there.

613
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,020
And they were so packed to the gills.

614
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,940
And simultaneously, I'm like, I bet if they ran everything at full capacity,

615
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,860
like all restaurants, all live shows, parks open late,

616
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:20,340
these crowds would abate a little like they would die down a little.

617
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,860
But then also one of one of the friends was like,

618
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,180
there are radio ads playing down here saying Disney,

619
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,740
certain parts of Disney are like now hiring seven hundred dollar signing boat.

620
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,780
So it's like they're having trouble getting people.

621
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,500
But it's like the parks are a little out of control.

622
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,060
Everything felt very busy.

623
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,140
And it's like the parks just there's a here's here's this.

624
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,740
Maybe people are going to be very upset with me after I say this.

625
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,540
But in some ways, even though there's new great stuff at Epcot

626
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,980
and I'll always love Epcot in some ways,

627
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,100
like being in Toon Lagoon feels more vibrant and alive

628
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,700
than being in parts of Epcot.

629
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,300
Well, you mean so you don't like you don't like the parts that are

630
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,980
still construction walls and have been for years, years of construction walls.

631
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,540
Just like it feels like Future World still kind of decaying.

632
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,220
Obviously, figment is decaying.

633
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,860
Like I was in Toon Lagoon and I'm like, Toon Lagoon doesn't feel tired to me.

634
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,900
I don't know. Like they're keeping it up.

635
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,260
I know that. But like, I don't know what it is.

636
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,860
Is it me? Is it is it the actual space?

637
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,740
Is it just vibes?

638
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,300
Is the are the vibes of Toon Lagoon so fresh?

639
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,500
Well, the vibes and also there were construction walls in Toon Lagoon and

640
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,900
Marvel Super Hero Island.

641
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,100
But it's just upkeep.

642
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,260
They're painting, they're repairing stuff.

643
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,060
And it's like, I'm all for that.

644
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,700
Like, yeah, put a fresh coat of paint on something.

645
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,580
Come at me for this, I think.

646
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,060
But whatever, I'm ready.

647
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,900
If you're if you're if you go there, you go to these parks

648
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,420
and you're honest with yourself, I think it's just look, I grew I grew up.

649
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,340
I was much more of a Disney kid than Universal kid.

650
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,460
But you got to.

651
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,380
Yeah, I don't know.

652
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,140
You have to think about where the energy is.

653
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,260
Where is the absolutely?

654
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,900
And I think it's I think the universal parks are feeling closer to Disneyland.

655
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,540
California adventure out here, where there's only like a small strip of land

656
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,540
separating. Well, yeah, that's just like nice jam packed with stuff.

657
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,740
And you don't have like the vast swaths of parks that haven't been

658
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,340
touched in a significant way in 30 years.

659
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's true.

660
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,980
I mean, I look, I'll say this and I know that if you're not a Club Three subscriber,

661
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,700
maybe you don't know about the controversy.

662
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,140
Another controversy I waded myself into when I said I never thought

663
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,260
I never gave a shit about Port of Entry.

664
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,620
People were very upset.

665
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,780
I will say I spent some time in Port of Entry.

666
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,820
I sat I ate some sort of a breakfast sandwich there.

667
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,380
I saw a tall lady pirates on stilts to talk more about stilts.

668
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,020
Oh, a lot of performers out, I feel like.

669
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,020
Yes. Never noticed before.

670
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,380
But there were a lot of performers.

671
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,540
A lot of original characters.

672
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,700
One of those pirates.

673
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,860
I met at our live show as a listener.

674
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,020
One of the pirates was in the pirates.

675
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,340
Yeah. The tall pirate.

676
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,420
Not the tall pirate.

677
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,380
OK, because there were two ladies that were tall, like extra tall pirates.

678
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,740
I don't recall anyone on stilts at the live show.

679
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,500
Was anyone on stilts at the live show?

680
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,780
No, I know.

681
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,660
I think we would have addressed the person on stilts.

682
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,740
But, you know, you never know at Icon Park.

683
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,940
That's what it's called, right?

684
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,220
Where we were. Yeah.

685
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,860
For whatever.

686
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,260
Somehow I thought I did not realize the venue was in the middle of Icon Park.

687
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,180
That was crazy.

688
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,860
I wish we'd gotten more Icon Park time.

689
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,940
And actually now is a good time to address what I saw when the lift dropped me off,

690
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:55,300
which is two big tanks and then a QR code that you could scan to join the army.

691
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,700
Oh, wow. Really?

692
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,860
All that under a Ferris wheel.

693
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,820
So wild.

694
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,740
Could you get in the tanks to take a photo?

695
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,100
I didn't. We had to do stuff to do.

696
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,180
Yeah.

697
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,140
I just real quick want to say, though, that I do appreciate Port of Entry more now.

698
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,980
Just having really taken the time,

699
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,580
because I think in the past, I've been just so Marvel brained.

700
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,300
I want to go right to Superhero Island.

701
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,380
And no, I did Port of Entry.

702
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,820
You know what? I also it was kind of forced.

703
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,820
It was kind of because I will say this complain about staying at Universal.

704
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,780
Well, there is the perk of an hour of early entrance at Islands of Adventure.

705
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,020
Yeah. And then I got in there and like could not get to anything that I wanted to do.

706
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,220
Right.

707
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,340
It was an unbelievable line to get in there.

708
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,780
And then once in there, Hagrid's already says a two hour wait somehow.

709
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,620
And then half the park is closed.

710
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,340
And what I really wanted to do was Spider-Man.

711
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,060
So I did at least get to I was like in prime position to just go straight to Spider-Man.

712
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,420
But I was forced to take in the Port of Entry sites and sounds

713
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,860
to chill out with a coffee for a minute.

714
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,100
And hey, you know what? Not so bad.

715
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Not so bad to sit and reflect and imagine where this where this port could take you.

716
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,060
I mean, look, we were hanging out there a couple of times.

717
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,500
We watched the sunset.

718
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,220
I sense that you were having like romance.

719
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,660
I sense that you were.

720
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,380
Am I correct? The times.

721
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,060
Beautiful night.

722
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,140
We weren't expecting it.

723
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,140
I look, I got off the plane and a few hours later,

724
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,900
I was at Port of Entry of Marvel Superhero Island. Yes.

725
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Did we say Port of Entry is the entrance to the Islands of Adventure?

726
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:40,460
I think I forgot to say that for maybe a listener who didn't know what Port of Entry was.

727
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,500
How could how could there be such a person?

728
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,060
You didn't recognize the tram. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

729
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,060
You don't know what port of and you didn't know that the name of it is

730
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,420
Fano's Lighthouse.

731
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,140
Fero's Lighthouse. Fero's Lighthouse.

732
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,020
Like the eighth one of the eight wonders of the ancient world.

733
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,820
Yeah. So I yeah, we were having room.

734
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,140
We watched sunset.

735
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,620
We shared a cigarette or two.

736
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,100
Oh, yeah. You got big long cigarettes.

737
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,820
That was your Orlando treat was long cigarettes.

738
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,460
Jane, I said like, oh, it'd be funny to take a picture of Port of Entry

739
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,140
with a Starbucks and a sleeve of Cinnabons, which the sleeve of Cinnabons were delicious.

740
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,940
I mobile a sleeve of many Cinnabons.

741
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,900
Simple man.

742
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,100
Just like a coffee, a long cigarette and a sleeve of Cinnabons.

743
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,820
Did you get the sleeve at

744
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,900
in Islands of Adventure or was it at City Walk?

745
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,220
At Islands. OK, thank God.

746
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,620
Because if it was City Walk, I would say we got to edit this part out.

747
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,900
Yeah, save it.

748
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,420
Yeah, save it. OK, cute.

749
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,860
Yeah, I mobile ordered it.

750
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,980
The man who looked like Napoleon Dynamite.

751
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,940
I was kind of watching the window and I was like, there is no one else here.

752
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,620
How is this not ready yet?

753
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,100
And then and then we went to the smoking area,

754
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,180
which is a beautiful outcropping of fake rocks.

755
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,180
And we saw the lights coming on because Islands of Adventure is great

756
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,620
colored lighting.

757
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,700
And there was already Christmas decorations up.

758
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,860
Oh, yeah, we had to see the Christmas transition in a lot of places.

759
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,500
That was very nice. At the hotel when we checked in.

760
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,180
First, we got the hotel at like

761
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,540
645 in the morning because we flew in on a red eye.

762
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,060
And this is this mood.

763
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,500
I don't understand this mood and that you like want to like

764
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,580
then get to a hotel and sleep as soon as you get in.

765
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,740
Well, because I had done this before at Universal and it worked.

766
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,500
I got there and they're like, we have a bunch of rooms ready.

767
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Do you want to pick where you're staying?

768
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,980
And and so we went and did the just open breakfast buffet.

769
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,460
Shout out to Patty, our waitress at Amatista Cook House.

770
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,180
We saw her like every day and she was so nice

771
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,460
when we were passing to get to the boat dock.

772
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,140
She always come out and say hi to us.

773
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,020
So we eat the breakfast buffet.

774
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,660
No buffet today. I'm getting a sleeve.

775
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,020
Sleep for me, Patty.

776
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,540
We got them a faith that we went up to the room and slept for a few hours.

777
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,300
It was great. And then we went to board of entry in Marvel Superhero Island.

778
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,540
I guess it does sound I don't know.

779
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,860
I'm just I'm not a red eye guy.

780
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,580
Well, he's also you do the right thing.

781
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,220
Can fall asleep on the plane.

782
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,540
That's an issue. I can't.

783
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,980
I can't do. Yeah.

784
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,460
Jane Jane is kind of a crapshoot, whether it's a morning flight or red eyes.

785
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,900
So she's like, I don't really care.

786
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,140
Just throw me in. Yeah, I can have sleep or whatever.

787
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,860
So yeah.

788
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,340
And I was talking to the front desk guy and I was like, how's it going?

789
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,380
Is busy this time of year and sort of thing.

790
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,940
And he got a look on his face said he had just gotten back from a war.

791
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,980
It's like, I'm just glad our nights is over.

792
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,340
Oh, yeah. I was like, well, Christmas is coming up.

793
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,300
And he's like Christmas last year was a breeze compared to our night.

794
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,820
And every team member I talked to was like, I'm just glad our night's done.

795
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,980
Like, I think it's such a it might be one of their busiest times of the

796
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,460
I mean, it's definitely one of their busiest times and it might be the busiest time there.

797
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,140
And it's also just like extended hours and it's like a whole nother

798
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,820
chunk of time or staff. Sure.

799
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,500
I'm crazy because of the park.

800
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:20,220
I mean, if our nights runs to one or two, then the boats run until three or so.

801
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,420
Sure. At least. Yeah.

802
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,460
Boy. Yeah.

803
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,380
Well, I think we picked the right time to go and weather was pretty good.

804
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,780
And yeah, that pocket.

805
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,580
It's not to say that there weren't little curses throughout.

806
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,900
Mike missed his flight.

807
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,300
That was a full miss of a flight.

808
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,100
I've never missed a flight in my life.

809
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,900
And I missed the flight, which is surprising because you've cut it pretty close.

810
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,020
I've said you're that kind of like to cut it close.

811
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,620
I don't like to fly. Yeah.

812
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,420
Psychologically, I think part of me is just like, I want to like

813
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,300
go from security right onto the plane, not think about it.

814
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,500
I don't want to sit.

815
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,580
And so I'm so confused by this because you're also the most anxiety ridden.

816
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,740
You've got your pocket full of ray blockers.

817
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,460
What you would say, what you would say about an anxious person, though,

818
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,660
on some level is they like it.

819
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,060
You would say that I'm actually looking for the anxiety in a lot of ways,

820
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,740
which is something you have to check, keep in check.

821
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,300
So in some ways, you have to keep checking.

822
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,660
Yeah, right.

823
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,540
Checking is sort of anxiety, which my brain likes on some level.

824
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,060
And that's the phone alerts is like to have just an endless

825
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,460
void of noise. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

826
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,260
So your brain likes it because it's familiar and then it's a little bit

827
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,220
comfortable, even though it's uncomfortable. Right.

828
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,980
But then how are you not like, I'm losing time, I'm losing time.

829
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Like I was. OK.

830
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,460
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, no, I was.

831
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,940
Because my anxiety is I need to be at the airport two and a half to two hours early.

832
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,140
I'm closer to that. Yeah. Yeah.

833
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,380
I got out of the it was a heartbreak.

834
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,660
I was I don't know the big thunder line very well in Florida.

835
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,900
And there was so I didn't know where I was.

836
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,420
I was like, if I round this corner and I don't see the trains,

837
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,580
I have to leave to make sure that I get back to my family in time.

838
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,060
And I rounded the corner and I saw no train.

839
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,100
And oh, well, that'll do it.

840
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,340
I put in that time for nothing.

841
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,380
It's pretty long.

842
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,860
And you are at the very back end of the park.

843
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,740
Yeah, you're right. A dead end corner.

844
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,580
Yep, yep, yep.

845
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,260
I hear there's a lot of land back there and there's a lot of wishes and dreams

846
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,580
that could be put back there.

847
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,300
We've been letting our imagination, we've been starting to think about

848
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,180
what else could be over there anyway. Moving on.

849
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,900
It was two years ago already, right?

850
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,460
Yeah, geez. Yeah.

851
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,420
They keep announcing they keep announcing nothing for that end of the park.

852
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,540
Anyway, thinking about it.

853
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,100
Oh, no, I just yeah, I missed the flight by a couple of minutes.

854
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,780
I made like three bad errors to baby car seat was in my car.

855
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,020
I had to take it out.

856
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,300
I forget the second one.

857
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,180
And then the third was like I was trying to figure out where I had paid to park

858
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,300
in this parking garage and I like second guessed myself and unparked

859
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,580
and went somewhere else.

860
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,060
Big, big mistake. And oh, no, the third one, which is the most crucial,

861
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,020
is that there's two American Airlines terminals at LAX.

862
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,900
And I got off of the first one and I went through security and they're like,

863
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,100
yeah, you can get to the other one.

864
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,300
You have to walk through a big tunnel.

865
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,580
Walk through a big tunnel.

866
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,940
So I like ran through a tunnel from like four to five.

867
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,860
And I was like, there's no I'm sure I would have if I had just gotten

868
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,860
dropped off at five, I would have been fine.

869
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,300
Four and five also connect right behind security.

870
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,420
You didn't have to get through the tunnel.

871
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,820
No, I think well, somebody told me I had to go to the tunnel.

872
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,860
Or maybe I'm thinking of the different was at five and six.

873
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,620
Well, last when I flew in the summer, they were like, oh, the tunnels closed.

874
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,860
Six and seven, for sure, are quicker

875
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,380
because I had to walk all the I didn't go back through security.

876
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,700
I then switched my flight to United, which is seven.

877
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,900
And then I had to walk through another terminal from five to six.

878
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,940
But then six to seven was a quick walk.

879
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,100
Now, how many of these terminals have rides at LAX?

880
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,900
Very well, there is none.

881
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,580
A people mover coming.

882
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,540
There is a way there is something in LAX

883
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,020
sometimes where you have to go outside and take a little car

884
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,660
to like a little auxiliary like place on the runways.

885
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,460
Sucks. That's like I want to go a little bus depot. Yeah. Yeah.

886
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,460
That's terrible.

887
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,100
Also, LAX constantly under construction.

888
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,820
So American was flying domestic flights out of the international terminal.

889
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,900
OK, so no, that was not great.

890
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,660
That was not a great start, but it was.

891
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,100
And I was because I was on the flight you're supposed to be on.

892
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,260
And they said like, all right, well, we're going to be pushing out here.

893
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,980
We thought we were going to have to delay it due to a rocket launch.

894
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,100
But apparently it's not going to be a problem.

895
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,900
We sorted it out.

896
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,940
So we were going to be we were going to have to delay things just a few minutes.

897
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,860
But now we're not.

898
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,820
It was like the rocket almost delayed it exactly the amount of time

899
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,380
it would have taken you that you needed to get on the plane.

900
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Was that a space?

901
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,540
Like, I think so.

902
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,180
The rocket has exploded.

903
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,060
So we're able to go.

904
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,460
The rocket instead chose to write a bunch of hateful statements on it.

905
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,860
So the rocket has been canceled.

906
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,340
The best is the randos on the Internet going like, aha,

907
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,020
actually, the rocket was supposed to explode so they could collect data.

908
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,460
And don't you feel foolish now?

909
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,460
And it's like, oh, that is what Elon wanted, actually.

910
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,140
Yeah.

911
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,420
I also I had I had my troubles, too, which is like I made it out the door really early.

912
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,700
I was right on time and then just a glass slipped from my hand

913
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,500
in the in the fridge on the way out the door and fell right onto my barefoot.

914
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,900
Leaving a black welts that weeks later is still on my toe.

915
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,740
Yeah. And I never really got a chance to look at it.

916
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,020
What would the busyness of flying and then needing to go,

917
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,700
obviously needing to go straight to city walk to start covering sectors.

918
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,820
So I didn't really see it till the very end of the day when I took my socks off

919
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,380
and saw the darkest of purples.

920
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,220
And I saw a shade that I've never seen on my own body.

921
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,100
And I was like, well, hmm, hospital.

922
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,300
No, let's see how things are in the morning in the morning.

923
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,220
Worse felt worse.

924
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,020
But stuff to do. We had this packed to the gills city walk day.

925
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,500
I'm like, well, can I manage this anyway?

926
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,300
Then towards the end of that day, Mike, you and I and Griffin

927
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,580
ended up at the Lone Palm Airport, home of the Hemisphere dancer,

928
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,860
which I'm told there is some story about.

929
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,620
And I felt very relaxed there looking at the, you know,

930
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,660
looking at looking at the lake and looking off at Hard Rock Live

931
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,620
at the beautiful Coliseum.

932
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,580
And I was like, you know, there's some sand here.

933
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,700
I take my shoes off.

934
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,180
Let me feel the sand.

935
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,580
It's there for a reason. I'm going to do it.

936
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,820
So I took my shoes off and I saw a change in the color on my foot.

937
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,820
It went from dark, dark purple to dark, dark red.

938
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,300
And and to me.

939
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,660
Well, OK, so I just I look like, oh, look at that.

940
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,780
And you look at my foot and say, oh, my God, it's bad.

941
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,860
And I say, are you kidding? That's better.

942
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,780
It was dark purple before.

943
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,020
I'm relieved by this darkest of dark red on my toe.

944
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,780
And it did only get better from there.

945
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,260
And I wasn't I wasn't a fool who ignored a hospital visit that I did.

946
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,260
But this certainly did.

947
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,220
It was like fine.

948
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,500
I'm sure it'll come up in one of the sectors.

949
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,260
Just the that on top of all of this, that so my toe was in really bad shape

950
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,380
as we were doing the most unpleasant things of our trip.

951
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,060
I'll say this list for listeners, too, especially if you find yourself

952
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:28,940
in Orlando and have an injury or a sickness, go to the hotel front desk.

953
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,420
Or if there's a concierge, talk to the concierge.

954
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,020
They are prepared for this inevitability.

955
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,540
Like my dad once had a tooth, like had a tooth going,

956
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,020
like dying or something was going on.

957
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,900
And they went to the concierge and they got him.

958
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,060
Like they connected him with emergency dentists and he went

959
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,740
and they gave him antibiotics.

960
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,380
They got him an ice skate and a big rock to knock it out of his mouth.

961
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,500
Castaway style. Yeah.

962
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,220
Yeah. I think there was an old West dentist barber, you know,

963
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:06,580
and they give him a bottle of whiskey and a strap of leather to bite and scream into.

964
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,580
No, but there's a million urgent cares there.

965
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,660
There's a million.

966
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,980
I feel like there's even services like old school services

967
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,620
where like the doctor will come to your hotel room.

968
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,860
Wow. You know, yeah, gee.

969
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,340
Well, you know what?

970
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,300
I you know what I should have done?

971
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,100
You know who I think could have taken care of me is relay.

972
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,140
You guys ever heard of relay before? No.

973
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,420
Well, I should have tested if relay could have helped out.

974
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,060
So Kevin from Telethon, who we met and hung out with down there.

975
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,940
He when I told him I was staying at Aventura, he said, oh, you know,

976
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,460
you know who you got to check out is relay.

977
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,980
Oh, is relay or maybe I maybe he didn't know the name,

978
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,260
but I found out the name is relay.

979
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:50,900
Relay is a robot who lives in Aventura, a robot who can fetch you things,

980
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,500
who can bring you towels and toothpaste. Right.

981
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,020
Because that was Aventura's big thing when they open.

982
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,460
They're like, oh, it's kind of a modernist, like Hyatt sort of setup.

983
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,460
But there's a lot of technology like you control a lot of the room with a tablet.

984
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,100
Yes, which is annoying and not how you expect a room to work.

985
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,660
I didn't say the lights in the remote are all in one.

986
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,900
All you have to do is turn on this tablet in the dark.

987
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,980
I just said the marketing. I didn't say it worked. OK.

988
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,100
Yeah, yeah. It's also been a few years and I don't know that the tablets

989
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,820
have been necessarily updated.

990
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,780
Yeah, yes. The future of tablets from 2016. Yeah. Yeah.

991
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,300
No, I thought that was dumb.

992
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,060
But a robot, a robot will come up to your room.

993
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,180
And one of those days that was especially tiring was or I was especially

994
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,660
the day that like broke us, the day where most of the heart was broken.

995
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,740
It's texting Kevin. He said, you know what?

996
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,500
You owe yourself some self care.

997
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,020
Is there anything you need in your room?

998
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,660
Do you need extra towels or something?

999
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,860
I say get relay to bring you something you need.

1000
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,100
And I thought there's nothing really I need, but I do want a robot

1001
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,340
to come to my door. Yeah.

1002
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,660
So I sent a text message to maybe a different bot.

1003
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,100
Maybe that was a human being who works in the hotel.

1004
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,940
And I asked if a robot could bring me a bar of soap.

1005
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,020
And they said, absolutely. Coming right up.

1006
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,060
And then an hour passed and I needed to move on with my day.

1007
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,500
And I said, I would no longer like relay to bring me a bar of soap.

1008
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,060
Yes, of course, sir. Sorry for the delay.

1009
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,060
So I never got relay.

1010
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,220
And I don't know if if this boxy robot could have

1011
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,380
checked if my toe was broken or not.

1012
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,980
Yeah. Once you once you got really relay in the room,

1013
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,620
you should not have let relay out.

1014
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,060
Oh, yes. Then like relay.

1015
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,700
You're like relay out your mind.

1016
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,340
Let's see how smart you are.

1017
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,380
Yeah. Can you can you escape from this room?

1018
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,700
Reprogrammed relay while you're like it was in there.

1019
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,460
What are you going to do?

1020
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,660
Flush yourself down the toilet to get out of here.

1021
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,820
You'll break.

1022
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,340
See, I asked for toothpaste at the front desk and they're like,

1023
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,180
oh, I'm so sorry we're out here, but I'll have someone send up,

1024
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,300
send some up to your room.

1025
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,620
And they were there in like 10, 15 minutes.

1026
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:02,220
So you're saying a human being is better than texting a person who calls a robot.

1027
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1028
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,380
The humans, the housekeeping was always on it.

1029
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,060
You know, so humans may be still the way to go.

1030
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,580
Huh? Maybe the AI isn't the way of the future.

1031
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,180
Interesting.

1032
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:15,980
I don't know.

1033
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,500
Here's here's something that I have to fit in.

1034
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,660
I can't list. Well, let me let me describe a little bit my morning

1035
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,260
after the the live shows, which again, everybody who came,

1036
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,020
everybody hung out after people who wore great stuff,

1037
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,100
who the lineup of people all wearing different planet Hollywood bomber jackets.

1038
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,660
There's too many to shout out.

1039
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,300
I loved everybody I met and I'd like to tin roof.

1040
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,660
And I love that we could actually we could like chat with everybody with drinks.

1041
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,140
And like it was like an after party.

1042
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,340
A little bit instead of being out on a weird street,

1043
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,380
which is usually our meeting people.

1044
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,260
So that was great.

1045
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,500
But I made a joke at the beginning of the live show.

1046
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,700
And the joke was about how, you know, we're excited to be here.

1047
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,140
But also we need to wrap this up to get the Tron virtual queue.

1048
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,300
That was legitimately true.

1049
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,100
Yeah, we did.

1050
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,420
There was a 7 a.m.

1051
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,820
need to wake up.

1052
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:08,540
And and I got out of the venue at 2 a.m., I believe.

1053
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,900
So that was one of the worst sleeps I've ever had and wired from the show.

1054
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,420
And but of course, wanted to do Tron, needed to do Tron.

1055
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,780
You pulled a group that was too good, Mike.

1056
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,140
You pulled an amazing I pulled eight.

1057
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,700
I pulled eight.

1058
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,340
I was like, please, can I get a one p.m. kind of?

1059
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,660
Yes, because Guardians was was late.

1060
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,900
A little after.

1061
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,020
And it was like, ah, we can come back to sleep.

1062
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,460
Yeah. Oh, in this case, not this.

1063
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,940
And we could have ignored that.

1064
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,660
But I'm like, I got and you know, and actually all

1065
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,300
you guys didn't do the mad dash so much.

1066
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,100
I was like, I'm up. I'm just going to do it.

1067
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,180
I'll sleep someday.

1068
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,420
And it all lined up.

1069
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,780
Lift took the perfect ticket to transportation center.

1070
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,940
Wait, that's going to be a hassle. Right.

1071
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,500
No. Got right on the ferry ferry.

1072
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,180
Got me right. I was there just five minutes later.

1073
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,140
Then the time Tron. Great.

1074
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,300
We'll talk about Tron down the road.

1075
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,260
We'll talk about a lot of the rides, obviously.

1076
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,500
We'll get a lot of episodes to come.

1077
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,420
But Tron. Great.

1078
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,100
Then because I kind of miss breakfast, I was like,

1079
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,580
I should just grab a time to have a sit down lunch.

1080
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,140
What's Skipper Canteen? Oh, yeah.

1081
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,620
I was not. Of course, we've talked about it.

1082
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,780
I'm vaguely aware of Skipper Canteen.

1083
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,140
God damn it. Skipper Canteen was great.

1084
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,220
Have you guys done it? Yeah, I haven't done it yet.

1085
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,500
You've done. Yeah, last year.

1086
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,540
Oh, my God. It's great.

1087
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,300
The food legitimately great.

1088
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,460
If you don't know the restaurant, it's kind of like an outgrowth of Jungle Cruise.

1089
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,300
So it's the theming of Jungle Cruise.

1090
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,180
And they make I didn't know that the servers make Jungle Cruise style.

1091
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,420
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's fun.

1092
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,380
Such good to everybody working the restaurant.

1093
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,420
Great decor. Great sea stuff.

1094
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,100
The sea mythology is part of it.

1095
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,740
Great like Bathroom, just like

1096
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,500
one of these great little plus up imaginary experiences.

1097
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,020
They don't need to have this, but I'm so glad they have it.

1098
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,780
It's 11 a.m. I slept horrible, but they have wine.

1099
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,980
God damn it. I'll get some wine.

1100
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,260
It was great, but it made me so loopy.

1101
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,380
I felt so insane, but in a good way.

1102
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,700
I find and my my voice is shot.

1103
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,780
You might have heard that in the show.

1104
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,900
My voice is going in and out this entire time.

1105
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:17,420
So I felt in like such a loopy way

1106
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,900
when I went to meet you, Mike and your friend, Dave.

1107
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,340
And I asked where you guys were and you said, well, we are watching

1108
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:30,180
the taping of a Disney holiday special in the hub.

1109
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,060
And I went, yes.

1110
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,780
And I texted you, are those boring dancers there who host everything?

1111
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,340
And you said, do you mean Julianne Huff?

1112
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,460
Why, yes, that's exactly who's here.

1113
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,260
Whoa, great. Run up.

1114
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,380
I feel so bonkers. No voice.

1115
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,660
So just drunk at 11 a.m.

1116
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,700
On no sleep. Wow.

1117
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,740
And then and then to see all these bright lights and to see a holiday

1118
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,420
performance by somebody who I've never seen before in my life.

1119
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,500
You know who that was? Yeah.

1120
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,740
Um, but then we're watching.

1121
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:08,700
We get to see an intro of a Julianne Huff, like a throw to essentially.

1122
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,380
Yeah, this excited me so much more than I anticipated.

1123
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,620
I don't think I've ever been there for a taping.

1124
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,380
I've watched Disney holiday specials since I was the youngest of child.

1125
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,420
I was so excited. I kept yelling, Huff.

1126
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,420
You were yelling at her and she was probably like,

1127
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,100
I don't know, 50 feet away, 75, like really close.

1128
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,060
I know you were heckling.

1129
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,820
I also know I refer. I didn't mean it as heckling.

1130
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,460
I was trying to be in the in the spirit.

1131
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,060
Show my appreciation.

1132
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,260
I also I referred to them as the boring dancers who host everything.

1133
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,860
But what I was not ready for was that in person, Julianne Huff

1134
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,460
is the beautiful woman.

1135
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,100
Oh, my God. Stunning.

1136
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,980
And then she turned around.

1137
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,820
I got a look in the eye and away.

1138
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,060
I saw this happen.

1139
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,180
Oh, God got a direct eye contact from Julianne and a wave.

1140
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,660
And it melted his icy heart, I think.

1141
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,780
He now loves the Huff's.

1142
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,380
I think I love the Huff's now.

1143
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,100
We love them. We love them.

1144
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,020
You know, because she was so close and like she's waiting to go on.

1145
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,300
And she was like doing some like banter with the audience,

1146
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,220
like the very close audience who are like behind her.

1147
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,100
Oh, yeah. She was just like listing rides like I the one I wrote down.

1148
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,660
She was just saying like, what are we doing so far?

1149
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,340
Guardians Tron Avatar.

1150
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,700
Love love.

1151
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,300
Yeah, she goes love.

1152
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,660
After love that must have melted my eyes.

1153
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,940
Avatar is a movie all about love.

1154
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,380
Yeah. Did you do you remember the weird guy in front of us?

1155
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,460
No. So I don't remember how you do.

1156
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,220
It was Dave, you and me.

1157
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:52,300
And you were saying something about like getting maybe on camera or so.

1158
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,380
Like we were joking around about it or something.

1159
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,780
We could not have been because you had to be vetted.

1160
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,180
You had to be wearing red or green.

1161
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,140
This audience. I mean, you're shot up.

1162
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,260
You're shot up with some sort of like stimulant to like the audience.

1163
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,860
They gave you the Biden's.

1164
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,580
They give you the Biden injections.

1165
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,060
Everybody gets the Biden goo.

1166
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,660
Whatever they gave him before that Bernie debate where he was much more awake.

1167
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,500
The important one that he had to win.

1168
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,260
Yeah, they had shot the they shoot the audience up.

1169
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,740
They're all dressed for Christmas and they're like in that fur, like that fervor.

1170
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,580
Like we love dancing and we love music.

1171
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,020
Perfect red and green, but no logos.

1172
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,660
To the audience.

1173
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,060
And you're like, these people are about to like, like start eating each other

1174
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,340
if they're given the command.

1175
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,620
That's the way they shoot these things now.

1176
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,580
But we were saying something about getting on camera or whatever.

1177
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,220
This guy is just watching and like taking a video.

1178
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,100
He goes, he turns around, he takes a video of us

1179
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,340
and then he takes a video of Julian and he goes, see,

1180
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,940
now you guys are in the video with her.

1181
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,660
We were like, OK, yeah.

1182
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,900
And it wasn't like he was like, I'll send you the video.

1183
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,100
No, he just did that.

1184
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,540
OK, that's fine.

1185
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,780
I'll just look at each other like, well, he thought we were really cool

1186
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,660
and full of early Christmas cheer, which was true.

1187
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,700
See, we were

1188
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,740
we were at Jena.

1189
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,820
I were at Magic Kingdom at some point later in the day that day.

1190
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,980
And we were in Tomorrowland and then fireworks started going off.

1191
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,620
And I'm like, it's 7 15 and that was five minutes of fire.

1192
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,580
So it was clearly TV.

1193
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,540
Ah, OK. Taping fireworks.

1194
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,060
And gotcha.

1195
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,340
We saw the roped off areas in the cherry pecker when we were down there

1196
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,620
a few years ago, they were taping something.

1197
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:42,140
And we're like, who is waiting, like walking through the stream by the castle?

1198
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,980
And like, oh, that's Darren Criss.

1199
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,620
And there's a camera man.

1200
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,900
It's like, oh, OK, we did not see Darren Criss.

1201
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,020
We didn't see Huff.

1202
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,620
The Disney types of celebrities.

1203
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,340
We did not see DJ Khaled like Griffin did.

1204
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,220
Yes, Griffin and I believe Malia saw

1205
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,340
DJ Khaled. Yeah, yeah.

1206
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,740
Doing a bunch of doing rapid fire

1207
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,100
intros, seemingly not.

1208
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:14,220
I don't know if I wasn't there, but it felt like for social media, essentially.

1209
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,540
Yeah. And then the video came out, what it was,

1210
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,940
which I think we retweeted, reaxed.

1211
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,220
I'm dying inside.

1212
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,100
Oh, yeah. Oh, much more much better.

1213
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,460
Proprietary. Remember that repost tweet.

1214
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,420
Who could remember that?

1215
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,180
All right. But he was just like running through.

1216
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,060
He was like catching a toy over and over.

1217
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,780
Yes. Which and the toy was being passed to all the celebrities on the special,

1218
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,580
which included Billy Corgan.

1219
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,780
I'm so upset that we didn't get to see the smashing pumpkins

1220
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,500
perform in front of the castle.

1221
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,380
It was the full pumpkins?

1222
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,740
Yes. Iha was there.

1223
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,220
Wow. Chamberlain was there.

1224
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,460
The other guys that aren't Darcy were there.

1225
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:59,060
Yes. And Billy is in the video catching a stuffed animal as well.

1226
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,540
Boy, oh boy. Just to cement his Disneyland weirdo status.

1227
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,980
Yeah, geez. Yeah, that does it.

1228
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,860
Wow. That's that's a very funny.

1229
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,740
Smashing pumpkins being a Disney special band.

1230
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,060
I don't think I could have seen that coming years and years ago.

1231
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,500
I don't think I knew that G.J.

1232
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,620
Collard and Billy Corgan had hit the level of ubiquitous

1233
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:24,020
that they were able to slide into the like in the way that Sting and Shaggy

1234
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,420
again, a few years ago.

1235
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,420
You didn't realize that Collard was a Shaggy?

1236
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,140
I didn't realize. No, I didn't realize.

1237
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,460
If anything, I'm like, isn't he too like relevant of a celebrity in a way to be?

1238
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,020
Yeah, because the Disney holiday special people are kind of like,

1239
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,780
I'm like out of it or just like they're like kind of their own little universe.

1240
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,020
Right. It's like your parents listening to some like.

1241
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,100
Yeah, sometimes.

1242
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,380
But then sometimes it's like I've never heard this person.

1243
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,940
Yeah, it's like on the label that Disney owns.

1244
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,380
Yeah. And like it's something like that. Yeah. Yeah.

1245
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,020
It's interesting with DJ Collard, because that's I'm trying to think of this.

1246
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,460
Yeah. More like. Well, they get to they got to keep.

1247
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,740
It was just him running through the catchphrases.

1248
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,420
And another one. Right. Right.

1249
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:08,100
And not knowing like to be Griffin and to I believe who added an extra day

1250
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,060
to his trip. Oh, yeah.

1251
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,860
And didn't like I know some magic is waiting for me if I stay longer.

1252
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,260
And the magic was this. It was DJ Khaled.

1253
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,500
That would have been a thrill. Yeah, I know. I wish.

1254
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,580
The thing I thought was odd, though, was there was a video that they sent us

1255
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,860
where he because he was in Toy Story land.

1256
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,420
And when he marched up to Mrs.

1257
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,580
Potato Head and said, I will not go down on you.

1258
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,060
I thought that was really weird.

1259
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,780
It was weird.

1260
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,420
Because they're not going to use that.

1261
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,300
That's filthy.

1262
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,340
Maybe he just that was just something you needed to say.

1263
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,540
But also, she's married.

1264
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,460
And who asked like she didn't she's not she doesn't want to either way.

1265
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,500
Any part of that.

1266
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,180
He's getting, you know, he's trying to get too much of his stuff.

1267
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,140
Yeah, his catchphrases and another one.

1268
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,300
I don't go down on ladies. Yeah.

1269
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,100
I know all the he's he's playing the hits.

1270
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,580
Yeah. Yeah. So I get that.

1271
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,420
But maybe it'll be unlike a, you know, Disney Plus is going to do some more

1272
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,260
mature content soon, I think.

1273
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,580
So I don't know. Maybe there'll be a different like cut.

1274
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,420
Oh, internationally, I think they already are.

1275
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,540
Maybe they'll use that clip. Right.

1276
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,060
Overseas. So sure.

1277
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,060
Yeah. Well, they're a little looser with these things.

1278
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,860
Yeah. Yeah.

1279
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,660
They can handle somebody saying that he won't do a sexual.

1280
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,860
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1281
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,380
Anything else for rewind down trip?

1282
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,100
Shout out to Griff.

1283
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,220
Having Griffin around all week was.

1284
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,500
Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Fantastic.

1285
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,060
So glad you came, Griff.

1286
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,820
The only thing I'm trying to think, the only other thing that comes to mind

1287
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:32,540
is that I did Dr.

1288
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,540
Dooms Fearful with the legs dangling, which I say I don't like.

1289
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,060
Which I don't like.

1290
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:42,300
And I will say this, I walked right on it.

1291
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,060
I really forced myself to do it.

1292
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,060
I really like pushed.

1293
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,260
I feel like I felt like that was the biggest accomplishment

1294
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:51,100
I accomplished on the trip because I really forced myself in there.

1295
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,260
It was so easy.

1296
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,700
And there was no line, especially up single rider.

1297
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:55,700
Like hoping for a little more.

1298
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,540
Exactly. I was like a little bit of like more of it.

1299
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,260
I was like, no, you're going on it.

1300
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,820
And I think I truly not as not as a bit.

1301
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:06,220
I turned around and left and then turned around again to go on it.

1302
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,900
Because this is the one where your leg, it's a giant drop,

1303
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,900
but your legs are dangling, which I don't like.

1304
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,180
So I went walked right on the ride.

1305
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:16,340
Just I missed some of the cool cue because of being single rider.

1306
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,780
I'm seated next to like a 10 year old, which is always the sort of check

1307
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,860
where you go, OK, like if there's a 10 year old, a 10 year old on this.

1308
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,140
This ain't going to be like even Velocicoaster,

1309
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,220
which I was not so worried about.

1310
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,900
I'm like, there's 10 year old like, OK, everything's fine.

1311
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,420
Oh, yeah, we got Velocicoaster to talk about.

1312
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,980
There's a lot of Velocicoaster.

1313
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,700
I dream of Velocicoaster.

1314
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,340
I Jason did it too.

1315
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,940
It's something else. Yeah.

1316
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,100
So we get on it and Dr.

1317
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,060
Dumas is narration and whoever is doing the voice.

1318
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,940
And I know it was from the 90s.

1319
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,980
I don't know if it was the same actor.

1320
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,060
I don't know who it was from the Fantastic Four cartoon.

1321
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,380
He's screaming at me, your fear, whatever is when I'm like, oh, this is good.

1322
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,660
I like this a lot. Yeah.

1323
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,540
And then it shoots me up.

1324
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,940
And I am for a moment kind of panicked.

1325
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,100
I like kind of grab. I'm like, what am I grabbing?

1326
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,060
What am I doing? Yeah.

1327
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,580
What is what is this really going to save me?

1328
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,140
And I shoot up in the air.

1329
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,140
And as soon as we're up at the top, it's amazing.

1330
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,100
The view is amazing.

1331
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:15,340
You can see all of the beautiful Orlando, no matter what side you're on.

1332
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:19,740
Yeah. And then I was sort of expecting like a very aggressive ride.

1333
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,300
That is not what Dr.

1334
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,380
Doom does to you. Dr.

1335
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,780
Doom gently rocks you down, bounces you back down.

1336
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,180
He bounces you in.

1337
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:33,140
I hate to be so dirty and like a gentle like hand job motion of like,

1338
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,780
like it just like like there's these like gentle pumps.

1339
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,180
Can I hear can I hear that again?

1340
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,260
Mm hmm. Is what Dr.

1341
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,300
Do. So I was expecting like, oh, my God, Dr.

1342
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,940
Doom wants my fear juice because he's going to really scare me so badly.

1343
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,180
And really, all he does is he shoots you up

1344
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:53,660
and then he kind of looks like gently pumps you back down.

1345
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:58,420
Fact the human body produces the most fear juice out of the scrotum.

1346
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,620
Yeah, I know where I could get the most fear juice.

1347
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,420
So I don't know why I was thinking sexual.

1348
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,620
I apologize for the sexual thoughts, but that's like I was like, this is the

1349
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,740
heat is rocks you down in such a nice way.

1350
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,620
This was not something I should have been that afraid of at all.

1351
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,300
And I was fine. I was going to the end.

1352
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,100
Did you like that? Yeah.

1353
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,220
Did you like that?

1354
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:25,620
The to come back any time, OK, whatever, whenever you're feeling stressed.

1355
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,540
The thank you, Victor.

1356
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,180
Yeah. The audio that plays before the rock,

1357
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,740
because I did it the one day. Yeah.

1358
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:38,460
And I had been a few years.

1359
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,660
So I was not I was a little unprepared for the launch,

1360
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,300
because I went like a foot and a half off the seat.

1361
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,300
Like I went all the way up high and I had the road to myself.

1362
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,780
So I was just screaming and laughing.

1363
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,780
But but you know what I'm saying?

1364
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,500
It's not Tower of Terror is way more aggressive.

1365
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,540
It's our terror is much, much more aggressive.

1366
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,700
This was a pleasant time.

1367
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,740
The team member did kind of like shatter an illusion for me

1368
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:08,940
because the doors closed and got to his face on it.

1369
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,460
And it's awesome.

1370
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,340
Which is awesome.

1371
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:15,340
But she stuck her hand between and it detected it and then open back up again.

1372
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:19,100
I was like, see that I thought it shut and you were trapped

1373
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,540
because then he does the whole like do bots ignore security precautions,

1374
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,500
which is so we talked about.

1375
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,140
We talked about that on the show and I forgot about it.

1376
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,500
And he goes, do not ignore security precautions.

1377
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,060
Yeah. I'm like, oh, that's fun.

1378
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,220
I'm like, I'm going to do another ride because you can't say that.

1379
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,340
So just to hear the great Victorasına Dooms voice.

1380
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,020
Do bots. Let's let's really get this guy off.

1381
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,780
Let's check this guy off.

1382
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,500
Let's see how high that beer juice can shoot.

1383
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,620
For some reason, he's thinking sexual thoughts to calm himself

1384
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,860
on this ride that he's afraid of. Amen, brother.

1385
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,780
He's very repressed.

1386
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:55,860
But Marvel Comics is where his sexuality was blossom.

1387
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:58,740
So that's, I guess, why he was having a weird pervert.

1388
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,700
One weird mush for this guy.

1389
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,540
If you get if you get a big nut right at the top,

1390
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,540
like that's the best you'll ever have.

1391
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:09,460
You can not at the top of my private rental.

1392
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,660
You need to make sure no one's around you freak.

1393
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,620
You pervert.

1394
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:16,300
Dr. Dooms fear fall provides the perfect nut.

1395
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,540
Ah, Skittle Skattle.

1396
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,860
Uh, so I will.

1397
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,300
I will do it again now that it's tied to the sexuality, I suppose. Great.

1398
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,980
Uh, I didn't go on storm. I almost did.

1399
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,140
I almost did, too.

1400
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:33,500
The line was a while and there was a really good employee working

1401
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,300
that was just like couldn't have been delivering the dialogue

1402
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,460
even like in a more funny, lazy way.

1403
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,900
It's like, all right, everybody, find your cars.

1404
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,820
We have to defeat Magneto.

1405
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:50,740
Everyone get we have to use Storm's powers to circle and get Magneto.

1406
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,020
And then like it happens and then the noise, whatever.

1407
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,860
And then he gets it goes, all right, we did it.

1408
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,220
We defeated Magneto.

1409
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,500
And I was like, oh, that's great.

1410
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,060
But I got this is too long.

1411
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,420
This line's too long for this ride.

1412
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,500
You got the best part of it.

1413
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,940
Yes. Yeah, that's kind of what I meant.

1414
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1415
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,060
I go, I got to hear this kid doing this dialogue, which is really great.

1416
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,780
I don't think the ride would have been any better than that.

1417
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,940
I don't think so either. That's great.

1418
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,340
Well, should we step it down for a sec?

1419
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,380
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1420
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:18,060
We'll be right back with more podcast.

1421
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,220
The right. Yeah.

1422
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,180
And now it's time for a very special episode of podcast.

1423
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,460
I have that thought.

1424
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,620
I know that joke in my head for weeks now.

1425
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:34,900
Yes. Something we've not expected to have to do.

1426
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,900
And I don't feel equipped to do.

1427
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,580
I don't know. I don't know how much you do.

1428
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,220
This is this is untread territory for everybody.

1429
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,060
This untread territory.

1430
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:48,100
OK, so look, I am not dying.

1431
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,820
Please do not be alarmed.

1432
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:55,100
But I start the I have some kind I, you know,

1433
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,540
I have sat out some stuff recently.

1434
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,700
I sat out a recording recently

1435
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,660
because I have been dealing with some health stuff last few years.

1436
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:09,220
I've been dealing with leg stiffness on and off for a few years now.

1437
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,980
And I've seen a lot of doctors,

1438
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,700
doctors and physical therapists and stuff.

1439
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:21,420
And thankfully, my current doctor's office was a little more like

1440
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:24,420
on the ball of like, I don't know what this is,

1441
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,380
but it shouldn't still be happening.

1442
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,460
And so I saw a neurologist in the last few months

1443
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:34,860
and got an MRI MRI done on the various stuff.

1444
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:38,980
And what it led to was that I have the

1445
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,140
how do I put it?

1446
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,420
That doesn't sound so dire.

1447
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,900
My spine is fine, but I have lesions on my brain

1448
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,020
consistent with multiple sclerosis.

1449
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,780
So that is my diagnosis.

1450
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:58,540
So what that means for the podcast, who knows?

1451
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,340
Or it doesn't. Sorry, I don't mean to misspeak.

1452
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,220
It doesn't really mean anything.

1453
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,860
It's just I got the diagnosis about 10 days before we left for Florida.

1454
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,220
Yeah, between the yes, we done talking about the hecticness of these shows.

1455
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:19,500
We've done the dynasty shows heading to Orlando, heading to a vacation

1456
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,020
and these and then in the middle, this bomb drops, which numerous

1457
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,620
medical professionals were like, we'll go to Florida.

1458
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,060
Do not sit around.

1459
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:30,140
You will just get depressed and it'll make everything worse.

1460
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,060
And they don't even know you have the podcast.

1461
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,140
Yeah, they don't even know about the podcast.

1462
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,060
They don't even know the history of it's literally the place

1463
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,540
that gives you superpowers.

1464
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,580
Yes. And it's where you're scheduled to go.

1465
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,140
So that that actually, oddly, that timing was was pretty good.

1466
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,540
Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,420
And the thing that kind of got them to like

1468
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,780
get on the ball and get me into the neurologist was like,

1469
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,540
the leg stiffness, you know, I'd seen a wonderful physical therapist lately,

1470
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,140
and then I started to break even kind of

1471
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,740
where it's like, I don't know if this is helping anymore.

1472
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,620
Like, it feels like the root is not going on.

1473
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:10,660
But like all summer, I had been dealing with on and off,

1474
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:14,060
like equilibrium issues and balance issues.

1475
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:19,420
And I had a bad sinus infection at the start of the summer.

1476
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,220
And so like, oh, yeah, it's probably an ear thing.

1477
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,180
So even with doctors are on the ball, they have to

1478
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,900
knock out like, is this anxiety?

1479
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,620
Is this

1480
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,020
inner ear infections, the sinus stuff?

1481
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,740
Because all of that's connected up there.

1482
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,020
Yeah, sure.

1483
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,820
And you never want someone to go like, maybe it's multiple sclerosis.

1484
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,460
Had you ever had that been suggested at all?

1485
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:50,060
But was there you heard that phrase before you heard the phrase?

1486
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,580
I had heard the phrase multiple sclerosis or MS.

1487
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,620
I just mean, did anyone ever know?

1488
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,540
No one ever suggested it, which I think was good,

1489
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:02,180
because then immediately you're like, well, what is this?

1490
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,420
What does this mean?

1491
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:06,980
Sure. And like, I started doing research.

1492
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,140
I'm going back soon for like further treatment.

1493
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,500
I've done a few different rounds of steroids.

1494
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,420
In fact, the week before

1495
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,900
we went to Florida, I was getting a few days of IV

1496
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:23,020
steroids and the one day I was literally lest anyone

1497
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,340
doubt my commitment to the pod.

1498
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,900
I was literally getting IV steroids in one arm and the other arm

1499
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:33,660
was holding my phone going like, what do you mean Cedar Fair and Six Flags are merging?

1500
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,900
How are they doing this?

1501
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,780
Stock, cash, merger of equals.

1502
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,540
OK, once it once a cub reporter, always a cub reporter.

1503
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,780
The nurse was like, oh, your blood pressure is going off the cure.

1504
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,580
You really whatever you're doing, you need to settle down.

1505
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,460
He's rambling about Snoopy and Looney Tunes.

1506
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,500
I was just I just all I did was imagine the phrase Six Flags,

1507
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,220
Knots, Berry Farm, and I flew off the handle. Yeah.

1508
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:02,180
Yeah. Well, that's, you know,

1509
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:05,660
yeah, I'm sure this is like jarring information for the listeners

1510
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:08,580
to get as it was for us to hear.

1511
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:13,820
And hopefully I'm not doing, you know, like glass half full.

1512
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,700
That's not merited.

1513
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,060
But having watched everything that happened to you throughout the summer

1514
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,860
and the confusion of how does a leg thing become also

1515
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,700
because that's all it was to us was like, I don't know.

1516
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,620
It's a leg thing. You put quotes around.

1517
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,020
Yeah, I don't know. Nobody. It's it's so foggy.

1518
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,300
And then these other things are happening.

1519
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,700
It's like, OK, this is beyond a leg thing.

1520
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,420
Crazy to watch go down to to have that go from, of course,

1521
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:41,660
of course, the diagnosis is crazy for you to hear and for everybody to hear.

1522
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:46,540
But that immediately you're getting help and getting treatment

1523
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,700
that there's a road map.

1524
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:53,940
It was like, you know, it was moving for me to see with

1525
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,100
just knowing that you like how much this had compounded into like,

1526
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,140
well, now it's these 10 things happening and you don't know how to get help.

1527
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:07,020
And that you're all like that the help flew in like special ops immediately.

1528
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:08,580
It was so great.

1529
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,740
Yeah, absolutely.

1530
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:13,260
And then the solidarity and community from people

1531
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,460
I knew and people I've talked to now, like I

1532
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:22,300
I it's been very helpful to talk to other people in any number of fields

1533
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,500
who deal with them as and stuff.

1534
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,660
And then one friend pointed out, like, you will realize

1535
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:32,420
how many people you know deal with some chronic issue.

1536
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,940
Yeah, for sure. That's what I bet every conversation you've had.

1537
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,060
Yeah. Since this has been like, well, here's somebody I know with them as

1538
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,980
who's who's triumphing over it or is what they did.

1539
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:44,420
Or it's something like, you know, one step removed.

1540
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,940
And yeah, it's I know there's so many people.

1541
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:52,340
Yeah. And and and big like actors and stuff like Christina Applegate

1542
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,780
and Selma Blair both have MS.

1543
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,220
So that's two thirds of the sweetest thing.

1544
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,100
But it was it's how I always think of them.

1545
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,940
Selma Blair has had a very inspiring, like crazy path.

1546
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,380
Yeah. And then Christina Applegate

1547
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:13,220
diagnosed more recently and it was very cathartic to read her

1548
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,460
like Vanity Fair interview.

1549
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,780
Go like, yeah, it fucking sucks.

1550
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:20,340
And it's like, oh, thanks, Christina Applegate.

1551
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,700
That makes me feel better because, yeah, it does.

1552
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,660
Yeah, yeah, sure. Of course. Yes.

1553
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:28,100
So I see somebody who's away here.

1554
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,820
You go ahead. Oh, I was going to say I took it a little easier in Florida.

1555
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:37,420
I rented a scooter because like walking for long periods of time is a little

1556
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:42,500
miserable and like, you know, I you don't realize how ingrained

1557
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:47,420
like the Protestant work ethic or capitalism poisoning is just like

1558
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:53,700
push through, push through until it's just like, OK, I am dizzy and very tired.

1559
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,900
And my leg hurts.

1560
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,060
And so the scooter was a that was a very interesting

1561
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,980
to see that angle from the parks because the cast members

1562
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,460
and team members were wonderful about it.

1563
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:11,660
Like they I had read that like theme parks are very, you know, accessible places.

1564
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,420
You didn't go to a counter and they said, push through, push through.

1565
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,380
Push through. No. Is this scooter rentals?

1566
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,220
Yes, but that's fake. We don't even do it. Push through.

1567
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:24,540
I I had fortunately learned from my reading that there are third party companies

1568
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:29,020
in Orlando, you know, and they are operating in a number of cities,

1569
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,500
but they will drop a scooter off at luggage services

1570
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:36,340
and you pick it up there and then just drop it off when you check out.

1571
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:38,380
It was right at the hotel at the hotel.

1572
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,620
Yeah. Wow.

1573
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:47,020
And it was very easy and scooter was surprisingly intuitive and easy to use.

1574
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:53,220
I will say, though, I learned quickly that guests have no idea

1575
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:58,780
what is going on around them and like, I want people to get out of the way for me.

1576
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,780
But like, don't run into me.

1577
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,940
Did you have a horn on that thing?

1578
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,060
There was a horn.

1579
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:09,100
I passed by someone once who like stepped aside

1580
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,780
or like we both kind of went around each other and they were like, use the horn.

1581
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,420
Use the horn. And I'm like, no, I do not like the horn.

1582
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:20,380
Yeah, yeah. Kids, kids were very cognizant of the scooter,

1583
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,340
because they relate bigger than them.

1584
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,540
So they get out of the way.

1585
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:27,140
But like adults were just like in their own little world.

1586
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,420
Having to navigate, yeah, like theme park traffic where sometimes people just like

1587
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,740
stop in the middle. It's like such a thoroughfare.

1588
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:37,020
But like, I don't know, you want to how about this group of 10 stops right here

1589
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,980
to talk about to talk the next play?

1590
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:42,540
And then like with a scooter, yes, you're like double the width

1591
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:46,180
you would normally be and or take picture like the

1592
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:52,060
my trip aboard whole like Moana was the Moana.

1593
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,540
The way water was beautiful and very well done.

1594
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:58,900
But it was like a like a panic attack in a very small area.

1595
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,260
Like, yeah. Mm hmm.

1596
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,140
They're still figuring that out.

1597
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:07,900
But like I was just glad like you just pulled the one side of the handle

1598
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,540
to go forward and the one to go back.

1599
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,380
I'm glad there wasn't a backing up beep beep beep.

1600
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,180
But like more attention than you want.

1601
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:16,940
They they were on the phone.

1602
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:21,020
It was so funny because it did show this on the scooter.

1603
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,100
And I guess it's a universal metaphor.

1604
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:28,220
But they're like, and you know, you can adjust the scooter from tortoise to hare.

1605
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,820
And that was the speed like setting.

1606
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:35,020
Yes, that discovery that that is the control.

1607
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,500
There is a little tortoise and a little hare.

1608
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:39,820
That's cute. It was cute.

1609
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:42,420
It was it was very original Orlando IP.

1610
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,940
Yeah. The tortoise in there.

1611
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:48,900
And it was very easy to do the boats at Univer from the hotel to the parks.

1612
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,420
They just like pull up a ramp and you just ride next to the captain.

1613
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,100
Wow. Oh, and you get the best see you now.

1614
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,220
You get the best view. Yeah.

1615
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,660
You should have gotten that like the certificate, like the Mark Twain, too,

1616
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:03,380
if you could have done a little captaining. Oh, yeah.

1617
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:05,220
Piloting. But I guess they don't probably do that.

1618
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,980
There's just so many back and forth.

1619
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,580
They don't have time to print a certificate.

1620
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,980
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

1621
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,020
But they should have for Jason and well, we should make a certificate.

1622
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:13,940
Yeah, we will.

1623
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:16,020
Captain of the do we remember the names of any of them?

1624
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,380
I have them all written down. Oh, yeah.

1625
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,340
We did a lot of pictures.

1626
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,340
I sat and waited for all the boats to come around so I could write down.

1627
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:25,380
Yeah. What they are shocking number of boats.

1628
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:28,660
Yeah, I may not have gotten all of them either because I didn't have six hours.

1629
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:35,300
Yeah. Yeah. So but yeah, my my original plan was like, I am going to suffer at City.

1630
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,300
I am going to force myself to so much as say, well,

1631
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,780
and pretty quickly before the trip, I was like, hey, guys,

1632
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:46,620
I'm going to dial back on the suffering and I'm going to skip some of the blitzing.

1633
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,940
Yeah, you didn't tell the doctors.

1634
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:49,580
The doctors knew what you were going to do.

1635
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,740
They would have said, don't go, I think. Don't go.

1636
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,060
So you're Orlando. Yes, a trip.

1637
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,580
Oh, that sounds fun. Well, daily podcast series.

1638
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:58,300
You're going where? BK.

1639
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,500
BK Whopper Bar Cetric.

1640
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,620
Yeah. No, I'll put you on the no fly list.

1641
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,460
I'm going to get you barred from a plane.

1642
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,900
Still learning a lot about it.

1643
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,300
You know, they suggest, you know, regular diet and exercise, exercise,

1644
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,140
especially when you're feeling better.

1645
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,620
But I don't know that anyone should eat that much cinnabon and cold stone.

1646
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,100
Yeah. Yes.

1647
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,380
A mixed bag, what you were going there to do.

1648
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:30,780
But I mean, look, give I think there's a again, bizarre timing.

1649
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:34,820
But I think there's a version where you're there and you don't have this diagnosis.

1650
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:38,140
And it's just like all these problems that you don't have your head around

1651
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,860
and that you don't understand and get in the way of Orlando being as fun as it can be.

1652
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:47,900
I feel like the the hope that came from the diagnosis and having a road map,

1653
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,340
getting to see you there and having some fun in Orlando

1654
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,860
after all the garbage you've had to deal with all year.

1655
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,900
It was it was it was heartwarming for me.

1656
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,180
And I hope it was to experience.

1657
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,140
We we had a very nice time.

1658
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,740
I mean, Jane's been an angel.

1659
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,700
He's been a real trooper through all this.

1660
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,220
And we definitely had some fun.

1661
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:10,460
We had the very fun.

1662
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:15,300
Then when we got to the hotel, we saw them wheeling in chunks of the Christmas tree.

1663
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:18,820
And then at the end of the night, we're taking the boat back.

1664
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:22,700
And it had been assembled and all the lights were on in a picture window

1665
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:26,260
that we could see from the water as we're pulling in.

1666
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,820
So we saw every stage of the Christmas.

1667
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:34,940
It was like on carts and then it was half up and then fully up and lit.

1668
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,100
Yeah. Wow.

1669
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,540
So real nice. So Christmas assembled.

1670
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,660
So in your favorite place, we had a yeah.

1671
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:44,900
And we it was yeah.

1672
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,660
I mean, some unique to take the scooter on a Disney bus.

1673
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:52,180
And then they strapped you in like six ways to Sunday.

1674
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,740
Oh, is that how I see those straps?

1675
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,540
I don't think about what's going on with those straps.

1676
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1677
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:03,260
Because I got the transportable scooter, which I don't know this best way to do it.

1678
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,740
But any time we took a lift or Jane's friends picked us up and stuff,

1679
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,940
we watched a YouTube video and it's like you can disassemble it

1680
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:13,740
to three or four pieces and throw it in a trunk.

1681
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:19,380
And and so that was very interesting to do an experience.

1682
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,860
And then like when we were at Animal Kingdom, we were like, all right,

1683
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,700
Eric's going to drive the car over to take in transportation.

1684
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,940
Why don't you guys take the bus so you can get the park faster?

1685
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,500
You know, you know, it's cool is that if you're in the scooter

1686
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,900
and you want to go on Velocicoaster, they just pick you up,

1687
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,980
put that thing right on the tracks and off you go.

1688
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,860
I mean, you have to change vehicles.

1689
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:46,180
I that was what said the reality of that.

1690
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,380
A number of universal rides.

1691
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,980
You train you go from the scooter

1692
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:54,380
to a regular wheelchair to go through the line.

1693
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:58,660
And I was like, this is is this OK for my brain?

1694
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,620
I'm like, I came all this way.

1695
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,180
The one thing I had to do was Velocicoaster.

1696
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,220
Like, is it OK for anyone's brain?

1697
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:08,300
I'm like, well, I don't think this is what caused

1698
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:12,020
this many rides on the Incredible Hulk in my early 20s.

1699
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,380
I don't think cause this.

1700
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:16,700
I don't think so. Otherwise, the entirety of the East would also

1701
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,380
have this condition.

1702
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,740
Yeah. Oh, right.

1703
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:23,420
The entirety of the coaster American coaster enthusiast would add this.

1704
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,460
Good point. This is people are going to have these things.

1705
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,140
And these are and here's these are some questions that I asked

1706
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:33,260
and that I feel like just given your role on the show,

1707
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:38,180
I'm just going to ask, what do you know about MS plus this

1708
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,940
in general, actually, MS plus rides?

1709
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,340
People want you to keep going on.

1710
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:44,380
You want to keep going on.

1711
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:45,780
Yeah, I want to keep going on rides.

1712
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,820
I you know, it's interesting because it's one of those things

1713
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:52,940
where it's like from what I've read and talked to other people.

1714
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:56,460
There's been a lot of medical advances in the last 20 years.

1715
01:21:56,740 --> 01:22:00,980
Simultaneously, there is a lot about this condition.

1716
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:06,300
They do not know, like which and I guess listeners, if you don't know,

1717
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,420
I mean, one of those things is a cure. Correct.

1718
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:14,380
And for you, this is going to be more about like managing and managing

1719
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,860
and and pushing it down.

1720
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:22,220
Yeah. Dealing dealing with flare ups is a term that's used a lot.

1721
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:28,260
So and then learning what treatment to do, which there are now dozens.

1722
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:31,380
So it's like, oh, that's fun to comb through. But

1723
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:37,700
yeah, I mean, between my medical people and like other people

1724
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,460
giving recommendations of like I deal with it, I have this.

1725
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,980
This is what I do every six months or whatever.

1726
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,220
We need to do this like Letterman.

1727
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,180
Do we need to have all your doctors on the show?

1728
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,620
Talk to them about their favorite rides.

1729
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:53,100
I feel like a lot of them would not necessarily be into that.

1730
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,460
I think what are they too busy with something to come on a theme park?

1731
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,900
I seem quite busy.

1732
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,700
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

1733
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:06,780
I mean, there is one of the things where it's like, well, no one has told me

1734
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:09,860
not to do there. It's like slow down.

1735
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:14,940
Like I am probably going to go take a nap after this.

1736
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,340
Like recording.

1737
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:21,300
And this is this is the different kind of like, oh, I need to read.

1738
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,180
Like Jason's a sleepy bear.

1739
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:26,060
This is a different kind of sleep. Yeah.

1740
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:32,100
You two have been very supportive and very helpful and very understanding and stuff.

1741
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,900
Well, sure. I mean, our hearts go out.

1742
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,500
We love you, Jason.

1743
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,540
Thank you. You know, we're here for you.

1744
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,820
I speak for the listeners, I assume they love you too.

1745
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:44,780
I have to assume I we've met so many nice.

1746
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:47,980
Sorry, you're the heart and soul of the podcast. Yeah.

1747
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,700
Oh, thank you.

1748
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,900
Well, that you said that.

1749
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:51,940
That was your word.

1750
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,980
Now you've said it. So that's too.

1751
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,340
Yeah. So that part, I was just repeating what you said.

1752
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,100
Eventually. Oh, fine.

1753
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,460
All right. You're the heart and soul of the podcast.

1754
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,980
Jason. Yeah. Yeah.

1755
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,780
How can I not now? Yeah.

1756
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,980
Yeah, that's right.

1757
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:05,940
I can pull this card.

1758
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,340
I have a card from a doctor that says that I'm bad.

1759
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:10,860
I would have said that in a different scenario, too.

1760
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:15,340
You know, I didn't need to be backed into a corner for that to be said.

1761
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,540
To say any real emotional thing. No.

1762
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,740
My emotions that are so out there all the time.

1763
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:24,820
Yes, we've we're all we're all completely primed to be able to deal with one of our

1764
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,700
co-hosts. Yeah.

1765
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,100
But one of the three of us having an immense personal issue.

1766
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:32,540
It's really weird. It's definitely weird.

1767
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:35,620
But yes, let me echo Mike and say, I mean, like,

1768
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,940
I you're such a good guy.

1769
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:42,260
And we've had I've had so much fun on this show with you

1770
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,940
for so many years. Oh, of course.

1771
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:50,300
I don't I, you know, it made me all weird and shaky to

1772
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,460
to get this news, obviously.

1773
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:53,580
And that's upsetting.

1774
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:57,100
But then at the core of it is that like I wouldn't feel that way

1775
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,700
if I didn't care about you a lot.

1776
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,700
Oh, the feeling, of course, is mutual.

1777
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,460
And no, everyone's been so great.

1778
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:05,340
And it's certainly cathartic for me to talk about.

1779
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,700
But I definitely wanted to.

1780
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:12,140
There's been a number of times on this show where recently where it's almost slipped out.

1781
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,700
And I was like, I need to talk about this sooner or later.

1782
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,700
Yeah. Then later. Yeah.

1783
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,020
Oh, we've barely recorded since my mind.

1784
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,740
Yeah. And just the one, you know,

1785
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:27,140
it was the one with Eva, the haunted car wash, which was like, again, I was like,

1786
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:30,300
understand, you know, like we've Mike and I both.

1787
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,700
This is crazy to hear.

1788
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,980
And I think I think I felt kind of odd and jittery about it until we were

1789
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:42,540
there was the three of us and the evil who was the best and a good friend.

1790
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:47,060
And like the normalcy of that to just be doing what we always do

1791
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:51,180
in the face of this felt so great.

1792
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,420
And it was it was nice to just like, hey, this is the same.

1793
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,780
And it does no reason. It can't be the same.

1794
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,060
Absolutely. Yeah.

1795
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,420
I mean, I told the even Griffin pretty quickly because it's like,

1796
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,140
oh, it's going to be an episode.

1797
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,580
It's going to be in Florida with us.

1798
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,620
And you know how you hate wandering into a conversation when people are

1799
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,820
talking about a movie you haven't seen?

1800
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,020
Like imagine that times a thousand heads like kind of heavy.

1801
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,500
Hey, what up? Yeah.

1802
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,140
If MS. Yeah.

1803
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:22,460
But no, I was saying it's been cathartic for me, but also I wanted for the

1804
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,820
listening folks listening public.

1805
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,340
You know, if you are dealing with a chronic condition, you are not alone.

1806
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:33,580
You know, the people who show up in your ears once week

1807
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,780
also had to deal with their health thing, you know.

1808
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:41,340
Well, and they all means, you know, like, you know, address it whenever you need.

1809
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:45,740
Please let the show be an outlet for as much as you want or don't want.

1810
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:49,100
And, you know, in terms of going forward and as you're coming with us.

1811
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:52,060
But I think it's it's great that you're being open about it

1812
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:55,660
and wanted to talk about it and let you know, let all the Cliffords in, you know.

1813
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,500
Absolutely.

1814
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,340
You tell your family, tell friends, you tell the cliff.

1815
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:02,020
That's the order. Yeah. Yeah.

1816
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,820
And then you tell Dr. Doom. Yeah.

1817
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,500
Yes, this is you have lots of fear for me to get.

1818
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:10,740
You are right, Dr. Do. Yeah. No kidding.

1819
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,140
It's got to be one of the more sobering conversations ever to take place

1820
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:16,300
after a discussion of Dr. Doom.

1821
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:19,300
Yeah. A perfect nutting you a full of fear.

1822
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,820
I forgot what we were going to record.

1823
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,540
I know. Yes.

1824
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,300
I was kind of teetering on it.

1825
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,260
Look, what are you going to do?

1826
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,380
I pushed it in that direction.

1827
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:30,780
Oh, thank you for taking the trip.

1828
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:32,180
Should normalcy.

1829
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,140
Yeah, normalcy.

1830
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:39,100
Yeah, normalcy is is the big thing that I have searched for

1831
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,940
because it's just like there is like the learning.

1832
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:49,060
Like the first day when we we flew in, checked in the hotel,

1833
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,900
popped into Islands of Adventure for a few hours

1834
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,100
and then met up with you, Scott, at CityWalk.

1835
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,020
I eventually pulled the card of like, I need to go back to the hotel

1836
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:03,140
because this has been I have hit my limit of stimulation.

1837
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,740
Like, sure.

1838
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:07,060
And you're going to have to recalibrate

1839
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:11,060
that you're going to have to figure out where that limit is.

1840
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:15,060
And by all means, yes, like, you know, whatever you need from from us.

1841
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:18,780
And of course, yeah, no, because I'm learning it real time.

1842
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:22,820
It's like, oh, I had breakfast and walked the dog and fed him

1843
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:24,580
and then came here to record.

1844
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:27,140
And I'm like, well, that's the day today.

1845
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,980
You know, perfectly understand this.

1846
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,060
Yeah, this seems like part of the course with them.

1847
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:34,020
I yeah, it does seem like like energy is so much.

1848
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,740
Yeah, energy levels are figured out.

1849
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:38,300
And yeah, things that used to be kind of all over the place

1850
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:42,420
and appetite and sleep with like with that much steroids in a person.

1851
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,700
You're going to have a side effects.

1852
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:47,100
So even though they do rock.

1853
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:50,940
Very helpful.

1854
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,620
That's great. That's great.

1855
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:58,420
I well, then let me ask the here's in my series of questions

1856
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,980
where I'm hoping for for hopeful answers.

1857
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,260
How does this and I can I ask you this in in Florida?

1858
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,780
There was a pre interview and this is it's a silly question,

1859
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:08,940
but a genuine concern.

1860
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:11,220
What does this mean for treat intake? Right.

1861
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:14,380
Yeah. A diet I very quickly started reading about.

1862
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:18,180
There was one study where it's like, well, process meats and dairy

1863
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:21,180
might contribute to and I was like, no clue that.

1864
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:23,660
Tab. Absolutely not.

1865
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,180
I do not want to see the word hot dogs anywhere in this article.

1866
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:32,180
This article doesn't exist to me.

1867
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:36,580
Yeah, I know. I I think it's OK.

1868
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,420
I'm working on more, you know, food pyramid.

1869
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:45,740
Three three square meals because that kind of consistency is important.

1870
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:50,900
But I don't I don't think it it means necessarily a lot

1871
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:53,860
for true treats.

1872
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:58,820
I learned Montel Williams has a mess and a big proponent of medical

1873
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:02,260
marijuana for treating the aches and pains.

1874
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:05,380
And I was like, Montel, I'm way ahead of you.

1875
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,860
It's come back. I'm back on that trade.

1876
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,420
Big old blunts.

1877
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:12,340
Yeah, yeah. Old blunts.

1878
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:14,740
Medical professionals and Montel Williams agree.

1879
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:18,580
The great. Yeah, that was I talked to someone with him.

1880
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:20,780
They're like, yeah, no, you can have weed.

1881
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,060
It's fine.

1882
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:26,020
And I was like, well, I only cut back because I started taking Lexapro

1883
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:29,380
because I was so stressed out from all these doctors visits, you know.

1884
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:34,060
But that got said, I figured out the dosage and when to take it during the day.

1885
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,460
So it's like, OK, that's leveled out.

1886
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:40,980
So I'm back on the train trying not to get it back to lockdown levels.

1887
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,260
What's that? What's that smoke coming out of the train?

1888
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:46,100
That doesn't smell like regular.

1889
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:49,100
That's not steam on this train, is it? Sure.

1890
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:51,540
It's a little funny smelling of steam.

1891
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:54,420
You couldn't smoke a blunt at Port of Entry, though, right?

1892
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,900
Because you can't smoke. No, no, I had to stick to Parliament.

1893
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,100
The sand is sort of thrown you in jail. Yeah.

1894
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:02,980
Putrid or to punch it.

1895
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:04,540
Oh, yeah. So stinky.

1896
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:07,500
Is language as stinky as smelling smoke.

1897
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:10,300
That was there's no excuse for stinky weed.

1898
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:14,540
You know, what gave me a lot of hope for Florida is being down there

1899
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:17,660
and meeting residents and people who work in the parks and everything.

1900
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:20,780
No, he did not come up a lot because it's like

1901
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:26,020
my big theory for the last few years is like, yeah, people don't get super

1902
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:30,860
into politics across the board because people have shit to do.

1903
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,900
People have lives to live.

1904
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,820
You forget Orlando's blue.

1905
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,500
You know, it's orange. Yeah.

1906
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,540
There is. Yeah. Yeah.

1907
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:43,460
And and the Santas is political hopes are fucking dead.

1908
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:47,820
Slowly dying with his weird shoes and terrible vibes

1909
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:53,900
and poor rest stop snack choices of Westmore.

1910
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:58,140
Why do they even sell that there?

1911
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:01,180
So there's that's something to be hopeful about.

1912
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:04,620
But yeah, I mean, like, I don't know anything else

1913
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,020
you need to get off your chest here.

1914
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,100
It's like, again, I'm glad you're talking about it.

1915
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:14,300
I to have the to have the fog clear up

1916
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:19,220
and understand what this is and that all of these disparate things

1917
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:24,740
affecting you and fucking you up that day to have a have a name on it

1918
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:28,900
and something that many things that you can do to help has been great.

1919
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:33,540
Yeah, I someone who had a I know who had a relative who deals with it.

1920
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:35,780
They're like, oh, I know people call it.

1921
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,380
It's one of those ones that people call like an invisible disease

1922
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:44,420
because it's like, uh, uh, uh, how do I say that?

1923
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,420
They the symptoms are so random. Right.

1924
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:52,340
And they hit people in such odd ways or unique ways

1925
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:57,180
and at different ways and stuff like a lot of people have vision problems

1926
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:01,460
or like other people have, you know, Christine Applegate had talked about,

1927
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,540
like, oh, we're trying to film a dance sequence

1928
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:06,180
and I was having a lot of balance issues. Right.

1929
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:09,820
And I certainly dealt with some balance stuff, but it's like,

1930
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:11,260
oh, and it's so random.

1931
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:15,380
It's like, how do you explain this sort of stuff?

1932
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:19,580
And at least with a condition, you can put a name to.

1933
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:23,860
Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, I am sorry to have made you

1934
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:27,620
rehearse the dance number for the Orlando show for so many months.

1935
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:30,700
Oh, well, I'm a pro, you know. Yeah, I know.

1936
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,180
I find it known.

1937
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:34,740
I wouldn't have made it so complicated.

1938
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:38,820
I wouldn't have hired all those choreographers to make it as advanced as it was.

1939
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:40,140
And I think we made the right decision to cut.

1940
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:43,060
Well, you know, I love I'm a showman.

1941
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:44,140
I love to put on a show.

1942
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,660
I know you like razzle dazzle.

1943
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,180
You want to wave a straw hat around.

1944
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:49,540
Siam Punk says I always make my towns.

1945
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,660
It's a great time to assume myself with him.

1946
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:56,380
That's your guy. Very chill, very chill guy.

1947
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,620
Yeah. What else?

1948
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,580
We eat back.

1949
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,860
Christian, I'm looking at the notes.

1950
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,380
I am looking at everyone.

1951
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,540
Everyone was really nice in Florida.

1952
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:12,900
Well, and I mean, now let me add to that at the beginning of the show,

1953
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:17,980
just like what we how awesome it is for us to go to Orlando and like the

1954
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:22,060
the wave of excitement and love and what like rarefied air it feels like

1955
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:25,140
for us to get to go there and do these shows and meet these awesome people.

1956
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:30,380
You had no idea you were also like, you know, providing this great wave of love

1957
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:33,900
and excitement to Jason, somebody who's had a hell of a year.

1958
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:36,980
And so we can't thank you for that. Of course.

1959
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:41,180
Give it given us a great night, Jason, a great night, a great trip.

1960
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:44,420
You didn't even know what how much all that meant.

1961
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:49,220
Yeah. And I, you know, if you saw me in the park with a cane or a scooter,

1962
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:50,820
I was like, oh, I'm dealing with some else.

1963
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:55,260
But I didn't want to like harsh it with buzz too much.

1964
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,420
I we met so many nice people.

1965
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:00,100
Oh, I have to shout out Montana, who?

1966
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:05,060
On Saturday gave me and Jane and our friends a tour of the pizza

1967
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,380
fari, the most surprise.

1968
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:10,380
I never really thought about it in Animal Kingdom.

1969
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:16,100
It is filled with the most beautiful murals and hand carved animals from Mexico.

1970
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:16,780
Wow, really? Wow.

1971
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:21,300
And there's so many like Joe Rody anecdotes or like little odd, like, oh,

1972
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:26,260
one artist started painting from there and one artist started painting from there.

1973
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:29,460
And that's why there's an extra toe or like

1974
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:32,340
that's why they know they ran one of them ran out of paint.

1975
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:33,660
And the other one had to.

1976
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:36,100
There's all these crazy anecdotes.

1977
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:40,540
But then a couple of people told me

1978
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:47,020
it's like, oh, the better pizza is the secret kind of stand in Animal Kingdom.

1979
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:50,860
That's the better pizza than pizza's pizza fari.

1980
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:56,020
But pizza fari, very cool, shares a door

1981
01:35:56,500 --> 01:36:00,300
with shares a wall with like Tiffin's.

1982
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:04,580
So like I got some operational scoops.

1983
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,220
Any any kitchen?

1984
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:12,940
I I well, I learned apparently there are twenty three thousand colors

1985
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:18,020
throughout Animal Kingdom, and they have an encyclopedia like really of this.

1986
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:22,700
But when they have to redo stuff, there's all these crazy

1987
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,300
uh, stories and stuff.

1988
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:30,060
So if you are at pizza fari, if you find yourself there,

1989
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:33,500
make sure to ask for Montana and she will give you the scoop.

1990
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:34,660
Oh, wow.

1991
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:38,860
Also, we saw I don't think I'd seen this maybe since I was a little kid.

1992
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:43,140
If ever the Festival of the Lion King show is wild.

1993
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:49,340
It's all like acrobats and singers and former parade repurposed parade floats.

1994
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,020
And it's a theater in the round.

1995
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,780
It's really awesome.

1996
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:58,780
Like there there have been there are actors in it since it started.

1997
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:04,700
Like, oh, like I read they've been doing it for 25 years or something like that.

1998
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:05,020
Yeah.

1999
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:05,580
30 years.

2000
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:05,980
Oh, God.

2001
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,460
Animal King's almost 30 years old, right?

2002
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:08,540
Yeah.

2003
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:09,300
Coming up.

2004
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:09,940
Yeah.

2005
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:10,980
Late 90s.

2006
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,300
Well, that hits hard.

2007
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:18,340
So that's I mark my age with the years that Animal Kingdom has been open.

2008
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:21,900
Anyway, but I appreciate you two being

2009
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:27,500
the blitzing through the park sunup to sundown correspondence strip

2010
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,060
because I was like, no, I'm not.

2011
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:31,540
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

2012
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:32,620
Yes, yes.

2013
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,420
I definitely day of show.

2014
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:39,500
It's like I'm sleeping in and ordering room service breakfast to rest up for these shows.

2015
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,540
That's what all of us should have done.

2016
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:43,660
We should have played it more like you.

2017
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:46,900
Well, I mean, look, cow fish is pretty chill, right?

2018
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,780
You know, that's where you ended up for lunch.

2019
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:49,220
We'll see.

2020
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,940
Yeah, well, we'll learn about cow fish.

2021
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,460
We'll learn about it down the road.

2022
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:54,420
Yeah, that's that's for another day.

2023
01:37:55,340 --> 01:38:00,580
But hey, for now, Jason, there's so much more to do.

2024
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:05,100
There's so many there's so many secret good Animal Kingdom pizzas that you need to eat.

2025
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,900
So we keep keep plowing.

2026
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:09,340
Fight through this thing.

2027
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:12,380
I feel like you're going to be able to and do a great job.

2028
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:17,900
And apologies if I said pizza safari at any point as opposed to pizza

2029
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:21,540
safari. Please don't come for me.

2030
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:22,580
I'm dealing with a lot.

2031
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:29,660
I will try not to pull that card too many times, but did they tell you?

2032
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:34,860
Have you been told if if a symptom of it is confusing Beppo with Pepo?

2033
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:41,700
There's a certain level of brain fog that occasionally comes up or lack of focus.

2034
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:47,500
But I think that was just that was just the too excited talking too fast.

2035
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:50,660
That I think is just thank God.

2036
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:53,740
OK, yeah, thankfully, it doesn't fall in that umbrella.

2037
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:58,220
I don't you know, look, it's going to be this is all going to be weird.

2038
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:02,860
We're going to like make jokes surrounding this thing, because what else do you do?

2039
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:05,060
What else we know how to do?

2040
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:11,180
But know that any joke is meant to cheer you up, make things normal for you,

2041
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,740
make it all feel the same.

2042
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,620
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

2043
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:16,380
No, I keep having fun together.

2044
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:17,940
Don't have any worry about that.

2045
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:23,820
And like if I sit one or two things out, please do not be alarmed.

2046
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,940
Please do not be worried.

2047
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:29,460
I just did not want to walk around Shaq.

2048
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:30,660
What is it called?

2049
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,580
Shaqtoberfest.

2050
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:36,220
Shaqtoberfest. I was like, oh, that doesn't seem that seems a little too much walking for me.

2051
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:40,100
You're saying that right now, going to Long Beach, given the current circumstances,

2052
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:44,020
going to Long Beach and hopping around a big inflatable floor.

2053
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,860
Yeah, no, I wouldn't.

2054
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,660
Didn't seem like the fun thing to do.

2055
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:51,140
Yeah, even before even before the exact diagnosis, I was like,

2056
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:53,220
oh, I don't think my legs should be doing that.

2057
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:57,820
Well, look, it's not you know, that isn't something anybody needs you to do.

2058
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,020
You don't need to hop around while Shaq narrates things.

2059
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:06,380
But I do hope that like I do hope that you're able to bounce back.

2060
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:07,300
Just silly.

2061
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,100
We're talking about a big bounce floor.

2062
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,380
Oh, look, I do want that.

2063
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:14,620
I want you to be able to get on a thing like that and bounce up higher than Shaq height.

2064
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:18,340
But mainly like I yeah, this it has been awful that you've had to like,

2065
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:20,020
you know, you don't ever want to sit anything.

2066
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,940
You want to be having fun with everybody.

2067
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:23,180
I like to be in the mix.

2068
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:27,180
I sure hope that everything, you know, helps you and keeps you in fighting shape.

2069
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:31,700
And because we love hanging out with you, we love going to these places with you.

2070
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,060
The audience loves you.

2071
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:36,780
And there's no I'm not going to do any wrap up or plugs on this episode

2072
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:41,020
besides show Jason some love because he deserves it.

2073
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:44,540
And we're pulling for you.

2074
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:46,140
I think it's all going to work out great.

2075
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:48,140
Thanks, Scott. Absolutely.

2076
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:53,140
Does that add to this? Yeah, yeah.
