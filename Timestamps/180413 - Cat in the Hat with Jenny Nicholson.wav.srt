Warning, today's podcast may include forged Make-A-Wish Foundation documents, goat parades,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,960
and the judgmental, omnipresent eyes of the Lorax.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,140
You must be spayed and neutered to listen to our discussion of the Cat in the Hat with

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,420
Jenny Nicholson on Podcast The Ride.

5
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,600
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who, if they do

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,780
decide to have children, will name their kids after country bears.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,460
I will name my firstborn son Tennessee Bear, so I guess Tennessee Bear Carlson.

8
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,320
Joining me as always, Scott Gairdner.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,640
Are you, was that a panicked face of like, can you name another country bear?

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,680
Is Trixie one of them?

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:56,900
Yes!

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,100
Yes, Trixie is one of them.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,880
Well, if it's because I thought of it, then that's, if it's a boy or a girl, you're stuck

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,560
with Trixie.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,160
Yes, Jason Sheridan also here.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,280
Can you name, this has now turned into like a trivia contest.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,280
Yeah, I will be cursing my child with the name Big Al right out the gate, because I

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,840
mean statistically they're also likely to be very short.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,800
Uh huh, sure, so Big Al will also be a shorter gentleman.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,440
Big Al will also be a, yeah, it's like when you call a really tall guy Tiny as a nickname.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,840
But it's like an ironic nickname.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,660
Yeah, it's fun.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,200
Yeah, it's fun.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,260
They'll have a conversation start.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,560
But it's gonna say Big on the birth certificate?

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,680
It's not even a nickname, you're just established as a baby?

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,940
Um, yeah, I guess I'll have to like figure that out, or it will just be Al and then Big

28
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,840
in quote, will a birth certificate put quotes like in the middle of a name?

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,480
I don't know, parentheticals or like notes that tell you like, maybe if you want, use

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:50,880
this.

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,420
Yeah.

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
It's a suggestion really.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,400
They gotta be more efficient than that.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,540
So let me introduce our guest, who I'm pretty sure can name all of the country bears.

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm not gonna put her on the spot, but I'm pretty sure you know her from her pop culture

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,140
centric YouTube channel.

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,200
It's probably our most off requested guest.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,880
It's Jenny Nicholson, ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,000
How is your country?

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,900
You know all of them, right?

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,200
Oh, I know a lot of them.

42
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,380
I mean, nobody went for Henry, the host, the Sunbonnet Trio, Swinging Teddy Beara.

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,820
Of course.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,980
Um, let's see, Liverlips McGraw.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,720
Of course.

46
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,100
And I think that that's exhausted my knowledge.

47
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,680
I think Zeke and Zeb are some, uh, I can't, what are the names of the one with the one

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
stringed guitar?

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:30,600
Oh yeah.

50
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,440
Who is that guy?

51
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,640
Or the washboard?

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,340
Oh yeah.

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,680
I think Tennessee Bear.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,040
Or the kid, the sad kid bear who doesn't sing or contribute much.

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,560
Oh yeah.

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,660
People are mad now.

57
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,560
I know him mostly from the Vacation Hoedown.

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,360
Yeah.

59
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,360
He factors more into that one.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,180
He was a bigger character in that canon.

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:46,840
Okay.

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,080
Still very popular in Japan, Vacation Hoedown.

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,500
Oh, I know.

64
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,120
They get merch of it and everything.

65
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,500
Yeah.

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,240
And I think they get the Christmas layover.

67
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,520
Yeah.

68
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,300
They get everything.

69
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,600
Japan loves the country bears.

70
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,780
It's sad how much America doesn't like the country bears as much as Japan.

71
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,920
Cause the country bears is like the greatest show on earth.

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,600
Although whenever I go, cause it's still in Florida and it's always full when I go and

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,100
people clap along and stuff.

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,560
I was there two weeks ago, but there was not clapping and I was upset about it.

75
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,120
Yeah.

76
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,720
You didn't get an old enough crowd.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,500
That's true.

78
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,680
They were young and they didn't know what these hillbilly bears.

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
Not southern or old enough to.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,100
You should have stood up and started ranting about that.

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,580
Like that whole president's guy.

82
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,120
Yeah.

83
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,080
Wait, did that happen?

84
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,320
The guy who started booing Trump and like treason, sir, you are destroying the fabric

85
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,060
of...

86
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,920
But if yeah, if you'd done that for...

87
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Is this a hoedown or not?

88
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,860
Did he think the robot was real?

89
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,900
The hoedown incorporates claps.

90
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,500
Did he think the robot was like real and going to respond?

91
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,260
I don't know.

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,100
People were literally yelling at him.

93
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,840
It's not real.

94
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,980
Come on, man.

95
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,340
We paid a lot of money and it's hot and we're tired.

96
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,740
Stop doing this.

97
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:51,960
Yeah.

98
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
There's a lot of Midwesterners in Disney world.

99
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I don't know if you want to go there to air your grievances.

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,440
Maybe not at that place.

101
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,700
You might get ganged up on.

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,740
They should make a Trump for California just for people to yell at.

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,920
Like know that that's where it's...

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,480
Just put him behind the counter at city hall.

105
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,920
He takes complaints, I guess.

106
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,260
And is very...

107
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,300
Kurt doesn't accept them.

108
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,780
It's a durable robot too.

109
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,120
So you can touch, you can hit it.

110
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,440
You can throw things at it.

111
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,940
Oh, then put it in an arcade.

112
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,640
Bring back the arcade in Tomorrowland.

113
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:19,960
Oh yeah.

114
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,700
Well they need that for storage, I guess.

115
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,380
The most expensive storage space in the country.

116
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,320
A lot of Star Wars crates in there.

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,600
A lot of crates, yeah.

118
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,020
A lot of unsold...

119
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,640
Who's the evil BB-8?

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,380
What's his name?

121
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,060
BB-9E!

122
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,280
What?

123
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,000
Unsold?

124
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,960
Excuse me.

125
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,340
I think you're going to beat us at character names.

126
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:42,860
Yeah, maybe.

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,920
Most people that come on the podcast are like, God, these nerds.

128
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,180
These nerds know all these characters.

129
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,160
But I think you might beat us in a trivia contest.

130
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,480
I might.

131
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,520
It might happen.

132
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,900
Like, you know all the...

133
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,100
You are big Captain EO.

134
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,480
You know...

135
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,020
Oh yeah.

136
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,380
Got Fuzzball and Hooter.

137
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,320
I don't know the two-headed one though.

138
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,960
Oh, it's Major and Minor Domo.

139
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,100
Oh!

140
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,520
Wait, no, no, no.

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,060
ID and OD are the two.

142
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,800
ID and OD.

143
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,740
And Major Domo is the robot that turns into the drum set.

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,140
Yes.

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,840
And did you know who the villain is called?

146
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,820
It's in the back of Major Domo.

147
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,320
The villain?

148
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,820
The villain.

149
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,960
She just the evil...

150
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,780
She is a George Lucas character named the Supreme Leader.

151
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,260
So that's Snoke's backstory in Captain EO.

152
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,960
Oh wow, you're right.

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,080
Hiding in plain sight.

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,020
Supreme Leader.

155
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,940
Is it a universe connect?

156
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,040
Same person.

157
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,400
It's the Supreme Leader.

158
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,300
That shimmery gold robe is from the end when she turned good.

159
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,340
But then she became ugly and lost her faith again.

160
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,020
Oh, okay.

161
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,920
This is just a J.J.

162
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
Abrams mystery box thing.

163
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,720
And he just like set up and then he's like, fuck you, I'm out of here.

164
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Even after 30 years, the Supreme Leader would never turn evil again.

165
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,180
Not after that dance number.

166
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,440
She's still got the rhythm in her bones.

167
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,080
So Jenny, you talk about all this stuff on your channel.

168
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,340
Whenever I can find an excuse.

169
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,060
Yes.

170
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,340
You just recently reviewed Escape from Tomorrow.

171
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,020
Yes.

172
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,640
The bane of my existence.

173
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,120
Yeah, it's dog shit.

174
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,920
It's real bad.

175
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,600
Yeah, for those of you who don't know, it's the movie that was like touted like shot inside

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,320
Disney World and Disneyland and it's like a gorilla movie and then you see it and it's

177
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,840
like not many shots, that many shots are actually inside and they sort of make things look like

178
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,580
they're there, but it's clearly just a bench and like a green screen.

179
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,480
Well, they do a bit of green screen, but I'd say like 70% is in the park.

180
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:32,840
Really?

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,460
It's that much?

182
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,560
But it's, I mean, that doesn't help its badness.

183
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,660
I was in California because I got kicked out of Florida.

184
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,120
That bothered me.

185
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,220
They didn't get kicked out.

186
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,660
They ran out of money.

187
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,680
Oh, they ran out of money.

188
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,100
They only bought like a week in Florida.

189
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,660
Okay, so kicked out by a budget.

190
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,300
Yeah, so then they had to come back and film where it's cheaper in their home park.

191
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,860
But then they have to know that some of the only people who are going to see this curiosity

192
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,920
gimmick movie are super Disney nerds who will either wonder how they do it or get mad at

193
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,300
it.

194
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,640
And so like there's shots that cut from Disneyland stuff to Disney World stuff and back and forth.

195
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,820
Yeah, I almost felt like that served it in a way because it is a horror movie.

196
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,760
So you're like, oh, what Toontown is right in front of the submarine lagoon?

197
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,560
What is this?

198
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,660
It's like a horrible dream where things rearrange in your brain.

199
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,260
Nothing makes sense.

200
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,360
It's a weird, like supernatural park.

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
But I know that wasn't on purpose.

202
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,580
It was just for budget reasons.

203
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,500
So he doesn't get any cookies for that.

204
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,820
No benefit of the doubt.

205
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,420
I was glad you threw, I watched your video as well, and I was glad you threw the guy

206
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,800
under the bus, the director.

207
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:34,980
Oh, I hate him.

208
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,280
And you just referred to him as some guy.

209
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah, some guy Randy Moore.

210
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,940
I appreciated that because I got, this what came out what in 2013, something like that?

211
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,400
I think so.

212
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,840
And it seemed to be riding this wave of festival Fangoria.

213
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,880
Like people were, like it was buzzed about because oh my God, how did they get away with

214
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,000
it?

215
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,680
And is this guy like the new David Lynch or the new Aronofsky?

216
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,880
And you watch it and it is the flattest Vimeo you've ever seen.

217
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,180
And like cat flu.

218
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,020
Cat flu is jaw droppingly stupid.

219
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:18,660
A lot of that movie reminds me, like there's some very easy, like the easiest like low

220
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,480
bar jokes like about Disney stuff is like, oh yeah, what is it?

221
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,380
A Coke cost $20?

222
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,020
Like, it's like, come on, man.

223
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,600
That's like the laziest shit.

224
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,160
Like you can do a little better than that.

225
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,720
There's definitely things worth critique.

226
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,180
I think most, most like theme park blogs and news sites are like pretty open about like,

227
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,780
yeah, Disney should be paying their employees a lot more.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,820
Like you just give out your dumb stunt bonuses, dumb like tax cut bonuses.

229
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,960
Stop holding them up.

230
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,240
Oh, I know.

231
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,940
And they're holding their union negotiations hostage before they get the bonuses.

232
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,140
It's horrible.

233
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,780
Yeah.

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,180
Everyone, everyone's like, yeah, this, this is like worth criticizing when people are

235
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,620
like, oh yeah, uh, uh, uh, what are the wait four hours?

236
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,980
The lines are so long.

237
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,220
Four hours for space mountain.

238
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,580
And it's like, come on, you can like, it takes a second to look up this.

239
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,320
Like have you ever been anywhere?

240
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,860
Like baseball games, movie theaters, airport.

241
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,900
This is what it's like.

242
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,600
This is everywhere.

243
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,600
So it's an odd criticism specifically.

244
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,320
For $11 for a glass of wine.

245
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,040
Almost everywhere.

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,040
That is the case.

247
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,260
Have you gone to a baseball game in the last 15 years?

248
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,660
Well, and he thinks it's like an expose like, well, they're selling you dreams, but they

249
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
just want your money.

250
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,400
And you're like, it's a theme park.

251
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,860
Yeah, I know.

252
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,120
Kind of always been the point.

253
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,020
It's inherently exploitative, but that doesn't mean they're trying to like pull one over

254
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,660
on you.

255
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,120
Yeah.

256
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,420
I have a very, uh, I don't know if I've ever shared this story about escape from tomorrow,

257
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,000
uh, from my own life.

258
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,620
Uh, when it came out, they did a free screening at, uh, Cine family, uh, which was a popular

259
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,080
destination for people to see, uh, the vibe, vibe theater.

260
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Yeah, I was going to say, and also a popular place for, uh, sexual harassers and abusers

261
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,400
to work at.

262
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,380
Um, uh, uh, yeah, so they, they would do free screenings of smaller movies.

263
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,340
Um, but you either had to like members got him first and whatever was left over, he had

264
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,000
to wait in line.

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,820
And I got down there like pretty early before and I D I don't live that close to it.

266
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,000
And I waited for about 20 minutes.

267
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,960
They're like, all right, we'll fill up.

268
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,580
Oh my God.

269
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,440
It was popular.

270
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,120
Yeah.

271
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,380
It was, it was packed because I mean partially because that screening was free, but like

272
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,880
it's like, all right, I guess I'll, well, and also all the buzz was that if you don't

273
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
see it now, you'll never see it.

274
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:48,700
Oh yeah.

275
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,880
It's going to get shut down by Disney.

276
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,060
You have to see it today.

277
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:52,900
Yeah.

278
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,060
Those Disney lawyers, they're going to repel in from the ceiling.

279
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,420
Yeah.

280
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,160
And they're going to grind up all the copies and put it into the churros.

281
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,800
Yeah, they're going to somehow stop it from hitting the internet, you know, a full film.

282
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,620
They really, maybe the best move Disney's made in the, like the smartest, most savvy

283
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,760
thing they've done in, in the last decade is just decide to ignore it.

284
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,060
Well, yeah.

285
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,900
Honestly, I think if it was better, they wouldn't have been able to resist trying to shut it

286
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,780
down, but I think they watched it and they were like, it's fine.

287
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,240
Yeah.

288
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,820
No one's going to remember this.

289
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
It's worth anyone's time.

290
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,000
And it's interesting to compare to now after the Florida project came out, which I don't

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
want to spoil for anyone, but the, the parks do play a role in the movie and it's very

292
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
moving and I thought, well done.

293
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,740
Like comparatively in a similar fashion.

294
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,200
Anything versus escape.

295
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Well, but yes, anything, but it's just like, well, this is how you, yeah, this is how you

296
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,840
The only time I, this is a side note, the only time I've been in a Cine Family was to

297
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,180
see a Rip Taylor documentary and Mr. Taylor was there and I'll tie it into Disney because

298
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,600
he did the genie's voice in DuckTales, Legend of the Last Lamp or whatever that lamp movie.

299
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,180
I loved that movie.

300
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,280
It was great.

301
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,560
I, was that in theaters or was that?

302
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,160
Yes, it was.

303
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,540
Okay.

304
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,480
Did it launch the series or come after?

305
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,540
It launched it, right?

306
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,300
It was after.

307
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
Or in the middle.

308
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,380
I think it was, I think the show started in the 86, 87.

309
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,380
It was like that animation where like it was slightly better, like that Jetsons movie where

310
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,420
you're like, it looks better.

311
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,980
It's still like, like 70 minutes.

312
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,900
It's still like too short, but it's good.

313
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,000
It's like a great movie.

314
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,420
And then it ends with like just hearing the theme song coming out of like movie speakers

315
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,220
is so good.

316
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,060
Cause it's such a good thing.

317
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,960
You can hear like a nice mix of the theme.

318
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,860
Not in the shitty 80s or 90s television.

319
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,520
It's big and grand.

320
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:37,880
Yes.

321
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,120
That is a perfect song for theater speakers.

322
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,500
Like a horn line as powerful as Indiana Jones, perhaps.

323
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,080
That's high praise.

324
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,180
I love the DuckTales theme.

325
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,240
Love the DuckTales theme.

326
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,460
Well, and I don't think, I don't know when it came out in theaters, but I didn't see

328
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,580
it in theaters, but my dad had like a home theater set up that we always watched it on

329
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,540
and we had it on LaserDisc.

330
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,500
And then he wanted to get rid of our LaserDisc player.

331
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,600
And I was like, you have to keep the player and the DuckTales LaserDisc.

332
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,060
You can get rid of everything else.

333
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,180
And he was like, well, no, I'm not going to keep the machine for this one.

334
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,000
And I was like, we need DuckTales.

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,600
It's the best one we have.

336
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
So we kept it?

337
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,740
Yeah.

338
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,300
Okay, good.

339
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,840
Of course.

340
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,360
Thank God.

341
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,580
Or at least he may have gotten rid of it and not told me that could happen too.

342
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,600
That happens a lot when we're kids.

343
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,000
Parents just disappear things and you don't even remember.

344
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,560
That was one I don't think I saw it in theaters either, but I did watch that VHS a lot.

345
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,000
And another movie with a very similar, like the show was out for a while and then they

346
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,960
made a movie that looked a little better was the Batman Mask of the Phantasm.

347
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,300
Sure.

348
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,120
Which is, I don't, is that the best Batman movie?

349
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,140
I'll say yes.

350
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:47,960
Yeah.

351
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I don't know.

352
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,700
Of any better than the Burton or?

353
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,380
It's kind of better, I think.

354
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,340
But that's a whole nother movie.

355
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,400
Better than the Dark Knight?

356
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,500
It's probably, the cartoon?

357
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,080
I don't know.

358
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,480
I've seen it, but it is a, Scott, it's a very good cartoon.

359
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,200
I know, very dismissive of calling it a cartoon.

360
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,160
It's certainly in the top three.

361
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,700
I will say top three.

362
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,560
I'd give you that.

363
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,520
I might say it's like, there's returns, Dark Knight, Phantasm.

364
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,700
But this isn't Justin Michael's Batman the Animated podcast.

365
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,540
No it's not, it's Podcast the Ride.

366
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,460
Podcast the Ride.

367
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,500
So Jenny, you were a former cast member.

368
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,020
Yes.

369
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,740
Our first former cast member.

370
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,760
How is that possible?

371
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,780
There's cast members everywhere in SoCal.

372
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,680
Well that's true.

373
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,960
Everyone's gone through that.

374
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,380
Scott was a tour guide at Universal Studios.

375
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,320
Oh, oh nice.

376
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,020
So that's the closest, but.

377
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,020
But not the Disney magic though.

378
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,960
I was, I'm a friend of Woody Woodpecker I guess, but not.

379
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,380
Not the mouse.

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,480
No, no, no, I never met the mouse.

381
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,460
So I've written some questions down.

382
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,580
These are the first things that popped into my head.

383
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,960
So as a cast member, my first question would be like, is it, does it make you appreciate

384
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,820
the magic more or a little less?

385
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,700
Obviously you still love Disney and you love the parks and everything, but is there a factor

386
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,320
into that or does it make you like it more because you're sort of part of the magic then?

387
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,960
I think it made me like it the same amount.

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,980
I think I was a huge Disney nerd when I went in.

389
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,480
I have seen it go both ways.

390
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,920
I've seen a lot of people go and work there and then get burnt out.

391
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,740
And I think that's part of it is like you have to kind of leave before you get burnt

392
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,360
out on it.

393
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,680
But then again, I'd have people where they'd be like, you know, oh, you're still so into

394
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,160
Disney, like that'll go away.

395
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,100
And I'd be like, how long have you been working here?

396
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,400
And they'd be like two months.

397
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,140
And I'd be like, I've been here for a year.

398
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,500
So I don't think, I don't think it's just that I'm waiting to get jaded at this point.

399
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,520
But the one thing I did notice was a difference is that after I stopped working there, I literally

400
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,160
bought my annual pass the day after I quit because my family was visiting across that

401
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,520
time.

402
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,340
So I was like, well, I'm getting it right now.

403
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,900
I quit yesterday and now I have my annual pass.

404
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,220
But it was like, it's so different visiting only as a guest than visiting as a cast member

405
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,020
on your day off.

406
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,160
Because I think you do kind of feel even though no one's really going to know, you feel like

407
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,760
you have to be on your best behavior and you feel like you might run into people that you

408
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,440
know still.

409
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,720
Now that I haven't been working there for a little while, I feel more like I'm just

410
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,340
a normal guest and maybe I'm getting that pass holder entitledness back where you feel

411
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,780
like you're going to get better service.

412
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,720
We have that.

413
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,740
We all have that.

414
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,680
And then you're like, oh, do you go like, I've been waiting for 30 minutes and they're

415
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,020
like, but you can come tomorrow.

416
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,260
You can just come back.

417
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,640
And you're like, well, I have a pad.

418
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,300
They're like, yeah, a million people have a premium pass holder.

419
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:32,740
Yes.

420
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,680
There must only be 70 of us or so.

421
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:35,960
Right?

422
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,340
We're on the top tier.

423
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,140
It is interesting.

424
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,800
I feel like that's what the jobs like.

425
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,080
This is when I was younger, I worked at the container store in Shomberg, Illinois.

426
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,440
And I do recall after working there for a while, I had an ownership over the place.

427
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,760
You sort of feel like, well, this is my place and I belong.

428
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,140
You walk in there on your day off and you'd be like, hell yeah, I know where everything

429
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,520
goes.

430
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,440
And then after you're done working there, you're like, what was wrong with me?

431
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,340
I do feel like I still get that sometimes where you'll go in, like not being a cast

432
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,520
member and still want to like yell at people who are breaking the rules.

433
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Oh, we have that too, though.

434
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,480
Like a walkway gets stopped and you'll be like, where's the GSO lead?

435
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,660
Who's letting this happen?

436
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,220
But you know, you just have to be like, okay, whatever.

437
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,280
There are people that mistreat the parks and I think we'll be like in line and be like,

438
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,040
have you seen this?

439
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,280
Yeah.

440
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,920
You'll be like, why isn't that me stepping in?

441
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,500
I was just at Florida and I saw the Little Mermaid show.

442
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,520
Have you guys seen that?

443
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:28,720
Yes.

444
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,620
And I just saw it again two weeks ago.

445
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,740
It was my first time seeing it.

446
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,480
I didn't know it was so puppet centric.

447
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,400
It was like the best thing I did all day in Hollywood studios, which is a low bar to clear.

448
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,920
But at the moment, yeah.

449
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,060
One of the two attractions currently.

450
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,640
But yeah, you know, you need to walk all the way in and go all the way down the row, even

451
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,820
if you're not sitting in the middle.

452
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,580
And this gentleman behind us and his child had stopped in the middle and the cast member

453
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,240
was like, move all the way down, sir.

454
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,900
And he didn't because he was just being a typical guest.

455
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,640
And she started like absolutely losing her mind.

456
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,900
She was like, sir, please, please, sir.

457
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,520
And she's like, when someone asks you to do something, you do it.

458
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,460
And she like seemed like she was going to start crying.

459
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,820
And I was just looking around like, where's her lead?

460
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,840
Who's allowed?

461
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,060
Yeah, because that was awkward.

462
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,180
He was the problem.

463
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,920
And then she immediately became the problem.

464
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,060
She met him on his level where she she raised the stakes and everyone in the whole theater

465
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,340
was just silent and watching this drama play out.

466
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:23,660
Yeah.

467
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,220
Like we were all looking around like, where are the other cast members?

468
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,180
And I was just like, this is not appropriate.

469
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,300
We went into the first musical number with a very odd mood in the theater.

470
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,080
Yeah.

471
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,140
We watched this cast member like storm out of the room crying in anger.

472
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,020
And then Sebastian pops up like under dust.

473
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,780
With like the little snail puppets.

474
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,280
It was a weird vibe.

475
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,720
Very strange.

476
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,140
I got to work a little harder at the top, Mon.

477
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,820
Get the crowd back.

478
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Tough thing to follow.

479
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
They said they're not to warm it up.

480
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,980
Were you with me at the opening of Cars Land?

481
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,640
And Cars Land was a mess.

482
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,960
The Radiator Springs Racer, the big opening weekend and the following weekend.

483
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
So yeah, so there was a whole mess and there might have been like it might have been down

484
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,340
or fast passes.

485
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,340
There was some problem.

486
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,180
And there was a cast member screaming at everyone.

487
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,940
And we went up to another cast member and they were like, they're from Florida.

488
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,780
And it was like a whole thing of like, uh.

489
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,020
I think it is a different training protocol there.

490
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,580
Well, I think that weather, that Florida weather can just drive anyone to madness.

491
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,660
And it's such a big park.

492
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,960
I think people slip through the cracks in training.

493
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,620
Oh yeah.

494
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,220
Higher turnover with the college program being a bigger presence out there.

495
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,460
So I think Florida is really different.

496
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,020
Sometimes for the worse, but it makes it more exciting.

497
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,200
It's like the wild west.

498
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,140
Yeah.

499
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,260
I also got yelled at in Pandora because I stopped to take a picture in the queue of

500
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,820
Flight of Passage, which is beautiful.

501
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,400
This guy was like, it's not a photo shoot.

502
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,080
And I was like, can you imagine an imagineer who like sculpted all this by hand?

503
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,140
Like they're going to feel like they're there.

504
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,480
They're going to think it's amazing.

505
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,140
And it's like, stop being dazzled by our alien.

506
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,280
That was also a photo shoot in this day and age.

507
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,620
The park is giant.

508
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,320
The whole park is a photo shoot.

509
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,400
That was a cast member?

510
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,740
Yeah.

511
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,280
Wow.

512
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,320
That's very odd.

513
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,000
I think he was working the line of Flight of Passage.

514
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,440
Yeah.

515
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,660
I mean, the nice way is like, oh, can you step to the side if you want to take a picture?

516
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,220
Yeah, because the company is not going to like to hear that because the pictures on

517
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,780
Instagram and Twitter and stuff are free marketing.

518
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,820
That's part of the experience is to be so impressed by what you're seeing that you want

519
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,080
to keep a memory of it.

520
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,540
But I don't know, it kind of became like an in-joke with my friend and I like whenever

521
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,160
one of our phones came out, we'd be like, ma'am, it's not a photo shoot.

522
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,760
Ma'am, please.

523
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,200
If you had Imagineer of Pandora, Joe Rode, he's listening to this.

524
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,040
He's crushed his can of whatever he's drinking.

525
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,140
And he's just like, I have to make a call.

526
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
Yeah, that guy's getting fired.

527
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,100
They'll find him somehow.

528
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,040
He's going to have to come undercover boss and just pose as a regular cast member.

529
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,260
The earring is so subtle.

530
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,280
It'll be really easy.

531
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,040
It's very Disney look.

532
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,680
He'll have to disguise it like he'll put prosthetics over it or something.

533
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,520
And he'll go to the back of his ear and wear a mullet wig.

534
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,700
Oh, that's a good idea.

535
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,040
Yeah, you're going to need a wig.

536
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,260
There's going to need some wig work.

537
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,940
This is just a dreadlock.

538
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:13,680
Exactly.

539
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,320
So, Jenny, what did you do?

540
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,360
What was your...

541
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,240
I had two different roles.

542
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,340
I was there for about three years total, I think.

543
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,420
So for the first half of my time, I was Circle D, which is the horses primarily, but it was

544
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,700
the petting farm animals when we still had that.

545
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
It's also the dogs at the kennel.

546
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,980
So it's literally anything alive that works at the resort.

547
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,180
This was before my time, but they used to handle the birds that would open the Jungle

548
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,380
Cruise in the morning and then live in the cages there.

549
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,300
They would be the ones that brought them out and back.

550
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,620
I also, I guess for a time there were spiders somewhere.

551
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,620
I want to say it was in a bugs land.

552
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,020
They had like display spiders or maybe it was at the end of Tarzan's tree house or something,

553
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,700
but they took care of the spiders too.

554
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,760
I don't think I knew about the birds, real birds in the jungle.

555
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,960
Yeah, they used to have in the cages hanging in the queue, like in the office area, they

556
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,920
would leave birds in there.

557
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,480
And then every morning when the jungle opened, they would bring out a bird on their arm and

558
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,800
be like, let's open the jungle for the day.

559
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,640
Oh, interesting.

560
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,460
But all before my time.

561
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,520
But I did know the cast members that owned the birds that had taken them home.

562
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,640
And then after that I transferred because I was upset that the petting farm was closing.

563
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,040
It was my favorite location.

564
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,940
Did you do the running of the goats?

565
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,540
Oh yeah.

566
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,380
Oh yeah.

567
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,400
That was my jam.

568
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,760
That was my favorite thing.

569
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,300
Yeah.

570
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,220
So, so, uh, they, yeah, in the back of Disneyland, basically there were goats and during the

571
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,600
daytime they would be out and you could pet them and would you feed them with it?

572
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,040
That's not allowed.

573
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,960
We wouldn't feed them there.

574
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,360
Goats have like very, they have multiple stomachs, so they digest for a long time.

575
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,700
So they would get a large breakfast in the morning and then at the end of the day they

576
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,660
would go home for their dinner.

577
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,620
That's why they ran.

578
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,920
Their motivation was they knew that dinner was waiting.

579
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,040
Oh, that's about how I live my life.

580
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,920
That's how you train a goat.

581
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,360
That's how you train Jason too.

582
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah.

583
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,340
Sorry, set the scene here.

584
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,040
You never saw the running of the goats?

585
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,620
Oh, they never have.

586
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,980
And so for anyone else who hasn't, can you narrate this?

587
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,160
This is Jason's second favorite thing to do at Disneyland.

588
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,820
It's so good.

589
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,020
I would, every time I was in the park would go and pet the goats.

590
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,960
The goats are amazing.

591
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,920
Who's your favorite goat?

592
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,320
Uh, all of them.

593
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,820
I couldn't choose a favorite.

594
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,980
Okay, you don't know any of their names.

595
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,180
No, I didn't learn any names.

596
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Scoot number one, round three of the trivia contest.

597
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,700
I know, I bet I could still name all the goats.

598
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,320
I had my favorite.

599
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Oh yeah, name some goats.

600
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:23,700
Go for it.

601
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,280
Oh, we had, um, we had a Medusa and a Leota.

602
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
They were, um, our spooky goat sisters.

603
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,500
We had Penny and Jane.

604
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,580
They were the white goats.

605
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,260
Um, Pongo, we had Lock, Shock and Barrel.

606
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,160
The triplets, they were my favorite.

607
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,980
They were very cuddly.

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,880
What were Lock, Shock and Barrel from?

609
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,240
The Nightmare, uh,

610
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,560
Um, yeah, Nightmare Before Christmas.

611
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,740
And Lock was the sweetest goat.

612
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,680
I forgot about Madame Leota and I was like, there's a goat named after Ray Liotta?

613
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,840
Yeah, Ray Liotta.

614
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,420
That's an interesting...

615
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,220
One of Disney's legends, Ray Liotta.

616
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,740
Yeah, Disney legend Ray Liotta.

617
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,660
And he said Penny and Jane.

618
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,360
We had, uh, Lilo and Stitch and, um, Mulan was the mother of Lilo and Stitch.

619
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,860
Did they all actively, uh, were they in pairs or is it siblings when they're all...

620
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,840
It's a lot of sibling groups and goats have really strong family bonds.

621
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,340
Um, we also got Bernard and Bianca.

622
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,040
They were babies.

623
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:19,300
The last year the farm was open and, um, our two sheep were Thunder and Bolt.

624
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
Oh, very cool.

625
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:21,920
That's nice.

626
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,820
Um, so the running, can you explain this then?

627
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,900
Yeah, so every night at closing we would close the main gate where people enter the petting

628
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,720
farm that like closes it off from the park.

629
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,940
And then we would move all the guests that wanted to stay to watch the running of the

630
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,660
goats over toward the cabin so they were clear of the path.

631
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,500
And then we would just open the gate and all the goats would like, know to run in a straight

632
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,460
line all the way backstage and all the way over the berm and back to their farm.

633
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,300
They would go like a distance too.

634
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,840
You would think like when I would see it...

635
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,720
Way backstage too.

636
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,640
So it was a while.

637
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,040
Right.

638
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,960
Like I would, I would see it and I would be like, why doesn't one just peel off and head

639
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,800
to fantasy land?

640
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,500
Like it's weird that they know...

641
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,020
That's another thing is they're such like social creatures is they always prefer to

642
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,700
follow the group.

643
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,260
So you would usually have the one dominant goat on a lead and then the cast member leading

644
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,760
the run.

645
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,340
Um, and that one would be usually lock or barrel.

646
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,000
And when Pongo, before he retired, it was always Pongo.

647
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,480
He was like our patriarch.

648
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,500
Um, so you would put the biggest one on a lead and then all the goats would follow the

649
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,040
leader goat.

650
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,060
Pongo was the glue, like Phil Hartman on SNL.

651
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,100
Pongo was a great goat.

652
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,780
Pongo was the leader of the cast.

653
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,940
Pongo would always like get on the high barrels.

654
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,140
So usually when you see someone has a picture with a goat, it would be Pongo.

655
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,780
Um, but he retired, he was getting really old.

656
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,740
So okay.

657
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,780
And what, what became of all of this?

658
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,900
What happened to all these other, because this is, uh, I'm correct, right?

659
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,020
This is the area that is now a Star Wars Galaxy's Edge.

660
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,360
So what, what, uh, where are the goats today?

661
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,800
The goats, um, the goats when I was there that would retire, they could, they would

662
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
just kind of go usually in sibling pairs.

663
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,060
Although Pongo got adopted off by himself.

664
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,700
Um, but they would either go in like ones or twos, um, just to cast members who wanted

665
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,200
them or friends of cast members, former cast members.

666
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,480
And then we were really lucky that when the farm closed, all of the goats went to the

667
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,800
same family who were like former cast members.

668
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,260
They live out in Marietta and they have like a big farm property.

669
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,180
So they took not only all the goats, but also the two donkeys.

670
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,960
Oh wow.

671
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,680
And then the cow went to a different cast member.

672
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,380
I hated the cow.

673
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,020
She was the meanest little cow.

674
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,320
She's just such a mean creature.

675
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,200
The cow's not bothering all the goats you like.

676
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,820
That's great.

677
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,200
Well, and she was always in her own pen, but um, she's still mad about the reception of

678
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,980
home on the range.

679
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:26,740
I think so.

680
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,280
I think it was part of it.

681
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,100
But um, and they had a bigger cow named after one of those cows, I think Daisy or something.

682
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,240
She was before I was there.

683
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,140
I heard she was really sweet, but we had a miniature cow named Clarabelle and I don't

684
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,840
know if it's a cow thing or a miniature cow thing, but she was so aggressive.

685
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Like the only time she seemed happy was when she was attacking people or destroying things.

686
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,980
Wow.

687
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,140
And she was like her low center of gravity made her like the perfect height to try to

688
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,380
knock you over and then kick you in the face.

689
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,120
The cow would try to knock you over.

690
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:58,760
Oh yeah.

691
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,000
And then you're trying to like kind of manhandle her.

692
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,940
That's the only way to like move a cow.

693
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,860
They're not like horses.

694
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,280
They have really big skulls.

695
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,920
So you can't just put a halter on and have leverage.

696
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,560
You have to like get them in the nose.

697
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,060
You have to like grab or hit their nose to stop them from like hurting you.

698
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,040
But um, guests would be watching.

699
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,400
So you'd have to be like gentle and be like, Oh, she just wants to play.

700
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,640
And they'd be like, look at the baby cow.

701
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,700
And you're like, no, it's like that movie, the orphan.

702
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,340
This is like a middle aged cow.

703
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,420
She's just small.

704
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,640
She's not a baby.

705
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,620
She's an adult.

706
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,360
She's like a scary woman and a cow's body.

707
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,040
Did they give you like lines to say when you were like trying to aggressively wrestle a

708
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,060
cow?

709
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,880
And some people weren't coy about it.

710
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,420
They were just like, she's being a brat.

711
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,760
And they'd like hit her in the face.

712
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,240
But I would always be like, Oh, Clarabelle's a silly cow.

713
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,440
You're trying to like smile as you're like trying to keep an eye on the cow so she doesn't

714
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,380
like kill you.

715
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,440
Um, but, and then we would also bring the horses out that work on main street.

716
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,040
We'd bring them for one hour sets where we would just keep them in the little pen there

717
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,580
and people could pet them over the fence.

718
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,500
Oh, wow.

719
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,360
And then of course we'd get people like, his home is so small, this poor horse.

720
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,440
And you're like, he's only here for an hour.

721
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,100
Or you can tell because the whole time he's here, there's a person with him holding him

722
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,780
on a halter.

723
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,180
Like, do you think that's his life?

724
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,720
Like there's always a human holding his face.

725
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,180
And then at the same time, guests would be like, when it's time for the horse to go home

726
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,760
and get lunch or get some water, they'd be like, I didn't like my kids didn't get to

727
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,320
pet him yet.

728
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,440
And it's like, well, do you want the horse to stay here in the heat or do you want the

729
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
horse to be happy?

730
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,920
It's like, you can't have both.

731
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,620
It is crazy to think about Disney having, this is the thing that like in the parks,

732
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,800
that discipline that you may not think about, just as like an average guest, it's like,

733
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,640
oh, there's a massive livestock operation going on behind the scenes.

734
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,260
It's huge.

735
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,080
It was five acres backstage.

736
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,380
Wow.

737
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,340
And that would include the big arena where the horses would exercise.

738
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,440
And then we also had an automated hot walker.

739
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,860
We called it the panel walker because it had like large panel doors and then a full barn

740
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,420
with all the horses and a full outside stall accommodation.

741
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,100
So if it was cold, we'd bring them in and if not, they would stay outside and have fresh

742
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,340
air.

743
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,740
So it was massive.

744
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,020
And then a smaller barn for the goats and the barn animals.

745
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,860
It sounds nice.

746
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,580
It seems like a good place for animals to live.

747
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:14,720
It was.

748
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,540
I think it was like, it was nice space.

749
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,320
It didn't feel as much like a barn because it was kind of surrounded by those backstage

750
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,840
roads.

751
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,960
So it felt a little like a lot of concrete, not a lot of like nice natural farmland you'd

752
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,840
picture for animals.

753
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,000
So I think the new facility they have out on Norco is like a lot more pleasant for a

754
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,800
horse, even though it is really inconvenient and far away.

755
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,620
They have to walk really, where is it?

756
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,620
It's in Norco.

757
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,420
So it's like, I don't know.

758
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,740
Where is that?

759
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,020
I don't know the area, but it's called horse town USA.

760
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,820
It's a very horsey area.

761
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,400
That's literally what Norco is called.

762
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,440
Really?

763
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,080
It's pretty delightful.

764
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:46,900
Wow.

765
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Was there ever a, like a, like were there problems?

766
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,620
Was there ever like an animal that like wandered somewhere shouldn't like, or is it just such

767
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,180
a lockdown system that though animals know what to do?

768
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:57,720
It's pretty locked down.

769
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,960
I mean, with anything you'll have like accidents, like, you know, sometimes you'd have a horse

770
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,200
that's like pulling the street car and tries to go the wrong direction.

771
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,540
If it's like a newbie horse or like they might spook, but there's such large horses that

772
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,500
even if they spook, they might trot.

773
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,500
They just don't have the energy to want to like run away with anyone.

774
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,560
Which is what I like about draft horses.

775
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,420
So I don't know.

776
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,080
I heard about stuff before I went there.

777
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,600
Did you have any interaction with the cats of Disneyland?

778
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,060
Yeah, that was another part of the operation was, um, not interacting with them so much,

779
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,760
but we would leave out food for the Disneyland cats in like backstage cat kennels at key

780
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,360
locations.

781
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,440
So you'd go around your little like golf cart and restock their food.

782
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,780
And the purpose of that was like, firstly, so they're not begging guests for food.

783
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,080
Cause that can be like a safety concern for everybody.

784
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,000
But the main function was to make sure they weren't carrying disease because to access

785
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,180
the cat kennels, they had to like crawl through this fuzzy tube that was lined with flea repellent.

786
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:56,880
Oh wow.

787
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,460
Yeah.

788
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,780
And then every couple of months they would not leave out the food.

789
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,720
And then at night they would put out traps with like more delicious food and then they

790
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,780
would trap, um, vaccinate, spay, neuter and release.

791
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,180
So if you see the cats in the park, if they have like a notch in their ear, that means

792
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,660
they've been successfully trapped and spayed, neutered, vaccinated.

793
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,940
And if they don't have the notch, it's like a wily cat that's been avoiding the traps.

794
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,640
That's crazy.

795
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,000
Interesting.

796
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,880
This is a little hidden Mickey game you play.

797
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:22,940
Yeah.

798
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,820
There you go.

799
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,160
For the, for the, those of you who don't know, there are cats that, they call them feral

800
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,500
cats, but not really feral, right?

801
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,980
They're pretty feral.

802
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,500
How are they?

803
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,600
I mean, some of them are friendly and they'll come up to people, especially the old ones.

804
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,120
Anytime I'm at the Disneyland hotel, I see at least one or two cats walking around the property.

805
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:38,360
They're pretty friendly.

806
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,120
The best place to see them is the rivers of America or by Grizzly River Run.

807
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,440
They're usually like in the plants and most of them are pretty shy.

808
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,180
So you just kind of observe them from a distance, but they're pretty cool.

809
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,560
They're kept there though, to keep mice away.

810
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,140
Is that real?

811
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,860
Is that really the purpose or they're just there?

812
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,140
I mean, there's, there's that urban legend that that's how they got there in the first

813
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,280
place, but as it is now, the company's not intentionally trying to keep them there.

814
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,900
They're just trying to keep them healthy and control the population.

815
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,180
Interesting.

816
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,420
So they're not carrying disease.

817
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,820
And I think the, the thinking is that the capture, spay and release is considered a

818
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,380
better option for population control than removing them from the area because then they'll

819
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,920
just like have more babies to fill the void in the ecosystem, I guess.

820
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,840
But yeah, when they are able to catch kittens when they're cat trapping or if they catch

821
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,760
one and notice that it's like really friendly and really adapted to humans, they'll just

822
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,200
adopt them out to cast members.

823
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:31,860
Wow.

824
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,220
But are we sure that Disney isn't just using these cats to concoct a secret formula of

825
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,800
cat flu?

826
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,620
I think it is kind of like symbiotic though, because you don't see a lot of rats at Disneyland.

827
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,320
Right.

828
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,600
When you said more delicious food, uh, do you know what brand?

829
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,980
Uh, like do they go with like a normal Iams and then they go with like a, like a real

830
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,660
piece of meat?

831
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,600
I think it is like real meat when it's the trapping nights or just like a more premium

832
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,160
brand.

833
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,800
I wasn't one of the cat trappers.

834
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,880
That was like an optional position you could train in if you wanted to work very late shifts.

835
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:04,340
Wow.

836
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,620
Really?

837
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,560
I heard it was very fun because you would, it would just be you and another cast member

838
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,220
cruising around in the golf cart all night.

839
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,040
It's really chill.

840
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,480
You get to go in weird areas of the park because they trap along the rivers of America, but

841
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,820
it wasn't a knowledge that I ever bothered to pick up while I was there.

842
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,700
Could you hire right into that job?

843
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,740
Because that's a job I feel like I would like to do for like a couple weeks.

844
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,040
For just cat trapping?

845
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,880
Just cat trapping.

846
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,680
It has to be part of the other livestock.

847
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,180
All the animals are the same job.

848
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,340
So first and foremost, it's going to be the horse knowledge that they look for.

849
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,040
Jason and I and like safari hats and a golf cart.

850
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,260
Well yeah, all white.

851
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,540
I know, it sounds fun, right?

852
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,120
All white giant nets.

853
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,840
Like full on Looney Tunes dog catcher.

854
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,620
I think they did have at least one large net, but I don't think that was usually what was

855
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,820
helping them catch the cat.

856
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,320
I think it was a backup plan.

857
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,280
That's a great idea.

858
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,640
You can put on the table.

859
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,220
Revolutionize the system.

860
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,840
And like show up at City Hall one day with giant nets and like, hello.

861
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,140
It was funny because you would get people asking if they could leave their cats there.

862
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,860
Like if you worked a kennel shift, like you would get calls like, I found a stray cat.

863
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,160
Can I like drop it off there?

864
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,420
Because I know you guys have a cat program and it's like, no, we're not, we're not taking

865
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,900
your cats and turning them loose.

866
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,140
Yeah, this is not a shelter.

867
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,600
This is not a rescue.

868
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,020
You hear rumors like, oh, Disneyland trains the cats and then every night they play a

869
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,800
bell and the cats all run to their kennels.

870
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,200
Like we're like a pied piper of cats or something.

871
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,220
I think I've heard that.

872
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:27,600
Yeah.

873
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,520
What do you think they are, goats or something?

874
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah, they're not trained.

875
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,560
They're super feral.

876
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,080
Wow.

877
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,420
And then the ones that are less feral, like I said, tend to get adopted out.

878
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,840
So a lot of cast members take home cats.

879
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,300
A lot of cast members will just grab a cat if they find a kitten and keep it, which they're

880
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,120
not supposed to do.

881
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,920
They're supposed to go through the official channels.

882
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,560
But do you hear about cast members like, yeah, I found a kitten and I took it home.

883
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,520
It's like, you're going to get ringworm because you should have waited for them to vaccinate

884
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:51,840
at first.

885
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,360
If we worked there, we would have told on those employees because we are good boys who

886
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,960
follow the rules.

887
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,100
Good boys who follow the rules.

888
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,280
Jenna, you were saying that there was another place you were, where was the other place

889
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,700
you worked on?

890
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,920
I transferred to guest relations, which is like, it's a couple of different things.

891
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,920
It's the department that handles VIPs.

892
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,860
It's the tours and it's complaints and information.

893
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,320
A lot of complaints.

894
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,820
Well, how'd that go?

895
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,460
I liked that one better.

896
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:18,820
Oh really?

897
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,660
Yeah.

898
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,380
I mean, I already knew that I didn't mind angry guests.

899
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,940
I kind of liked handling the people who are really angry.

900
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,720
And you would get that at the kennel a lot because I was like a lead at the kennel too.

901
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,800
So if somebody gets turned away and they're like, well, I want to talk to your lead, you're

902
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,340
the one that gets to drive over there and be like, okay, here's why we're not letting

903
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,400
your dog into the kennel.

904
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,600
And it would always be because they weren't vaccinated or they didn't bring their proof

905
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,460
of vaccination.

906
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,880
But if people's vacations are at stake and they get there and find out they can't leave

907
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,220
their dog in the kennel, there can be a lot of emotions attached to that.

908
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,660
But yeah, it never bothered me.

909
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,780
So I was like, I could just do this all the time and listen to angry people.

910
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,820
Did you find it to be sort of a test?

911
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:07,620
Could you have enough of a sunny Disney disposition enough to counter any anger you faced?

912
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,660
Yeah, it is kind of like a test.

913
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,300
And also I think it's a good test of social anxiety, which I think I have sometimes to

914
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,620
just be like, I'll talk to strangers and not just any strangers, angry strangers.

915
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,920
Furious people with potentially furious dogs.

916
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,180
Yeah, exactly.

917
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,840
So yeah, I liked dealing with difficult guests.

918
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,100
And in fact, when I was at Circle D, if they were ever like, yeah, someone's really angry

919
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,700
down at the kennel, we need to send a lead.

920
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
I'd be like, I'm free.

921
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,760
I can go down there.

922
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,760
Take care of that.

923
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,940
That one is interesting because you are leaving a dog in a facility with people.

924
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,140
One of the issues I think that people have with the Disney parks is guests, if you're

925
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:54,280
going, maybe spend five, 10 minutes on the computer, googling good things to do.

926
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,720
People don't do any research.

927
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,380
Because there's so much at stake, like I said.

928
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,860
And it's like, you'd think you'd go on the website and find out exactly what you need.

929
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,240
And we would work with people, like if their dog was in fact vaccinated, we would offer

930
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,960
to call their vet's office on their behalf.

931
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,340
We had a fax machine there.

932
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,660
We were like, they can fax or email us the papers.

933
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,580
We'll print them here.

934
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,180
We do have to wait until we get them to check you in though.

935
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,160
And some people, it would become clear that they just didn't have the shots, in which

936
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,300
case we'd give them a list of like, here are local vets that'll do it today.

937
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,380
You can just come back.

938
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,940
Oh yeah.

939
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,820
So we tried to work with them, but it's like, you know, if they came on a Sunday and their

940
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,360
vet's office wasn't open or if they didn't want to drive out and find a vet, it's like,

941
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,840
you know, people, if there's any wrench thrown in their plans, I think Disney vacations,

942
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,880
they cost so much and people plan for so long ahead of time that, like I said, there's a

943
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,860
lot of emotion in it.

944
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,820
And I think that even if there's a solution that you're presenting to them, the fact that

945
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,940
they're going to have to delay going in for three hours and they didn't plan for that,

946
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,620
it can just get them in a tizzy really fast.

947
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,240
Yeah.

948
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,600
But I mean, I mean, I get when people are, sorry, I don't get when people are like, I

949
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,500
showed up at noon.

950
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,120
What do you mean?

951
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,020
I can't just walk on every ride or get a table at like a restaurant immediately.

952
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:09,100
Dog stuff is like, I guess in California, I just feel like people take better care of

953
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,480
their dogs, but it's like, that's quick.

954
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,240
Cause you can't like, if something's wrong with the hotel room, yeah, you can move into

955
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,020
another room or like hit a button and it's like, okay, you got a dining credit or whatever,

956
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,640
but like it's a dog.

957
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,200
Yeah.

958
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,740
And with dog stuff, it's like, even if you're okay with your dog catching something and

959
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,540
getting sick, the kennel can get audited.

960
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,360
It's like there are state regulations for what they have to have.

961
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,200
So it's like, we straight up can't take the dog if it doesn't have the shots and the proof

962
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,880
of the shots.

963
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,820
Like, is my dog cute enough for you to override all of that?

964
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,740
And we would get that.

965
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,660
We would have people begging and yelling.

966
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,840
And then there was one time I, I had to go down and talk to the angry, you know, wife.

967
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,580
And then she called her husband and I had to talk to him too.

968
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,380
And it was just like, I'll talk to all, I'll talk to your whole family, but we're not taking

969
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,000
the dog into the kennel.

970
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,520
Give me your whole family and your disgusting disease ridden animal.

971
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,400
I'll talk to the dog if it helps.

972
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:05,140
Is that though, do you have a, in your head, like the top three, like worst one, like craziest

973
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,120
people to deal with?

974
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,940
Or do you have any memories of the worst or most intense situations?

975
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,140
I had a woman who called my lead at city hall a retard.

976
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,140
Oh God.

977
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,280
I know.

978
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,640
And the reason she was trying to like con us into getting a park hopper and she was

979
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,200
in Disneyland and she said she needed to go to California adventure because they had those

980
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,340
chili cones at cars land.

981
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,160
And she said that she was pregnant and that was all she wanted.

982
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,640
And I was like, well, we have chili here.

983
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,660
You can get gumbo, you can get chili.

984
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,960
I will write you a voucher for a chili if it'll cheer you up.

985
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,160
But she's like, no, I need to go into that park.

986
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,200
And I was like, ma'am, it's 2 p.m.

987
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,140
If you park hop now, you will have gotten the value of a park hopper ticket.

988
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,380
You can upgrade to it.

989
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,700
But you know, maybe if you'd only been in the park for an hour, I could send you over

990
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,380
there and give you a one park ticket where you're just in that park.

991
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,100
But if you've already had half the day in one park and then you go to the other, you

992
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,940
have park hopped.

993
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,420
That is the value of a park hopper ticket.

994
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,420
So you have to upgrade at that point.

995
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,740
But she started off dealing with my manager and she was like yelling at him and I could

996
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,940
see him getting really mad back where he was like, ma'am, if you're not going to like respect

997
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,680
me and listen to me.

998
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,960
And whenever you see people getting emotional, you're like, OK, I need to step in.

999
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,180
Yeah.

1000
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
So I was like, oh, what's going on over here?

1001
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,420
I can assist your guests.

1002
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,560
And he was like, OK.

1003
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,560
And she's like, yeah, I'm trying to get into California Adventure and this retard over

1004
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:26,960
here.

1005
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,820
And I was just like, ma'am, if you're not going to be respectful, I'm not going to help

1006
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,040
you.

1007
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,300
And she was like, OK, I'm sorry.

1008
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,760
I'm sorry.

1009
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
It's like you can get mad at people a little bit if they're not using respectful language.

1010
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,120
You can be like, you can't say that in Disneyland.

1011
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,860
But then she just said it's soft spoken.

1012
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,760
And that was fun.

1013
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,080
And she didn't get her park hopper.

1014
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,160
I think I gave her like a fast pass to a ride or something.

1015
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,480
But she still came out on top.

1016
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:51,960
She did.

1017
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,960
Usually people leave with something and you at least want to make them feel that they've

1018
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,320
been listened to and make them feel like they won.

1019
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,400
And then they're not angry.

1020
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,760
And it costs us nothing to give them a fast pass.

1021
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,040
So that's kind of fun about it, too, is it's city hall like you do have the power to

1022
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,120
pretty much do anything for them.

1023
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,660
You can give them park hopper tickets if it's an appropriate situation for it, or you

1024
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,280
can give them tickets to come back.

1025
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,200
You can get them seating sometimes if you pair up with the people arranging the seating

1026
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,240
that night for like parades and shows.

1027
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,240
Fast passes, obviously, you could probably give out like 100 fast passes a day without

1028
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,820
people being like you're giving out too many fast passes.

1029
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,880
So here's a hack for anyone listening.

1030
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,940
Go to get services.

1031
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,780
No, be difficult like a maniac.

1032
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,340
But people, they're like they know they know they've seen everything at that point.

1033
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,700
So it just does come down to like what the situation is and what feels appropriate.

1034
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,760
And that was what they really hammered in in training is they're like, is it possible?

1035
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,720
Is it appropriate?

1036
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,480
And then you kind of work from there.

1037
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,220
And it's so case by case that that's what I liked about it is like if you were stuck on

1038
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,480
something, you could excuse yourself and talk to your lead and be like, here's what's going

1039
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,100
on. What do you think I should do?

1040
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,200
But usually, like no one would question your choices and you would just document

1041
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,180
everything if you did give them free things.

1042
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,240
But yeah, you did feel like you had a lot of power to fix people's trips.

1043
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,940
So if it is like a person who's not scamming you, who's in there because they're having a

1044
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,380
frustrating time, it did feel really good to like help them turn it around.

1045
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,880
So I liked that one.

1046
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,420
I liked it better than Circle D, I think.

1047
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,960
I like the idea that someone was yelling loudly about Chili in City Hall, which is a thing.

1048
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,340
Well, Walt would have felt the same.

1049
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,660
Chili is very important.

1050
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:37,960
Yeah. Speaking of City Hall on the podcast, we've we've started a little campaign to try to

1051
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,380
make our very own Jason Sheridan the mayor of Disneyland, which is a position we were made

1052
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,820
aware of. Did you ever have any interaction with the mayor of Disneyland?

1053
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,920
I didn't even know that was a thing.

1054
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,660
What is the mayor of Disneyland?

1055
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,740
It's a cast member.

1056
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,420
The one in Florida recently passed away.

1057
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,480
That's I'm just trying to find more information.

1058
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,580
Is there even actually a current mayor?

1059
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,740
That's what I'm wondering.

1060
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,200
What does it entail?

1061
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,480
So what happened was in 2014, we were at the anniversary, like whatever, 59th anniversary.

1062
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,960
And they said, ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Disneyland and a man in the top hat.

1063
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,400
And so this is crazy that you've never met the mayor.

1064
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,320
So he comes out.

1065
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,880
He does a big ceremony.

1066
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,560
And I was like, oh, my God, there's a mayor and Jason should be the mayor in 20 years.

1067
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,560
So what did he do?

1068
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,160
He just said, like, oh, welcome.

1069
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,680
Did he carry a key to Disneyland?

1070
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,960
He just he was. Are you sure it wasn't just an eccentric man?

1071
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,620
Somebody is somebody announced him.

1072
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,780
So that's how I knew it was official.

1073
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,180
Was it the voice of Disneyland?

1074
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,200
Like a recording? Yes, it was a whole thing.

1075
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,680
And it was all ceremony with all the characters.

1076
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,040
And they said mayor of Disney. Yes.

1077
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,580
So was he an old man?

1078
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,620
He seemed to make a wish.

1079
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,100
If he's like 18, I don't think so.

1080
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,720
Maybe it's make a wish foundation.

1081
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,280
So the reason I know I'm not crazy is 40 year old man.

1082
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,280
You're like, that's not.

1083
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,560
Well, if we need to go make a wish for you, then we can lie our way into getting you that.

1084
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,560
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's another bad guess.

1085
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,960
I have had people lie and say they're on make a wish trips that aren't because our department would handle that, too.

1086
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,840
But you would get the heads up about that.

1087
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,840
You would be well, I already have the list of all the guests that are coming.

1088
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,140
But I had a man come to one of our viewing sections with a forged make a wish email that had the letterhead and everything.

1089
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,980
Yeah. And I called back Chamber of Commerce, like, you know, is this family on the list?

1090
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,000
And they were like, no.

1091
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,980
And that man started like yelling at my coworker.

1092
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,980
He had a girl there that was actually in like a motorized wheelchair.

1093
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,780
And it was like a legit one. It wasn't an e.c.v.

1094
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,960
It was an actual joystick operated wheelchair.

1095
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,740
So I was like, so she's got some medical condition.

1096
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,080
She's not on a make a wish trip.

1097
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,680
But I did give them viewing.

1098
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,580
We had like an extra standing room only section.

1099
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,720
And I was like, well, the child that's sick is already in a chair so I can put the family in the standing room section.

1100
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,500
The girl can go in the front. It's fine.

1101
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,660
But then he was angry about that.

1102
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,180
He's like, those guests get benches and and you want us to stand like we're garbage in the back.

1103
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,020
And I was like, it's an unobstructed view.

1104
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,140
And then there again, that was one situation where I had this coworker.

1105
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,280
She wasn't there long.

1106
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,660
She started like yelling back to him and she's like, I felt threatened.

1107
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,440
He had tattoos. And I was just like, I guess I shouldn't say her name, but I was just like, you know, her name.

1108
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,140
And I was like, go stand in the corner.

1109
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,620
I will take care of this guest because it's like you don't yell back to guests.

1110
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,320
It looks bad. It's not a good look.

1111
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,560
It's not a good way to handle it.

1112
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,900
Even in this, the darkest Disneyland story I've ever heard.

1113
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,800
Forging make a wish documents.

1114
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,660
He was mad. And it was sad. They missed the show.

1115
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,720
He ended up pulling his whole family out of the section.

1116
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,800
And he was like, I'm going to go complain.

1117
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,900
And I was like, OK, you can tell them my name's Jenny.

1118
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,920
You can tell them what happened. It's fine.

1119
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,620
Because I knew I was in the right.

1120
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,640
I'd already called on my management and everything.

1121
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,720
But it's like, you know, sometimes if you get a guest like that, you're just like, OK, he's going to yell at me for two minutes and see he's not going anywhere and just leave.

1122
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,160
So that's sometimes what it takes when you get people that are at that level.

1123
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,580
He'll lose his voice eventually.

1124
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,120
Yeah, he'll get frustrated yelling in circles with somebody that's not getting upset they're being yelled at.

1125
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,600
And it'll stop being satisfying and he'll leave.

1126
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,960
She didn't break at all.

1127
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,740
Her posture didn't change.

1128
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,580
Didn't melt to the puddle.

1129
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,700
I understand, sir. Yes, this must be very frustrating.

1130
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,220
You're welcome to go to Chamber of Commerce.

1131
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,740
Person in full plaid to have a breakdown from the yelling at you.

1132
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,600
Tears on plaid. That's what I wanted.

1133
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:20,480
To bring this back to the mayoral campaign, I think this should be, now that you're aware of this issue, Jason, I think that you should have a zero tolerance policy towards make a wish forgery.

1134
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,180
I think punishable by death.

1135
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,700
What method?

1136
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,480
By death?

1137
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,780
What method of execution?

1138
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,440
Yeah, we got to figure that out.

1139
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,880
Drowning in the rivers of America.

1140
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,940
Walking the plank off the Columbia.

1141
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,580
Wearing like lots of like Disney mugs and piggy banks.

1142
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,540
Some oversized goofy shoes.

1143
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,120
Ah, sure. Yeah, yeah. Full of sand.

1144
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,420
Yeah.

1145
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,320
You could add a plank to the Mark Twain.

1146
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,260
Oh.

1147
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,480
Because Jason's favorite ride is the Mark Twain River.

1148
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,860
That would be classy, wouldn't it?

1149
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,700
So yeah, it would be a nice painted white plank and then you can make the march right off.

1150
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,740
But everybody's in black.

1151
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,600
Yes.

1152
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,580
The contrast is striking.

1153
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,800
Because you need a visual like why Trump wants the wall.

1154
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,620
Sir, you have sinned and justice must be done.

1155
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:13,320
What if you're watching the finale of Fantasmic and then the boat hits the center in front of the audience and then they go, ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Disneyland.

1156
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,380
We've got a real scumbag here.

1157
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,040
It's time to meet out some justice.

1158
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,660
Frontier justice.

1159
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,200
Yep.

1160
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,180
What do you think?

1161
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,240
They would love that.

1162
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,660
Can you imagine the hush that would fall over the crowd?

1163
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:31,380
And then, yeah, you have to repeat like, you know, 20 meters, 40 meters, Mark Twain.

1164
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,880
And then you push them off.

1165
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,420
It would be beautiful.

1166
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,460
Beautiful ceremony.

1167
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,160
And then the music picks back up.

1168
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:37,920
Yeah, the music.

1169
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,000
The dreams and yeah.

1170
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:48,180
And you know that as Mickey has defeated hypothetical made up evil, so has evil been defeated in our real world.

1171
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,740
By a real life Mickey S.

1172
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Hero to the mayor of Jason.

1173
00:47:52,600 --> 00:48:00,000
That said, any I will be very lenient on like old time bindle wearing carrying hobos.

1174
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,740
If they can get in the park, they're allowed to stripe whatever pie cooling.

1175
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:17,820
Yeah, they can, you know, if they're not allowed to carve their symbols saying like free pie or like they're not allowed to carve their hobo code in the park, but they are if they have chalk, they can use shock that washes away.

1176
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,440
But what if they steal that premium cat food?

1177
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,620
In the cat trap.

1178
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,560
If they can fight for it, they can have it.

1179
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,900
Them's the rules of the road.

1180
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,340
All right.

1181
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,780
Yeah, I think that's fair.

1182
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,180
Turn it into a soup.

1183
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,620
I think this multi-billion dollar company can afford a little extra premium cat food.

1184
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:42,380
Give them a let them dig, let them put their bindle into the chili tank where the cones are filled and whatever you can fit in there and you can get out.

1185
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,220
Yeah, go chili fishing.

1186
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,040
Is there a chili tank that was there a job at Disney where you have to supervise a chili tank?

1187
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,540
I mean, even backstage they had chili and it was Walt's chili because Walt loved his chili.

1188
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,080
Oh, really?

1189
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:54,540
He did.

1190
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,340
He loved chili.

1191
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,680
He loved grilled cheese sandwiches.

1192
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,060
If you ever go up to his apartment, he has like a panini press for grilled cheese sandwiches.

1193
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:01,640
Yeah.

1194
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,420
He loved that.

1195
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,020
He was a simple man because he didn't grow up wealthy.

1196
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,480
So his family, it was a lot of like depression food.

1197
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,000
So they ate a lot of chili.

1198
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,680
He loved grilled cheeses and he also loved Tom and Jerry's in a departure from the studio.

1199
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,840
That was like his favorite alcoholic drink.

1200
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,360
Really?

1201
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,140
Tom and Jerry.

1202
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,340
What's a Tom and Jerry?

1203
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,900
I think it's some kind of hot beverage.

1204
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,820
Like it's a hot alcoholic beverage.

1205
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,300
I want to say it's like gin.

1206
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,380
I think you just straight up drink hot gin.

1207
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,120
Or like, I don't know, but it sounded gross when I heard the recipe.

1208
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,800
At Carthay on the menu, there's a-

1209
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,780
The Walt's favorite drink.

1210
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,480
Scotch mist.

1211
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,080
And it's just scotch with an ice cube in it.

1212
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,680
And a lemon twist.

1213
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,780
It's really good.

1214
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,760
It is good, yeah.

1215
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,300
At the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco, there is like an exhibit.

1216
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,440
It's really incredible.

1217
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:54,600
And there is, do you remember like the display case of like, here's the stuff Walt liked to have in the house?

1218
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,700
And it was like jello diet custards and like chili.

1219
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:06,460
And there's debate about what his favorite kind of chili was, whether it was Hormel or a different brand of chili.

1220
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,940
We'll have two experts on to debate that one.

1221
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,460
Well they have their Disneyland recipe of Walt's chili.

1222
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,800
Yes, there is his classic chili.

1223
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
I have to assume that's like to his taste.

1224
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,920
And it's not very good.

1225
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,500
I got it once.

1226
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,360
It's not very good.

1227
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,280
We have to settle this debate.

1228
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,020
I'm tired of signing on to Twitter and what a divided-

1229
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,420
Like Hormel chili.

1230
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,860
These, it's, we have to, if we don't learn how to speak to each other on this Walt chili issue, then how do we move forward?

1231
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:38,020
I mean, they have all these other canned goods and replica goods at the museum of like, here's what he would send the housekeeper on shopping trips for, of like whipped, miracle, miracle whip.

1232
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,360
Miracle whip, just spooning it right onto the chili.

1233
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,260
Right, hot gin.

1234
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,460
Wash it down with a scone.

1235
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,480
Hot gin, miracle whip.

1236
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,300
Jason is such a Walt Disney fan.

1237
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,220
He, uh, he just eats exclusively from Walt's diet.

1238
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:49,700
Yeah.

1239
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,020
He's going to die very young.

1240
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,540
But happy.

1241
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,000
And mayor, and mayor of Disneyland.

1242
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,340
Yeah.

1243
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,440
Um, the only last, the last thing I had written down here.

1244
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,900
So when you're around the park, do you see, like, do you have interactions with, uh, the coolest, most famous people?

1245
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,740
And by that, I mean, Walt Disney Imagineers.

1246
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,100
Not that much.

1247
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,540
I mean, they go on VIP tours, but they're not the ones that we would see the most often.

1248
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:20,380
But, um, yeah, I mean, it seems like the people who tell you they're Imagineers are like the ones that aren't really.

1249
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,520
We've, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1250
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,040
People who are eager to name drop.

1251
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,940
More lies.

1252
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,160
I didn't know Disneyland was such a park of lies.

1253
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,780
So Trump shows up a lot though.

1254
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,440
He'll just ride the main street vehicles.

1255
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:39,400
I actually saw him more as a circle D cast member than a VIP guide because our tour guide, I should say VIP was a different, um, distinction.

1256
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,960
But same at universal.

1257
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,240
Yeah.

1258
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,460
Extra set of training.

1259
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,400
I wasn't up for it.

1260
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:53,800
You wanted to do, if you wanted to do the scripted tours or the, um, the one-on-one tours, everyone would handle the guests and like a concierge degree or like for the VIP seating.

1261
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,680
But, um, you would decide if you wanted to train into doing the one-on-one tours.

1262
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,440
And I always found those really awkward.

1263
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,000
The idea of following around a stranger's family all day.

1264
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,200
I just, I didn't have the spoons for that.

1265
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,760
So I preferred the scripted ones, but, um, but yeah, I would see a lot more as circle D.

1266
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,420
I would see Rolly Crump because he loves to just ride the main street vehicles and then tell you that he made them.

1267
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,440
It's really cute.

1268
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,900
It's awesome.

1269
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,640
That's great.

1270
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,980
Uh, wow.

1271
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,660
Um, those dorkish delight.

1272
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,760
If you're ever looking for them in the park, just stare at the horse drawn street car.

1273
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,580
You might see it rolling by.

1274
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,000
You might show up at some point.

1275
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,840
That is like the high school student going back at the football game.

1276
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,740
Like I used to play here, by the way.

1277
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,360
I don't know.

1278
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,580
Sorry.

1279
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,100
Not really Crump, Bob Gurr.

1280
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,180
Look, I'm losing all my busy knowledge.

1281
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,200
Bob Gurr.

1282
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,680
He was the one that fathered all those famous vehicles.

1283
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,340
That round counted for all the points.

1284
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,400
Joke's on you.

1285
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,440
We're up again.

1286
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,380
Or we're tied.

1287
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:49,980
I don't know.

1288
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,400
Yeah.

1289
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,300
You guys are like, we all knew that.

1290
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,920
We were just waiting for you to catch up.

1291
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,780
There's some Raleigh Crump exhibit happening.

1292
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,020
Right.

1293
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,860
The Van Eden Gallery selling all this stuff right now.

1294
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,300
Oh, neat.

1295
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,080
All right.

1296
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:00,760
They're both great.

1297
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,840
I hope he wants that.

1298
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,140
A lot of sketches and stuff.

1299
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:03,500
Oh, fun.

1300
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,040
Yeah.

1301
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,080
Both of them are pretty like public in the Southern California area of like doing talks and exhibits.

1302
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,460
Bob Gurr, wait, we contextualized Bob Gurr for people who don't know.

1303
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:13,440
Uh, yeah.

1304
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,280
Well, Main Street Vehicles.

1305
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,360
Uh, what else is he knowing?

1306
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,060
Later works on, um.

1307
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,120
We also designed the Omni Mover system.

1308
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:19,900
Oh, is that right?

1309
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,620
That was in my tour.

1310
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,260
That's why it suddenly jogged my memory.

1311
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,860
Worked on King Kong later for Universal, I believe.

1312
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,600
Yeah.

1313
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,580
I think they hired a special for.

1314
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,960
What a segue, Scott.

1315
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,420
Talking about Universal.

1316
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,580
Over to.

1317
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:37,440
We could talk to you about like cat traps and chili for more, many more hours.

1318
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,640
That should be the title of this episode.

1319
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,900
Cat traps and chili.

1320
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,500
That's true.

1321
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,200
Well, I was my, my, my ideal segue here was that we're all about to catch a giant case of cat flu.

1322
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,520
Oh, that's even better.

1323
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:48,940
Yeah.

1324
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,160
Yeah.

1325
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:49,680
Yeah.

1326
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,340
Because we're talking about Islands of Adventures, Cat in the Hat.

1327
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,100
Cat in the Hat.

1328
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,620
So you were just there.

1329
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,760
I was just there.

1330
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,220
Oh, okay.

1331
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,840
And was this your first time on this Cat in the Hat ride?

1332
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,160
Yeah.

1333
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,240
I've been to Islands of Adventure two times before that.

1334
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,360
And I did not even know that ride existed.

1335
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,520
Oh, really?

1336
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:07,560
Interesting.

1337
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,940
I, in fact, I didn't know there were really that many dark rides there.

1338
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:11,820
I love E.T.

1339
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,880
Um, but we were walking through Seuss land and my friend that I was with said she wanted to find characters.

1340
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,560
And I saw like a sign saying like Cat in the Hat.

1341
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:26,560
And my hopes were immediately up because it looked like a building, but I was like, no, we'll probably walk in and it'll be like a meet and greet of Cat in the Hat.

1342
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,720
So I even asked at the front and they were like, no, it's like a ride.

1343
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,080
And I was like, oh my God.

1344
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,680
Like a ride?

1345
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,740
So I was immediately very excited.

1346
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,440
Oh, it felt like a weird, like a, like a hidden thing almost.

1347
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,000
I know what you mean.

1348
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,060
It's just down a dark hallway.

1349
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:39,620
There's no showmanship on the building.

1350
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:44,340
Well, cause the giant sign does say Cat in the Hat, but it doesn't say Cole in the ride.

1351
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,740
Could be a meet and greet.

1352
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,600
I was going to say the fit for our like official nomenclature purposes.

1353
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,500
This ride is just called the Cat in the Hat.

1354
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,900
Not Cat in the Hat the ride.

1355
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,240
Just the Cat in the Hat.

1356
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:54,580
Yeah.

1357
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,340
I believe so.

1358
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:55,640
Yeah.

1359
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:08,760
Which may have been like, uh, this, this is the, I'll say in the original land of, uh, based on hyper successful children's books where the estate or persons involved in them were involved.

1360
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,940
Like before the Harry Potter stuff at Universal, the Geisel estate, uh,

1361
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,720
His wife's still alive, right?

1362
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,500
Yeah.

1363
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,800
His wife is still alive and she was like very hands on and like selling the rights and stuff.

1364
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,920
In fact, there is a plaque somewhere in Seuss Landing.

1365
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,000
The general area in which this ride is set.

1366
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,280
That is that pays homage to Doctor, to Theodore, to Dr.

1367
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,020
Seuss, but also to Mrs.

1368
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,460
Geisel.

1369
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,900
Let's just, we want to just commit to Geisel and neither we're wrong the whole time.

1370
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,200
That's fine.

1371
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:39,960
I'll say Geisel.

1372
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:40,640
I think it might be Geisel.

1373
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,140
Seuss.

1374
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,020
People will be mad.

1375
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,600
Yeah, yeah, Seuss.

1376
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:43,660
Seuss.

1377
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,740
Not Geisel Landing.

1378
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,100
Lord and Lady Seuss.

1379
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,380
We shall refer to that.

1380
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,460
But yeah, Seuss Land.

1381
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,660
Is it Seuss Landing?

1382
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,520
Seuss Landing.

1383
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,340
I think it's a good land.

1384
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,980
Like they did, they put effort in.

1385
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,980
I'm so used to California Universal where nothing seems to have involved effort in any step in the process.

1386
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,680
It's finally turning around.

1387
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,260
Yeah, a little bit.

1388
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,780
Their signs are like, we're better now, we promise.

1389
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1390
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,340
And Super Mario will be a step in that direction, I think.

1391
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,380
Oh, I'm so excited for that.

1392
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,380
Do we have a date yet?

1393
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:12,780
No.

1394
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,380
I don't think so.

1395
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,760
Five years from now.

1396
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,960
Yeah, whole nother problem is they were like, yeah, we're going to be building this stuff every year.

1397
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,120
And then nothing's open really since Harry Potter, like three years ago.

1398
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,360
Well, they did close Waterworld, right?

1399
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,400
No, it's still open.

1400
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,520
Okay, so they're not even clearing the land yet.

1401
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,620
No, that's not even necessarily going away.

1402
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,860
I don't think that's where it's going.

1403
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,820
I think Super Nintendo is probably going downstairs.

1404
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,260
I think it's near Transformers.

1405
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,600
They have already removed sound stages.

1406
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:47,520
25 through 22, which used to have CSI, the number one show at the time I was doing it.

1407
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:47,540
Oh, wow.

1408
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,920
Marg Helgenberger.

1409
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,800
Yeah, if you could keep doing a little bit, do a little more.

1410
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,020
Scott Coder right into the thing.

1411
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,020
What happened?

1412
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,180
What was the rest of that?

1413
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,020
You were a tram tour guy?

1414
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,240
Yeah, I did the tram tour.

1415
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:56,960
Yeah, yeah.

1416
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,780
Marg Helgenberger, who was the other one?

1417
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,960
Who was, did anyone know which CSI that was?

1418
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,400
Yeah, it's William.

1419
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,100
Oh, come on.

1420
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh, yeah, William something.

1421
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,100
William H. Macy.

1422
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,780
Sure, William H. Macy.

1423
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,700
I would just make up stuff.

1424
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,240
I could say from like to live and die in LA.

1425
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,560
Yeah, I think you're right.

1426
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,080
Yes, it's that guy.

1427
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,100
Um, thrilling.

1428
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,500
William Peterson.

1429
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,940
Yes, William Peterson.

1430
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,220
And later on Ted Danson.

1431
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,120
Uh-huh.

1432
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,200
Oh, the Ted Danson.

1433
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:35,420
On my audition, I had to like read a little blurb where I said all of the, I had to say all five of the Desperate Housewives,

1434
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:40,480
which is Desperate Housewives mania for that month that I did that job.

1435
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,140
And so-

1436
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,260
Were you allowed to read it or did you have to memorize it?

1437
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,100
Yeah, you had notes in front of you.

1438
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:52,220
Before my, for this audition purpose, I was handed a little blurb and I had to say all of the character names and the actress.

1439
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,200
And then when, and I like, I got through that because I like, I have to get through this paragraph.

1440
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,000
This is my entry point to this dumb job I want to do.

1441
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:06,280
And, uh, but then whenever I, it was this, this cul-de-sac where all of the houses were almost the same.

1442
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,360
It was like such a dull-

1443
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,580
You're talking about Wisteria Lane.

1444
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,260
Wisteria Lane.

1445
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,540
Of course, yeah, they still have that on the tour, right?

1446
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,400
Yeah, they still do it.

1447
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,940
I don't know if they, they can't, they can't still be talking about Desperate Housewives.

1448
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,520
Up until a couple, two years ago, they were.

1449
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:18,860
Yeah.

1450
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,520
Like my mom, when I took her, she was like, Ooh, Wisteria Lane.

1451
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,740
I would always bail.

1452
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:29,620
I would focus on another thing that filmed there, which is the music video for Nellie and Kelly Rowland's song Dilemma.

1453
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:37,400
And I would sing over the song, which always, like I've established myself as a stiff white guy by that point.

1454
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,140
So to then sing the Nellie song was always a big hit.

1455
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,120
And I did like doing it.

1456
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,420
And when I'm with my boo, I'm gonna crazy about you.

1457
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:53,720
But, uh, yeah, I, but I, my brain could not retain that Desperate Housewives information.

1458
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,100
The names are two, it was Edie and Laura and I don't know.

1459
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,320
I never watched it.

1460
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,440
Sally and Stephanie.

1461
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,820
God, I just, my brain left my body every time I did the thing.

1462
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:05,480
Yeah, yeah.

1463
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,260
Nobody wouldn't know.

1464
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,100
What are women called?

1465
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,220
Carol, Rebecca, Erica.

1466
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,820
There's always a Megan.

1467
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:11,940
There's always a Megan.

1468
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,020
Megan's a backstabber.

1469
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,760
Watch out for Megan.

1470
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,280
Anyway, Wisteria Lane.

1471
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,460
Yeah, so Universal.

1472
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,240
Why no Wisteria Lane at Islands of Adventure?

1473
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,420
There should be a whole land.

1474
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,380
Yeah, but just put it on a truck.

1475
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,480
Put it on a flatbed.

1476
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,680
Drive it out there.

1477
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,100
It's a crowd pleaser.

1478
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,280
And then stop at malls along the way.

1479
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,520
The Wisteria Lane tour.

1480
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,980
They could, like Wisteria Lane would have been good to move to the

1481
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,080
former backlot at Hollywood Studios.

1482
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,320
Like they had the Golden Girls house at Hollywood Studios.

1483
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,060
I never had to ride that when it was open, but it was rough, right?

1484
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,560
Like they didn't have anything.

1485
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:48,680
They made up like basically like those, whatever you call those, not their

1486
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,360
not real houses, facades or whatever.

1487
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:51,860
False fronts and sides.

1488
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,140
I think they had the Golden Girls house, it was the real one, right?

1489
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,700
But then the rest was like a fake recording studio.

1490
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,220
They're like, we could record things in here.

1491
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,280
But it's just like one that you would record things in.

1492
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:03,600
Right.

1493
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,100
They did it.

1494
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,460
I think they did, both Universal and Disney made an effort to have actual

1495
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:13,300
stuff produced, mainly the kids shows and then see Disney and then all the

1496
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,640
Nickelodeon stuff at Universal Florida.

1497
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,060
I feel like there was a window from 89 to 95.

1498
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,180
I wish I had gotten to see the Nick Studios there, but by the time I went

1499
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,520
for the first time it was gone.

1500
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,620
Counts flew down.

1501
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,220
I never got to go.

1502
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:24,940
I did it.

1503
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,440
I didn't see anything that cool.

1504
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,320
I think I talked before, they had the couch from SNCC behind a glass with

1505
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:38,320
dramatic lighting and like on the tour, like behind a glass wall and stuff.

1506
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:42,860
The, uh, I think I, I think I was there when like all that was being explained.

1507
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:43,720
It wasn't on yet.

1508
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,760
And it was like, and this stage is being used for kids SNL called all that.

1509
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:53,320
Um, with the man who, uh, who will never not be on SNL, Kenan Thompson.

1510
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,900
15 seasons going strong.

1511
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,280
I saw Kenan Thompson's office when I went to his child office.

1512
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,280
Yeah, I guess so.

1513
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,400
It's full of like blocks and stuff.

1514
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,160
And yeah, just candy bar shelves.

1515
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,020
It was raised at Nickelodeon.

1516
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,960
Or was he into weed already?

1517
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,120
Was he a weed guy?

1518
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,240
At 14?

1519
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,620
Um, maybe.

1520
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,780
Um, the craziest tour, the really barren tour, um, is the one in, in.

1521
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,220
Paris, which I never miss an opportunity to.

1522
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:30,160
There is a, yeah, there's a studios there and with a tram tour and that one for

1523
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,540
sure nothing has ever been filmed.

1524
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,300
Yeah, that is the least tram credibility of all of them.

1525
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,420
But it's like a fake Hollywood.

1526
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,480
You're like, it's like, I'm on a movie set.

1527
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,000
It's a recreation of a place that recreates things.

1528
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,440
It's like, I'm on a real fake New York street.

1529
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,300
Just like in the pictures.

1530
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,080
This is what an unfinished building would look like.

1531
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,380
Le film tech, le film de tech.

1532
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,020
We're like, oh movie theaters.

1533
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:53,760
Sure.

1534
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,820
Le cinema tech.

1535
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,380
It's like a Borat voice.

1536
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,420
That's like France.

1537
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:13,540
Uh, that park has a, that has all of the sets from a, uh, a 2002 Christian

1538
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,120
Bale movie called the rain of fire.

1539
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,540
I don't even remember that is, that is all that they just like, they took like

1540
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,820
four statues from rain of fire.

1541
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,140
How much do you think they spent on that?

1542
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,580
$30,000.

1543
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,280
I think so.

1544
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:24,560
Yeah.

1545
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,220
On the film or on the moving the stuff?

1546
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,340
Just on the stuff they acquired.

1547
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000


1548
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,040
$30,000, but you got to move it yourself.

1549
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,380
We can do that.

1550
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,340
We got Disney money.

1551
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,900
They got, they got French, like, uh, field laborers to come and like,

1552
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,080
usually pick grapes out in the French fields.

1553
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,240
I mean, that movie, that movie they were thinking or hoping was going to be a huge

1554
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,060
hit the summer that came out and they should have waited shit immediately.

1555
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,940
They should have waited to see how it did.

1556
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,260
Yeah.

1557
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,280
Before they got everything.

1558
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:53,860
They really should have.

1559
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,160
To see if people were interested in the tale of Quinn Abercrombie.

1560
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:58,940
Oh my God.

1561
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,100
Boy.

1562
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,820
Is that an action star?

1563
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,260
Um, no, that's the character.

1564
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,780
Another character is Denton Van Zand.

1565
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,460
Oh my God.

1566
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,220
Played by Matthew McConaughey.

1567
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:11,220
Ooh.

1568
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,180
Um, maybe it's like you fed AI, like computer, come up with action

1569
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,000
movie characters, please computer.

1570
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,120
It's sci-fi though.

1571
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,660
So you might want to throw a Z or two into those names.

1572
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,040
Yeah.

1573
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,200
That weirds it up.

1574
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,280
We're going to sell this in Paris.

1575
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,800
Oh, and it takes place in England.

1576
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,820
So England it up a bit.

1577
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,180
Make them a little British.

1578
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:29,780
Yeah.

1579
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,660
It should have been a success by all rights.

1580
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,740
By all the, according to the algorithm, the computer should have had this one

1581
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:38,540
right, but they didn't.

1582
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,840
We really thought we nailed it.

1583
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:45,040
Um, but anyway, so, and also no rain of fire, uh, uh, island at Islands of Adventure.

1584
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:45,580
Oh yeah.

1585
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,200
They missed a lot of properties, but they did get Seuss landing.

1586
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:49,460
Um, so.

1587
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,560
That weird Popeye land with all those horrible water rides.

1588
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,700
Well, that's it's it's wild.

1589
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,100
I mean, that did you ride the Dudley do right.

1590
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:58,560
Right.

1591
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:58,860


1592
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,500
I've a million times.

1593
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,120
It's my life.

1594
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:01,920
Oh yeah.

1595
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,000
You get a whole thing on it.

1596
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,940
Jason wants it preserved as it is forever.

1597
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:05,640
Yes.

1598
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:06,820
He loves it.

1599
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:10,300
I mean, that, that part, I mean, the park is fascinated.

1600
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,960
Like the story of Islands of Adventure is like, you know, they always plan to have

1601
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,600
a second park and you know, there was a court.

1602
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,860
I mean, we could probably do a whole episode on the unbuilt, like Warner

1603
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:25,140
brother, a universal cartoon world that was going to be like Looney tunes rides

1604
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:30,700
and a Gotham, like Batman rides and a Superman ride, and that just didn't happen.

1605
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,600
So they're like, all right, well, what can we, all right, we were going to do

1606
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:38,300
Jurassic park anyway, uh, myth characters, their public domain.

1607
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:38,600
Okay.

1608
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,080
That takes care of lost continent.

1609
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:40,640
Looks nice.

1610
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:45,220
Uh, Marvel was dealing with bankruptcy at the time, so they were just signing

1611
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,280
in anything and that has come back to haunt Disney now.

1612
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,880
Um, it's a bad land.

1613
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,440
Yeah.

1614
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,880
It preserves that character dining.

1615
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,320
Did you guys know that's an option?

1616
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,180
They just started doing character dining.

1617
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,180
With rogue and Cyclops.

1618
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,480
I was like, what's that like face character of Cyclops.

1619
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,940
What would you even say to him?

1620
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,420
Hey, I have a lot of things to say to Cyclops.

1621
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,980
We both have pictures with Cyclops.

1622
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:09,460
Yes.

1623
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,440
I have multiple photos with Cyclops.

1624
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:17,520
Uh, he, yeah, I feel like I would do the real dickish thing of being like, so, uh,

1625
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:21,460
like, like I would start to like, be like, how about that whole onslaught conflict?

1626
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:21,740
Huh?

1627
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:25,720
You remember that in the nineties when professor X and Magneto's brains merged

1628
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,860
and created an evil being known as onslaught.

1629
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,720
And like, I'd see if I could get him and then he'd be like, come on, man.

1630
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,040
Do you think they have a training thing where they have to know the canon?

1631
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,800
Cause I know Disney is very on it.

1632
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:40,460
Like they quiz their face characters on movie details and stuff, but they do.

1633
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:43,360
It's part of like the callback audition as they like, they tell you what

1634
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,740
character you're being considered for.

1635
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,360
They tell you to go home and watch the movie a bunch of times.

1636
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,180
And then when you come back, they might be like, you know, it's basic stuff,

1637
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,580
but if you're Ariel, you should at least know the names of all of her

1638
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,820
friends and her, her kingdom and her dad.

1639
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:59,080
Is it for just the princesses or like the princes or whoever has a face?

1640
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,320
Like is does Mickey F to whoever's playing Mickey have to know, like,

1641
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,360
no, those are more like miming base.

1642
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:04,640
Right.

1643
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:08,480
But like, say improv, but like Star Lord would have to know.

1644
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:08,620
Yeah.

1645
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,060
Anyone who speaks, they're called face characters if they speak in or, or in

1646
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,460
like a mask or, or uncovered face.

1647
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,840
But if they're in a full character head, it's a fur character.

1648
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:21,820
So with those, it's more physicality and it is though, like it is goofy physicality.

1649
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,300
They'll be like, move like you're goofy and you have to have it down to move

1650
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,240
the way goofy consistently moves.

1651
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:31,680
But you can't just like, it's not an arbitrary flailing around.

1652
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,940
Yeah, no, they all have their own mannerisms they're supposed to have.

1653
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,060
Let me ask you this question.

1654
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,840
Why every time I take a photo with Minnie Mouse, is she so aggressive with me?

1655
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,160
Is she flirtatious?

1656
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,160
She's flirtatious.

1657
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,680
She kisses me and makes the noise from inside.

1658
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,820
This is, this is in Florida.

1659
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,580
That popping noise where they kiss you.

1660
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,500
I don't know how they do that.

1661
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,360
Her nose hits me in the side of the face.

1662
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,180
Uh, and then she'd like really kind of like gets right on my arm.

1663
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,180
Like what is going on?

1664
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,780
I'm saying she's like a like me?

1665
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,520
Minnie is a flirtatious lady.

1666
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,060
She's but in like a coy way.

1667
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,440
I feel like Daisy's more like out to get a man, but Minnie is like, she's just

1668
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:04,960
playful.

1669
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:05,720
She's okay.

1670
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,320
She likes to flatter her guests.

1671
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:07,920
I see.

1672
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:11,880
So on the other hand, like whenever I meet Chewbacca, he like manhandles me a lot.

1673
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,280
I don't like meeting Chewbacca.

1674
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,560
He hugs too hard.

1675
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:20,680
He'll usually try to like playfully take my stuff and I'll be like, Hey, my stuff.

1676
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,300
I don't know.

1677
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,980
I just don't like Chewbacca that much.

1678
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,520
My wife was legit scared of you were there for that.

1679
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:26,600
She was so freaked.

1680
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,160
Of which one?

1681
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:27,500
Kylo Ren?

1682
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,300
Of Chewbacca.

1683
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:28,800
Oh yeah.

1684
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,340
Just him coming around the corner and that he is Chewbacca of size.

1685
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,180
He's got those human eyes.

1686
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:32,680
You know?

1687
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,880
I don't like that.

1688
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,520
Did you end up?

1689
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,560
So in Seuss Landing, uh, uh, did you find characters?

1690
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,860
Did you find fur characters?

1691
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,280
Cause the Lorax walks around.

1692
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,060
I'd love to meet the Lorax.

1693
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:45,940
We met the Lorax.

1694
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:46,920
We had photos with Lorax.

1695
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:51,040
We thought that Grinch was going to be coming out at a certain point, but we didn't like linger to wait for it to happen.

1696
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,960
Cause they said it was like a little story time.

1697
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,900
And then at the end you can get pictures and we were like, we're not going to wait here an hour to meet the Grinch.

1698
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,000
Cause for all I know, it was Jim Carrey Grinch, like a Grinch-mas out here.

1699
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,380
I was like, I don't want to meet that guy.

1700
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,700
It's fascinating to me.

1701
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:10,740
So that is a thing about Seuss Landing and the Fast Eight, because I think the, uh, Jim Carrey Grinch looks like a damn nightmare.

1702
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,300
He's scary.

1703
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,360
Is he the one at Seuss Landing or is it a suit?

1704
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,540
I think at Grinch-mas it's him.

1705
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,480
And I think the rest of the year it's like the, uh, the drawn sort of like.

1706
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,940
He looks like a, he looks like a hobo.

1707
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,060
The plush Grinch.

1708
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,860
I think they might finally phase out Carrey Grinch as a face character.

1709
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,780
I think you're right on that.

1710
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,560
Rest in pieces Carrey Grinch.

1711
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,300
So I love I'm with you on Throw and Shade on Carrey Grinch.

1712
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,300
I think it's so weird.

1713
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,840
It almost 20 years after the fact.

1714
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,760
I don't need the movie when he's a scary looking man.

1715
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,080
I don't need to meet any children.

1716
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,820
It is, it is more perplexing.

1717
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:47,160
Like I get why Waterworld like bombed as a movie, a hit as a stunt show.

1718
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,640
Perfect in 20 minutes.

1719
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:49,680
Yeah.

1720
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:54,220
Uh, the Carrey Grinch, like I think it did fine as a movie, but like.

1721
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,540
Well some people it's like their childhood.

1722
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:56,400
I guess so.

1723
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,360
The Christmas movie they always watched.

1724
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,740
Um, I never really got that.

1725
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,980
My mom also thought he was scary looking, so we never had the DVD

1726
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,880
bought for us or anything like that.

1727
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,980
But some kids it's like quintessential Christmas entertainment.

1728
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,060
You know what's really unacceptable is the child Grinch.

1729
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,580
When was the last time you looked at the child Grinch?

1730
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,020
The scary animatronic thing.

1731
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,060
Oh, and it was a real kid.

1732
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,920
Baby animatronic and then a real child.

1733
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:23,800
Was there a baby, like a fully fake, like robotic baby?

1734
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,240
Yeah, but the nanny's fine.

1735
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,000
That's a popular meme is baby Grinch.

1736
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,720
Oh yeah, there it is.

1737
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,900
They do have like eight year old Grinch that's like a kid in makeup.

1738
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,440
Oh God.

1739
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,200
Yeah, it's pretty rough.

1740
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,920
It reminds me of the baby from Dinosaur, which is a show that I

1741
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,920
hate for looking scary.

1742
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,540
But we love the baby from Dinosaur.

1743
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,000
So we will.

1744
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:41,580
I hate Dinosaur.

1745
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,440
I don't.

1746
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,360
I don't know if I like Dinosaur.

1747
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,160
Yeah, you don't like dinosaurs?

1748
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,320
I'm not sure if I do.

1749
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:50,080
I think I find them a little unpleasant and legit scary at times.

1750
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,140
Well in the episodes we're very dark.

1751
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,180
Jesus Christ.

1752
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,500
So I'm showing another photo of baby Grinch.

1753
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,660
This is the most upset.

1754
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,540
I've been in the moment on the show is looking at this goddamn baby Grinch.

1755
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,520
I like baby Grinch.

1756
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,100
Why in the world?

1757
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,940
This is like something bug mane would think.

1758
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,700
You like this guy?

1759
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,840
I kind of like baby Grinch.

1760
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,760
Do you think they thought they were going to sell a lot of toys and that?

1761
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:12,780
Yes.

1762
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:13,260
Yes.

1763
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:13,600
Yes.

1764
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,300
Well, there are so many creepy.

1765
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:16,720
Look at him.

1766
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,400
Look at little baby.

1767
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,380
Look at this.

1768
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,840
Yeah, it was slightly older.

1769
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:21,820
That's when he's.

1770
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,040
Um, what was it?

1771
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,300
Is that a child or a small person?

1772
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,060
No, it's a kid.

1773
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:26,840


1774
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:27,220
Yeah.

1775
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:30,380
It's kind of sad to think of some kid having to sit still for that long to look

1776
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,160
that horrible.

1777
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,020
Yeah.

1778
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:32,480
Geez.

1779
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,400
Ta-da.

1780
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,840
That's a poor little six year old.

1781
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:39,660
Jim Carrey didn't bring his old pal Simon Birch into the project.

1782
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,820
Just in case people have not seen the teaser, there is like an illumination.

1783
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,080
Uh, the people who made the minions movies are making a, how the Grinch stole

1784
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:54,580
Christmas, like CGI animated movie, um, with voice by Benedict Cumberbatch.

1785
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:55,100
Right.

1786
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:55,360
Yeah.

1787
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,400
It's a good choice for the voice.

1788
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,160
The movie looks lame, but I think that's good casting at least.

1789
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:03,140
I think it's good casting and the room though, the rumor about this part of the

1790
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:09,000
park, cause this, this, uh, uh, island and islands of adventure has not had a lot of

1791
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,960
updates since it opened in 1999.

1792
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,080
But there's been a rumor for years that there's blueprints somewhere for a Mount

1793
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,180
Crumpet based roller coaster.

1794
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,680
Like you, like you would ride the slide.

1795
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:24,000
Thrill level of like Snow White mine train where like kids can go on it too.

1796
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:24,820
That seems right.

1797
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:25,220
Yeah.

1798
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:25,600
I think.

1799
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:25,980
Yeah.

1800
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:31,100
And, and so like dark, right elements when you go inside, the dog and his little

1801
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,640
contraptions and stuff, couple minimal little scenes.

1802
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,780
Yeah, that sounds great.

1803
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:41,140
Uh, that would be super for, there is room behind it, uh, behind like the island, the

1804
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,980
land to, to build that.

1805
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:47,380
And it was, it's supposedly like gotten close to happening in the past and then

1806
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,740
the money has never shown up.

1807
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,600
I feel like it'll happen.

1808
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,820
It may, but it's gotta be like a minions level hit.

1809
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:54,280
Right.

1810
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,840
This bar might be pretty high.

1811
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,740
It seems unclear to me if secret life of pets is happening.

1812
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,460
That's been a rumor for a long time.

1813
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,520
I don't know how well that, Oh, are they going to do a ride?

1814
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:04,100


1815
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,880
How did that room do financially?

1816
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:07,040
I didn't see that one.

1817
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,160
Well, it did well.

1818
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,820
I think there's a secret plan.

1819
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,240
By the way, have you guys seen the parade in universal Florida?

1820
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,700
I have seen video of it.

1821
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,360
It's the saddest parade I've ever seen.

1822
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:21,360
Like honestly, and they have people come out on bicycles and you're like, what's

1823
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:21,720
that?

1824
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,880
They're New Yorkers.

1825
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,960
They're there for secret life of pets.

1826
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,680
I mean, some of the floats, like the secret life of pets, they did have a clever

1827
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,500
float and it had like little puppets of all the little animals.

1828
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,040
But that's what I thought.

1829
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,860
I think I thought that the puppets are pretty well done.

1830
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:41,120
That sounds very lame that there's just like bike, uh, a deliverer people running

1831
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:41,400
around.

1832
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,340
Well, the energy was so low and sad on the ground dancers.

1833
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,360
It was people kind of lethargically clapping.

1834
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,280
It was really hot.

1835
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,520
The floats were pretty cute, but there were only like four of them.

1836
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,300
And then all the ground dancers in between appeared to not have choreography.

1837
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,560
It wasn't like a Disney parade.

1838
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,200
They were just kind of wearing brightly colored shirts.

1839
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,680
They weren't really costumes and they're just awkwardly clapping.

1840
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:06,980
I will tell you, I think one of the reasons why that, uh, parade, it looks a

1841
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,880
little cheap because there's also, I was down there last summer.

1842
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:17,620
There's like a mini despicable me parade where it's with like a massive float, a

1843
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,320
massive float.

1844
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:19,200
They did have a float in it.

1845
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,660
Did they just stick it in a slightly larger parade?

1846
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,800
And that was the idea.

1847
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,480
Maybe that I just saw it like come like out of nowhere, came from the backstage

1848
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:32,380
area, like tons of dancers and minions and the girls and grew.

1849
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,700
And, and then they did a number.

1850
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,820
It was like a dance party and then they like three floats and they're like, no,

1851
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:39,680
it's a parade.

1852
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,300
I don't quite know what it was.

1853
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,920
Cause it just came out, it happened and then it backed up and went backstage.

1854
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:45,840
Okay.

1855
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,540
So it's like, I mean, Disney world has one like that too.

1856
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,240
That's like the dance party parade and they just kind of roll out, linger and

1857
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,360
then roll back in.

1858
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,840
Well, there was also a flash mob that happened when I was there.

1859
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,800
A, you know, like just people in street clothes, like hanging around, like they

1860
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,740
were guests and then they all stared at doing a choreographed dance and then they

1861
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,380
dispersed and went away with no explanation.

1862
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,860
And did they do that multiple times or was it like a film it and put it online

1863
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,380
thing?

1864
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,660
I only saw it.

1865
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,660
I think it happens a few times a day.

1866
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,420
But it wasn't really explained.

1867
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:16,800
Yeah.

1868
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,520
I mean, I guess that's cheaper than a parade and also more unique because then

1869
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,840
people feel like they've seen a flash mob in real life, but you also don't have to

1870
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,220
build floats and it's like the same number of dancers.

1871
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:28,360
So it's kind of a clever idea.

1872
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,180
Kind of remind you, it was like a different version of like the citizens of

1873
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:32,560
Hollywood.

1874
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,880
Is that what they call them at MGM?

1875
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,600
The people who wander around MGM.

1876
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:36,100
Oh, right.

1877
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:36,820
Was that what they're called?

1878
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:42,620
Like the citizens of Buena Vista street similar.

1879
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,140
This was just like an average.

1880
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:47,580
This is like a different take on that where it's like a little thing happens and

1881
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:48,280
then they wander off.

1882
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:48,880
That's a cool idea.

1883
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:53,440
Um, for, for Sue Slaney, like they have, yeah, some of those walk around characters.

1884
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:57,440
I was just going to quickly say like Disney is such a better job of like all the

1885
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,600
characters are in one universe.

1886
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,140
It's like, it makes total sense.

1887
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,780
But then all of a sudden, like in universal, it's like, well, there's Vin

1888
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,240
Diesel and there's the Lorax.

1889
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,560
And you're like, wait a minute that they don't exist in the same space.

1890
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,460
There's only friends.

1891
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,260
I think there's a Curious George float.

1892
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,420
Oh, that makes sense.

1893
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,760
It's a Dora the Explorer float.

1894
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,940
And it shows on there too.

1895
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:20,320
Stuff you don't know they own until it shows up in one of the four parade units.

1896
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:25,440
So the Seuss Landing done pretty well, like kind of its own little island.

1897
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:31,740
Like the estate was very much like, uh, the big thing I know is that, uh, they are

1898
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,560
not allowed to do anything near Seuss Landing for Halloween horror nights.

1899
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:36,380
Can't.

1900
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,220
That's a good idea.

1901
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,340
So like that's like off limits.

1902
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,440
They were allowed to.

1903
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,320
It would be, it would be kind of awesome to like,

1904
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:46,100
But I can get why Seuss's Widow wouldn't be down for that.

1905
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:52,740
They do though in, uh, in Hollywood, like in the Terror Tram, there's like a little

1906
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,820
bit of the grid, the actual Grinch set left.

1907
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,600
Yeah, but the Grinch set's already a nightmare.

1908
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1909
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:58,660
It's like dilapidated.

1910
01:15:58,940 --> 01:15:59,700
It's falling apart.

1911
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,360
Yeah, it's all faded by the sun and stuff.

1912
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:01,720
Yeah.

1913
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,460
That's a very sad little zone.

1914
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,520
And also a point.

1915
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,420
And, and that came right after I did my Wisteria Lane thing.

1916
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:10,860
That was like my, that was always kind of my.

1917
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,940
Some bleached remains of Whoville.

1918
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:13,500
Yeah.

1919
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:13,980
Yeah.

1920
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:14,380
Yeah.

1921
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:18,300
Uh, uh, that was, that was where I always checked out in the tour.

1922
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,760
That's like 50 minutes in I'm getting ready to go to the bathroom.

1923
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:22,240
Yeah.

1924
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:22,560
Yeah.

1925
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,960
Uh, the Seuss Landing is very, uh, short.

1926
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,860
Not a lot of tall things.

1927
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,800
I feel like, and maybe this is my perception of it.

1928
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,420
Truffula trees and the moose juice, goose juice.

1929
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,600
Yeah, but they're not like, there's a little ride that goes up in the top.

1930
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,060
What is that ride called?

1931
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:36,700
Have you read it?

1932
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,180
I have.

1933
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:37,800
It scared the shit.

1934
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,860
Scared the shit out of me.

1935
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,940
Cause the Seuss trolley train ride.

1936
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:42,540
There you go.

1937
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:44,200
Well, here's, here's what scares me now.

1938
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,260
And, uh, if you listen to the podcast, you know, maybe there's a lot of things

1939
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:47,740
that scare me.

1940
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,960
Um, but what scares me is slow moving rides that are elevated.

1941
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,660
So goofy sky school scares me.

1942
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,820
I can go on roller coasters.

1943
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,700
It's kind of slow though.

1944
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,060
Like when it's slow and if it rounds a bend, I feel like I'm going to fall out

1945
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,380
of the cart and it's the similar.

1946
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,540
You're supposed to feel that way.

1947
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,420
And I hate it.

1948
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,380
It scares me.

1949
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,060
Have you guys been on goofy sky school?

1950
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,180
I've been on goofy sky school.

1951
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:12,520
I've also written the high in the sky Seuss trolley train ride, which is the

1952
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,860
full, full official name.

1953
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,100
It features the sneezes.

1954
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,220
There's some sweaters being made inside.

1955
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:17,620
Yeah.

1956
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,160
It goes through the restaurant.

1957
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,700
It goes through a circus McGurkis cafe stupendous.

1958
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:28,940
Uh, so this, this ride holds a special place for me because, uh, for years, uh,

1959
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,860
I'm a big islands of adventure fan.

1960
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:35,580
And for years, like this ride was supposed to be open, like with the park or like

1961
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,420
shortly thereafter and it functions kind of like a people mover.

1962
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,940
I was going to say it's like they're people movers.

1963
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,160
Yeah.

1964
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,620
Is the track sitting empty all of the people mover?

1965
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:44,940
Well, that's the thing.

1966
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:51,560
There was a single car with like a, a statue of like a Seuss looking guy who

1967
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,020
would come out every now and then.

1968
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,340
So it would come out every now and then.

1969
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:01,580
And like when I was like 12 or 13, I would be like, where do I get on that thing?

1970
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,200
Because it also like, it does have cool views.

1971
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,520
You see cool views of the rest of the park and you go around.

1972
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,940
My eyes were closed for most of it.

1973
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:11,800
Mics weren't closed, but, um, watch a video.

1974
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,620
I'll be honest.

1975
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,380
You were high in the sky.

1976
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:14,800
You were too high up.

1977
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:15,640
I didn't like it.

1978
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,900
He was too high in the sky.

1979
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,360
I did always think they should do that with the people mover.

1980
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,120
Cause I understand it's not safe anymore to put humans on, but I always thought

1981
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,000
they should just build a small little automated robot that looks like a trash

1982
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,340
can guy that comes out and just wheels around.

1983
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,940
Wait, all the old characters do a pass.

1984
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,440
You get a Rex up there.

1985
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,780
You get ID and OD put Rex on wheels.

1986
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,060
Oh my God.

1987
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:38,680
That'd be great.

1988
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,440
Like a daily robot parade.

1989
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,360
OSHA anymore.

1990
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,880
So they're literally not allowed to have people up there without

1991
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,060
fall protection anymore.

1992
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,460
And the foundations were kind of wrecked by the rocket rods.

1993
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,520
So like they would have to basically rebuild the entire thing.

1994
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,200
Cause it has cracks and it's falling apart and stuff.

1995
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:01,040
It's not supposed to be walked upon by humans in its current state.

1996
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:01,480
Okay.

1997
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,540
But they could put some little robots and then they could just call them back to the

1998
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,720
maintenance bay or come and retrieve them if they stopped, you know, after

1999
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,820
hours, go up there with a cherry picker and pull the bot down.

2000
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:12,380
Sure.

2001
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,760
It wouldn't be a safety concern at that point.

2002
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,200
Couldn't we introduce more robots and characters like in Florida's Tomorrow

2003
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,360
Land, like let's have Sunny Eclipse's brother.

2004
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,680
I know, but let's get like Sunny Eclipse's brother or some other sister.

2005
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,000
Give them a physical form.

2006
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,600
This was my favorite.

2007
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,040
I should contextualize that.

2008
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,960
I watched that video.

2009
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,160
Oh, that's a good idea.

2010
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:32,960
That's a good tie together.

2011
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,160
I think they should join the band.

2012
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:34,960
Oh yeah.

2013
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,620
Skippy a little guitar that's made for multiple arms.

2014
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:38,120
Yeah.

2015
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,380
And then he can be burnt Skippy if he like, do the guitar wrong.

2016
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,180
And now a different, um, they re-skinned that.

2017
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,700
So now it's like the orange alien from Lilo and Stitch.

2018
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,960
It's still in the Stitch encounter.

2019
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,860
So it's the skeleton of burnt Skippy, but they, so they already have a different

2020
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,160
character.

2021
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,140
Put them all up there.

2022
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,440
Yeah.

2023
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,360
Skippy, orange alien, sir.

2024
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,420
They can all just be members of the band.

2025
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:59,460
That's a wonderful idea.

2026
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,020
This idea, any of these robot jams, these are so wonderful.

2027
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,580
I want to contextualize that too, that I watched that video that you did where you

2028
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:10,820
talked about Sunny Eclipse, who was the lounge singer in the Tomorrowland

2029
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,300
like hamburger restaurant.

2030
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,880
And that, that was this, I didn't, that was new facts to me that you said in the

2031
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,040
video that his backing vocals cannot be seen.

2032
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,500
They're the space angels.

2033
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,120
They're invisible.

2034
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:27,960
He was singing a gig and suddenly from nowhere he heard voices backing him up.

2035
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,500
He has a song explaining this.

2036
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:29,960
He explains that plot in the song.

2037
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,260
He explains it through song.

2038
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,040
He's like, there it was at the gig and then out of the blue space angels.

2039
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,720
And they're singing along and he's like, you're invisible, but you sing along to my

2040
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:39,220
songs.

2041
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:42,580
Like he just informs you of this through song and you're kind of like, I get it.

2042
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:45,480
What a massive premise to contain in this.

2043
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,420
Scott, he only has 25 minutes of show.

2044
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,920
He's telling you who you learn in his hometown and what it's like.

2045
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:49,320
Really?

2046
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:49,620
Yeah.

2047
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,100
He's from New York or U-Norc.

2048
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,880
The whole song is a tongue twister.

2049
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,480
He's from-

2050
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,060
Scott, how did you not know this you fucking idiot?

2051
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:00,980
And the whole song, I don't know how this man performed the song because the whole

2052
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,540
song is like phrases like that where he says like,

2053
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:07,500
taxi tabs and stuff like that where you're just like, oh my God, then what a-

2054
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,220
It's all pig Latin nonsense.

2055
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:09,940
Yeah.

2056
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:10,240
It's all swapped around.

2057
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,240
They just hired an actual dyslexic singer.

2058
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,060
There you go.

2059
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,240
Well, I did hear this fun fact.

2060
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,820
The man who provided the voice of Sunny Eclipse has never seen him perform.

2061
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,580
He's never seen the alien animatronic with his voice, which makes me very sad.

2062
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,040
Who did the voice?

2063
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:23,580
I don't know.

2064
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:28,180
It's just some paid like session singer that sounds like a Frank Sinatra type.

2065
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:34,980
Well, the guy who did the music for Marvel superhero island has never been down there to see it.

2066
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:36,420
Well, I just don't know how you'd resist.

2067
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:37,660


2068
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,080
You mean the guy who did-

2069
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,900
Yeah, who did all the late nineties rock music.

2070
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,660
Well, the only one I understand is that Ellen never wrote energy adventure.

2071
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:52,020
And I get that because it was also filmed footage of her when she was in like an awkward nineties phase.

2072
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:58,200
So I could imagine feeling self-conscious, seeing like a 10 foot high projection of yourself 10 years ago.

2073
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,580
Well, that's also hard to shut.

2074
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:03,700
They shut down a hundred person capacity ride.

2075
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,380
I think that, yeah, there was some room on the ride to get her on there.

2076
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,580
I don't know that that was-

2077
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,080
Sneak her in in the dark, sneak her out.

2078
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,280
Have her hop on in the dinosaur zone.

2079
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:15,620
Real quick.

2080
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,400
I have more about the high in the sky Sue Stralley train ride.

2081
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:18,800
Oh, please.

2082
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,280
Okay, good.

2083
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,320
Okay.

2084
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,280
So when I finally did get to ride it, I did enjoy it.

2085
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,240
I was interested.

2086
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:30,820
So when it was supposed to open, that was supposed to be Sylvester McMonkey McBean's unusual driving machines.

2087
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,160
I don't even know that book.

2088
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,760
So I'm glad they didn't go with that.

2089
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:35,860
You did not read that book or you-

2090
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:36,760
I've never read that book.

2091
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,120
Yeah, I don't think I read that one either.

2092
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,700
High in the sky from anything in particular, is that just, that's a general Sue thing.

2093
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,320
I think it was a general Sue thing.

2094
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:48,100
And I think it was another thing done in by like budgetary stuff.

2095
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:53,140
Like they, they just, they couldn't get the money to do this little train thing.

2096
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:57,560
And then I think it was also like, there was weird technical issues with it.

2097
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:01,980
I believe I heard once, which you think like, how do you mess up a little train ride?

2098
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:05,940
I don't get what technical issues that would have that the new incarnation doesn't have.

2099
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:06,840
Yeah, exactly.

2100
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:07,860
How was it different?

2101
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,420
I have no idea.

2102
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,360
Do you think it was more ambitious?

2103
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,960
Like it's a train, but you got a spinner wheel and you can spin around.

2104
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:21,480
I think a lot of this part of the story of a lot of this park was we had a lot more ambitious ideas, but we were on a budget and time crunch.

2105
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:28,620
Then the last thing I will say, I found this on the Seuss Wikia, the entry for this ride.

2106
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:32,380
There was one comment from a user named PyroGothNerd.

2107
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:32,960
Okay.

2108
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:37,080
This is a very, this is a very child oriented ride.

2109
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,700
And by child, I mean toddler.

2110
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,680
It's pretty boring actually.

2111
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,700
He's like, I found myself pretty disappointed.

2112
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,040
Yeah.

2113
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,660
A high in the sky train ride.

2114
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:45,420
What is his name?

2115
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,680
PyroGothNerd.

2116
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:47,260
Oh, okay.

2117
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,000
Why did he think this was a ride for him?

2118
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:49,940
Yeah, exactly.

2119
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,160
Like this is a whole land for little children.

2120
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:53,520
I'm gonna love that one.

2121
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,160
Yeah.

2122
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,800
I found the Seuss ride skewed a little young for my taste.

2123
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,720
This whole land appeals only to children and I don't understand it.

2124
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,040
It's famous.

2125
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,080
Where is PyroGothNerd?

2126
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:13,000
Where is, are the attractions based on Seuss's political cartoons, 90% of which are horribly racist.

2127
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:13,900
Oh God.

2128
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:14,800
Wow.

2129
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,360
Is that true?

2130
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,720
Uh, it was not the biggest fan of the Japanese.

2131
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:20,960
Dr. Seuss.

2132
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:21,520
Geez.

2133
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,360
Was that wartime?

2134
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:23,660
During the middle of the war.

2135
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:28,460
So I believe he recanted that.

2136
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,180
Oh, okay.

2137
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,080
One of the books is a,

2138
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:31,920
I'm sorry?

2139
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,740
One of the books is essentially a metaphor.

2140
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:38,780
Well the speeches are anti-racism as well.

2141
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:39,520
Yeah.

2142
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,860
I think he, he changed his ways after the war.

2143
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,160
I think he did also have an arms race one.

2144
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:46,920
Was it about pie throwing or something?

2145
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:47,780
Yeah.

2146
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:56,580
Like he is pretty progressive otherwise, but like, I mean, he was in the services and like he was, you know, for our side.

2147
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,940
Oh, he was in the army?

2148
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,720
Yeah.

2149
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,740
I think he was in the, like the culture.

2150
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,600
Uh, I think he was in the film division, maybe.

2151
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,100
Oh, okay.

2152
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,380
Making film and propaganda and that sort of thing.

2153
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,420
Is the cat in the hat a metaphor for a war?

2154
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,380
Or thing one and thing two?

2155
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,700
Some, uh, yeah.

2156
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,580
So you had never been on the ride before you said?

2157
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,060
Oh, no, I didn't even know it existed until I walked in.

2158
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:24,560
So as soon as I saw the queue, I was like getting really hyped for it.

2159
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,300
And in fairness, it is like a very ambitious dark ride.

2160
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:28,800
Yeah.

2161
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,620
It's got a lot of figures that move a lot.

2162
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,360
It's got some cool effects.

2163
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:33,680
The spinning was clever.

2164
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:37,500
I heard from someone on Twitter that the spinning used to be more aggressive and

2165
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:42,600
that's why the vehicles have nets around them because people's belongings used to

2166
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,960
fly out of the vehicles.

2167
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,120
I remember thinking it was the first ride I went on in islands of adventure.

2168
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:52,500
Uh, I must've gone there in like 2000 and I remember thinking for kind of a kids

2169
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,160
dark ride, this is, this is surprisingly intense.

2170
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:59,840
It was a long ride and yeah, you have a lot of cat figures that move around a lot.

2171
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,760
A good range of motion.

2172
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,980
The little thing one and thing two like run around.

2173
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,680
They simulate walking, which you don't see a lot.

2174
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,600
They kind of like run alongside your car when they're revealed.

2175
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:10,440
It's pretty fun.

2176
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:11,840
With their little legs swinging.

2177
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,720
I compared them to Chucky dolls.

2178
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,220
I thought they were a little scary.

2179
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,720
Um, you can see the thing holding them up.

2180
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:23,080
You can, but does that mean you don't like the rare rabbit that hops around in the

2181
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,080
Florida squash mountain?

2182
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:24,520
No, that's true.

2183
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:25,520
I guess that's true.

2184
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:26,760
I guess that's true.

2185
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:27,540
Yeah, fess up.

2186
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:28,720
A lot of this.

2187
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,360
Look, I agree.

2188
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,220
I think this was an, it is an ambitious ride.

2189
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,960
There's cool stuff in it, but there's, there's stuff where it's like one step

2190
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,040
forward, one step back.

2191
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,240
Like I liked the moments early on in the ride where it's like the narrator is

2192
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:41,760
narrowing stuff.

2193
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:42,860
There's a lighting cue.

2194
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,260
It highlights what he's saying, but then there's some parts that are just empty

2195
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,400
hallways with black lights.

2196
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:53,720
I gotta say that the lighting cues to me were the main factor in its

2197
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,760
nightmarishness.

2198
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,360
Yes.

2199
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,440
You have all these whirling rainbow lights that are like more disorienting and then

2200
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,660
everywhere you look, there's just stuff moving.

2201
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:04,880
They have those scary contraptions with arms moving.

2202
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,420
Um, I thought the fish was a cool effect because they have the little animatronic

2203
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:12,360
fish and then the bowl that he's in is like double pained plastic that's full of

2204
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:12,680
water.

2205
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,060
So it sloshes around like a real fish bowl.

2206
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:15,840
That looks cool.

2207
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,400
Since you brought up the fish, I'll say this.

2208
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:23,500
This is a thing I found on the universal website that made me laugh a lot, uh, from

2209
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,640
the ride page on the website.

2210
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,880
Cautious Mr.

2211
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,180
Crinkle Bean reminds us that any minute mother will be home.

2212
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,460
Is that the fish, Mr.

2213
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,100
Crinkle Bean?

2214
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:32,400
Yes.

2215
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,080
Look this up.

2216
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:34,400
Mr.

2217
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:38,700
Crinkle Bean was, Crinkle Bean was revealed as his last name in the TV

2218
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,160
special, in the TV adaptation.

2219
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,340
In the book he is not named, uh, Crinkle Bean.

2220
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,300
What the TV special was a cartoon in the old, from a while ago.

2221
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:49,640
Yeah.

2222
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,980
Was that the puppet era?

2223
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:54,380
Like when Horton, here's a who had the special that was like puppets.

2224
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,460
Cause I watched those when I was a kid.

2225
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,220
Oh no, those were pretty recent.

2226
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,940
These are the cartoon back in the seventies.

2227
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:03,100
Well, but then they, I think also when they had the puppet series, they would

2228
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:07,000
recycle the seventies cartoons by having them as shorts in between the puppet

2229
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,200
segments.

2230
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:12,520
They definitely would because I mean the shorts like summarize the full books and

2231
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,740
they're, the books are only 10 pages long.

2232
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:17,220
Two puppet stories and a short or something like that.

2233
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:22,120
On the cartoon, did the fish have the voice, uh, somebody clearly imitating

2234
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,700
Edwin because that is what mother and father are home.

2235
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:26,400
Yeah.

2236
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,040
And also there's, yes, that's true.

2237
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:29,480
Well, yeah.

2238
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,880
And then there's not quite in this, this riot a little bit, but I think the Mike

2239
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,380
Myers cat in the hat is a little in that vein too.

2240
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,400
Like we decided all the cat in the hat characters sound like Edwin.

2241
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,640
So they, yeah, they're all, because this one is just mostly the fish, but

2242
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:44,820
oh, the children sound like this as well.

2243
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,860
And then the mom sounds like that too.

2244
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,800
When she comes home.

2245
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:50,060
What's going on?

2246
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,260
Can you imagine watching a whole movie where every character is that?

2247
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,100
What would you do?

2248
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,160
It's almost like a power play at that point.

2249
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,680
It's like, I dare you to say anything about it.

2250
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,160
That's 45 minutes left.

2251
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,420
Do you know the voice of the fish in the ride?

2252
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,460
Who does it?

2253
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:04,860
Yeah.

2254
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:05,980
No, I don't.

2255
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,620
Corey Burton is the person's name.

2256
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:09,240
Corey Burton.

2257
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:09,960
That sounds familiar.

2258
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,800
Corey Burton is a ton of things.

2259
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,480
He's a lot of voices in all animation, but in parks especially.

2260
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,720
And he is the voice of the Mad Hatter in all.

2261
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:24,420
Oh, that makes perfect sense because Edwin was Mad Hatter in the else.

2262
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:24,880
Wonderland.

2263
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:30,160
I somehow, I, this, I copy and pasted this from my documents, uh, my, my

2264
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:34,140
notes document about the Mickey and Friends parking structure and amazingly

2265
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,700
in two and a half hours or whatever.

2266
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,340
I didn't, we didn't talk about Corey Burton.

2267
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,280
The Corey Burton is the voice of the tram.

2268
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,900
He is the, uh, hold on to the hand, right?

2269
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,200
The, uh, please watch your staff.

2270
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,440
I met that guy.

2271
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:45,780
Really?

2272
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,060
It was at Star Wars Celebration.

2273
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:47,800
Whoa.

2274
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:48,220
Hey.

2275
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,300
It was weird.

2276
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:52,380
I like went back to my hotel after we did the, they did the Galactic

2277
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,580
Knights like a press night.

2278
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,000
So we got to go to that.

2279
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,940
Um, and then I went back to the hotel and I wanted a midnight quiche.

2280
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,340
So I, I went to the hotel restaurant.

2281
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:03,820
It's open all hours.

2282
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:07,140
I was like, it's not too late to grab a quiche before I go back to my room.

2283
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:07,440
That's right.

2284
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,120
There is some 24 hour restaurant.

2285
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,300
It's like a little diner thing.

2286
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:10,520
Disney World.

2287
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:14,100
Well, no, this is, um, this was back at the con hotel, so I don't

2288
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,500
remember what chain or whatever, but yeah, they had one in the lobby

2289
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:20,240
and you could go and grab, you know, Benedict's or quiches to take to your

2290
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:23,940
room, so I did that every night of the trip, but I went there and there were

2291
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,460
like only a handful of people in there.

2292
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:28,600
And then I was still wearing my Galactic Knights lanyard and the man who was in

2293
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:33,520
line in front of me was like, um, Oh, I did a voice for that fireworks show.

2294
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,160
Like, did you see the fireworks show?

2295
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:39,720
And I was like, I did, but I only really noticed like quotes from the

2296
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,400
star Wars movies and he's like, Oh, and then I said, and of course, like the,

2297
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,420
the main Disneyland announcer guy.

2298
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,500
And he was like, yeah, that's me.

2299
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,600
And I was like, what?

2300
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:50,900
And he's like, yeah, I did the voice for the fireworks show.

2301
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:53,480
And I was like, but that was just the guy that does all the announcements,

2302
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,420
like all the park ones and like the monorail.

2303
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,120
And he's like, yeah, I did all of that.

2304
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,020
Don't you see my child?

2305
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,840
And then he started doing like, he did the monorail spiel for me.

2306
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,160
And then I had him say hello to one of my friends.

2307
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,040
Who's a cast member.

2308
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,540
He was like, hello, Alicia, welcome to Disney world.

2309
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:09,800
It was really cool.

2310
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:12,640
But he was also kind of doing a girl.

2311
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,600
He was pulling a girl by hanging around.

2312
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:17,140
But I was wearing the lanyard.

2313
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,460
It'd be weird if I was just a random human and he's like,

2314
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:20,620
I'm the voice of Disneyland.

2315
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:24,160
I would tell everyone though, I see you're getting quiche.

2316
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,320
What about a Benedict?

2317
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,960
He does the voice waiting for people to notice.

2318
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,340
Go right ahead.

2319
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:32,040
But, um, but it was really cool seeing him do it in person.

2320
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,740
And his wife is the voice of California adventure.

2321
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,460
So she's the lady voice that does all those announcements.

2322
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:38,400
Yeah.

2323
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,200
They're just a nice sounding couple.

2324
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:46,520
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, the opposite of nice, uh, sound.

2325
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,480
Oh man, I was trying to make a segue.

2326
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,660
Jason, you mentioned the live action cat in the hat.

2327
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:56,500
Of course, that movie, uh, the movie that made the guys will estate go, okay,

2328
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,400
no more live action, Dr.

2329
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:59,100
Seuss movies.

2330
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:03,120
I believe that is the story that they're like, no only animated from now on.

2331
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,580
No, never again, because that movie ate shit so much.

2332
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,220
They only know how to make one kind of suit.

2333
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,400
It's like the same as the very similar.

2334
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,760
Why is it like that?

2335
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:13,120
Yeah.

2336
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,140
It was a big news story too.

2337
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,860
According to found an LA times article from like 98 99 that they did universal

2338
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:24,660
paid 5 million for the rights to cat in the hat, which seems low.

2339
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,620
And when it was going to be.

2340
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:27,560
Tim Allen.

2341
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:28,580
Oh wow.

2342
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,820
Thought that it was, and you know why it's Mike Myers.

2343
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,500
I think I know the answer to this, but yeah, you go, the, uh, the, uh, the lawsuit

2344
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,360
because of sprockets because of sprockets.

2345
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:38,800
Yeah.

2346
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,320
So Mike Myers famous sprockets sketch on SNL.

2347
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:42,800
He was going to make a movie and there was a script.

2348
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,040
It's mostly the script was good.

2349
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:46,040
The German TV shows Dieter.

2350
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:46,320
Yeah.

2351
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:46,600
Yeah.

2352
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,120
I remember there was some article saying that he had a black turtleneck on and he

2353
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,860
said, now is the time on sprockets where we dance.

2354
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:53,600
And then he would say like, do you want to touch my monkey?

2355
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,560
Which now that I say it sounds a little lame, but I love this sketch as a child.

2356
01:32:56,860 --> 01:33:02,140
He apparently in preparation for it would do, he did a, uh, an OP opened for John

2357
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:07,240
Brian at the Largo as Dieter and with like a little band and he did the song.

2358
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:08,280
He did the Beatles song.

2359
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,860
I'm happy just to dance with you as I'm half.

2360
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,920
I'm as happy as a little girl.

2361
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:13,840
Oh my God.

2362
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:14,220
Yeah.

2363
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:14,480
Yeah.

2364
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,860
Dieter was doing live shows around that time.

2365
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:17,200
That's crazy.

2366
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,640
Supposedly the script was funny, but then he just like got cold feet and didn't want

2367
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,820
to do it, but then they sued him.

2368
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:22,720
He really did.

2369
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,240
Cause they wanted him because he had a contract.

2370
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,240
So then to get out of the car, like what happened?

2371
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:31,660
So it was with imagine entertainment part of the settlement because it was very

2372
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:35,120
bitter contract was they took him off cat in the hat.

2373
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,200
No, they took him on cat and do cat.

2374
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:41,700
And he was made to do cat in the hat as a punishment essentially forced into these

2375
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:42,400
prosthetics.

2376
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,180
Put on this snout, Mike, that's what you get for pulling out.

2377
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:49,560
I was picturing Tim Allen as the person in question for the whole story.

2378
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:50,320
We didn't know.

2379
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,880
He was that much of a showman.

2380
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,240
You didn't know Tim Allen was on a Saturday night live.

2381
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,120
Well, I was like maybe as a host.

2382
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,300
He used to be big.

2383
01:33:58,580 --> 01:33:59,040
Yeah, that's true.

2384
01:33:59,160 --> 01:33:59,660
He never did.

2385
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,220
Amazingly.

2386
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:06,700
Also a casualty, I think of this cat in the hat movie, the thing they paid $4

2387
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,920
million, the rights for the film rights to Oh, the places you'll go.

2388
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,720
What, how could you make a film of that?

2389
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,300
I don't know.

2390
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,300
They were going to try.

2391
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:18,080
I think, but also how could you make a film of the Lorax and they proved that you

2392
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:18,760
couldn't.

2393
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:19,060
Yeah.

2394
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,700
I honestly though, I feel like that one could have been good.

2395
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,240
If they had like gotten someone good on board.

2396
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:26,340
Is it, is it bad?

2397
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:27,440
I don't think I ever saw it.

2398
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:31,600
I have a distinct memory though of the, the, the one slur craze.

2399
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,940
Uh, well, the what?

2400
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,440
Oh no.

2401
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,560
Like one slur had fan girls.

2402
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:38,420
It was insane.

2403
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,340
Like, and there was no one to ship him with.

2404
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,660
So they would ship him with the good and evil versions of himself.

2405
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:45,040
It was deep.

2406
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,240
Yeah, this is deep.

2407
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:49,980
No, my, my thing is, uh, deep in a different way.

2408
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:53,300
Do you remember the billboards that were all over LA for the Lorax?

2409
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,420
It was just a big orange billboard.

2410
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:56,260
Oh, with just his face.

2411
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:01,000
Uh, every time I saw those, I would think about how in the great Gatsby, there's

2412
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,880
that reoccurring detail of the, yeah, the eyes of TJ Ekelberg that always like, uh,

2413
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:11,060
the book fucking Scott Fitzgerald sat down and was like, I'm going to write a book of

2414
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:14,400
metaphors for English teachers to talk about for years.

2415
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:19,560
Uh, just those eyes and that billboard watching the characters, the eyes of God

2416
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,200
looking down.

2417
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,840
So for like months, I would be the Lorax just following me.

2418
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,900
Just watching me.

2419
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,640
Did you hit someone with your car as well?

2420
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:28,980
When the Lorax was watching?

2421
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,940
Oh, uh, yes.

2422
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:35,940
Uh, my mistress, my mistress was like, oh, this is rough.

2423
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:41,020
And you look in the sky and there's the Lorax billboard and then old English

2424
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,640
teachers just calling me at all hours.

2425
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,920
Like you see, it's a metaphor and the green light is a metaphor.

2426
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,800
You're like the light was green.

2427
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,740
I thought I could go.

2428
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:51,440
It's like, it's a very compacted version of great Gatsby.

2429
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,740
That's the green light.

2430
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,580
It's just a stoplight.

2431
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,900
Jason's just Jason's life.

2432
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,300
Just my life being haunted by Danny Devine.

2433
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,500
I'm the Lorax.

2434
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:00,560
Is he the Lorax?

2435
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,740
He was the Lorax.

2436
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:06,160
They realized that the story of the book was hard to like stretch to movie length.

2437
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:11,480
So they added a framing narrative about a little animated boy voiced by adult man,

2438
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,840
Zac Efron, who just sounds like himself.

2439
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:14,920
He doesn't sound like a child.

2440
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,320
It's just an adult man's voice.

2441
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:21,920
And his love interest played by Taylor Swift and the Taylor Swift girl.

2442
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:22,780
Just voice acting?

2443
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:23,900
She was voice acting.

2444
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:24,880
They didn't even sing.

2445
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:25,580
It wasn't even a musical.

2446
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:28,020
Well, oh, it was kind of a musical, but she didn't sing.

2447
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:31,220
They had like an intro song and an outro song and that was it.

2448
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,260
And the Taylor Swift character is like, gosh, I love trees.

2449
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,500
If only I could see a tree.

2450
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:43,140
And then Zac Efron's like the way I'll date Taylor Swift is I'll find a tree.

2451
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,240
But there are no trees anymore because this is set after the plot of

2452
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:51,820
the Lorax, so I have to go find the Once-ler and find a tree to impress my girlfriend.

2453
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:57,060
And that's, this is very, this is more convoluted than Seussical, where

2454
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,880
they match up all the Dr. Seuss stuff.

2455
01:36:59,040 --> 01:36:59,720
Oh, I hated Seussical.

2456
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,340
My high school performed that.

2457
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:01,660
Yeah.

2458
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:02,820
It's it's rough.

2459
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:03,540
Were you in it?

2460
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:05,040
Oh no, I didn't audition.

2461
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:05,540
Okay.

2462
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,880
I would just have opted out.

2463
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:07,380
Seussical.

2464
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah.

2465
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:08,380
Yeah.

2466
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:08,900
Yeah.

2467
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:13,840
Seussical has the big, the one big song in that is a person is a person.

2468
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:14,820
No matter how small.

2469
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:18,240
Jojo, my best friend at the time was the lead character.

2470
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,840
And it was Jojo.

2471
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,200
They repeat it so much.

2472
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,020
And I remember seeing it when I was in college.

2473
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,500
I was like, is this a pro-life musical?

2474
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,400
And it's not, it's not.

2475
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,960
The musical thinks it is, but the wife is like, no.

2476
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:30,600
No.

2477
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:30,920
Yeah.

2478
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:35,180
That's what, after a minute of Googling and looking at the Seuss

2479
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:39,720
Wikipedia page is like, uh, pro-life groups use that phrase.

2480
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:40,420
Yeah.

2481
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:41,720
The co-opting and then the widow sued.

2482
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:42,180
Yeah.

2483
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:43,620
It's like, please stop doing that.

2484
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:43,840
Yeah.

2485
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:44,620
Please stop it.

2486
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:48,420
She was, I didn't know anything about this Seussical controversy.

2487
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:49,000
Yeah.

2488
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,220
It's a lot of odd darkness.

2489
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:53,560
They did use that phrase on like on billboards or whatever.

2490
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,500
I will just say like, I found Cat in the Hat as a book.

2491
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,240
Very anxiety inducing.

2492
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:01,360
It's not one of the better Seuss books.

2493
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:04,900
It's kind of reminds me of Alice in Wonderland, which I also didn't like as

2494
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:09,160
a kid and I guess it's like, it's just kind of well-behaved children being

2495
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:11,960
tormented by fantasy freaks.

2496
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,700
That's a good way to put it.

2497
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,300
So it doesn't seem fun cause they're not along for the ride.

2498
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,500
They're just stressed.

2499
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,720
Like Alice is stressed that she's going to die and the little kids in Cat in

2500
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,120
the Hat are stressed that they're going to get in trouble and see their home

2501
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:25,480
destroyed.

2502
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:29,320
There's an intruder in our house and he's whimsical, but chaotic.

2503
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,640
Oh, and he's got two weird little friends.

2504
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:35,920
Oh, we haven't even talked about the fucking, the thing one and thing two

2505
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,320
shirts.

2506
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,820
Oh, I see what you're saying.

2507
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,500
That has been a thing since Islands opened.

2508
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:41,460
That's a thing.

2509
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,380
Who wears those and why?

2510
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:44,640
They have like thing dad and stuff.

2511
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,020
Thing dad or like, yeah, thing one and thing two.

2512
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:52,040
And now it's kind of been usurped by the minion shirts, by like the bright

2513
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:54,380
yellow shirts with minion eyes and stuff on them.

2514
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,340
Or the minion overalls printed on them.

2515
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:56,700
Yeah.

2516
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,300
You guys just jogged a very weird memory.

2517
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:01,700
This is the strangest story I could tell.

2518
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:03,300
That is our show catchphrase.

2519
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,180
I had a Cat in the Hat experience when I was a kid and I don't know why I

2520
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:11,520
never made the connection until now, but my dad used to work in video game

2521
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:15,020
development and he worked for the company that made the Bubsy games.

2522
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,580
Oh, are we no, and I have a little, I know, I know,

2523
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:21,280
and I used to play the games too.

2524
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,420
And I guess for promotional purposes, they had like a Bubsy mascot suit.

2525
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,900
And my, my sister and I played the Bubsy games, um, because my dad brought them

2526
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:36,480
home obviously, and we had little stuffed animals of Bubsy that I think only

2527
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:39,500
employees of the company could get these little Bubsy dolls, but we still have our

2528
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,360
little Bubsy dolls.

2529
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,620
And then, um, my dad, to surprise us one night, my mom had to go to her like

2530
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:49,400
women's group meeting and she's like, and I just don't have a sitter for you guys.

2531
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,880
Like they were like doing like a long con and she's like, yeah, I didn't find a

2532
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,300
babysitter.

2533
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:54,660
You guys will just have to be good.

2534
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:57,300
And then she left and we're like, oh my God, we're home alone.

2535
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,760
We're only like three and five.

2536
01:39:58,920 --> 01:39:59,520
What do we do?

2537
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,220
And then the doorbell rings and it's Bubsy here to babysit us.

2538
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:09,960
My dad put on the mascot suit and came home early to babysit us as Bubsy.

2539
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,200
And so we thought that Bubsy had just showed up at our house and obviously he

2540
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,960
was like, you know, doing everything wrong.

2541
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,480
Cause he's just a big mascot suit of Bubsy.

2542
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,480
How long did the character acting lay?

2543
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,480
He could have been hired officially to do it.

2544
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,720
My dad was a theater major too.

2545
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:24,760
So, um,

2546
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:30,720
If I saw that I would look out like the front windows of my child at home and saw

2547
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,600
that I'd be like, it's scary.

2548
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:35,860
Get the cordless phone call 911.

2549
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,300
I'm locking the doors.

2550
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,920
And like we were kind of put in the role of like babysitting ourselves because it's

2551
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,000
just this big unspeaking Bubsy.

2552
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,820
So we were like, well now it's time for us to go to bed and stuff.

2553
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,620
So it lasted a long time.

2554
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,160
It did.

2555
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:52,640
And then like my mom got back from her like meeting and Bubsy left a little bit

2556
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,300
before that.

2557
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:55,980
Like we were changing for bed and we came out and Bubsy was gone.

2558
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,380
And then my mom came in like, how are you guys?

2559
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,080
How was the night like playing dumb?

2560
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,420
And we were like, Bubsy was here.

2561
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:02,180
It was Bubsy.

2562
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,200
And she's like, what?

2563
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:04,440
But there was no Mr.

2564
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:10,160
Crinkle Bean to be the voice of reason and go like, Bubsy, just fucking cool it.

2565
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,880
It's just funny because it is a large cartoon cat.

2566
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:15,720
And I can't believe I never drew that connection until just now.

2567
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,840
But he's like hauntingly silent like the Babadook.

2568
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:20,540
Yeah, it was like the Babadook.

2569
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:25,660
It is really scary in hindsight imagining like a tall Bubsy just in your house.

2570
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,440
It's a space you don't expect a mascot suit to be in kind of.

2571
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,160
Yeah.

2572
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,460
That's why you go to Disneyland or to the mall or whatever.

2573
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:35,000
Text in which you expect them.

2574
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,800
Yes, but when it showed up at your door.

2575
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:38,380
It's a bit scary.

2576
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:39,320
Yeah, I was.

2577
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:39,560
I was.

2578
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:42,560
It's somewhere between like childhood magic and sort of right.

2579
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:44,100
For us, it was just we liked it.

2580
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:48,480
But in hindsight, if that happened to me now, first of all, be weird if you wanted

2581
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,200
to babysit me because I am an adult.

2582
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:54,680
So if Bubsy showed up in my apartment, like I'm your babysitter, I'd be like, I

2583
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,060
need a weapon.

2584
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,680
I'm here to tell you what to do.

2585
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:01,220
Creepy.

2586
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:01,660
All right.

2587
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:02,380
Well, creepy.

2588
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:04,440
But it was like the cat in the hat.

2589
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:05,040
Made real.

2590
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:05,620
But Bubsy.

2591
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:06,300
Literal.

2592
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:09,320
A weird story I told you guys.

2593
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:10,580
Thank you.

2594
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,140
For sure.

2595
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,840
You had a cat in your house.

2596
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,260
Yeah.

2597
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:15,180
That giant cat.

2598
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:16,220
A lot of people have cats in their house.

2599
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:17,800
He was like a cool cat though.

2600
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:18,140
Bubsy.

2601
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:18,740
He was a cool cat.

2602
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:21,040
I wish I had pictures of that like mascot suit.

2603
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,500
I'm sure they're in some photo album.

2604
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:25,180
Like that was not the only time we saw the suit.

2605
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,800
We saw him at like company appearances and stuff too.

2606
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:28,900
But, um.

2607
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,620
And he would want you there as well.

2608
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:30,900
Yeah.

2609
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,540
I've never been able to find pictures of the suit like online.

2610
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:33,860
But.

2611
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:34,200
Wow.

2612
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:38,160
I'm imagining a darker scenario than probably what occurred where

2613
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:39,880
like you're happy Bubsy is there.

2614
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:45,140
You start playing and then you both open up to Bubsy about how much like

2615
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,680
all your problems with your dad.

2616
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:49,960
And now you're like, I don't think he's, I don't think he's holding down work.

2617
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:53,080
And I think he may, maybe he's being mean to my mom.

2618
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,100
I'm glad you're here instead Bubsy.

2619
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:56,520
Stay forever.

2620
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:57,600
I hope our dad never.

2621
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:00,020
There used to be a light in his eyes and it's since been distinguished.

2622
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,300
Oh my God.

2623
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:03,660
Maybe the stress of us.

2624
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,780
You're our surrogate father Bubsy.

2625
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:10,100
But I think what we did with Bubsy is, um, we also as like, you know, having

2626
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:14,700
our dad working there, we had a VHS of the Bubsy pilot, which I think is on

2627
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:19,080
YouTube now, but we were like, let's watch the Bubsy movie and it's about

2628
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,660
like his niece and nephew Bubsy.

2629
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,400
And I don't really remember.

2630
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:25,740
This sounds like the Lorax movie where it's like, they're so

2631
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:28,460
convoluted setting up this stuff.

2632
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:32,000
I think one of the things that works with Seuss landing is they're like,

2633
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,640
look, here's here's one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.

2634
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:37,900
And that was very cute.

2635
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:42,680
Um, and there's the, there's the carousel with all the fish.

2636
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:43,560
There's the carousel.

2637
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:46,400
Oh, it's the Circus McGurkis.

2638
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:48,600
Oh, uh, yes.

2639
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:51,540
Uh, or a Circus McGurkis is the restaurant.

2640
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:51,860
Okay.

2641
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,280
And the carousel is just everything.

2642
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:54,460
It's a catch all.

2643
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:54,840
Yeah.

2644
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:55,880
It's kind of a catch all.

2645
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:58,580
Uh, there's the, do you guys know about the Zacks bypass?

2646
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:00,280
Are you familiar with the Zacks bypass?

2647
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,640
The Zackses were like two, two stubborn creature.

2648
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:09,500
The they're kind of creature and two of them met and one was going north and one

2649
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:12,480
was going south and they refused to compromise.

2650
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:16,000
So there, the road was built around and above them.

2651
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,400
And so the trolley train ride does go directly above them and you can, and

2652
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,800
there it's just two Zackses stuck in hell.

2653
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:25,740
That's a deep reference.

2654
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:26,680
They're just stuck in limbo.

2655
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:31,900
There's a lot of, the detail work in this part of the park is good.

2656
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:35,040
Uh, like there is a lot of details, a lot of references to the book.

2657
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:35,600
Yeah.

2658
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,380
I thought, you know, looking at a lot of pictures, like is, is the

2659
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:42,900
paint like kind of sun dammit?

2660
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,320
Like a lot of where it looks good when I went.

2661
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:46,200
It was fine.

2662
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:47,280
I think they updated it.

2663
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,600
I think it's like Toontown where it just fades really fast.

2664
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:50,060
Yeah.

2665
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:54,280
But then there's also like looking at the Soos art, like it is a very flat

2666
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,920
matte style of color, so I think they try, they replicated that pretty

2667
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:00,860
well, but I think it's still fades.

2668
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:05,060
So my thing is that they, I think they, in trying to recreate, especially

2669
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:09,160
on the ride and trying to recreate the art of the book, I feel like it

2670
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:12,020
looks weird and it looks like, especially like the characters look

2671
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,660
there, they're melting a little bit.

2672
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:16,580
Like, yeah, it looks a little bit like he's melting the colors.

2673
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:18,340
Don't maybe pop that ride.

2674
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:19,040
He does.

2675
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:24,760
And in preparation for doing this talk, I watched, um, I rewatched

2676
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:25,900
a ride through of the ride.

2677
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:26,300
Yes.

2678
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:30,140
And in that ride through, the cat looked a lot better than when I saw him.

2679
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:34,640
So my thinking is that the skin that I saw, and this sounds as scary as it

2680
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:39,420
ought to, I think the skin that I saw on the cat in the hat had been on too long.

2681
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:42,040
Like his blacks were not black enough.

2682
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,500
He looks like pale.

2683
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,160
There weren't enough squiggly lines to indicate hair.

2684
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,980
It was kind of slouching off his body.

2685
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:53,320
His eyes happened to splash mountain every now and then where they look good.

2686
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:57,420
Like you'll notice they stopped moving, but like it's, it's a range of motion thing.

2687
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,520
I feel like their skins hold up pretty good.

2688
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:00,000
Oh, okay.

2689
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:00,440
Yeah.

2690
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:04,080
But cat in the hat, it was like his skin is like latex or something.

2691
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:05,100
It's not fur.

2692
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:05,840
It's not fur.

2693
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:06,460
Okay.

2694
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:06,960
Yeah.

2695
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:07,840
That's an issue.

2696
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:08,980
Why is it?

2697
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:12,420
It should be more like a cartoon.

2698
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:14,540
I mean, they should have probably kind of redesigned it.

2699
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:15,940
They'd not go full Mike Myers.

2700
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:21,640
But still have a different cartoonish thing, but yeah, like a rabbit or something

2701
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,300
like that.

2702
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:26,140
Cause yeah, cause the way that the characters look is kind of frightening.

2703
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:28,360
And with fur, you don't have to change it out as often.

2704
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:28,660
Right.

2705
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:33,500
Cause that happens with pirates and haunted too is like their skin will kind of slough off.

2706
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:33,860
Right.

2707
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:37,540
And I think what they do is they'll go in and kind of whittle off the excess that's

2708
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,500
coming off at the edges.

2709
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:44,380
Like honestly, I saw some ex-imagineer had like a website post and in his keepsake

2710
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:48,560
box, he had like bits of old skin from the haunted mansion skin.

2711
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,000
So it's like that bluish gray.

2712
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:50,480
Right.

2713
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,600
I saw the skin of Mater from the radiator Springs racer at D23.

2714
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,260
They had his whole mouth.

2715
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:56,940
His whole skin.

2716
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:58,020
So that's really, it's crazy.

2717
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,960
They have, cause they have to replace that full Mater mouth every couple months or

2718
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:02,460
something.

2719
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:03,000
Yeah.

2720
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:04,460
That must have a lot of wear in there.

2721
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:09,740
So, so the, so again, that is loose skin a lot and they got to maybe upkeep a little

2722
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:09,980
bit better.

2723
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:15,940
Also a screen, uh, with some very dated, like 2000 CGI.

2724
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:17,140
Does that not look good now?

2725
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:20,920
This ride is better than the animatronic, which is not saying a lot.

2726
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:24,340
This ride reminds me of the Winnie the Pooh in Disneyland.

2727
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:27,700
It's a similar ride where there's a couple of okay things.

2728
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,500
It's not as good as that ride.

2729
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:32,240
It's weird though, cause it is more ambitious than that ride.

2730
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,540
Cause Winnie the Pooh is like stiff mannequins and they move a little bit.

2731
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:37,420
So there's not a lot that can go wrong there.

2732
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:39,060
Cause it's rigid plastic.

2733
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:39,700
That's true.

2734
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:42,900
And I think Cat in the Hat, they do have a much bigger range of motion.

2735
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:46,260
So it's a more impressive ride because like there's a lot more that's moving.

2736
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:47,220
It's longer.

2737
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,740
There's a lot of like moving elements and effects.

2738
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,880
You have the little contraptions with arms running all over the room.

2739
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:55,120
You have scenery swinging out of the way.

2740
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:59,400
It benefits from being like, there's not a lot of dark rides in islands either.

2741
01:47:59,400 --> 01:47:59,760
Yeah.

2742
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,780
Until I guess if you consider Hogwarts.

2743
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,060
By everything.

2744
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:04,960
Yeah.

2745
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,940
I'm in the, but they also has the thing like this, I complained about this on

2746
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:13,700
Small World and I was shouted down by my co-hosts and guests that I don't like how

2747
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:17,080
Small World, you can see just the ceiling very, it's very visible and it looks like

2748
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:17,300
a building.

2749
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:18,980
It depends on like time of day.

2750
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:21,180
Like if your eyes are adjusted to the darkness.

2751
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,700
I wrote down in my notes, unlike it's a Small World, I am not charmed by this

2752
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:27,380
visible lighting.

2753
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,560
Thank you very much.

2754
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:29,780
Oh the lighting racks.

2755
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:32,240
So you can see too much of the lighting racks are pretty clear.

2756
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:35,480
So as much as you're saying, yeah, like you've been completely trapped in the

2757
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:36,840
house would be horrifying.

2758
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:38,240
I do think it would be better.

2759
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:42,480
I didn't even notice that as much just because it was such a sensory overload.

2760
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,400
Cause like there is a lot moving and you're looking left and right.

2761
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:49,280
And then on top of that, they have the soundtrack of the ride, which is like the

2762
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,840
nightmarish giggling of thing one and thing two.

2763
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,060
And then also like the distressed cries of the children in Goldfish.

2764
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,600
So it's just like, it's overwhelming.

2765
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:03,280
I remember at one point in the ride, like my friend and I just the whole time I felt

2766
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,080
bad cause there was like this couple in front of us that just got put on the

2767
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,840
vehicle with us and they were just this like adult, like middle Eastern couple.

2768
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:12,380
They, they appeared to not, not like speak a lot of English.

2769
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:15,900
I think they were just along for the ride and maybe they were even enjoying it, but

2770
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:20,040
we were right behind them going like, Oh, wait, was there a line for this ride?

2771
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:20,920
There was a short line.

2772
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:23,280
We waited about five to seven minutes.

2773
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,940
It's not, it's never long.

2774
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,600
Basically a walk on.

2775
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:26,960
Yeah.

2776
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:30,340
So I don't like, they should have been giving everyone their own cars.

2777
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,400
They should have had their own cause also they came in from the VIP line.

2778
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,760
So they had bought that pass all day.

2779
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,260
Should have given them their own car.

2780
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,120
Did you wait?

2781
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,940
So who got to control the spinning?

2782
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,420
Oh, you don't control.

2783
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:42,340
You don't control the spinning.

2784
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:43,040
Oh, you don't anymore.

2785
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:46,080
If you used to, but maybe you never did.

2786
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,280
I don't think you ever did.

2787
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:48,500
I'm confusing my rides then maybe.

2788
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:49,700
You control it.

2789
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:50,220
And that's why I heard.

2790
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:52,320
Men in black where you hit something with them.

2791
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:53,420
Not thinking of Men in Black.

2792
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:53,880
Men in Black.

2793
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:54,420
Such a good ride.

2794
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:55,080
Something else.

2795
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,940
Can I throw, can I throw out a little, little bit of trivia and I'm curious if

2796
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:59,380
you guys know the, uh, the answer.

2797
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:01,600
I was thinking how it is odd.

2798
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:06,020
It is a very rare Universal Studios dark ride.

2799
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,060
There are not a lot.

2800
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:12,680
I would say in my quantification of this, I was going to ask, if you could name the

2801
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:15,640
other two, one is ET, probably the first Universal Studios dark ride.

2802
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:18,340
They had not done another one until Cat in the Hat.

2803
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:20,380
Well, confrontation is a dark ride.

2804
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:22,280
It's gone now, but it was a dark ride.

2805
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:27,980
Well, let me, let me qualify like, like a, like in the more of a kid's style,

2806
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:32,020
little cars, uh, um, you know, like more of family rides.

2807
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:32,460
Okay.

2808
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:36,340
Um, like can you name the other, there's only one other one.

2809
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,560
And you're not counting Men in Black.

2810
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:39,900
I'm not counting, I'm not counting Men in Black cause it's a shooting ride.

2811
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:40,820
Different genre, I think.

2812
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,240
I mean, it's again, what counts?

2813
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,440
Cause like you could almost count the Dudley Doo, right?

2814
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:48,420
Cause it does have scenes that move, but I wouldn't really count it.

2815
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:49,340


2816
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,620
Uh, straight up dark ride.

2817
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:53,060
It's I'll, I'll give you the hint that it's not in America.

2818
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,780
I, I'm, I'm, hopefully you guys don't know what this is.

2819
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:58,420
There's a Madagascar safari ride.

2820
01:50:59,100 --> 01:50:59,500
Is that it?

2821
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:04,680
It's called like crate adventure or something, but that is a, that's a water

2822
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:05,020
ride.

2823
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:05,940
Oh, that's a water ride.

2824
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:10,600
But in the same park, I believe in Singapore, there is something called

2825
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,200
Sesame Street spaghetti space chase.

2826
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:14,100
Whoa.

2827
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:16,040
It's pretty fun.

2828
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,580
I recommend a watch through ride through of it.

2829
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:21,180
Singapore has really good rides too.

2830
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,160
I've only seen ride throughs of them, but their Jurassic park looks a lot better

2831
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,720
than ours.

2832
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,080
Does it really?

2833
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,820
Oh, is that the one that has a rapids ride rather than a flamethrower?

2834
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,780
And then also just the dinos are all way better maintained.

2835
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,900
California's in a very sad state.

2836
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:34,320
Yeah.

2837
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:35,720
They have loose skin.

2838
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,620
Well, yeah, they have loose skin, but it looks a little better on a dinosaur.

2839
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:39,440
They're not as humanoid.

2840
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:40,120
That's true.

2841
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,980
Um, and you don't really know what a real dino should look like.

2842
01:51:42,980 --> 01:51:45,340
So it's easier to fool the eye and be like, sure.

2843
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,340
That's a brontosaurus.

2844
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:47,000
Okay.

2845
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:51,480
I just always think dinosaurs look like better animatronics because we don't have

2846
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,800
a basis for comparison.

2847
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,200
Right.

2848
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:53,860
Um,

2849
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,360
Oh, sure.

2850
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,500
And they're lizardy.

2851
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,780
So you expect a bit of skin.

2852
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,200
They're almost like elephants.

2853
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,200
You're just like, okay, they can have some wrinkles.

2854
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,180
They're chubby.

2855
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:07,400
But, um, I think like a couple months ago, someone made a ride through comparison of

2856
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:14,320
like opening day or opening year, um, Jurassic park river cruise versus 2017

2857
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,220
Jurassic park river cruise.

2858
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:20,860
And not only just the skin maintenance being worse, like them needing some TLC,

2859
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:23,540
you can see that all of them are in their B modes now.

2860
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:27,080
Like where they're just their range of motion is a lot less.

2861
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:32,200
So even the ones that are operating properly, they always have like all theme

2862
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:37,420
parks, any, any key or ambitious animatronic is usually pre-programmed with an A

2863
01:52:37,420 --> 01:52:41,820
mode where it's working at its full operating capacity and a B mode, which is

2864
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:44,800
like what it does if the figure is having problems.

2865
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,480
So it's meant to be like a last resort mode and not like something you run all

2866
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:49,940
the time.

2867
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:53,080
It's supposed to be like, it needs maintenance, but it's a major part of the

2868
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:53,320
ride.

2869
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,240
It's a key figure.

2870
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,140
Like it'll look weird if we take it out.

2871
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:59,560
So in the interest of running the park for the day, we're going to put it in its B

2872
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,760
mode so it can function and we'll fix it at night.

2873
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:06,580
So then there, and then there's whatever the Yeti at expedition ever is stuck in.

2874
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:09,300
At this point, he does have a B mode too.

2875
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:12,960
And initially they did just run him in B mode where they minimized his movement,

2876
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,700
but now he's just off with strobe lights.

2877
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:21,100
And that's why when they did the singer, the song, is it the singer of songs in

2878
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:21,520
the avatar?

2879
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,600
Yeah, her B mode is a projection.

2880
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,020
The shaman of songs.

2881
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:29,360
But that's built on a contraption where they can just pull it backstage

2882
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,760
immediately and get it on and on.

2883
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:35,360
And she can be fixed right there without them having to move her out of the

2884
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:35,660
building.

2885
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:42,520
Like they purposely build stuff that are complex to fix easier than when they

2886
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:42,960
built the Yeti.

2887
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:48,280
Also like at Disneyland, all figures where the ride can't run without them, um,

2888
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,100
have a backup figure as well.

2889
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:52,680
So in case of emergency, they can be substituted out.

2890
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:55,140
I think the auctioneer at pirates has one.

2891
01:53:55,140 --> 01:54:00,280
Um, I know that the dog from pirates has one because one time at holiday time,

2892
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:04,740
they pulled it out for a photo op and like we could all take pictures with it

2893
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:06,300
and like wear pirate hats and stuff.

2894
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:08,240
And I was like, if it's here, what's in the ride?

2895
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:09,200
And they're like, Oh, we have two.

2896
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,040
Cause it's important.

2897
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:11,400
Yeah, we got another one.

2898
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,960
The joke doesn't make sense if there's no dog there.

2899
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,540
So, I mean, obviously you'll see the singing pirates where it's like a quartet

2900
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,680
and it's really common to see one of them just gone.

2901
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:20,060
Yes.

2902
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:23,260
Because with those, it doesn't ruin the scene if they're gone, they can just have

2903
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:24,120
a barrel there.

2904
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:25,100
Ruins it for me though.

2905
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:30,340
But like, and same for a lot of space or, um, splash mountain ones, you'll see them

2906
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:33,420
taken out and just have blank spots where they should be.

2907
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:33,920
Wow.

2908
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,700
But, um, yeah, I think we never, we now have a way to quantify, uh, if we've done

2909
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:41,640
a good or bad job in each episode.

2910
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:43,160
If we're in A mode or B mode.

2911
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:44,100
Yeah, A mode or B mode.

2912
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:45,540
Sorry guys, I feel like I was in B mode.

2913
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,520
Or your full Yeti where you just got a strobe light on and a fan.

2914
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,540
I was really phoning it in.

2915
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:54,240
Cat in the Hat, no longer spinner I found on the website.

2916
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,600
I found on the message board here.

2917
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,420
So it used to be, I believe so.

2918
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:00,320
Cause I have a memory of spinning it and I'm not that crazy.

2919
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:05,240
Cause now you hit a hallway where you spin lethargically, like a gentle spin

2920
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:08,320
for the duration of that hallway, but the rest of it, you're just going forward.

2921
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,260
That hallway, I think is the cheapest spot.

2922
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,800
Like that's like the black light hallway.

2923
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:12,320
Is that right?

2924
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:16,460
That's when, uh, thing one and thing two, push a piano on top of your head and then

2925
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:18,360
you see stars and you see sound effects.

2926
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,740
It's kind of like in Mr. Toad when you go through the dynamite.

2927
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:24,080
Like, yeah, yeah.

2928
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:25,900
It's just a simulation of a cartoon effect.

2929
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:29,760
I mean, not every thing can be a giant, huge animatronic.

2930
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,440
There's money costs, but like,

2931
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:33,300
I'm surprised how many they did have in the ride.

2932
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:34,320
Yeah, that's true.

2933
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:35,840
It's just all that effort.

2934
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:39,080
And for a result that's unnerving and unpleasant.

2935
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:43,860
I am really, uh, the spinning thing is really getting to me that it's gone

2936
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:48,120
because that was one of my favorite parts of the ride is how crazy you could make

2937
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,460
the ride in addition to how nightmarish it was.

2938
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:53,480
And maybe that makes you feel more like you have agency in it.

2939
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:53,680
Yes.

2940
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:56,160
I think the current version, it's more of a bombardment.

2941
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:59,520
Like all these sights and sounds just coming at you.

2942
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:02,460
I feel like if you're spinning, you've got like a thing to focus on other than

2943
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:03,920
all the things coming at you.

2944
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:04,220
Yes.

2945
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:07,340
And you can try to be like a Tasmanian devil also through...

2946
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:09,500
Yeah, you're like an active participant in this chaos.

2947
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:10,440
Yeah.

2948
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:14,240
You're just, you're just being bombarded, uh, like the children are.

2949
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:16,420
It's this horrible nightmare day that they have.

2950
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:16,720
Yeah.

2951
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,540
And I, when I read this, I said, I read the book.

2952
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,700
I was just like, Mike, what if this happened to me?

2953
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:21,900
Like it was just...

2954
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:22,860
It is anxiety inducing.

2955
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:23,520
Yeah.

2956
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,740
And it wasn't fun.

2957
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:28,560
And I, we would, I would get it read to me, but I didn't love it.

2958
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:32,100
Um, and the, the film only compounds this.

2959
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:33,520
I flipped through the film.

2960
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:35,040
The film is a nightmare.

2961
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:41,060
If the film occurred to you in reality, I was starting to watch it.

2962
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,580
I was well, cause...

2963
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:43,120
You must have known.

2964
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:46,180
You know, it just showed up on HBO now this week.

2965
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:47,660
And then I was like, I'm going to watch it.

2966
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:48,840
So I have stuff to say.

2967
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:49,300
Oh, yeah.

2968
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:50,500
Now I got to track it.

2969
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:50,820
Oh no.

2970
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:51,680
Now that it's right there.

2971
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:55,440
Give it a, actually somebody did a good job on YouTube of paring down just the

2972
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,020
strangest moments in Cat in the Hat.

2973
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:01,800
And, uh, the number one being, I'll just spoil it.

2974
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,600
Paris Hilton is in this movie.

2975
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:03,820
What?

2976
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:08,260
In an unspeaking, they ended up at some nightclub and Paris Hilton is there.

2977
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:09,020
What, they leave the house?

2978
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:12,600
Yeah, they go out or, or it might, I think part of the house made for a

2979
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:13,560
nightclub, I think.

2980
01:57:13,620 --> 01:57:13,860
Yeah.

2981
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,420
The whole, the house is transforming.

2982
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:17,120
The whole one is also a nosy neighbor.

2983
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,000
Is that right?

2984
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:18,380
Yeah.

2985
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:21,160
And he has a big prosthetic gut at some point.

2986
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:22,420
Oh boy, that's fun.

2987
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:23,420
Oh, there's a failed...

2988
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,140
They'd be more offended if they didn't give you one.

2989
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:25,960
Yeah, yeah.

2990
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:31,000
There's a, there's a failed, uh, Mike Myers catchphrase in it.

2991
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:31,360
I don't know.

2992
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:31,860
I didn't know that.

2993
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:32,960
He keeps saying...

2994
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:33,740
Somebody stop me.

2995
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,220
It's really close.

2996
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:38,860
The entire character is very close to the mask in that he keeps

2997
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:40,080
transforming into things.

2998
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:42,300
And here now he's an infomercial host.

2999
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:43,060
Yeah.

3000
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:43,280
Yeah.

3001
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:46,780
He was Carmen Miranda, which I feel like other characters of that

3002
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:48,060
nature have been Carmen Miranda.

3003
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:49,960
That is locked in my mind.

3004
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:50,240
That visual.

3005
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:50,700
Really upsetting.

3006
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:54,480
He does a kind of odd little like shake of his like, like his...

3007
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:55,120
His cat tail?

3008
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:55,780
Coconut butt.

3009
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,680
Like, uh, it's, uh, it's pretty disturbing.

3010
01:57:58,720 --> 01:57:59,940
That's what the ride was missing.

3011
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:04,980
The, uh, um, like odd sexually confused moment.

3012
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,860
There's a weird part where he just holds up a dress in front of

3013
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:09,980
him and says, I'm a girl.

3014
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:10,900
Oh, Jesus.

3015
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:13,000
I, uh, you don't really know why.

3016
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,360
It's that like early 2000s sensibility of like men dressed

3017
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:18,300
in dresses is only funny.

3018
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:19,200
Yeah.

3019
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:19,620
Yeah.

3020
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:22,340
How could anyone ever belittle themselves?

3021
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,300
Why would he demean himself like a woman?

3022
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,380
Only the freakiest freaks, whatever.

3023
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:27,760
Yeah.

3024
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,040
It definitely comes out of that.

3025
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:32,100
So Mike Myers didn't do a month long residency as the cat in

3026
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,740
the hat like he did for Guru Pindar.

3027
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:35,540
Opening for John Bryan at the Largo.

3028
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,840
He showed up at the L.

3029
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:37,080
Ray.

3030
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:39,620
He's doing some, uh, he's doing working out cats.

3031
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,560
Doing opening sets for Friends, Ferdinand.

3032
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:44,860
There's a secret show at the People's Improv Theater in New York.

3033
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:48,240
And, uh, let's just say there's a very curious cat involved.

3034
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,640
I like also dressed as Carmen Miranda on top of it.

3035
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:51,960
Yeah.

3036
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:54,240
I like the idea that he would workshop and just go to kids'

3037
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:56,660
houses to workshop the whole thing.

3038
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,600
A la Bubsy.

3039
01:58:57,760 --> 01:58:58,120
That's right.

3040
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:58,840
A la Bubsy.

3041
01:58:58,840 --> 01:58:59,680
A la Bubsy.

3042
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:01,580
Your house would have been open.

3043
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:04,260
The, I want to say one more thing about this movie is that it has

3044
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:05,620
a little theme park connection.

3045
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:09,320
There's a very bizarre section where there's a, there's a babysitter

3046
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:13,120
who falls asleep, who kind of cannot be trained when she, at the end, she wakes

3047
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:15,320
up and like didn't know anything happened, Mrs.

3048
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:15,840
Kwon.

3049
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:20,640
And, uh, and, and at some, and at some point the house becomes this odd

3050
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:25,580
multi-layered river zone and they ride her like a log flume.

3051
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:29,080
And there's a part where the cat, the kid says, Oh my God, this is

3052
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:30,380
like a ride at a theme park.

3053
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:33,960
And the cat, Mike Myers turns to Cameron and says, you mean like

3054
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:35,320
Universal Studios?

3055
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:37,460
How horrible.

3056
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:38,980
Really often he holds up maps.

3057
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:43,000
Like then accurate, perhaps Universal escape maps that didn't freeze frame,

3058
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:44,020
but it could have been from that era.

3059
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:48,620
That's a lot of, um, a lot of overconfidence early in the project.

3060
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:49,380
Uh huh.

3061
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:53,280
Like the presumption that the film would make so much money that it would

3062
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,260
inevitably get a theme park ride.

3063
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:58,680
That it would get a ride and that even the bare mentioning of it would

3064
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:01,880
boost attendance five fold at the park.

3065
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,400
And the idea that like, well, we know this one's got it in the bag,

3066
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,460
that it's going to get a ride.

3067
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:08,360
So we might as well make a little coy joke.

3068
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:12,920
I mean, we've got all the powers in the movie, so this is going to be a hit.

3069
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:14,500
This guy's a catchphrase machine.

3070
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:16,800
Oh, I didn't say he keeps saying, Oh yeah.

3071
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:18,980
Like Kool-Aid man?

3072
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,440
Pretty much like the Kool-Aid man.

3073
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:20,800
Yep.

3074
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,080
Does he bust through any walls?

3075
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:22,980
He's got to.

3076
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:24,200
A lot of walls get busted.

3077
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:25,220
So it's referential.

3078
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:28,960
That's par for the course for, uh, but he doesn't say it while doing the busting.

3079
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,280
Or thing one and thing two, like scary little men.

3080
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:33,180
They are so fucking scary.

3081
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:37,620
Could you imagine being the widow with the kids?

3082
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:42,820
Like watching this, the Seuss family watching, like, what the fuck did you do?

3083
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,080
How did you do this?

3084
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:44,540
Hideous.

3085
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:45,680
They have snouts.

3086
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:51,100
The only thing this movie did correctly is that at the end of the ride, um, they,

3087
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:54,080
they, they, they, there's like an announcement, a Corey Burton-esque

3088
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:59,240
announcement saying, uh, uh, you like, uh, you please exit the Quan to your left.

3089
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:00,000
Cause she's Mrs.

3090
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:00,380
Quan.

3091
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:00,640
Right.

3092
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,700
They were riding on her and there's another little scene and then it comes

3093
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,760
back and they're holding a souvenir photo.

3094
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:09,460
And the photo says on the back, I survived the Quan.

3095
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:14,720
And our podcast ends with you survived podcast, the ride.

3096
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:19,180
And I just want to say, I feel great that a joke that we do in every single episode

3097
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:22,520
is something worthy of the Mike Myers cat in the hat.

3098
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,080
That's great.

3099
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,920
Do you say that every episode?

3100
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:27,340
You're about to find out.

3101
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:29,900
Um, so is this a good time?

3102
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:31,320
Well, we should do a poll.

3103
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:33,380
We should just have our final thoughts with what we do to the ride.

3104
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:34,640
Final thoughts, cat in the hat.

3105
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:38,280
Did you like, do you, do you like this ride more than you didn't like this ride?

3106
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:39,920
Or what's your sum total?

3107
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:44,360
It was pretty rough, but I guess that amount of effort I have to respect.

3108
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:46,900
So, so we have a scale.

3109
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:50,340
So would you keep the ride perfectly as is, would you plus it up and what are your

3110
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:53,400
ideas or would you just burn it down and for insurance money and build something

3111
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:53,720
new?

3112
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:58,780
Is an option for plus it up to reskin everything and make it a different ride?

3113
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:02,420
Yeah, I would use all the figures and make them some other Seuss property.

3114
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:07,160
Maybe a Lorax right now that has a downer ending, not Lorax, but something

3115
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,720
Horton.

3116
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:09,080
That'd be a good ride.

3117
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:11,520
Yeah, I'm not versed enough in Horton.

3118
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:15,360
Uh, but maybe I want to be, I want to learn what Horton is.

3119
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:17,040
So, uh, yeah, take it out.

3120
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:17,680
It's Horton now.

3121
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:18,200
Yeah, it's Horton.

3122
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,620
So I can experience Horton.

3123
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,200
That's good.

3124
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:21,240
That's your plus it up as well.

3125
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,000
Yeah, it's just Horton.

3126
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:22,460
Yeah.

3127
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:23,080
It's time.

3128
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:26,320
I do think they have to, I have, I have this general thing about Islands of

3129
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:30,840
Adventure that I, I've said this, I think it was, if we were going to rank VIP theme

3130
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:35,860
parks year to year, I think in 99, 2000, uh, Islands of Adventure is number one.

3131
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:36,680
It's the VIP.

3132
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:40,580
And now I feel like it's just not, what else can you do?

3133
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:42,160
You can do little seasonal events.

3134
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:44,440
They string Christmas lights up around Seuss landing.

3135
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:49,180
I don't know what else, uh, what other, uh, all these, so many of these things

3136
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:50,540
need a kind of police on life.

3137
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,140
Superhero Island's just there.

3138
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:53,260
They should take that out.

3139
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:54,860
It's just embarrassing with Disney.

3140
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:55,720
I love it.

3141
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:59,080
No, I love the, well, we love Mike and I love it as it is.

3142
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:04,740
I also love the, uh, uh, industrial conflict it causes between two massive

3143
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:05,240
behemoths.

3144
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:06,160
I think it's fascinating.

3145
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:09,920
It's just up out of spite at this point because they fought contractually to be

3146
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:12,940
allowed to keep it and I think they're going to keep it as long as they can

3147
02:03:12,940 --> 02:03:13,340
justify.

3148
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,720
But I honestly think that, especially with Disney getting a Marvel land, it's going

3149
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:20,640
to become even more a source of embarrassment and it should just come out.

3150
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:22,800
But that Spider-Man ride is so good.

3151
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:23,120
It's nice.

3152
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:26,040
It's so, it's, it's the same ride as Transformers.

3153
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:28,980
So now that they have Transformers, they don't need

3154
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:29,640
the Spider-Man ride.

3155
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:31,460
The IP is better though with Spider-Man.

3156
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:35,780
Of course it is, but, Ooh, but they can, what an easy ride to re-theme.

3157
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:36,500
I'll put it that way.

3158
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:38,220
They have other properties at Universal.

3159
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:40,820
They could easily put in a Lucille Ball ride there.

3160
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:41,640
Oh God.

3161
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:43,600
A similar, very similar.

3162
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:46,040
Woody Woodpecker and his Woody Woodpecker wife.

3163
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:47,360
Or combine them on multiple.

3164
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,620
Smokey and the Bandit.

3165
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:51,320
It's like the easiest ride of all time to re-theme cause it's so screen heavy.

3166
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:54,020
So yeah, Lucy, you go through the Ricardo's kitchen.

3167
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:55,160
I think is a good idea.

3168
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:58,960
Uh, I will say, yeah, my, my, I would say plus up this.

3169
02:03:58,960 --> 02:03:59,600
Right too.

3170
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:02,560
I think you could plus up all of Seuss landing.

3171
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:06,640
And I think like this ride especially made me think about like, you know, the

3172
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:13,580
fantasy land dark rides get sort of a plus thing up like every 10, 20 years or so.

3173
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:15,160
They had projections and all that.

3174
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:16,820
They had projections, they clean it up.

3175
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:17,740
They redo the queue.

3176
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:20,140
I think you do that for this ride.

3177
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:22,000
You know, you make the anatronics a little better.

3178
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,820
You add some rear projection stuff.

3179
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:28,360
I think you do like a full new fantasy land, um, for Seuss landing.

3180
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:30,040
Cause I love the level of detail.

3181
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:35,780
Um, I, I, I had a great time going back and looking at all this stuff.

3182
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:40,060
Cause I, I pass through that island of the park pretty quickly usually, but it's

3183
02:04:40,060 --> 02:04:41,180
like, Oh, this is cool.

3184
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:41,720
This is cool.

3185
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:46,980
But looking at the restaurants, I mean the circus restaurant looks really cool inside.

3186
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:48,540
The food looks atrocious.

3187
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:52,120
Like the food in this part of the park reading these menus look like.

3188
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,320
Such a bummer.

3189
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,080
I mean, all the restaurants are like that though.

3190
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:55,360
Right?

3191
02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:56,140
It's like pizza.

3192
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:56,800
Yeah.

3193
02:04:56,840 --> 02:04:57,240
Yeah.

3194
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,680
And like the green eggs and ham restaurant is never open.

3195
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:02,100
Do they not serve green eggs and ham?

3196
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,140
They do serve green eggs.

3197
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:06,820
It's like green eggs with like parsley and arugula and stuff.

3198
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:08,960
It's not that level.

3199
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,700
What I saw, photos I've seen, cause that sounds kind of nice.

3200
02:05:11,900 --> 02:05:13,780
I think there's green ingredients you could put in.

3201
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:15,260
I think they experimented with it, but, and then I think they

3202
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:16,600
experiment with dying the eggs.

3203
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:19,180
It is just like, it is green sponges.

3204
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,320
It looks so fucking horrible.

3205
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:21,620
Cause it's like McDonald's eggs.

3206
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:22,580
It's like the bed.

3207
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,880
That's why you put them on a muffin or a croissant, which.

3208
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:25,420
That's good.

3209
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:26,660
That would dress it up.

3210
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:27,360
That'd be something.

3211
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:28,420
A green egg croissant, which.

3212
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,340
And they always put ham on those anyway.

3213
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:30,740
Huh?

3214
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:31,460
That's delicious.

3215
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:35,220
So I, yeah, so, but it should be the better egg for McDonald's.

3216
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:36,360
It should be the McMuffin egg.

3217
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:39,300
The point of the muffin or the croissant is to disguise the poor

3218
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:41,060
quality of the eggs and it works.

3219
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:41,680
That's true.

3220
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:43,580
Everybody wins.

3221
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:48,420
So, but I think you can plus up the, I feel like this land, this whole

3222
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:51,520
land should be a lot cooler, a lot wilder.

3223
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:55,780
The food should be like a kid's dream of like those crazy milkshakes

3224
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:57,600
now with a cake coming out of it.

3225
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:57,880
Oh right.

3226
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:01,860
Like Goofy's kitchen status where it's like mac and cheese on a pizza.

3227
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:03,820
Peanut butter and jelly pizza.

3228
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:04,920
They should be.

3229
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:09,180
Do you know that they have a, like a fancy cotton candy place now?

3230
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:10,480
Yeah, I saw that.

3231
02:06:10,820 --> 02:06:11,320
Honk honkers.

3232
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:13,760
Cotton candy with like toppings.

3233
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:17,400
It's like multi-layered and yeah, and you put marshmallows in them.

3234
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,540
But they don't advertise that.

3235
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:19,800
They should be selling that.

3236
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:20,320
I didn't even know that was a thing.

3237
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,880
I could see that being really good with like Japanese guests.

3238
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:25,760
Cause they love like Instagrammable desserts.

3239
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:28,540
Oh, and like sort of bizarrely indulgent.

3240
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:31,560
Like I know that's like a thing in Tokyo is like a famous shop that

3241
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:33,700
makes massive rainbow cotton candy.

3242
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,460
So yeah, there you go.

3243
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:35,840
Yeah.

3244
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:38,700
Uh, but you think they should advertise that like on your TV,

3245
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:40,480
like during basketball games.

3246
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:42,900
No, no.

3247
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:47,080
I mean like, but like, like Dole Whip has like, Oh, such a following.

3248
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:48,920
Like there should be crazy foods.

3249
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:49,820
A doctor's suit.

3250
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:52,360
Where it looks cool and be like, it was weird dessert.

3251
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,100
There is a fun fact about the land.

3252
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:56,180
There's like no straight lines in the land.

3253
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,520
Everything is curved.

3254
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:59,040
Uh, yeah.

3255
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:03,620
And, and, uh, uh, but like, see a door and it's straight.

3256
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:05,000
There's lines.

3257
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:05,720
All right.

3258
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,420
But then they'll do like trapezoid doors.

3259
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:11,380
If it's like Tim Town, I haven't scrutinized Seuss Landing, but it's

3260
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:13,140
like, you know, they'll stay whimsical.

3261
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:15,120
They did a good job.

3262
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:16,560
I'm not besmirching the workers.

3263
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,160
Stop besmirching Seuss Landing.

3264
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:19,440
The makers of Seuss Landing.

3265
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:23,700
Anyway, so there's a lot I like about the, there's a lot and, and, you know,

3266
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:28,560
yeah, I think the ride is ambitious, but I think it's, it's coming up on 20 years.

3267
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:32,000
And I think yeah, like 1999 was opening.

3268
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:33,380
I'm even more impressed now.

3269
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:36,520
How many years you've missed this ride existing?

3270
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,280
Better than the show, the voyage of the little mermaid?

3271
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:39,140
No, no, no, no.

3272
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:39,540
The ride.

3273
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:40,980
Oh, are you not into the little mermaid ride?

3274
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,260
There's a little stiff.

3275
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:46,880
Ursula looks good, but I think everything else that it could be better is all I'm

3276
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:47,100
saying.

3277
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:52,380
Uh, well, if you get, I'll give a little plug to, uh, Doug Barnes over at the

3278
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:55,360
Season Pass there, they did a special episode with Tony Baxter where he talks

3279
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,180
about his original vision for that ride.

3280
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:58,620
I've seen the video from the DVD.

3281
02:07:59,220 --> 02:07:59,540
And it's cooler.

3282
02:07:59,540 --> 02:08:01,380
Where you go under the sea and there's the ships.

3283
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:02,460
Oh, the special feature.

3284
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:03,480
Yeah, that does look like a better thing.

3285
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,780
And you were like kind of floating in the middle of the ride.

3286
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:07,140
Tony Baxter has such good ideas though.

3287
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:10,660
Didn't he invent that Mary Poppins idea when he was like in high school?

3288
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:10,940
Yeah.

3289
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:11,580
That's one of the things.

3290
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:14,520
Where it's like you're on a carousel and then they peel off and you go, it was

3291
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:14,840
amazing.

3292
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:15,840
There's a video on YouTube.

3293
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:16,380
It's really great.

3294
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:22,080
Um, and we avoid talking, we're now, uh, three hours and 45 minutes in the first

3295
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:23,140
Tony Baxter reference.

3296
02:08:23,420 --> 02:08:27,120
I was hoping there was a Baxter anecdote from Disneyland or something from me.

3297
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:28,120
No, I've never met him.

3298
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:32,420
If I could meet any Imagineer, I'd pick Tony Baxter.

3299
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:33,760
He's so cool.

3300
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:39,060
Uh, so yeah, so, so quickly sum up, uh, uh, so we, uh, we don't go to the fourth

3301
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,300
hour.

3302
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:43,520
Uh, um, I just think, as I said before, I want that spinning back.

3303
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:45,020
I don't like the idea that spinning is gone.

3304
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,240
I thought that was so much fun.

3305
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:48,120
I think you got to close off the top.

3306
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:51,320
I think you got to make me really feel like I'm inside this nightmare house.

3307
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:56,080
And then my last suggestion is add that song from Seussical because I want some

3308
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,640
value, some Christian values.

3309
02:08:57,980 --> 02:08:59,860
The one pro life song.

3310
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:00,940
That's a horrible song.

3311
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,300
You can't put that in Cat in the Hat.

3312
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:02,700
Okay.

3313
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:03,040
All right.

3314
02:09:03,180 --> 02:09:05,220
Well then, but I had some of the

3315
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:07,320
Cat in the Hat had a song in Seussical.

3316
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,300
I can't bring it to mine, but it existed.

3317
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:09,680
Oh, it did.

3318
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:10,780
We'll add that song in.

3319
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:11,220
Alright.

3320
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:15,040
Seussical is sort of like an Avengers set up where they all come together.

3321
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,420
As long as it's a Christian song.

3322
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:17,760
Oh, wait.

3323
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:23,320
I know my plus up now, which is that I want the music to be the 1982 album, Cat

3324
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,600
in the Hat by a Blue-Eyed Soul singer, Bobby Caldwell.

3325
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:27,220
Oh, wow.

3326
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:31,520
Can he have a photorealistic animatronic that comes out of a door and pops up next

3327
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:31,980
Yeah.

3328
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,020
I want a really realistic Bobby Caldwell, his cool beard and cool sunglasses and

3329
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:37,560
cool hat.

3330
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:38,600
It's not stylized.

3331
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:40,140
It looks exactly like him.

3332
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:40,500
Yes.

3333
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:40,800
Yeah.

3334
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:42,800
Or just bring him around.

3335
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:47,360
He does private shows for every single ride that goes by.

3336
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:47,600
Wow.

3337
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:49,220
That's my personal plus it up.

3338
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:52,360
I don't know if anybody else is down with that, but I'm fine with that.

3339
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:53,400
That sounds good to me.

3340
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:53,960
Hey, great.

3341
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:54,400
Alright.

3342
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:55,240
Any final thoughts?

3343
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:56,820
Jason's especially agreed.

3344
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:57,220
Hey.

3345
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:58,640
Bobby Caldwell goes in there.

3346
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,100
That's all we need to plus it up.

3347
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:01,820
I guess so with that.

3348
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:04,200
Jenny Nicholson, you've survived Podcast The Ride.

3349
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:06,080
See, we say it.

3350
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:07,000
We say it.

3351
02:10:07,160 --> 02:10:07,720
We do say it.

3352
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:08,020
It's a reference.

3353
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,020
It's a real reference.

3354
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:12,680
So we know you do a YouTube channel and we reference you.

3355
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:13,540
You do great work there.

3356
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:15,420
You just put in your name on YouTube.

3357
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:18,460
Jenny Nicholson on YouTube is my channel.

3358
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:19,600
Twitter as well.

3359
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:20,500
Twitter as well.

3360
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,020
Anything else to plug?

3361
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:22,740
No.

3362
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,220
That's fine.

3363
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:25,420
Great stuff.

3364
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:26,480
Great videos though.

3365
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:31,820
And as much as much ranting as I think is deserved about topics that should be ranted

3366
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:32,240
about.

3367
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:35,820
As much as I think a non theme parky audience will tolerate.

3368
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:42,200
We're trying to make sure there's much less and less non theme parky audience out there.

3369
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:43,420
If we all work together.

3370
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:48,160
Yeah, this will be a giant subsect of all audiences.

3371
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:55,720
And to help that endeavor, go to follow us at Podcast The Ride on Twitter and on Instagram.

3372
02:10:56,140 --> 02:10:58,880
Yeah, and rate and review us on iTunes or whatever the hell.

3373
02:10:58,980 --> 02:11:00,260
Do they call it Apple Podcasts?

3374
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:01,260
What the hell is it really called?

3375
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:02,580
It's not iTunes, right?

3376
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:04,220
Apple Podcasts?

3377
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:07,620
You can do it on iTunes or you can do it on the podcast app.

3378
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:09,400
We're on something called Art 19.

3379
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:10,040
Yeah.

3380
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:12,300
That's about as boring of a thing as I could say.

3381
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:13,360
But we're on it.

3382
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,080
Yeah, look us up and listen.

3383
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:17,100
So yeah, thanks for listening guys.

3384
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,760
And we'll see you next week.

3385
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:20,680
Bye.

3386
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,100
Bye.
