1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate, the only theme park podcast where we make our

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,640
guests demand sanctuary before they're allowed to enter the recording.

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm Jason Scharton, joined as always Scott Garner.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,560
Yeah, it seems harsh, but you know, it's sanctuary, I think from the PC police.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,760
You're feeling pursued by the PC police.

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,560
I mean, we are the modern day truth tellers, modern day philosophers, you know.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,760
Yeah, it's our role.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,680
We're not making that Netflix money, but you know, what are you going to do?

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,760
Mike Carlson also here.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm here if you would please refer to me as Judge Michael for the rest of the show, because

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,720
I am, I feel like I am the judge on the show oftentimes, but today I'd really like it officially.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,600
Hell of a character to be associated.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
What do you mean?

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,560
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,520
Fun uplifting, the fun uplifting songs of Frollo.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,560
Who says I'm not just inspired by the judges of the show Hot Bench?

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
You know, it's Hot Bench.

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,160
Hot Bench is a show where there's three judges and they make a determination based on, I

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,360
think small claims.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Most of these are small claims.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
Most of them are small claims.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,520
So yeah, I'm not, I'm not in Frollo inspired.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,960
I'm the judges of Hot Bench inspired.

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
Sure.

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,160
Oh, you never miss a Judge Gini Pirro book signing.

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,520
She's in LA.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
She's great.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Is Judge, is Judge Joe Brown still on?

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,080
Judge Joe Brown is still on, I believe.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
He's good too.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Hot Judge.

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,960
You've not done yourself with obscure references.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Hot Bench.

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Oh my God.

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,920
I mean, Judge sounds good.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
That sounds good too.

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,760
It seems sort of the bad teacher mode.

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
A hunky judge.

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,640
Oh, now we've learned.

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
This is what happens.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,640
The lights do go out.

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,800
Like, am I dumb and Hot Bench is something that people know?

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
I think so.

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,560
It's like on TV everywhere in the world.

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
All the time.

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
It's indicated and it's in the afternoon.

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,400
Mom watches Hot Bench.

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I think so.

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,880
I came upon Hot Bench a few years ago and I'm not a huge, don't get me wrong, I'm not

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,320
going to try to present myself as a huge Hot Bench fan.

52
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
I just am aware of it.

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
What is Hot Bench?

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
It's a judge show.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,920
There's three judges and they make, you know, they solve small claims.

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Like Judge Judy?

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,600
Yeah, yeah, but there's three of them.

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,160
Judge Judy is seemingly the producer and creator of Hot Bench.

59
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
She's a bad bitch.

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
She's outsourcing.

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
She's a bad bitch.

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,480
She's building an empire of bad bitches.

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,600
Judge Patricia, Judge Michael, and there is a Judge Michael.

65
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
And then Judge Tanya.

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Those are the judges on Hot Bench.

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,160
Is there a Frollo in that bunch?

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
I don't know.

69
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't think so.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,320
He's a pretty harsh judge.

71
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,640
But so anyway, no, I'm not an expert, but all the Hot Bench fans out there make your

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,880
voices heard because I do believe it's a popular show.

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Alright.

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,760
I doubt this.

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,760
That other voice you heard are guests today.

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Oh my God, we're recording.

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
That's right.

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
We are recording.

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,760
I probably like paused for the light.

80
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,000
That's the exciting world of podcasting.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
She's a singer.

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
She's my partner.

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,400
She's holding our little buddy Garfield.

84
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,520
It's Jane Clare back on the show.

85
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Hello.

86
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
Happy to be back in person.

87
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Yeah, thanks for being here.

88
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
For the first time.

89
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm in person with dog in hand.

90
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,120
That's as nice as it could be.

91
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,360
So you thought just because we were casually at medium energy or less discussing a judge

92
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,360
show that somehow this was not riveting content for this podcast.

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,160
I thought because the whole light situation, I was like, oh, they're definitely going to

94
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,640
like that might be cut.

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
That's that.

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
I don't know.

97
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
So I'll get the lights right in the garage.

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,160
I think we'll we'll like judges.

99
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,160
We will determine we will review the evidence.

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,560
What is compelling content?

101
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,440
Are the lights flickering in the garage?

102
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,760
Compelling content as compelling as learning about Judge Tanya Acker and then and then the

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,760
three judges, meaning Jason Scott and I, who are kind of like the hot bench judges.

104
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Oh, yes.

105
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Same amount.

106
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Same amount.

107
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,440
Hot podcast, hot podcast judges will determine.

108
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,040
And I think it's going to be my my guess is it's going to be cut.

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,040
The audience won't even know we're talking about.

110
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,240
For to have any thread of sense.

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,960
Some part of it has to be in there.

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Yeah, I guess that's true.

113
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,440
Maybe now we're editing magic and then look, we're good.

114
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
We'll dry.

115
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,080
We have to drive eventually to the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

116
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm like afraid to talk.

117
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
I don't know what to do.

118
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Eventually.

119
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
This is a reality.

120
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
It's all in.

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
It's all in.

122
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Keeping it in.

123
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,520
Let's get let's let's cut to the chase.

124
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
You're here.

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
You're back.

126
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
We're excited to have you.

127
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,920
And you're and you're here to talk about a show that you were fond of.

128
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,840
I don't remember if this came up when you joined us before over Zoom.

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
I think it did.

130
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,680
It must have come up then.

131
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,880
We planted the seeds for this Hunchback of Notre Dame live show from Disney MGM Studios.

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,480
What can you tell us about this, about finding this, about your your fondness for this?

133
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Yeah.

134
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,240
So this show I didn't realize, but it had such an impact on my life.

135
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,200
That might sound silly, but let me give a little context.

136
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,640
So that show opened in 1996, the same day, things like June 21st, same day that the show

137
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,000
that the animated movie came out.

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,600
It was like a dual thing.

139
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,240
And I had just moved to Orlando.

140
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
I was four.

141
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,080
So I was little and we got passes to Disney World and we would go like every weekend.

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
And I lived there until about 2000.

143
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,440
So like almost the entire run of the show closed in 2002.

144
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,160
So like almost every weekend as like a four to like 10 year old, I was seeing this and

145
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,280
like it still makes me cry.

146
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,760
It is the most beautiful theme park show I have ever seen.

147
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,640
And like the way it blew my mind and like rewatching it brought back like all these

148
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,560
kind of like, oh my God, I forgot how that affected me in this way and this way.

149
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
And so it really, I hold it in a really special part of my heart.

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,240
I think it's not something talked about a lot because it was Jason was saying like it's

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
a little out of the way.

152
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,600
Well, yeah, I was out of the way.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,880
When we first started dating, I saw that you had the notebook.

154
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Yeah, the candy.

155
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Not the notebook.

156
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,480
The candy is marketing moves.

157
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,080
The VHS clamshell notebooks.

158
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
You had the hunchback.

159
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
I have the hunchback one.

160
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Yeah.

161
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,640
And I joked that like, oh, that was kind of like the history years that I kind of like

162
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,080
blanked out on like Pocahontas and hunchback.

163
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,000
I mean, I saw them and they were hits.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sort of.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,840
They're not Little Mermaid.

166
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
They're not.

167
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,640
It's an Alan Menken music.

168
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Steven Schwartz lyrics like Power Team.

169
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,440
But you remember Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast.

170
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,040
I think that was kind of bigger.

171
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,800
And yeah, hunchback is pretty dark.

172
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,440
But I think that's why I love it.

173
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,120
I remember it coming out.

174
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,960
I remember like having some Happy Meal toys from it.

175
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,840
It was just like it just came after the Golden Age of Animation.

176
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,000
And then Hercules and Mulan hooked my attention more because there was a lot more fighting

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,160
in them.

178
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
And I was a boy.

179
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,640
I was a young boy.

180
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,360
Like swords and swords.

181
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah.

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,880
And Pocahontas and hunchback a little more complicated.

183
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:00,800
I had a fifth grade history teacher who was so mad at the historical revisionism of Pocahontas.

184
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,960
Any chance she had to rant about Pocahontas.

185
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,280
I mean, it is pretty messed up.

186
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,600
It's pretty weird that like, yeah, the real Pocahontas was like 12 years old when the

187
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
events happened.

188
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Yeah, the love story they created is kind of sus.

189
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Because that was a little weird.

190
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
It's probably important to tell the kids that that might not be accurate.

191
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,840
Well, speaking of things that need to be covered before we get into it.

192
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,360
Now, Hunchback is it is on Disney Plus as is Hunchback 2, which I didn't didn't know

193
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
that existed.

194
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,600
Oh, I hold that thought.

195
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,480
I have a feeling.

196
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,200
Most of what I have is about Hunchback 2.

197
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
But we'll deal with that later.

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,840
Yes, that's fine.

199
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
Yeah, I did watch it today.

200
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,960
And I think it is on the right side of history, but it is complicated.

201
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,240
I mean, it is a lot about like prejudice turning you into a monster and accepting people who

202
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
are different.

203
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,680
But you wanted to clear some stuff up.

204
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,320
I want to clear some stuff up.

205
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
OK.

206
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,040
Also, I could talk for like hours about just the musicals.

207
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,360
So like, I just want to like every little thing.

208
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm like, oh, and this means this.

209
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
And it's so like, yeah, yeah.

210
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,040
I don't want to talk too much, but I really could talk about it forever.

211
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,520
So there is a certain word that they use.

212
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,960
And it's from the movie.

213
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,140
And that doesn't make it right.

214
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,480
But that's why it's in the stage show that they refer to Esmeralda as, you know, a word

215
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,880
that wouldn't be as PC today.

216
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,160
So like, we'll get that out of the way.

217
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,840
We won't say it, but it's there.

218
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,320
And then used a lot in the movie.

219
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,600
Use a lot of movies like a character description from 1830.

220
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
She describes herself as one.

221
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,480
So like, OK, there we go.

222
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
We got it out of the way.

223
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,880
And then also in the show, during the topsy turvy scene, there is like a moment where

224
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,600
a woman is in like a big fat suit and that's supposed to be like goofy and funny.

225
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,120
And that's also not OK.

226
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,040
I don't know if you all even noticed that.

227
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,840
But there was like, like, it's VHS.

228
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
There's a lot going on.

229
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
Oh, no, I meant the live show.

230
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I guess I'm talking about the live show.

231
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,040
No, no, you're like watching a copy of it.

232
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,600
You're just like, yeah, there's a lot going on in that show.

233
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,360
There's not like a pro shot version of this so much.

234
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,080
So yeah, I'm certainly missing things.

235
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,880
Some are like they move around with each character and some are like wide on YouTube.

236
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I feel that.

237
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,440
Right. Yeah.

238
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,280
But yeah, but I mean, it's all 25 years.

239
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,080
I mean, stuff has changed a lot in 25 years.

240
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,560
Yeah, I just wanted to get that out of the way so I can talk about how much I love it,

241
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,080
even though there's some problematic stuff, people don't like come for me.

242
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,240
Yeah, sure.

243
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,000
No, you're not endorsing the kind of more like antiquated language used.

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,520
No, no, no, no. You're not endorsing throwing a baby in a well,

245
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,880
which almost does to his punishment.

246
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,640
Yeah, that is it is the the criticisms of the movie at the time I looked up

247
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,600
were very interesting because it was all it's too dark for children.

248
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,000
Evangelicals thought it was anti-Christian

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,160
because Frollo behaves like them.

250
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
What were the other complaints?

251
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,240
Oh, the one of the biggest, this is so odd, Demi Moore voices Esmeralda.

252
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,280
And they were so mad because she had just done strip tease.

253
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,440
And now she's doing a Disney movie.

254
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,080
Oh, that's another thing we should cover.

255
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,840
There's a lot of white women playing Esmeralda.

256
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
Oh, OK, I can't say that. I'm so worried.

257
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,320
I'm going to say the word that you told me.

258
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,560
She is she is she is not a white character.

259
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
Yes. So like got to get that out of the way now, too.

260
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,400
I just want to cover bases.

261
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,880
Or sing these things.

262
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,280
This is what was going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,120
You're there. You're endorsing Topsy Turvy.

264
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,280
And OK, yeah, I'm endorsing the whole show.

265
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah. You know where to start.

266
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,520
Um, was it was this also am I reading into your

267
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,760
like early love of this show as being like you're probably not

268
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
watching a ton of you're not like on Broadway every weekend.

269
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,960
You're not. This is probably like you falling in love with theater

270
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,080
and live performance.

271
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,320
Million percent.

272
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,080
Like this, Jason said imprinted on me.

273
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,000
I think that's the best way to say it, because I mean, this show has

274
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,040
this show has everything.

275
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,760
Literally, though, there's like combat, there's dancing.

276
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,040
There's like amazing singing.

277
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
There's puppetry.

278
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,680
There's like heavy storytelling.

279
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,840
There's like empathy.

280
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,600
There's like people dancing their ass off and then like belting their ass off

281
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
and like just like interaction in the audience and like the props that they like.

282
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
And as I like a four or five year old, I am looking at this

283
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,880
and fully like finishing the picture in my head.

284
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,040
So it's like this whole world that I'm in.

285
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,920
And like the way they utilize the stairs for different things,

286
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,000
like in my mind, I could switch with them that they were no longer here,

287
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,160
even though it's the same prop.

288
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,680
Like it was just so magical.

289
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,160
And so like I understood it and could really just go there and like.

290
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah. Well, it's OK.

291
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,880
So it's it's teaching you about like the suspension of disbelief.

292
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,320
Yeah. And a theatrical experience, because this more like any live show

293
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,360
has that we're like we're representing this environment minimally

294
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,600
or like or sort of abstractly.

295
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
But this one, especially because it sort of uses

296
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,040
I'm going to miss.

297
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,760
I don't know about these comedienne del arte type.

298
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
This just came up recently.

299
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,720
I don't know the right thing. But you know what I mean?

300
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Like the whole thing, there's moments of it that are presented

301
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,480
as a troupe of players telling the story and puppets.

302
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,800
It's not so much that you're fully transported to the to the world of Paris

303
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
at this time, like it's all theatrical.

304
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,720
Yeah, 100 percent.

305
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,000
And and I think that it's cool that they do that, because it's also like

306
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,640
within the show, it's a storytelling, but then the whole thing is a storytelling.

307
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,200
You know what I mean for the audience? Right. Right.

308
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,080
And yeah, it's yeah, there's a lot of great theatrical.

309
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,320
I mean, in terms of like this stuff we really like, I was very impressed

310
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,560
of like, oh, they spend some money on that.

311
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Like this is like a fully staged.

312
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,000
This is an elaborate set. The costumes are so good.

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,560
Detailed costumes, like the full performers singing acrobatics,

314
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,760
pyro, just just all the stuff, all the like commitment level stuff

315
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,040
we like to say it to see.

316
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,120
It's also very much a product of its time where they had so much confidence

317
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,360
in the animated studio.

318
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,080
They're like, this opens the day of the movie.

319
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,400
We're not nowadays.

320
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
You got to wait and see how the movie goes.

321
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,520
And then maybe something will slowly show up in the park,

322
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,160
although they're getting the Marvel stuff in like as stuff.

323
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,840
Yeah, but that's a little easier.

324
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,200
And then you can pretty much count on that stuff being successful.

325
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,160
Yes. For the most part, this is like they had their footing with a couple movies.

326
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,280
And now it caught up to like, OK, so we need things instantly

327
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,240
because this is going to be beloved by all children and part guests everywhere.

328
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,680
Yeah. In this case, maybe not so much.

329
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,400
Not everybody grabbed on to hunchback.

330
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,200
Not the way it is one of the first where that was not happening

331
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,120
as much. Not immediately, but on a 70 million dollar budget,

332
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,440
it made 350 plus million.

333
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,680
So it's insane to call that a bomb, I guess.

334
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,040
It's certainly not a bomb.

335
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,920
Yeah. From what I saw and I was surprised, apparently Hercules

336
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,880
was when the box office downturn started on these movies.

337
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,800
Ah, what did it make a profit, you know, or did it just kind of it was like

338
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,840
was I feel like I remember it just like kind of even like not bad.

339
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,080
Did OK. I forget.

340
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,200
But that that was another one where they got it in a parade

341
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,680
very quickly, like maybe opening summer.

342
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,720
I was like, parade.

343
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,560
I remember Hercules victory parade. Sure.

344
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,280
They also I know were mainly covering the Disney MGM Studios version,

345
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,440
but I recall the the Disneyland version, the festival.

346
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,840
Yeah. Yeah. Which was like also the like an insane scale,

347
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,720
this massive and also sort of creative in its staging, where it was more

348
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,920
outdoor theater in the round.

349
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,680
It felt like a Ren fair kind of event.

350
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,280
And I hadn't really watched it until today.

351
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,880
I don't think I saw it in person when it was happening.

352
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,280
But like Quasimodo does stunts a guy in a suit with the limited

353
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,560
visibility of the face and and then the hunchback.

354
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,000
You have a hunchback on top of you and said you're the guys

355
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,640
swinging down ropes and climbing everywhere.

356
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,880
You could climb on this thing.

357
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,760
I was pretty blown away by the scale.

358
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,800
He does not also sing because he's a face.

359
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,080
He's not a face character.

360
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,120
He's a man. I don't really know that show as well.

361
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,240
In the this is a big difference between the two.

362
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,640
And I was curious in the in the Disneyland one.

363
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,040
It's like it's more of the mascot style.

364
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,880
So you're not seeing the performers face.

365
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,800
Thus the big ballad Up There is sung.

366
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,840
Out there. Oh, my God.

367
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,800
How did you say? I'm sorry.

368
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Out there.

369
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,520
Up there. Oh, come on.

370
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,920
There. No, this is why you're here to correct this.

371
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,520
I just watched it, too.

372
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,080
And I still made that mistake.

373
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,760
But that song is so epic.

374
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,920
I really am worried I'm going to get a song wrong now.

375
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,440
Don't fuck up, Michael.

376
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,480
This is the Bible. These songs.

377
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
You better not.

378
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,680
This is the one thing I actually am really like not protective of,

379
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,280
but like a little bit like it's just like in your.

380
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Oh, read me out if you need to.

381
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Great.

382
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
No, feel free to yell at me.

383
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,120
Share Mike apart, damn it.

384
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,160
Give Jason a break.

385
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
This was.

386
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,240
No, I'm just kidding.

387
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,480
Well, no, I one of the reasons this came up again

388
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,480
was at some point during the pandemic,

389
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,160
I think it was after you had been on the show

390
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,840
and this came up in conversation and that you you love the show.

391
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,560
I know we'll have to have you back. Talk about this show.

392
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,960
Some some click baby blog

393
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,080
describe something the Walt Disney Company was doing was like devious,

394
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,960
like something evil done by Hades himself or Judge Frollo.

395
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,280
And I was like, who the fuck is that?

396
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,960
Like I was like, what is this reference?

397
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,600
I was like, I didn't even know the character.

398
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
I couldn't remember.

399
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,040
You remember Judge Frollo?

400
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,960
I didn't know the name off the top of my head.

401
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,000
I was like, who is Judge Frollo?

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,400
Jane, did you break a glass in your hand?

403
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,360
She was a little.

404
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,040
I don't remember. I mean, it's pandemic.

405
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,080
I remember half that shit.

406
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,680
What did you say?

407
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,320
Who is Judge Frollo?

408
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,360
I do get mad sometimes when he tosses stuff out like musical terms

409
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,400
and or like like reference something like, how dare you?

410
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
That's a this musical and this is this and open here.

411
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,320
Like, how dare you shit on that? Like, yes, because most of the musicals

412
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,320
I like were like, I don't know, before the war century old.

413
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
Yeah, I'm more like contemporary.

414
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,320
Is there the word review in the title?

415
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,880
Yes. And there might be a year. There might be.

416
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,280
I yeah, I was watch.

417
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,120
I was recently watching H.M.

418
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,560
Maxis the three that's that's entertainment series,

419
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,040
which is just a clip show movies of the old MGM movie.

420
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,800
Yeah, they put those in theaters.

421
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,320
It just be like, here's all the here's all the famous musical sequences

422
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,000
from a bunch of musicals.

423
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,520
You go to the theater to see.

424
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,440
Can you imagine to go into the theater to see a clip show now?

425
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,480
An irate 1979 Frank Sinatra already looks like a mummy,

426
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,320
like and he seems to be so annoyed that he has to do this to introduce these.

427
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,720
He only hosts it really?

428
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Well, it's like him and then Elizabeth Taylor and then Fred Astaire.

429
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,800
Like it's like remember the good old times we had.

430
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,640
Yeah. Years ago.

431
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Not that long ago.

432
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,720
It's not that long ago, but some of those early ones when they're figuring it out,

433
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,600
I can't I can't endorse like a Mountie.

434
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,560
Like it was like a guy in a Mountie outfit and then a woman.

435
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,160
And they were just like making eye contact for like two minutes singing at each other.

436
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,920
And I was like, this is not a movie.

437
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,760
This is not very this may as well be a photograph.

438
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,320
I wonder what that one is.

439
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,280
I don't know offhand. What's the scary Mountie musical?

440
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,880
It's very it's very bizarre.

441
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,280
So so I like a little after that and a little before like Stephen Schwartz's time.

442
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,960
But I can't you can't argue with Stephen Schwartz on his own.

443
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,120
And did Godspell and Pippen and Wicked.

444
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,280
And so with Alan Menken, like I was who did this.

445
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Yes. OK. Yeah.

446
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,520
Schwartz and Menken. OK.

447
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
Yeah. He did like the lyrics, right?

448
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,400
I guess.

449
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Schwartz did the lyrics, Menken did the lyrics and rewatching it.

450
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,200
I was like, wow, these songs are very good and they are very musical theater.

451
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,080
I can see how you eventually would jump into that.

452
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,200
Maybe more so than some of the other ones.

453
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,280
Yeah. Yeah.

454
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,040
Yeah. And I mean,

455
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,360
I think too, I mean, I was raised like cult Catholic, like really,

456
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,120
really traumatizingly bad.

457
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,160
And so I think there was a little bit of like familiarity with it

458
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,360
and also how Esmeralda like really fought against it and like

459
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,560
how Quasimodo kind of showed like empathy and kind of like those bad people.

460
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,760
I think maybe I was like, oh, good, I'm not alone.

461
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,920
Like, but yeah, I don't know.

462
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,040
And that a church could be fun.

463
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,160
A place where you swing around on ropes.

464
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,080
We'll get there one day.

465
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,120
Now the rafters of the actual building, not the masses aren't fun.

466
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,640
I'm saying like he swings around up top.

467
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,800
Yeah, he's like he's spider man.

468
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,400
He's the Spider Man of the church.

469
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,080
I think that's the movie.

470
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Oh, Jesus.

471
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,880
Spider Man of the Church.

472
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh, my God.

473
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,160
You know, that's not an improvement.

474
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,440
No, because I don't.

475
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm not really I don't really.

476
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
You weren't a big Spider Man fan.

477
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,480
You know, can we talk about the Spider Man thing?

478
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,000
Well, I yeah, I kept getting him Spider Man stuff like for his birthday and stuff.

479
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,640
And he was like, OK, well, by the way, who told you that Spider Man is my favorite?

480
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,200
I was like, you did. You always say Spider Man is your best friend.

481
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,440
He's like, I say he's a friend.

482
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
He's a friend. And I'm like, what do you know?

483
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,520
He's like, well, Marvel is like their mic.

484
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,560
I know the X-Men are X-Men are my family and Spider Man's more like

485
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,680
so Mike feels an attachment to Optimus Prime.

486
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, so what you're saying, I'm not even sure even you are calling Optimus Prime

487
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,120
your family or friends. No, no, I wasn't.

488
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,720
And I have if there's he's more of just like a cold, distant father figure.

489
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,240
Like a mentor figure.

490
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,760
Well, now you're back in family territory.

491
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,400
Yeah. You're like a professor.

492
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,240
Yeah, that's what I merely mean by him.

493
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,480
I don't think of him as my friend, Jason.

494
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,320
So wait, wait, hold on.

495
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,120
The movie is short of it.

496
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
Mike's not crazy. He doesn't.

497
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,240
He thinks of Optimus Prime as a father figure, not his actual father.

498
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,320
Now on to Jason's thing.

499
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
No, I'm crazy. Family.

500
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,000
Let's get back to me.

501
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,960
I know. I'm just about to.

502
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,120
I'm just trying to figure out exactly who Jason in the Marvel

503
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,720
universe considers his family and friends.

504
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,960
That's what I'm trying to get back to.

505
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,800
Yeah, I think Spider Man, I'm always concerned about him.

506
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,520
Like a right like like you're worried about your friend in the Marvel universe.

507
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,840
My eyes are glazing over anything about Marvel.

508
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,200
And I'm just like, how do you think I feel half these episodes?

509
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,120
We can have a side.

510
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,760
That's a little break. We'll do our own.

511
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
Let's split. Let's get a splitter. Yeah.

512
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,200
We'll record our own.

513
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,560
Well, for me, it's my best friend's Gambit.

514
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,320
I probably you know what?

515
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,280
It might be him too.

516
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,360
Oh, my God. You guys have the same best friend.

517
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,400
Maybe Cable.

518
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,320
Are you going to fight over him?

519
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,400
Cable's like the friend.

520
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,600
Are you guys going to fight over your best friend?

521
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,760
Is this going to happen?

522
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,400
Oh, my God.

523
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,080
Gambit showed up in both.

524
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,320
What's that paper thing that goes back and forth?

525
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,280
The shoes. No, no, no.

526
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,400
The little thing you do with your.

527
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
No. Good guess, though.

528
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
The little thing that goes.

529
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,760
The little thing in your hands.

530
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
Were you a fortune teller?

531
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

532
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,200
Yes, that Gambit was in.

533
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,520
They they both got Gambit when they did that.

534
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,240
Maybe Cable.

535
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,760
Cable is a very funny one.

536
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,680
Cable had a lot of guns and.

537
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,560
You showed me that Jubilee box of that toy and she was cool looking.

538
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,800
Oh, yeah. Jubilee is cool.

539
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,480
She's like, yeah, she's like a cool teen.

540
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,960
Yeah, because over the weekend, I dropped what I was doing

541
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,120
because Mike let me know that these action figures were on sale.

542
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,880
We're ready for preorder.

543
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,240
The X-Men 92 ones.

544
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,680
And I I usually am pretty I'm pretty picky with what I bought.

545
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,920
But I dropped what I was doing to.

546
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040
You see Garfield's face.

547
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,880
Oh, yeah, yeah. Do you want to take a photo?

548
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,080
Oh, sure. His tongue is full.

549
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,160
But if I get too loud, he looks up at me like, how dare you?

550
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,440
OK, well, when he goes back to the other.

551
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
Yeah, when he goes back.

552
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,760
So so Jason finally had to tell you Spider-Man is not my best friend.

553
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,440
Well, I felt like shit because I went and like got him this really cool.

554
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,880
No, no, this was like an amazing gift.

555
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,040
It was more like you don't realize how much you talk about Spider-Man.

556
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,880
Yeah, like I full stop thought that was your dude.

557
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,200
And I was like, cool, I'm going to get this shit going.

558
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
Like this guy's it.

559
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,920
And I go like balls to the wall.

560
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,120
And he's like, so who told him like, oh, fuck.

561
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,120
Like, well, you got me the Spider-Man comic that came out

562
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
the month I was born.

563
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,760
That's very thoughtful.

564
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,320
Yeah, which we did.

565
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,000
We then we also did look up the X-Men issue,

566
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,240
which is a beautifully painted cover, but it does say life death on the cover.

567
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,360
And that's half right.

568
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,160
So it was a little grimmer.

569
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,320
And the Spider-Man cover was more fun and dynamic.

570
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,120
So it was the right choice anyway.

571
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,160
OK, back to Hunchback.

572
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,640
Back to Hunchback.

573
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
Spider-Man, the Spider-Man of the church.

574
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,120
Spider-Man of the church.

575
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,240
Well, well, this is something I was saying long ago about the in the

576
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,240
in the Disneyland version, he's like it's the character head

577
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,440
and you don't see the face.

578
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,720
It's not he's not two random guys sing out there.

579
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,360
There we go.

580
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,320
You got it.

581
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
Next to him, it's a strange arrangement.

582
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,200
And in this version, the Florida version, it is a guy.

583
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,480
It's a guy with like not such crazy prosthetics.

584
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,280
Wait, no, I got to say, because sorry, I'm sorry.

585
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,480
I cut people off and I'm trying to.

586
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
No, no, no, no.

587
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,480
I was watching this again.

588
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,560
I watched this like maybe 10 times since we talked about

589
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,960
we were going to do it this week, like literally on repeat.

590
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,920
And since I performed in theme park before, I was like, oh, my fucking God.

591
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,640
Like these people had the hardest tracks in this show,

592
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,040
like in a theater that isn't fully enclosed.

593
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,360
So it's hot as hell, human as hell.

594
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,800
And they have multiple layers on.

595
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,880
And then they're also like, OK, Quasimodo, he has it's covering

596
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,960
like his nose and like the top of his eyes.

597
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,040
And he also has like a hunchback on.

598
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,840
He has to walk a certain way and character.

599
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,000
At one point, he lifts up as Merelda.

600
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He does like stunt shit kind of.

601
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,560
And he's belting like out there, which has one of the highest notes

602
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,880
in the bridge for like a male musical theater guy.

603
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,920
I see your eyes glazing over.

604
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,080
No, no, I'm thinking about him singing.

605
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,760
The word is I'd treasure.

606
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm contemplating if I could hit it.

607
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
You guys are changing the key, but yeah, you guys are so good.

608
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
You're so good.

609
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
We have a piano note to help us out.

610
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
If this was Spider-Man, Try the Dark, I could sing these songs.

611
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,880
Oh, yeah, of course.

612
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,600
This is different.

613
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,560
It's like two last minutes.

614
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,000
Blake, who falls from the sky.

615
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,800
I don't want to get you off your track, Jane, but let me.

616
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,680
But I have something applicable to say, which is this.

617
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,000
Disney did do a live version, a theatrical version outside of the theme parks

618
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,560
in theaters of Hunchback and Nunchuk.

619
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,920
I don't think it made it to Broadway.

620
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,880
They did limited runs in test market.

621
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,360
They did it at the La Jolla Playhouse.

622
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,800
It was at La Jolla for a while.

623
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,600
And yeah, it seemed like pretty popular, like one of a bunch of awards looked like in San Diego.

624
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,800
And I'm like, who is in it?

625
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,640
I wonder if I'd recognize a name and the only name I would care about in Broadway world was on it.

626
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,720
Patrick Page, the Green Goblin himself played Frollo.

627
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,680
Yeah, he did.

628
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,400
Legend.

629
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:34,900
Yeah.

630
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,880
He did a good job.

631
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm a freaky little judge.

632
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,520
I'm just a little judge.

633
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm a bad little judge.

634
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,120
He's the man, yeah.

635
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,280
Yeah, and then in the original movie, it's, what is it, Tony Jay?

636
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,000
Is that right?

637
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,800
He's Frollo.

638
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,040
Right.

639
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,540
Yeah.

640
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh, that's who Patrick Page was.

641
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah.

642
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,720
Oh, wow.

643
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,680
That's very funny.

644
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,480
Yeah, I think you pointed that out to me once, Jason, actually.

645
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
You were like, could we, like years ago.

646
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,520
Well, we looked, I think, was he in Hades?

647
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,520
He was in like, yeah, he was in a big hit.

648
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,480
He's been in so much stuff recently and he's done a lot.

649
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
Yeah, this movie, the movie is interesting because

650
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,000
Demi Moore is the speaking voice of Esmeralda.

651
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,440
She doesn't sing the song.

652
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,040
And then Kevin Klein is the voice of Phoebus.

653
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,680
Phoebus.

654
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,180
Phoebus.

655
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,720
But he doesn't really sing that character.

656
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:32,800
No.

657
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,680
He's like, actor.

658
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,960
Yeah, he doesn't sing.

659
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,760
And then besides Jason Alexander, who is great, who does Broadway and film and TV,

660
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,400
it's a lot of theater people in the movie.

661
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,080
So it's a very Broadway heavy kind of ensemble.

662
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,640
And Tony Jay was like in the Royal Shakespeare Company.

663
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,160
And then what's the name of the guy that's escaped me now who voices Quasimodo?

664
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,680
I know his last name is Hulch.

665
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Oh, it's Tom.

666
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,520
Tom Hulch?

667
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:57,840
Yeah.

668
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,160
Is it?

669
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,320
Okay.

670
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,920
Amadeus fame.

671
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,600
Oh, yes.

672
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,240
Over my head.

673
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,720
But yes.

674
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,880
Yeah, he's Mozart.

675
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,320
He and I was watching like a behind the scenes like documentary type thing about the movie

676
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,320
and they kind of he helped like inspire Quasimodo a little bit because the animators would put down

677
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,360
their rough sketches of things and then have actors come in and not look at the actor,

678
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
but like look at the animations.

679
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,200
And as soon as they heard his voice, they were like, holy crap, like this guy's Quasimodo.

680
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,960
We're going for this.

681
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,040
And I think he's like such a beautiful singer and such a beautiful voice actor.

682
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,120
I mean, Quasimodo here, I'm going to make a really bold statement.

683
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,880
Quasimodo, big dick energy, huge fucking horse cock energy, because here's why.

684
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,600
Here's my yeah, I said a horse cock.

685
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,560
Never been on the show before.

686
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,840
I don't think that phrase second gate, baby, getting fucking wild.

687
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,080
We edited out the part where Mike was blown out of his chair down the block.

688
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,120
Is that bothering you, Michael?

689
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,160
Yeah, that's fine.

690
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,880
I said the is the steam coming out of your ears?

691
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,200
I mean, let's go ahead.

692
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
You can't see it because the Cardi B song.

693
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,000
The dirty Cardi B song.

694
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,760
I said the title of it once.

695
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,720
Oh, my gosh.

696
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,840
The radio safe version, which is worse.

697
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,400
Yeah, it is worse.

698
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,480
So big dick energy.

699
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,360
Here's why.

700
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
So Quasimodo, right?

701
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,000
He meets Esmeralda and is kind of like, holy shit, this girl's awesome, right?

702
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
Kind of falls for her.

703
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,880
And then she's like, hey, I kind of fell for this guy.

704
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,840
Also, he's injured.

705
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,720
Can you help?

706
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,880
And Quasimodo takes one second to do a little Heaven's Light reprise,

707
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,240
which also is an amazing song.

708
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,720
Heaven's Light.

709
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,760
We have to talk about that.

710
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:46,400
But so then he helps her and him kind of takes a second about it

711
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,880
and then goes and puts their hands together and is like, you know what?

712
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,320
You two belong together.

713
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,120
I'm going to be good.

714
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,440
He gets through it.

715
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
He's such a fucking man.

716
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Really, he's such a man.

717
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,400
He does the right thing.

718
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,360
He's empathetic.

719
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I know what you're thinking over there.

720
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,280
He's also not needy.

721
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,760
He's not needy.

722
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,960
Which is how it's very attractive.

723
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,560
He's grateful.

724
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,520
You say, yeah, you know what?

725
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,720
Yeah, that guy is good for you.

726
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,520
Go for it.

727
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,480
Yeah, he's fucking rad.

728
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,040
I'm not worried.

729
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,800
He's not jealous and he helps the guy not die.

730
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,320
He's a G.

731
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,680
I said to Jason, I was like, did this shape the kind of...

732
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,200
I've always really been into very emotional and very empathetic guys.

733
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
And I was like, well, I don't want to say I'm into you

734
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
because you look good in the laundry bag.

735
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,840
Because you're an ugly dude.

736
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,440
Because you look like shit, man.

737
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,800
I was like, am I a Spirelda and you're quasi?

738
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,400
And then he was like, it doesn't really bode well for us.

739
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,760
And I'm like, well, that's not really what I mean.

740
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,320
But empathy is the one word to describe that character

741
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,040
and really sweet and really gentle.

742
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,640
And I've always been attracted to...

743
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,880
What is that stern look?

744
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,440
I was just thinking about how a doctor once told me that,

745
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,640
well, posture is very important.

746
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
If people don't watch their posture,

747
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,880
they end up with hunchbacks when they're old.

748
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,680
They walk with a hunch.

749
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,840
I manifested this.

750
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,240
Jason, do you recall the doctor at an early age telling you

751
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,640
that you might grow up to have big dick energy?

752
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,520
Jason has big dick energy.

753
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,240
Can I say that?

754
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,120
Jason has big dick energy.

755
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,920
Yeah, all the things you said, it doesn't...

756
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,360
I'm glad you said it because I think it.

757
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
And I don't have the courage to say it.

758
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,720
You're that dead.

759
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,520
Top of the world.

760
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,440
Yeah, no, Jason, very empathetic.

761
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,280
He plays it cool.

762
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,280
All that's what I'm...

763
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,480
I don't know if he plays it cool.

764
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
That's what we saw all the time too.

765
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,320
I don't know if this is too personal,

766
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,440
but our first date, we always talk about our hands.

767
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,320
Remember? Can we say that?

768
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,200
I was at two.

769
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,160
No, yeah, you can say that.

770
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,800
So on our first date, there was a moment where I got a little

771
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,600
anxious because I have a slew of mental health problems,

772
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,440
but I got really anxious.

773
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,120
And at one point he was like, hey, hey, it's okay.

774
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,000
And he put his hand on mine.

775
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,440
And from that moment, I was like, oh my God, this guy is different.

776
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,280
He's so nice.

777
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,760
And I always think of that because sometimes we'll be talking like,

778
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
remember our first date and you play your hand on mine?

779
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,560
You've always been so comforting and like, I don't know.

780
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,040
Thank you.

781
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,000
I love you.

782
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,520
That's nice, you guys.

783
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,600
So he's got all of it, is what you're saying.

784
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,480
But much cuter.

785
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,760
Thank you.

786
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,880
You're as handsome as Phoebus himself.

787
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,120
Jason is the looks of Phoebus with the dick of Quasimodo.

788
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,160
That's what we're trying to say here.

789
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,840
I scared Garfield.

790
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,720
I scared Garfield.

791
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Garfield is not wild about this.

792
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,520
Laughs or laughs.

793
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,040
If Jason even coughs a little.

794
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,600
Yeah, Garfield.

795
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,720
But I can cough as much as I want.

796
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,200
Yeah.

797
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,040
If Jason has a big cough energy.

798
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,760
A big cough energy.

799
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,160
Well, he does have a big cough energy.

800
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,120
He has a big, deep cough.

801
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
He scares the bejesus out of Garfield.

802
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,520
It scares me too.

803
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,400
It scares Mike.

804
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,840
Everyone in my family has it.

805
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,720
And also like I have an allergy, reoccurring nasal drip.

806
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,000
And so it hasn't been too bad lately, but yeah, Garfield hates it.

807
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,920
He will either run to the other side of the room or he will come and check on me.

808
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,080
And he's helping by walking all over my chest.

809
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,520
He'll stand on his chest or go like make sure he's okay.

810
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,480
Stare at him.

811
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,240
Just like stare at him in the face.

812
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,120
If you're like sitting down.

813
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,320
Or just mad dog me a little.

814
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,680
He loves you.

815
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,480
He loves his daddy.

816
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Is he, would you say that he's anything like

817
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,000
the jolly, the goat?

818
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, I was gonna just say he's like, he's like Esmeralda's got, well, yes.

819
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,840
And we're, or maybe we are the gargoyles.

820
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,480
Yes!

821
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,600
Oh my god.

822
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,720
Who encourage Jason to go get out there.

823
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,560
This is not true because there was no scenario where like he was watching you from.

824
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,000
Right, doesn't that one to one?

825
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

826
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,280
No, no, no.

827
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,160
We never had a scenario like go get him big guy.

828
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,280
Yeah, you can do it.

829
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,200
But then they get him all psyched up and then he doesn't even get the girl.

830
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,120
And I think that's kind of mean of them.

831
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,480
They're like, hey, she loves you.

832
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
And he's like, no, she doesn't.

833
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,080
The gargoyles as a kid, I recall, and don't be mad at me.

834
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
I don't think I loved the gargoyles as a kid.

835
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,640
And I love the side characters on every movie.

836
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,760
They were always my favorite.

837
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,360
And I think these might've been the first side characters that like let me down.

838
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,120
I agree with that actually.

839
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,440
I do.

840
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:25,840
What do you mean?

841
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,200
The lovable buddies are the stone gargoyles that are out there.

842
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,200
And is a stretch on their like, you know, you got to get cute buddies in there somewhere.

843
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
Who is this going to be?

844
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,320
And then it's in question whether other people can see them or not.

845
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,280
I was just going to say it's a thing that he used as like an adaptability because he

846
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,000
stuck up there alone.

847
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,680
So it's all kind of in his head.

848
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,080
But the goat sees them at one point.

849
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,040
Animals are crazy.

850
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,480
They can see shit all the time.

851
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,960
They know.

852
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,640
Animals.

853
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,840
They say stuff.

854
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,560
Yeah, animals in general.

855
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
Ghosts and such.

856
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,360
But I think that's interesting.

857
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
I think that's also kind of a dark thing.

858
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,000
That's a mental thing.

859
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,760
He helped himself.

860
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,800
He must have just developed because he's like an adult.

861
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,840
He's been in there for like decades.

862
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,200
That poor guy, man.

863
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,440
Yeah, there's a Ninja Turtles mini series, spoiler alert, where all of them are dead

864
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,560
except for Michelangelo.

865
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,280
And the brothers are just like hanging out with him in his mind.

866
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,360
It's really depressing.

867
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,840
Jesus.

868
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,480
Really dark.

869
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,640
It's called The Last Ronin.

870
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,040
Here's something I learned about the gargoyles.

871
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,240
They are voiced by these musical theater actors.

872
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,960
Jason Alexander, you know the other names are probably Morse, if you're a theater person.

873
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,800
I remember not knowing who they were.

874
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,120
They just weren't mainstream celebrities.

875
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,440
But you know who always wanted to get mainstream celebrities into these films?

876
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,960
Jeffrey Katzenberg.

877
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,160
He knows the formula.

878
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,080
He knows if there's a celebrity anywhere near this thing, millions of people will flock to it always.

879
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,120
Guaranteed.

880
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,080
No matter what.

881
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,520
So he's like, we got three fun gargoyle characters.

882
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,560
We got to stack the decks.

883
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,440
We got to get the funniest nuts out there in the world of comedy.

884
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:19,040
And his idea, his pitch of who the gargoyles would be were Letterman, Arsenio, and you know what's coming.

885
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,880
Jay Leno.

886
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,800
Oh my gosh.

887
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,680
You imagine.

888
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,240
I would have.

889
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,720
If that had happened, I would have just said to you, those were my favorite characters in any Disney movie of all time.

890
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,960
You know what I always say all the times that the gargoyles are the best characters ever, ever in any.

891
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,960
The alternate timeline.

892
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,600
This is an episode just called The Gargoyles from Hunchback.

893
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,560
There's a parallel universe where that happened, like for sure.

894
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,440
Yes, I believe that.

895
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,840
Yes.

896
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:56,880
Well, they're also considered naming the gargoyles Chaney, Lawton and Quinn after Lon Chaney, Charles Lawton and Anthony Quinn, who had played Quasimodo previously.

897
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,160
And they were concerned.

898
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,520
Disney Legal was concerned they would get sued by the estates.

899
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,440
I had to wait.

900
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,480
That was the problem.

901
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,080
Not that like all children would blink their eyes audibly at this threat.

902
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,560
Lawton.

903
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,120
Mommy, can I have a Lawton doll?

904
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,600
Please give me a little children.

905
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,920
Little children chuckling at the references in the theater.

906
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,560
Like a little smart smarty pants child, like chuckling like a clever reference.

907
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,600
Little de font Leroy child.

908
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
He knows who Lawton is.

909
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,800
That's what Jason did when he was a little kid.

910
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
I wouldn't know anything about this.

911
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,640
Little Lord, if we had a big lolly and that like the bloomers or whatever in the hat.

912
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,280
A lot of pearls.

913
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,040
Red sheets, like big red sheets.

914
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,240
Very apple cheeked.

915
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,080
In 1930 when he was going to the movies.

916
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

917
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,440
Well, and to okay, I'll say something like nice about the gargoyles in the movie.

918
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,120
I forget her name, but the female character one, that was her last thing ever.

919
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,720
She was like an old actress who had done a bunch of stuff and that was her last ever

920
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,040
role.

921
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,320
And I think that's that's nice.

922
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,760
And I do like that they have a female one because she's really funny.

923
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,520
Like she's kind of like this rough around the edges kind of funny older.

924
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,800
Yeah, she's got like a lean stretch type energy to her.

925
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,640
Yeah, she's fun.

926
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,120
I agree.

927
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,680
She is fun.

928
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,120
Yeah, no, I think that's very funny.

929
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,240
I think I like the gargoyles maybe more now than the costumes are cool in the show.

930
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,560
I think that is a really cool.

931
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,960
Yes, the represent because they have some weird stuff to represent throughout this show.

932
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,360
Yeah.

933
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,640
And to like make the make them move.

934
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,560
You do it's awkward move in the movie.

935
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,040
It's awkward.

936
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,720
They have to hop around everywhere.

937
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,720
But yeah, that that was a successful element of the show for sure.

938
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
The goat is a marionette.

939
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,480
The goat?

940
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:38,980
Yeah.

941
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,420
Uh, make them like them on and everything, baby.

942
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,100
I'm really gassing you up this episode.

943
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,300
Thank you so much, dear.

944
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,420
It makes up for the hundreds of others.

945
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,300
Anyway, there's a little goat puppet.

946
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,220
It's the worst represent or they they they did have to make some cuts.

947
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,980
I mean, this is a long show for theme park.

948
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,820
It's about 30 minutes long.

949
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,020
It's a long 30, 30, 30 minutes because there's a did you guys see it?

950
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,820
Sorry, I cut you off.

951
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,220
God damn.

952
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,740
I'm really gonna say I mean, watching the movie, they got a lot of the hellfire brimstone stuff,

953
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,700
which is, you know, you're at 90 degree Florida heat.

954
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,180
Maybe you don't want to hear about sin so much.

955
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,020
So it kind of makes sense why they would have.

956
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,820
But I feel like the horse isn't super rep.

957
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,380
You you said you were scared of the one about the horse.

958
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,060
So horse comes out at some point.

959
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,980
First of all, the puppetry at the beginning is so cool because it leads right up to the

960
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,300
actual actor characters entrances because like the quasi moto puppet,

961
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,220
they have go up stage left to the stairs and right when it gets to the top and disappears,

962
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,900
the real actor comes out and I was like, damn, that's cool.

963
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:50,100
So they also have a puppet of Frollo on the horse and then it comes out in real life.

964
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,980
That horse, I would like nearly piss myself when that shit came out because it's like

965
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,060
rushes to the end of the stage and almost looks like it's going to go like over the stage and

966
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,380
it kind of goes back and I'm still trying to figure out.

967
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,020
I think there's like a person under there and then I was like, is it Frollo?

968
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,660
But then he gets off the horse right after.

969
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,260
So it's not anyway, that horse scared the shit out of me, man.

970
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,780
One character is riding another essentially like, yeah, how do they do it?

971
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,100
Is it like a classic horse costume with two people?

972
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,740
No, no, it's like it's like it has wheels.

973
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,060
Right.

974
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,620
Oh, so I think it's a puppetry up through the head and there's like a person in it

975
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,580
because you see the feet.

976
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:25,940
Right.

977
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,340
It's cool.

978
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,860
Like it looks cool.

979
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,220
It's scary as hell.

980
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,300
It might be, yeah, it would be like an interesting design.

981
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,660
Like if you take off the skin of the horse, you'd be like, oh, I see that.

982
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,740
As a kid, it was like so big and scary and came so close to you.

983
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,940
I'm like, yeah.

984
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:40,820
Yeah.

985
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,060
Yeah.

986
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,300
You're not scared of this thing more in general.

987
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Like you were just like, ah, the magic.

988
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,140
No, I was scared of everything.

989
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,380
Okay.

990
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,020
Okay.

991
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,340
Still kind of scared of everything.

992
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,580
Yes, you don't use similar to Scott.

993
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:58,340
Scott, you of course don't like big things and small spaces and Jane is very similar

994
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,140
or like big.

995
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,900
You don't like big things above me.

996
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,780
Above me.

997
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,100
We went on the Jurassic World ride after that.

998
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,740
Jesus Christ.

999
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,500
The upgrade at Universal Hollywood.

1000
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:06,900
Hell no.

1001
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,860
You barely made it through.

1002
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,180
Yeah.

1003
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,140
You know, I was like, you didn't have to do this for my account.

1004
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,020
It was like we were just, you had visited me at Potter and watched one of my shows

1005
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,580
or some shit, right?

1006
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,300
Yes.

1007
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
And then after we were like, no, I was like, yeah, no, I can ride it.

1008
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,100
And we were in like the calm part and you were like, Jesus.

1009
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,820
And I'm like, because I also have some mechanophobia.

1010
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,420
Have you guys learned about submechanophobia?

1011
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:26,820
No.

1012
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,340
There's this video that I've not been unwilling to watch it.

1013
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,300
I don't want to know about.

1014
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,820
Do we have the same shit, man?

1015
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,380
Similar.

1016
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,020
So submechanophobia is the fear of like a mechanic thing or something underwater.

1017
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:45,300
So like the Jaws shark or the Jurassic Park when you're going through the world,

1018
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,020
whatever the fuck.

1019
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,900
If you're going through the normal part and there's like the ones in the water,

1020
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,220
I started like freaking out and he was like, this is like the calm part.

1021
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,420
I was like, I know, but they're underwater.

1022
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,700
It's freaking me the fuck out.

1023
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,860
Like, what is the ride's a recipe of all that's all these things.

1024
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,340
I fully had like a mild panic attack, but I was like, it's cool.

1025
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,700
What is the actual fear?

1026
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,580
Is it that it's just going to do something or is it just literally there?

1027
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,620
Because it's like this creepy.

1028
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,220
It's going to emerge from that.

1029
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,460
It's there and like being underwater is such a like mysterious thing.

1030
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,660
And it's just like a weird thing.

1031
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,100
But yeah, I don't know what it's called, but I have a fear of things hanging over me.

1032
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,900
Like if you remember World of Disney and Disney World before they like changed it,

1033
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,220
how it held is hanging like the cats and guys.

1034
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,260
Well, I remember there was a John Smith sitting in a chair and it was huge.

1035
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,460
And one time when I was younger, my siblings were assholes.

1036
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,380
They are going to get in trouble.

1037
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,180
Are they going to jail?

1038
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,180
Oh, no, no, no, I don't talk to them.

1039
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,820
Stop me, please.

1040
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,980
What is the story?

1041
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,780
What were you building?

1042
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,420
They were like, hey, come over here.

1043
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,300
And I was like, what?

1044
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,420
And they were like, look up.

1045
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,500
And I was like, oh, my God, I was right under it.

1046
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,700
And they knew I was scared.

1047
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,060
Like that shit scars me.

1048
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,660
I hate big things hanging over me.

1049
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,500
Like Secret Life pets, that the big the big brown dog.

1050
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,660
We went on that ride and I was like, oh, my God, don't get me off of this.

1051
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,060
He's on a girder at some point right above you.

1052
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,140
I was literally like, this is awful.

1053
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,460
And I'm there going like, haha, I know.

1054
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,260
What's that?

1055
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:16,580
Can I?

1056
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,580
I hate to bring up the go back to the bad memory.

1057
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,500
But was John Smith sitting in what kind of was he just sitting in a chair?

1058
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,620
Yeah, it was like he was like sitting in.

1059
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,140
They were you guys.

1060
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,740
You need to show pictures of this.

1061
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,700
There was a carpet with Aladdin and Jasmine.

1062
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,380
That makes sense to me that they would be flying.

1063
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,580
But why is John Smith?

1064
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,060
Did he have the same like was he laughing like a Mary Poppins?

1065
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,380
He was just in a fucking chair, man.

1066
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,500
Why are you going hard on this?

1067
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,220
I'm just curious.

1068
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,460
I'm just curious because I want to know about the chair.

1069
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,300
As well as he was floating, why would he be floated?

1070
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,500
The carpet makes perfect sense.

1071
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,940
I was just trying to figure out if that was just.

1072
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,500
Why is he up there?

1073
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,020
Did every character up there?

1074
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,740
So it didn't the carpet just happened to work better.

1075
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,860
OK, so that just was an example.

1076
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,620
Maybe that was the only one that actually made sense.

1077
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,700
I think it's maybe the spirit of nature.

1078
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,500
Like he was blessed by Grandmother Willow and it gave him the ability to fly into the rafters

1079
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,140
of the store.

1080
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,500
Does that work?

1081
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,060
He could.

1082
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,620
Yeah, it does work.

1083
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,060
I mean, OK, he can fly in the store.

1084
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,700
Got it.

1085
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,540
He has powers to fly in the store because of the special flying grand.

1086
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,060
OK, Grandmother Willow herself.

1087
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,100
But only in the chair.

1088
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,460
Only in the chair and only in the chair in Orlando.

1089
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:19,700
Right.

1090
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,020
Yeah.

1091
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,340
Yeah.

1092
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,300
Not in Anaheim.

1093
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,380
Not in like mood shadows in Malibu.

1094
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,420
He was not blessed.

1095
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,860
They could not float in the chair there.

1096
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,260
Got it.

1097
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,140
OK, I'm comfortable now.

1098
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:28,740
OK, good.

1099
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,300
I'm really glad.

1100
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,580
We know the why of this.

1101
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,220
Well, what's some other stuff about the show or the adaptation of the show?

1102
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,220
Like are there songs we've missed or they're like big staging?

1103
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,780
I mean, just the massive bell.

1104
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,500
We got a big bell.

1105
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,580
You got a big, big cauldron.

1106
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,940
You got a bit like that.

1107
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,660
Like, yes.

1108
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,300
Yeah.

1109
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,300
Dump a bunch of fireworks on the.

1110
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,900
He throws like a wooden beam.

1111
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,700
I mean, it's not wood, but he's like sanctuary.

1112
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,060
That was exciting.

1113
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,020
Like throwing the beam.

1114
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,060
Bictic energy.

1115
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,900
And then they pick up the beam and use it as a battering ram.

1116
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,380
Like it's.

1117
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,740
Also, and I was going to say, man, like the choreography of having to do that and go

1118
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,980
upstairs and running and like using this.

1119
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,180
Like if you just watch one track of that show, it's wild.

1120
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:12,740
Like.

1121
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:12,980
Yeah.

1122
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,580
What does track mean?

1123
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,900
Yeah.

1124
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,580
So like in Beetlejuice, I was the Fantasia track.

1125
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,620
So like the Esmeralda track or the it means like the role in the show.

1126
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,260
So like the chorus, it could be like, oh, I'm doing like sometimes like, oh, chorus

1127
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,740
three track, which is different than the chorus five track.

1128
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,180
It's just like which role you're doing.

1129
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:34,740
They just call it.

1130
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,620
You have to be at every point because it might be other role.

1131
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,020
Maybe for a second you play this character and then you change it.

1132
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,860
Yeah, well, because the the like ensemble, I think really have they all have hard jobs.

1133
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,860
The show looks I mean, to me, it looked really hard.

1134
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,460
But the ensemble really does carry a lot of it because they're in it from beginning to end.

1135
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,380
They are props sometimes they are like atmosphere sometimes they're dancing.

1136
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:06,020
They're like doing the puppetry like they do so much just to keep the show like alive.

1137
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,700
So I got to give a shout out to those people because damn they worked their ass off.

1138
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,500
Yeah. And there's not really a lot of moments where they get off stage.

1139
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,540
They're on the whole time.

1140
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,540
Catch a breath, have a drink of water.

1141
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,060
There's not a lot of that.

1142
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,060
I in the gig.

1143
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:19,540
Let's be honest.

1144
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:19,780
Yeah.

1145
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,860
Frollo gets a lot of time to rest.

1146
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:28,500
I was impressed because it's in the movie and they they replicate it almost exactly in the show.

1147
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:36,260
In the topsy turvy day number, the person does a handstand and the different costume falls over them.

1148
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:41,540
That's very easy to do in animation seemingly, but they did it with a practical costume and I

1149
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,980
thought that was very impressive.

1150
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,100
I loved that as a kid.

1151
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,860
So it's like his bottom part of the costume.

1152
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,900
He's got like a upside down head hanging from between his legs.

1153
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,140
And then there's a full skirt over it.

1154
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,980
So then when he goes and does the handstand, the skirt falls and it looks like his legs are the arms

1155
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,380
and then the head and then the skirt.

1156
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:01,620
Wow.

1157
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,660
It's cool as hell.

1158
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,380
That's very clever.

1159
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,460
It's like those Katy Perry quick changes.

1160
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:05,860
Oh yeah.

1161
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,620
She saw the show too and it really inspired her.

1162
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,340
I could see that.

1163
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:10,980
That would add up.

1164
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,980
That would be hard to believe.

1165
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:19,460
One of my favorite discoveries about the song topsy turvy day is that he explicitly says

1166
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,580
topsy turvy day.

1167
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,020
It's topsy turvy day.

1168
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,220
January 6th.

1169
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:23,860
January 6th.

1170
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,700
Topsy turvy day.

1171
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,020
What?

1172
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,900
I looked that up too.

1173
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,220
Yeah.

1174
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,100
I'm like wait, I'm sorry.

1175
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,140
Is that in the movie or in this performance?

1176
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,220
He says on the 6th of January.

1177
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,100
Join the Bones.

1178
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,060
Topsy turvy day.

1179
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,180
Join the Bones and Thieves and Strumpets streaming in from charters to callous.

1180
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,700
Scurvy names are extra scurvy on the 6th of January.

1181
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:44,900
Whoa.

1182
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,300
So it was topsy turvy day at the US Capitol.

1183
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,020
Why a goat man can be the speaker of the house.

1184
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,500
That's right.

1185
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah.

1186
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,940
Why a wall that usually isn't smeared with shit is smeared with shit.

1187
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,580
Everything is topsy turvy day.

1188
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,860
It's the day we crown the QAnon Shaman.

1189
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:08,900
Lord.

1190
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,460
I was in the car listening to the soundtrack today and it went by and I went what?

1191
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,020
I go I got to like we wanted to pull over and like rewind it and then I did.

1192
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,260
Yeah.

1193
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,980
Looked it up.

1194
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,380
Geez.

1195
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,860
I also that one I was like this is pretty close to a different topsy.

1196
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,460
One of my favorite topsy's.

1197
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:32,740
I almost said the top of the show said it's topsy turvy day which is different the turning turtle.

1198
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:32,980
Right.

1199
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,140
Everyone please make sure you know the difference.

1200
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,860
Topsy turvy is not turning turtle.

1201
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,580
I just want to make sure everyone knows that from Mary Poppins 2.

1202
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,300
How do you feel about the topsy runner?

1203
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,140
If you're ranking your favorite runners from the show where is the topsy runner?

1204
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,820
It's in my top three and I don't think I even bring up as much as I want to.

1205
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,340
Topsy's come up I think four times in this show.

1206
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,500
Meryl Streep's character from Mary Poppins 2.

1207
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,620
You pull your topsy.

1208
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,900
That's not Stephen Schwartz.

1209
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,940
That's Mark Shaman.

1210
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,860
I don't know I didn't see that one.

1211
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,100
That's not Stephen Schwartz.

1212
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,600
Yeah.

1213
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,020
Turning turtle.

1214
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:08,740
Don't encourage.

1215
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,460
Turning turtle which is different than turtle turtle.

1216
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,420
Yes of course.

1217
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,460
At the turtle club.

1218
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:14,580
Thank you.

1219
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,460
Did you know when you were coming on how many connections would come back to this show?

1220
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,860
I mean late night in the 90s ninja turtles.

1221
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,380
I thought you were going to say turtle references.

1222
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,580
Turtles.

1223
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,140
Oh yeah.

1224
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,860
We all know that when they filmed the turtle club scene they had to give a speech and address

1225
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,260
a recent topsy turvy day.

1226
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,540
Well I saw an article going around that.

1227
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,540
I'm gonna make like champ gestures.

1228
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,500
Yeah I did it.

1229
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,060
That's one of my favorite things by the way.

1230
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,500
When people do that and they put their hands together and like do like the celebrations.

1231
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,140
Do the celebrations.

1232
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,020
That's so funny to me anytime I see that for some reason.

1233
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,860
Well I feel like Phoebus.

1234
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,820
I feel as victorious as Phoebus himself.

1235
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,320
Phoebus.

1236
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,660
I mean he kind of does nothing.

1237
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,500
Phoebus has been Phoebus energy.

1238
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,540
Oh yeah I think he has small dick energy personally because.

1239
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,260
I feel small dick energy but big Phoebus energy.

1240
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:06,900
Yeah exactly.

1241
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,780
Big Phoebus energy.

1242
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,540
Who has bigger Phoebus energy than Phoebus.

1243
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,180
Exactly yeah because he's kind of douchey.

1244
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,620
He's kind of douchey to Esmeralda and I'm kind of pissed she falls for him actually

1245
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,540
because uh anyway wait hold on can I say one more thing about Esmeralda?

1246
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:19,940
Sure.

1247
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,900
Yes I have to.

1248
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,660
Every woman who played that role I just have to be like you are a Wonder Woman because

1249
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:32,820
that bitch comes out she dances does the fucking splits she swings around like a stripper pole.

1250
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:39,300
She does like that acrobatics she's like doing all that shit and then that bitch sings um

1251
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,940
god help the outcasts she runs down that fucking runway when she belts that note and I'm like

1252
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:54,340
yes like queen and she has to do that and be a dancer and do this and like that's hard to find.

1253
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,660
Sure.

1254
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:59,700
And is the right character type like I was just like damn these women are insane like they are

1255
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,340
so good just want to shout out to Esmeralda.

1256
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,140
You want to be these you're out there like you this is planning the like I want to perform in

1257
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,260
this kind of setting.

1258
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:12,660
Exactly after we watched this show I would go around I don't know if you remember on like a

1259
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:17,060
Sunset Boulevard in MGM I call it MGM and like there were by the bathrooms there was like this

1260
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:22,180
little kind of platform thing I would always go up there and I was like five six and start singing

1261
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,780
and dancing and people would come over and clap like I was like yeah this is like what I do right

1262
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:31,140
like even though my family oppressed it until I was uh I guess still kind of uh

1263
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,940
sorry mom if you're listening this I love you very very dearly um.

Very curious how you figured out how to listen to this but okay.

00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,300
Mom and grandma oh shit your G's.

1268
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,100
Grandma is not hearing this.

1269
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:55,460
I mean fist bump hit my glasses but mom and grandma you the OG's everybody else.

1270
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,260
Well the jury's out who's the jury's out.

1271
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,860
The judges will decide.

1272
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:06,500
Frodo will decide who is an outcast of your family.

1273
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,960
Me.

1274
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,260
God help you then.

1275
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:15,300
This is all sinking into your child Ray meanwhile I'm on the other side of MGM studios just like

1276
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,340
wow Casablanca I'll have to rent that from video update when I get back to pencil.

1277
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,140
Like all the golden age of Hollywood stuff stuck with me and some of the movie musical stuff I mean

1278
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,780
all the Gene Kelly singing in the rain stuff.

1279
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,740
Well it's interesting I mean we're.

1280
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,500
I know that you brought.

1281
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,820
Of course yeah BuzzFeed Berkeley yeah.

1282
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:40,900
Yeah well I didn't see that I didn't see those until a few years ago a lot of the BuzzFeed

1283
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,100
Berkeley stuff but some of them are on hvm acts now.

1284
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,600
Sure.

1285
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,360
They got bub bub Z.

1286
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,300
Bugsy.

1287
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,200
BuzzFeed is not topsy.

1288
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,760
BuzzFeed is not topsy.

1289
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,880
Uh yeah this is like because because we had the first those the little mermaid beauty and the

1290
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,560
beast Aladdin lion king was my time to perform them in the living room these songs.

1291
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,120
Nice.

1292
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,760
So now I was and there's video of it there's video of me there's video you know what the

1293
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,560
best video we have is actually me doing the whole Muppet movie.

1294
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,840
Wow.

1295
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,920
Just me so I mean with the record playing but I'm just standing there with the microphone doing

1296
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,320
the song.

1297
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,600
Grabbing your junk.

1298
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,720
I was not grabbing my junk in this video I don't think maybe just a little bit but not not like

1299
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,600
I was in the other video.

1300
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,000
You felt safe you weren't experiencing fear.

1301
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,760
Yeah this was just my grandmother's living room.

1302
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,080
Yeah.

1303
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,720
So yeah but.

1304
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,360
That's sweet.

1305
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,520
In front of you can't do it in front of your grandma.

1306
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,600
No and I knew yeah I knew that too I knew I couldn't be lewd in front of my grandmother.

1307
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:44,040
Uh so yeah so these Pocahontas and then this and then the others yeah they they weren't

1308
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,760
I was I was I turned self-conscious then for these and then they just didn't they

1309
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,920
ended up not resonating as much so it is interesting to go back and listen to

1310
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,640
Hercules and Pocahontas and this to go home this is a good song.

1311
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,520
The music is just so good and they get the best like singers like Judy Coon sang for

1312
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,800
Pocahontas and she's like a Broadway like legend I mean.

1313
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:11,720
The Pocahontas songs resonate with I just remember that they have more of a sense memory

1314
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,640
for me they're more of like these songs I kind of have forgotten more and I think it's just

1315
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,200
because the movie I was like so I was probably scared of it I wasn't like scared but like I

1316
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,240
was just like ah it seems unpleasant to me when I watched it as a kid.

1317
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:32,840
I think you're it is not crazy to as a child watch the song Hellfire and want to get it out

1318
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,440
of your brain as quickly as possible.

1319
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:41,560
Can we talk about Hellfire just yeah of course sadly not included in the no they cut it but

1320
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:48,440
that shit is crazy so basically Frollo's like I'm horny she must die and he literally says in the

1321
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:59,320
song it's not my fault and like she'll be mine or she will burn so it's fucking wild also like very

1322
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,040
familiar to what I grew up being told like so I think that's like I don't know I just scary

1323
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:09,560
Catholicism if you do anything as a woman you're really bad you should feel very guilty just from

1324
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:18,120
birth you suck you can't do anything Frollo is a terrifying character like they have set him he is

1325
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:23,880
essentially committing genocide for years for decades he says like in the movie and then this

1326
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:34,360
Hellfire song is like yeah it opens like that I mean it's good it's good but it's terrible but

1327
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:40,440
it's beautiful but heaven's light though that's kept in the show I cry like I will cry right

1328
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,760
now thinking about it it's so beautiful he's just like longing for this thing and like love

1329
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:54,760
oh I don't want to talk about it okay I'll cry um oh I was just gonna say with any of these um like

1330
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:01,560
Disney 35 45 minute versions of these shows which they really started what was the first was the

1331
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,400
Beauty and the Beast the first one that was kind of around for a while I think it was because like

1332
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,240
they because they then this is sort of became a template for the shows because obviously Aladdin

1333
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:14,440
they did forever and they're doing one of the Frollo's gone closed it yeah uh hope maybe come

1334
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,240
back I don't know but uh it's almost like sometimes when I'm watching these and over the years watching

1335
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:25,480
them they would be from the movie so you would take it for granted like the production of them

1336
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:31,160
if that makes sense in the sense that it's they're so strict to the actual movie as like when I was

1337
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,600
watching them as a kid or even now you just kind of go oh yeah it's like an abridged version of

1338
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,800
the movie not even actually appreciating the production aspects of it as much at least that's

1339
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,560
when I was younger when I didn't have a podcast to think about this type of thing you go oh yeah

1340
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,720
yeah it's like being the beast we saw that okay I've seen that in the movie okay I get that yeah

1341
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:53,240
but to adapt it to adapt it is like a got a major pain in the ass and then to also like

1342
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,480
truncate it has to be a pain in the ass too how do you do it all and give everybody all the stuff

1343
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:04,680
they want from the movie yeah they love so I'm saying I appreciate all of these versions a

1344
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,480
little more because it's got to be kind of hard to do all of it harder than I would even imagine

1345
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,760
well and what's interesting too is because they dropped on the same day that means they were in

1346
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,200
rehearsals and learning music that wasn't even out to the public yet unless they released the

1347
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,520
album before the movie I don't know that but they would usually a little a little early I think you

1348
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,400
know what I mean like they're learning about these characters in this story that isn't even out yet

1349
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,880
so from like a performer perspective I mean that would be really cool like this isn't even out yet

1350
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,880
and I'm gonna be this character like that's pretty epic like you're playing them alongside them that's

1351
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:41,480
cool yeah yeah well go ahead no no no um one more thing that Esmeralda is like she's awesome um

1352
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:48,040
the the singing voice of Esmeralda in the movie is the only job this girl ever did and she like

1353
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,800
fell to the face of the earth I guess they found her like singing somewhere in LA when they're

1354
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,960
making the movie and they were like do you want to do this she sings it very like soft and tenderly

1355
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,360
and doesn't really belt it and then the stage show it is like balls to the wall she is belting to

1356
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,560
Jesus she is like here is my high note hire me right now and I'm so glad they did that because

1357
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:10,120
it is just so much better but as a little factoid that girl like sang the song and then was just like

1358
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:17,480
bye really wow huh seems really good it's so weird right she's such an iconic song that everybody

1359
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:23,320

1361
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,280
for a second moment but I do want to make you aware if you weren't already of something that

1362
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,480
happened alongside of the release of the film which was the release of the McDonald's McChicken

1363
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:49,400
Cordon Bleu meal um the uh you know you got quasi cups and there's Phoebus on there if I want Phoebus

00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:58,120
on my fries and you got uh this this item is a McChicken sandwich with ham with like a thin slice

1366
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:13,160

1367
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,120
oh yeah wait wait never mind don't do it later do it after uh you got ham you got gar

1368
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:26,840
yeah you know all right ham lettuce tomato garlic cheese yeah of course yeah explain no further

1369
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:34,600
McDonald's in 1996 I'm sure yeah and pull off a delicate flavor combo and smoky bacon

1370
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:43,400
flavored sauce not bacon itself likely on itself brought to our local rest stop

1371
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,480
they hired they hired flavors from around the world from around the horn every there was uh

1372
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:55,720
every McDonald's they hired a french chef to sit in the kitchen and cook these yeah that's how

1373
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,520
they did it and then they had to pay the rat on top of his head and there was tope to pull his

1374
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,640
hair and control him they didn't have to pay him they didn't know he was under there oh okay

1375
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:09,560
they had to put up with it they had to hide him yeah yeah yeah inspectors came smoky bacon flavored

1376
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:15,800
this is a bizarre I just like this aesthetic on cups and this weird like cross I but I don't

1377
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,840
Jane are you excited but like were you would you have been at McDonald's at this time and like yeah

1378
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,440
hell of a chicken cordon bleu um I was a little fat kid I remember like getting an order of like

1379
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,640
two big macs and two extra large fries one time and then like vomiting it up so I don't know

1380
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,560
that would quite be my thing I remember like characters being on cups and stuff

1381
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,720
yeah I think I still wouldn't be I mean I was again I was like four when this came out so I

1382
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:44,680
maybe was a little right that might be too early as far as they're not eating a ton of chicken cordon

1383
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:51,400
bleu I've had some good chicken cordon bleu I've had some bad chicken cordon bleu in my time

1384
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,640
you know I think they should really I think that uh uh they should make a reference to it on Rick

1385
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,600
and Morty and we can get that sandwich back oh yeah it's all in Star Wars chair like why

1386
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:05,640
was it Szechuan sauce and not McChickenCordonBleu like let's get the McChickenCordonBleu back

1387
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:12,440
this smoky bacon flavored sauce is very jealous of Szechuan sauce for its in my movie idea sauce

1388
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:20,040
story where all sauces are alive and uh and their desire like the toys is to be consumed

1389
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:26,920
and especially to be viral to go viral smoky bacon flavored at a shit year yeah yeah Szechuan

1390
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,520
people are gonna get choked up with those Steven Schwartz lyrics about the sauces

1391
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:41,480
so descriptive he fits so many adjectives in there yeah um so that's uh now look I also don't want

1392
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:49,480
to sidetrack too much but uh I look I I've been skeptical in the past of the entertainment value

1393
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,120
of this the Disney straight to video sequels I don't think I've ever had interest I'm like I

1394
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:59,880
bet that's not going to be any fun to watch uh if I could quote the tagline for first Hunchback when

1395
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:08,280
it came out uh Hunchback 2 join the party what the hell I recommend Hunchback you never you never

1396
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,240
did it despite enjoying the show I think I was like a purist like I was like the sequels suck

1397
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:20,600
like oh that you're correct that's no that's right in reality that's right in in my strange

1398
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,800
poisoned brain no I love it it's just I I recommend I recommend it to you guys I recommend it to

1399
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:32,520
everyone here's what here's the thing of well okay first of all it's a it's a smooth 60 minutes

1400
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,520
nice if you take the credits out somehow qualifies as a feature film

1401
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:41,880
despite being 60 at the directed by thank you Michael Eisner big dick energy

1402
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:55,880
I so he

1403
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:06,920
threw me so I'm flustered now uh uh Hunchback 2 it's if you if you get tired of if you get

1404
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:13,560
exhausted by animated films where that they feel like the characters have to be moving around all

1405
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:21,000
the time or like say words and then say more words without pausing arbitrarily for a while

1406
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,360
in the middle this is if you if if you want a different flavor like a smoky bacon flavor of an

1407
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:35,320
animated film I I was shocked by I like got through six minutes of it just like I want to get a get a

1408
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,560
taste of what this is like and then stop and then I was like I gotta I bet I paused and I showed a

1409
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,560
little to Erin and she's like can we I gotta go to bed can we save this for tomorrow like we made a

1410
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:50,520
point of we we watched Hunchback of Notre Dame 2 as a family it feels like it was made in like

1411
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:58,760
Croatia in 1981 by two people it's so bizarre it like could not feel lit if if you didn't know all

1412
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,320
these characters already from a real Disney movie and you just and you've never met any of them

1413
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:09,400
before you just say this is the strangest thing of ever it's like it's so bizarre and one of the

1414
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,720
weirdest things everybody's back and these are big stars Demi Moore is back yes yeah that's usually

1415
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:20,120
why I didn't like watching the sequels I genuinely didn't know that they always didn't there was

1416
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:24,520
always at least one right hold out if it wasn't quite the Robin Williams level although they

1417
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:31,800
ended up getting back for 11.3 but like it's funny but the he was right to not do it but I somehow

1418
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:36,040
I think by then they'd cracked the contract we have to get them so Kevin Klein's back Jason

1419
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:43,000
Alexander's back um there's this weird I think I've got I've had Phoebus on the brain because of this

1420
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,400
weird part where it's not the festival of fools it's a different thing there's a different festival

1421
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,680
that looks exactly the same like if you trade they just traced over the other one and that's

1422
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:59,240
some festival where everybody yells in the town square their love like you have to like you know

1423
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:06,520
so like like oh can I yell your name at the yes so it so Kevin Klein is saying how I want to see

1424
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:15,240
you standing there yelling I love my husband Phoebus what the fuck is the strangest phrase

1425
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:21,240
I've just been obsessed with the name because of that just like weird I don't know so audience

1426
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:27,080
just watch watch Hunchback 2 if it's at me on twitter if you really like like a five second

1427
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:33,240
part or just a screenshot I really recommend how you know how like there's you're in a funhouse

1428
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:39,320
mirror and you look weird and distorted but maybe there can be like a reverse of that such as when

1429
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:44,920
quasi looks at himself in a bell and then it corrects him and you look you get a sense of

1430
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:51,560
what regular quasi would look like which is still not great but he's just kind of this like okay

1431
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,200
it's like what he would look like if he got some corrective surgery

1432
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:01,560
oh I'm gonna cry like it's corrected quasi oh anyway don't change quasi your big dick energy

1433
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:06,440
just how you are did it did his dick correct it was just a bell illusion did his dick correct

1434
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:12,440
his dick sucks now

1435
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:21,320
yeah he gets perfect everywhere else but his dick that's like the trade-off that is yeah that's like

1436
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:27,400
the guy was sky couldn't be in the garage with him because of the dick is too big in a small place

1437
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,880
Michael you're really fixating on like dicks everyone's talking we're all dick crazy today

1438
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,800
all right all right fine someone open the forbidden door Michael ran right through

1439
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:54,680
hey I have permission yeah hey do it I'm all about it um also you get uh uh recently mentioned

1440
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:02,440
Michael McKeon as evil magician Sarooch I think I love it I think I like Sarooch Sarooch is great

1441
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:08,840
he's a much he's like a way muted Frollo he's like almost the same but not nearly as scary

1442
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:14,280
there's a song that's just like out there but not as good there's a song where the the uh uh the

1443
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,800
the gargoyles uh like egg him on and like hey he's great but it's not as good as the one in the if

1444
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,760
you just want like a watered down I feel like it'd be interesting for you loving the movie you might

1445
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:30,120
be furious you're you're like you're you're gonna unleash Garfield at me after you watch it you

1446
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:37,960
might be mad at you he sits and just slowly closes his eyes there's no attack in he doesn't bark or

1447
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,840
bite he just started licking like a normal dog like he'll give you kisses he started kissing

1448
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:48,680
Jason and then he started doing to me the fuck you know are you got it first yeah he fucking

1449
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:56,280
loves Jason man uh you know hey it's my my comrade you know he's the only the only guy

1451
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:07,240
like whatever really when is how long can he go without a bathroom break forever really he we

1457
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:45,800
maybe the same year at least early 2000s yeah cheap not full length feature films

1458
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,080
I think they're part and part of their I think you can't watch one without the other I say

1459
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,880
master of let's get this set up at the new Beverly they do the double features here in LA

1461
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:05,640
yeah and you know some of those you know watching two great movies in a row sounds nice but then

1462
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:11,080
you're there for a long time because great movies are long often you're out of like you would be in

1463
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:17,080
and out of master and discover master disguise plus uh hunchback too before other people were

1464
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:25,160
out of the one one movie an entire dune is passed and you've watched two quality films instead you

1465
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,440
could have a pre-show of turning turtle the scene from mary pavins too to just to get the length

1466
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:35,400
longer oh yeah like when they use the old like yeah yeah let's go out to the lobby shorts you

1469
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,080
enjoy our feature presentation can I ask a quick question this might be too personal

1470
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:54,600
we're moving to side when you decide to watch a movie how does it work is there a negotiation

1471
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:01,000
uh like because yeah I we're all guilty like with me and jace yeah yeah sorry um we're all like

1472
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,320
sometimes i'll be like i want to watch this very annoying thing and then sometimes we're pretty

1473
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:11,720
cool with each other i feel like well we early on when we were dating you you made it clear that

1474
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:17,400
you weren't like the biggest movie buff i hated watching movies it sounded like you i kind of i

1475
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,240
can't i'm better at it now you are better at it now but you had made it sound like you went on a

1476
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:27,960
lot of dates with guys who insisted you watched pulp fiction and i was like yeah i know that i

1477
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,760
have seen that i should probably not tell that story basically a guy stopped hooking up with me

1478
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,560
because i was like i don't think i like that and he just dropped my ass and i was like you

1479
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,400
weren't even that cool anyway but i was like i don't think i like this and he was like how dare

1480
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:45,720
you it's pulp fiction it's like the best and i was like bye like the fuck man yes that's very

1481
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:50,680
strange and inhuman so i don't that's crazy you do that for pulp fiction that's you you do that

1482
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:56,360
for boondock saints that's the line in the sand yeah that's the coolest yeah yeah but for like

1483
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:01,480
watching stuff so a lot of times we like test out a show or something together right and if one of

1484
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,760
us is more into it i'll go i'll watch this without you and you can kind of watch on your own is that

1485
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:10,120
cool okay yeah like we don't really have a lot of shows that we're like we must watch together

1486
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,280
the one thing we must watch together is this youtube channel called las vegas inside and out

1487
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:22,200
shout out to dale and paula mckenzie yeah this is i don't think it's ever come up this is every

1488
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:28,520
sunday morning we watch this there it's an elderly couple in las vegas who review all the casinos

1489
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:36,040
and the hotels and stuff and they like everything and a lot of their coffee is clearly coming from

1490
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,800
the casino website but they're really good sports he has like a sub character named

1491
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:44,600
durango dale that pops in and she does paula's kitchen what do you mean a sub yeah what does

1492
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,560
that mean like like a cowboy voice like and then durango dale and they'll cut to him he's like hey

1493
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:55,000
i'm durango oh wow he's got personas yeah because he kind of buries this lead i think he's like a

1494
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,080
little self-conscious about it but i think it's fascinating because he he was a vegas performer

1495
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:06,840
he was a singer he was a country music singer for years like decades as well just no just as

1496

1503
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:57,400
this is this is such a it's an old other niche it is like in the world there's the theme park

1504
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:03,320
media world that a lot of people may never know about there's also a massive world of vegas

1505
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:09,000
vegas media people reviewing slot machines like reviewing casinos reviewing slot machines there's

1506
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,480
footage on youtube of just people 30 minutes of someone playing a slot machine and it's our

1507
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:19,640
favorite thing to watch when we get balls high at night we put this shit on and we are cruising

1508
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,920
so yeah we don't watch a lot of movies but we watch a lot of uh and there's also a lot of those

1509
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:32,840
we watch reviews of slot machines yes we love that we've all watched all five seasons of riverdale

1510
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,960
yeah can i can i ask when you're reviewing a slot machine what are the things that people talk about

1511
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,440
he watches those ones more than i do i like just like the i also like to walk around once

1512
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:48,680
i i'm just if i'm doing if i'm if i'm doing like working on the computer do they review the graphics

1513
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:53,160
do they review the mechanism by which you would the big one slot as opposed to the three i think

1514
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:58,040
i'm in a three slot at one point in time there's a big trend in the graph video graphics sort of

1515
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,520
like i played a blake shelton slot machine a few years ago and they have more of like a kind of

1516
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:08,840
a mini game like sheldon or young sheldon because there is both i wouldn't i'm sure there is both

1517
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,320
yeah there is no there's big bang theory there's a big bang there's for sure young blake sheldon

1518
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,920
there's a giant dune setup there's a dune slot machine already wait is that real are you joking

1519
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,880
there's there's a big timothy chalamet uh dune slot machine right next to this is willy wonka

1520
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:30,040
machine yeah i think there because there's there's definitely sharks there's like guys who are like

1521
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,920
and this is how you bet on time and i don't really like those but like i like the videos where people

1522
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:39,160
like all right i have a hundred dollars in free play i'm gonna see how much i can win we love

1523
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,960
free play yeah you can't really walk away with free free play you can generate money that you walk

1524
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,720
away with but you can't it's credit it's credit to play so you guys glorifying gambling judge

1525
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:58,600
frollo would have his way while you fire these gamblers soon will burn we should be so lucky

1526
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,240
like sheldon's slot machines

1527
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,520
is

1528
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:27,080
we saw them at a pizza place uh yeah we were sitting next to them at picnic tables and i was

01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:54,600

1556
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:59,880
i didn't know what rocky raccoon was and now i know you didn't know we're done

1557
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,680
are you there best creature in the galaxy

1558
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:12,360
oh i'm laughing he eats them

1559
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:21,000
garfy still quiet hunchback of notredame musical at disney mgm studios what else do we have to say

1560
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,040
about this performance about this uh this production well i had a thing that i i think

1561
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,160
one of the reasons because i asked my dad i was like do you remember seeing that he's like and

1562
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:36,920
we both had the same like i think we saw that and i looked up a map from like 96 97 and it's it was

1563
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:44,520
the it was in the back lot theater um and it was kind of behind the muppets and now that area

1564
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:51,480
appears to be uh nothing on the map or at best it's like access roads show building stuff for

1565
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:57,240
uh galaxy's edge and you demolish right right yeah yeah i don't remember seeing this i was

1566
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:03,000
definitely there twice when it would have been around and i don't i unless i totally forgot i

1567
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,280
don't believe we saw 96 to 2002 i don't think we have a run not nearly as long as disneyland

1568
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:12,840
i think i think like and that was a big thunder ranch one right yeah yeah that's what it was that

1569
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:18,120
area sort of stayed but sat vacant for a long time and you'd see it from the train like that

1570
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:24,200
looks like a big exciting venue for a live show what is it not that yeah it's an empty place

1571
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:30,600
and now that is also that is part of galaxy's edge right so these hunchback spots have been

1572
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:36,120
torn down um does this make you do you think it had its time that's a big good bit's a pretty big

1573
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:42,600
run it had a really good run i think because it was a solid show i mean i was watching clips from

1574
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:49,960
when it first opened and then like 2000 2001 2002 and they had it it was like set there you go every

1575
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:55,000
show was like solid i don't know like they really figured it out and didn't have to change a lot

1576
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,360
because i think sometimes with theme park shows you start one way and there's like oh you work

1577
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:03,240
out the kinks but this show i think they like nailed it and then went until the contract was

1578
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:09,000
over with whatever disney wanted or whatever yeah probably a expensive show to operate that many

1579
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,960
like actors probably well there's special effects and there's stunt work i don't have to pay people

1580
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:19,880
for stunt work like stunts and puppets yeah i mean they're really the only thing that i could

1581
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:26,680
think to add to a show like this to plus it up would be topical references if the gargoyles

1582
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,960
would have who's the guy to do i guess it's the jason alexander i think it's the jason alexander

1583
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,400
gargoyle but all i think the gargoyles i guess could have done it i'm like glaring at michael

1584
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:38,040
right now that's fair but this is just my taste this is my personal taste uh is that if they

1585
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:45,640
could have made you know jokes about cloning sheep uh or uh whatever else happened in 1996

1586
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:51,240
six or seven uh yeah that would have been i'm sorry to stay on the in this area but the

1587
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:57,960
the invention of viagra great you'd have to dance around it but yeah you couldn't say what it might

1588
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,240
might be a way to allude

1589
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:11,720
there's that pill that makes the guys harder than we are hard and stone

1590
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,320
yeah that's exactly what i'm talking about that would have i think they could have probably gotten

1591
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:21,800
a few more years out of the show if they had done something like that and uh and really because then

1592
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,800
the people would come you'd always have reason to come back which is genius of the aladdin show

1593
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,160
is there was always a reason to come back to see what genie was going to roast this week

1594
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:35,240
sure everyone would leave saying well we gotta come back we gotta come back we gotta reason

1595
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:40,600
first yeah we gotta come back yeah to see what it appears that what replaced this um well this

1596
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:47,320
replay there was a pocahontas show in this space beforehand and then like it was a little hard

1597
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,120
to tell what replaced this because but it seemed like the verdict was just special events it was

1598
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:56,040
a special event stage that kind of sat empty unless they had something going on corporate

1599
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:01,400
event or something yeah in this area yeah disneyland one too this was a hunchback like uh

1600
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:07,880
somehow torched the no nobody could follow it salted the earth nothing could grow one more thing

1601
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:12,600
at the time they also had this ice cream bar i'm saying this for my mom because i talked to her

1602
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,640
about this i was like mom do you remember the show and she's like oh i'm gonna start crying and i was

1603
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:20,280
like yes thank you but um she was like there was this ice cream bar and it was called like the

1604
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:25,000
hunchback bar and it was like ice cream dipped in caramel dipped in chocolate and like they sold

1605
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,680
it with like mickey bars and for a while when the show was running they had it and then they stopped

1606
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:33,960
so i wanted to mention that and also i'm looking up yeah oh yeah i couldn't find a picture of it i

1607
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,360
looked and then also i wanted to say they sometimes would have sign language interpreters and they

1608
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:43,480
would have usually like a guy and a girl and they did every character and like so amazingly well and

1609
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,040
that was my mom was like those people were so good i could cry like the show was just really

1610
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:53,240
overwhelming in a good way to watch like everyone just like went hard so i think watching on youtube

1611
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,400
like i'm i'm just honestly so sad that you guys will never get to see it i'm not being sarcastic

1612
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:03,160
like it is i'm sad you will never get to see it like live it was so good wow is it um would you

1613
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,800
say that even the the movie itself is like your favorite movie still of the disney of like well i

1614
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,680
really like alice in wonderland mostly when i'm high i like to watch alice in wonderland because

1615
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:17,960
i'm like this guy gets it um which doesn't even have any slot machine the guy who wrote it i don't

1616
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:28,760
know oh louis carol you mean yeah okay sometimes i'm a little dense is that what a delivery

1617
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:36,120
what a delivery on that thank you um i think like this caterpillar gets it or something yeah well

1618
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:41,480
the caterpillar because i guess he's hookah and yeah and i whenever i go on the alice ride if i go

1619
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:49,640
by him i'm like pay my respects so yeah i think um hunchback's probably my favorite i would yeah i

1620
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:54,680
think i'm back to my favorite i like alice but that's a newer thing that's a newer i'd never

1621
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,360
really watched all day through and then like more recently i watched it and and man get

1622
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:04,600
fucked up and watch alice you will feel so crazy like dumb and dumber come out and you're like what

1623
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:15,160
the fuck is going on like again i am sometimes not the smartest um dense and denser

1624
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:27,640
a lot of things but jason is more book smart and so sometimes i say some really dumb shit you know

1625
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:33,160
just because jason could name the actor robert mitcham it doesn't mean he's smart okay he just

1626
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:40,280
said no some hard lesson to learn michael i came with like 35 that that's sitting just because

1627
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:45,240
he knows some old actors don't don't get the idea i know new stuff that he doesn't know i teach him

1628
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:50,680
new stuff oh yes yeah we know because he'll come into the episode with some phrases that we don't

1629
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,760
know and like well where's he getting that i don't know what's gonna pass it off i you well just

1630
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:59,240
casually slip it in as if we won't just like get a radar on it like what was that he said a thing

1631
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:03,240
what was it that's a cool phrase he said sicko mode once in life

1632
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:11,560

madeline yeah and she is a character name she michael mccann the evil magician thinks that

1680
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,560
all she's good for is being as a magician's assistant standing there and looking pretty

1681
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:03,720
but she wants to be a tightrope walker okay and spoiler she gets her chance just when phoebus

1682
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:10,920
needs her the most all right my favorite mathematically correct sure that's my favorite movie
