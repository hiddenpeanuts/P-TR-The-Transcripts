1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Warning, the following celebratory podcast was recorded in the open air with its hosts

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,940
and the actual vicinity of each other.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,340
Will they remember how to podcast in person?

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,640
Can they maintain eye contact?

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,120
Or will they desperately miss the low res zoom screen and its slight delays?

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,100
We'll find out on today's 200th, wow, main feed episode.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,920
It's the 200th episode, Safe-Tacular on today's podcast, The Ride.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks where we're giving each other the

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,840
ultimate anniversary gift, not being on fucking zoom.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm Scott Gardner, joined on the main feed for the 200th time by Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,320
I am here.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,600
It's also, this is an innovative thing because we're in the elements, we're outside.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,360
Which is another like groundbreaking thing and another treat.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,240
There's a lot of history, yes, beyond what we're doing, the outdoor nature of it, but

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,440
before we get into that, Jason Sheridan, happy 200.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:35,560
It does feel a little perverse to like podcast in God's nature where we can bother your neighbors

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
with like bits.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,600
We can hunch outside instead of hunch indoors.

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,360
I know we're not meant to be getting fresh air.

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,560
Like maybe one, maybe two go to the parks and then, you know, to get content, we force

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,680
ourselves into fresh air, but we don't record the content in the fresh air.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,560
Not at all.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,320
That being said, the bigger possibility is less us and more that the neighbor might start

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,240
blasting loud Italian opera.

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,560
This has happened every once in a while.

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm making a guess on Italian, I don't know.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,320
That could be an issue.

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,880
Yeah, here, before you might know this from the art or from the title or from something

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,280
or other, but to celebrate the 200th new main feed episode, we are doing an in-person record

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,960
right now for the first time in 13 months.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh my God.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,080
13 months, yes, we're here.

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,400
We can look into each other's actual eyes and not our video eyes.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,360
Yeah, socially distance with masks on.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,880
Yeah, still masks.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,080
So if there's muffle, that is why trying to project over it, we're probably going too

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
far.

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,280
We're going to give someone the direction and you're at a nightclub, so there's a lot

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,280
of activity around you, so just make sure you get it here.

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
We sound like we're doing nightclub scenes in movies right now.

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,880
Yeah, if there's any plane noises, sorry, that's how flight paths work.

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,320
Yeah, if true.

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
One right now, I think.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,880
Yeah, yes, there's one overhead right now.

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,000
And if you hear any sort of old motors, there's a decent chance Jay Leno has driven by.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,680
If you hear a sputtering motor or something from a Model T or some sort of old Studebaker,

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,000
decent chance it's Mr. Leno.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,640
You know, I saw the president drive by once in Burbank.

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,920
I was getting gas and the whole motorcade, the limo, the Cadillac, the bulletproof Cadillac.

52
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Which one?

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Which president?

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Obama.

55
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I guess I should, Obama, Obama.

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
And that was, yeah.

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,560
Three presidents ago and you said the president?

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,720
I guess I should have said a president.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,840
I saw Jimmy Carter drive by in Burbank.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,200
He was headed to the Bob's Big Boy.

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah, hey, anything can happen.

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,840
It's Burbank and we're out in the elements of Burbank.

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,320
Yeah, this is cool.

64
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,760
I don't think, now I don't think we're making the Perma switch back and we might listen

65
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
back to this and go, well, we certainly won't do it that way again.

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,800
But seem like a good little treat to give ourselves because it's been a while.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,080
I've got some stats and maybe you want to take a guess.

68
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,120
Some miserable stats, but I feel less miserable about them because I'm seeing you guys.

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Uh-huh.

70
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,160
Uh, main feed only.

71
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,840
How many episodes over Zoom?

72
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh my goodness.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,520
Well, if you said 13 months, what, 13 times four, which I can't, 13 times four, 40 plus

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,480
12, 52.

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,080
So yeah, a couple breaks, 49.

76
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,440
A little less, I would say.

77
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,240
I didn't give Jason a chance to guess.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,360
Oh, 40 even?

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,440
45, right in the middle.

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,040
45 of these out of 200.

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,720
So almost a quarter of the main feed this entire time.

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,200
We've been doing the podcast for almost four years and over a year of it has been this

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
way.

84
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:58,480
Patreon, the Patreon is so newish comparatively that wait, I think, okay, uh, 35 of the second

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,580
gates have been over Zoom and there's only been, I'm sorry, oh no, 38 if you count little

86
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,640
odds and ends like the Macas amigos rebuttal or little holiday episodes we've done.

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,060
There's only 94 of those in general.

88
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,040
So 40% of the Patreon's life entirely has been in the stupid way we've had to do it.

89
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Wow.

90
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Gee whiz.

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Can you believe it?

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,920
Uh, I mean I can because I feel like I've aged a decade in this last year.

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Big time.

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
I've never felt old until now.

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,560
I've never had concerns about and depression about being old.

96
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
for like 2005.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Like suddenly these eras that seemed like yesterday, I'm like, I can barely recall.

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
It was another world then.

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Yeah.

100
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
I think for the zoom recordings, like I turn, there's a part of my brain that turned like

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,120
performing brain that turns on, but usually when that happens in person at like Mike's

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,120
place or at a theater or something, I have to be human afterwards, you know, have some,

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,960
you know, we just chit chat.

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Maybe we get lunch.

105
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Sure.

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,400
If that is, I gotta, you know, say hi to people afterwards.

107
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,640
Um, uh, uh, regardless in person or digital, I just go, well, I feel like shit.

108
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,200
I did a bad job.

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,760
But when you do it over zoom, it's not, it's kind of bad because then you can just walk

110
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,120
to a couch or a bed and lie face down and you just give it into that sense of defeat.

111
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Typical.

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,080
I don't, these are things, despite many episodes together, I don't know that you go face plant

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,120
after an episode like a comic.

114
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,200
I know sometimes I walk the dog or sometimes I just said comic, but yeah, Carfield's the

115
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
dog.

116
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Yes.

117
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Jane's dog.

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Jane's dog.

119
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,440
So sometimes, you know, I try to keep it human.

120
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,360
I try to, I try to like decompress a little after recording.

121
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
I mean, we did shows at UCB for years where, where I would just walk off stage like pretty

122
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,280
much always and just be in my head of like, Oh, well, that could have gone better.

123
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,160
And I just heart of myself, you know?

124
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,920
Well, you don't have to worry about the bad improv shows anymore.

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,240
Well, say your name, my geeky name might be back.

126
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
That's true.

127
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,960
And maybe it'd be fun at this point.

128
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Yeah.

129
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm having this opposite thing and I'm curious if you guys have had it or if any listeners

130
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,520
are having this, because I think this might be like a syndrome in the world that is building

131
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,760
a little bit of backyard hangs that I've had.

132
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,880
And this one right now might be one of them.

133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,680
I think it's the opposite of you, Jason.

134
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm not feeling weird and bad after Zoom stuff.

135
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,920
I'm feeling weird and bad after things in person because I don't know how to do it anymore.

136
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,720
I've found myself needing to apologize for things that were our made up checking with

137
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Erin was I okay?

138
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,960
And she's like, what do you mean?

139
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,840
You're like over analyzing because all of our, I think a lot of people like us, our

140
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,680
social skills were tenuous to begin with.

141
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,160
And now we might have to build them all back up.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,680
I don't know how to be at a party anymore.

143
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,240
I don't know how to like introduce people to people they don't know and hop from one

144
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,320
cluster to another.

145
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
It's all gone.

146
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Yeah.

147
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,880
I have not been doing many.

148
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,280
I mean, I would see, I would see people briefly outside for the last year.

149
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,360
But Jason and I were actually seeing someone for their birthday, a friend of the show,

150
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
Marissa Strickland.

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
And I remember the first five minutes, we're all standing very far away from each other

152
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,920
and we're all talking and there's cars driving by and it's impossible to hear each other

153
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,520
and you're straining and you're like, oh yeah, these are like my friends that I'm comfortable

154
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
with.

155
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,400
But then I'm trying and I remember like it took me 15 minutes and then I made a joke

156
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,120
and it killed finally.

157
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,480
And I went, all right, I'm back.

158
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,300
I remember like it wouldn't, it wasn't working.

159
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,160
And I felt like I had been making bad jokes and then finally one worked okay.

160
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,520
And then I like settled down a bit, but there was definitely a lot of like clunkiness in

161
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
my head.

162
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,240
I was bragging about making a joke, which is annoying.

163
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
But I'm just trying to...

164
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Now your punishment's coming later.

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
It was just delayed.

166
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
That's a good point.

167
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,960
This guy's referring to the fact that I got emotional after we was done because I hadn't

168
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,400
seen people in so long.

169
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,720
But yes, no, it's very strange and it's going to be an adjustment.

170
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Yeah.

171
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
It's gonna be weird.

172
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,200
It was nice to see, you know, a bunch of our old friends or old performer friends and the

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,920
podcast that came out of that group, Podcast the Ride, half of Off Book the Musical, a

174
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,840
quarter of Wild Horses.

175
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
What a time.

176
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
That's true.

177
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Yes.

178
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,840
The 100% of the Ben Shapiro show.

179
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:33,360
You know, he doesn't talk to us anymore and he wasn't a very giving improviser to begin

180
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
with.

181
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,720
So I went more information.

182
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,400
He's not a natural talent like Gut Field or something.

183
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,160
We're in the crater of Gut Field.

184
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Gut Feld is his name.

185
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Oh, excuse me.

186
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,160
You're thinking of Garfield, Jason, and you put Gut Field.

187
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,240
I am and he's such a good boy.

188
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,800
Gut Feld is not Garfield the dog who's not Garfield the cat.

189
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Yeah.

190
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,920
We're going to do a thing later on.

191
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,280
I was like, should I make a Gut Feld joke in here?

192
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,720
But now I've decided not to do it.

193
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Because we've already mentioned Gut Feld.

194
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
No way.

195
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,640
If that's at the end of the show, then people will be hungry for more Gut Feld.

196
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
We'll see.

197
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
At the time we do it.

198
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
If you don't know what we're talking about, Fox News has introduced their answer to late

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
night comedy and it's dog shit.

200
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
It sucks.

201
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,160
And it took me back to one of my very first jobs in LA where I remember someone had a

202
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,000
framed picture of the whole cast and crew of one of the previous jobs they worked on,

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,640
the half hour news hour.

204
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Oh, yes.

205
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,960
And I was just like, why would you frame that?

206
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,240
You're only in this office for three months to begin with.

207
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Why do you have that?

208
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,320
It taints your view of somebody if they have a framed photo.

209
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,760
The only thing I know about that show is that the cold open was Rush Limbaugh.

210
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
R.I.P.

211
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Oh my god.

212
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Yeah.

213
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,680
I was really blank in my head and then I went, oh, I remember now.

214
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080
I do remember all of this.

215
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
That cold open.

216
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Yeah, yeah.

217
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,400
Yeah, Gut Feld's not so good.

218
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,680
My favorite joke was he's being mean to all the late night hosts and he says, Jimmy Fallon

219
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,040
does more fawning than a pack of deer.

220
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,600
Which is like that's like when Norm MacDonald did the fake roast jokes to make to shit on

221
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,560
the idea of roasts in general.

222
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,320
That's like, has there ever been a joke softer than fawning, more fawning than a pack of deer?

223
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm begging for Reader's Digest.

224
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,600
Please, give me.

225
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Geez, I need to read something.

226
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,760
You have to go way back into the 1900s to find a softer joke than that.

227
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,160
I mean, look, would I like to talk about the Gut Feld monologue all episode?

228
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Yes, I would.

229
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,440
But what a waste that would be of this moment.

230
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
We're together.

231
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,320
There's theme park news afoot.

232
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Oh my gosh.

233
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Well, plenty.

235
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,600
Because things are turning the machines back on.

236
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,320
What are you referring to though, Jason?

237
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,120
Well, I mean, I have a few things.

238
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,920
The biggest like thing announced that I saw in the last day or so.

239
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,360
We're recording this a couple days before it came out.

240
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,520
The Velocicoaster at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure opening June 10th.

241
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Oh, interesting.

242
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Oh, okay.

243
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Then know that.

244
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Wow, wow.

245
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Yeah.

246
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
All right, all right.

247
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
That's good.

248
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,920
I think I've determined might be too intense for me.

249
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Really?

250
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
I've watched some, I've looked at some footage.

251
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,760
I mean, it looks like the greatest roller coaster ever, but I don't know.

252
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,640
If the digital ride through that I watched is accurate, I think it might push my boundaries

253
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,960
a little too far.

254
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,920
Would you do Hulk at this point?

255
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Not sure.

256
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
I didn't last time.

257
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
I don't know.

258
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,560
Again, what if my ride stamina is gone?

259
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Oh, do you think it got worse?

260
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,320
I have not been staying in shape in the last 13 months.

261
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
That's interesting.

262
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,400
I was thinking you would be more raring to do like new things, but I guess, yeah, if

263
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,200
we're talking about sort of shrinking in other facets of our lives, maybe it will.

264
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,120
Wait, wait, are you saying there's a chance that I might not like haunts anymore?

265
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
Oh, no.

266
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Have you?

267
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
No, there's no, come on.

268
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,960
Like people in the dark lunging at you, strangers in like really narrow corridors.

269
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,120
Of course you're going to love it.

270
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,760
Doesn't that seem more pleasant than an unseen plague lurking around every corner or potentially

271
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,840
inside the bodies of your friends and loved ones?

272
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,680
Distrusting everyone you know and like or dislike or everyone.

273
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,040
You're meeting by a stranger on the street who looks very kind and you're just a second

274
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,520
away from going, don't you dare look at me.

275
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
Back off, back off, back off.

276
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Oh my God.

277
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Yeah, you're right.

278
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,640
You've lived in a haunt this whole time.

279
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,200
It's a good thing you got in shape.

280
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,680
Yes, that's a good point.

281
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,040
So maybe I'm, maybe I'll be better.

282
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,240
I'll be, I'm so dead inside now at this point that I'll be even more ready for haunts.

283
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,520
But I don't know with Velocicoaster.

284
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,480
I feel like Velocicoaster will be on par with Hulk because I was thinking of the same issue

285
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
too.

286
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,840
Like if, first of all, if you're listening to this for your first podcast, the right

287
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,720
episode, turn it off and listen to another one because this is going to be a lot of inside

288
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
baseball I think.

289
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,600
And we're in weird muffled mask talk as well.

290
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
And it's weird muffled mask talk.

291
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,640
The show doesn't sound like this a lot.

292
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,840
But I was thinking about this and I was like, when I go back to Six Flags, should I be braver

293
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,680
and try to do like X2 which scares the shit out of me?

294
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Yeah.

295
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,800
And I was like, I still feel I don't want to, but maybe, maybe I have to.

296
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I don't know.

297
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Really, to throw myself in the deep end?

298
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I don't know.

299
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,800
You have to ask yourself, will it be worth, is it a personal thing?

300
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,200
Do you think that the audience will be excited enough for you to be worth it?

301
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,080
Do you want the likes and the clicks that much or is it a personal growth thing?

302
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,840
Oh, I think it's both.

303
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,280
I'm a needy, desperate performer who wants to please a bunch of listeners, a bunch of

304
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,120
Cliffords by doing something new and they know I'm out of my comfort zone and that's

305
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,360
always amusing I think.

306
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,520
I as a viewer or a listener like that.

307
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,320
So I think I feel some sort of pressure to deliver on a new experience and also yeah,

308
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,040
it would be, I feel like a little bit accomplished when I do something new.

309
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
That's true.

310
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
That's part of it I think.

311
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,240
Hey, if I can tangent for just a sec since you mentioned Clifford, check out Google theme,

312
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,200
no, what is it called?

313
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:18,240
Human Boy Worldwide is a, it's this clothing startup that is doing a short run of Clifford

314
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,760
t-shirts and then after that they're doing a line of shirts based on posters for Robert

315
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,120
Altman movies, but just the logo.

316
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,440
So like you can get a Clifford shirt and then in a few weeks you can get a shirt that says

317
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,480
like the long goodbye or McCabe and Mrs. Miller and I know I'm stocking up.

318
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,280
Honoring all the best films.

319
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,140
And I think they're selling a Jiminy Glick shirt too, which is very funny.

321
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,560
Did they get like the Martin Short rights just of his whole catalog?

322
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,760
Don't worry about it.

323
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,720
I bought, you know what I did a couple weeks ago and it hasn't shipped so I'm worried.

324
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,440
Some weird site was like offering like a bootleg looking Jim Carrey, Red Letter Batman Forever

325
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,440
shirt and I just pulled the trigger immediately on it.

326
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,280
But now that I think about it, I was like was it legit?

327
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,840
Did I get scammed like I did when I gave my credit card info for the Mr. Tato biography?

328
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
I don't know because it hasn't shipped.

329
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,800
I don't have it yet, but maybe it's a similar situation where they don't have the official

330
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,860
Clifford rights.

331
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,160
Has anyone noticed, I feel like Clifford is in the zeitgeist now somehow.

332
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,560
Did we cause it somehow?

333
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
I don't know.

334
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,160
I don't know if we were just part of the zeitgeist with Clifford or we caused it.

335
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I don't know.

336
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,920
Where else do you mean by zeitgeist?

337
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,360
How is Martin Short's Clifford in the zeitgeist?

338
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,760
I just see it more on Twitter.

339
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,600
I know part of it is probably an algorithm thing where I had searched for it.

340
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,480
I think it's easily viewable on HBO Max at this point.

341
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Yes, it's viewable there.

342
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,160
I did watch it.

343
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Not great.

344
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Oh, we had a great time.

345
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
We watched it too.

346
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
We had a great time.

347
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I was ready.

348
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I was ready to go.

349
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
You know what it is, I think?

350
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,440
I think if you view, because I've watched clips, right?

351
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,720
Obviously, the wonderful roller coaster scene that won the fake theme park final four, that's

352
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
great.

353
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,520
But besides that, there'll be a scene with Debney Coleman or a scene with Charles Gruden

354
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
that's great.

355
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,600
And you watch the scenes and you think this is a good movie.

356
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
And then it all together, right?

357
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,520
Like I'm sure it was awesome on set.

358
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,440
They probably thought they were making the greatest thing.

359
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
And that's not nothing.

360
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,000
There's movies where everybody's cracking each other up, where the scenes aren't good

361
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
either.

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,840
So I do give it up to Clifford for that.

363
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,480
But maybe that's the problem.

364
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Individual moments are good.

365
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,600
But Jason, you've maybe disagree and say it's all.

366
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,480
I mean, I had seen it a couple of times already.

367
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,720
And I just I like the performances a lot from Gruden and Short and Steenburgen and Debney

368
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,880
Coleman.

369
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,000
And so like, yeah, as a film, capital F film, like, I don't know that it holds up together.

370
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,200
But there's some very funny comedy moments.

371
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
The scene where Martin Short is like, he's like, you can't even look normal like a normal

372
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,520
little boy and he's looking around.

373
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
That is very funny.

374
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
I can't beat it.

375
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Yeah.

376
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,760
The incredible amount to which Clifford rigs explosives to blow up the model of the public

377
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
transit system.

378
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Yes.

379
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,040
It is a really vicious explosion.

380
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Yes.

381
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
It's very impressive.

382
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,440
Really nice analog, tactile, so much debris.

383
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah, I don't know.

384
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,920
I think we're going to start like we know how things go with us.

385
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,200
You start you think you don't like something and then we talk about it and we talk about

386
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
it.

387
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
That's true.

388
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,720
And then I yes, then I'm the biggest Clifford fan in the world, especially you.

389
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
There was a comment.

390
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,680
I don't know if it was in a mailbag or a tweet or something, but I don't know if you ever

391
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,320
if this ever made it your way.

392
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,240
I just saw some a listener to the show saying that there's an evolution with Mike, which

393
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,400
is hearing about something, maybe kind of disliking it, then coming around and starting

394
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,320
to think that it's good or cute.

395
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
Right, right.

396
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,000
And then the next step, which is making it so much of a tenant of your personality, you

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
must defend it at all costs.

398
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,760
I don't know who said it or where.

399
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,480
Take credit somewhere if you said it.

400
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,520
But that is that's happened a number of times in these 200 episodes.

401
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,440
Yeah, I do think that is true.

402
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,400
I mean, obviously the Jimmy Buffett is the best example of it.

403
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,600
I guess to some degree, Avatar and the mighty Akron.

404
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,880
I think there's levels of it.

405
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,160
I think there's levels like the Buffett is again, that's the Max version of it.

406
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,120
Duffy is I think one of the you're making fun of Duffy and then it became steadily less

407
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
and less.

408
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,000
I think maybe to a lesser extent, baby Aladar.

409
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,080
It's not so much it's in the family.

410
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

411
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,920
Yeah, it's a mini version of it.

412
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Right, right.

413
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,760
But it's like more is like Jimmy Buffett.

414
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,200
I'll listen to in the car.

415
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,280
And I'm not actually thinking about Aladar so much during the day.

416
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,240
Baby Aladar.

417
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,960
Maybe you could come become that.

418
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
But yeah, it hasn't happened.

419
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,720
But no, that's not that's not entirely wrong.

420
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,440
It becomes sort of a fun toy at a certain point and then becomes truly not ironic at

421
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
all.

422
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Yeah.

423
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Yeah.

424
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Just watch the things just stand up on the other side of the fence.

425
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,880
Maybe baby Aladar would be helped along if the baby Aladar I got you ever came.

426
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,160
But that's a strand.

427
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,880
That's another like delivery that hasn't shown up many, many months ago.

428
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,600
So many months ago, it was cursed.

429
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,360
You bought me a cursed baby Aladar.

430
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,440
There was that discussion, I think.

431
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Yeah.

432
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Yeah.

433
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,120
Wait, did we add that on the show or listeners did too?

434
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,400
I think I think there were comments that were like, I had one of these and it like wouldn't

435
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
stop making noise.

436
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Yes.

437
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Right.

438
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Right.

439
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
Had one and any time they tried to donate it somewhere, it always ended up back in the

440
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,400
house and it would not stop making noise as the battery slowly gave out.

441
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Jesus.

442
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh my God.

443
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
It's the one toy that's actually alive.

444
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
It's not Woody and Buzz.

445
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
It's just baby Aladar.

446
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,040
And he doesn't even like pretend to not be alive when you're looking at him.

447
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
He's just always alive.

448
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Hi.

449
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
The crusty doll.

450
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Change me.

451
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,040
I peed again.

452
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,360
What else is going on news wise, though?

453
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:01,880
Well, Universal Hollywood put up a link for announced reservations for annual pass holders.

454
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,440
They're keeping their annual pass program growing to make reservations to see the park

455
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,520
reopen once again.

456
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,200
The websites crashed or didn't load at all again and again for people.

457
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,240
And simultaneously, almost within a day or two, Disney has announced here's how you buy

458
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,360
tickets to Disneyland.

459
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,720
Yeah, not my favorite.

460
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm not digging the amount of complication here.

461
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,520
I don't understand this thing where April 15th tickets are on sale.

462
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,920
But no, wait, April 15th.

463
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
No, that's right.

464
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,360
April 15th, you can buy tickets.

465
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,160
April 12th, you can make reservations.

466
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,240
So everybody has the jump on you if they have tickets already.

467
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,680
But our annual passes are worth nothing.

468
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,200
Yes, I was just catching up on this right before I left.

469
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,680
If you already bought tickets and you had gone and they were still good, that's you

470
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,240
have a better opportunity to book a reservation for Disney.

471
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
There's no one talk.

472
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,080
I had said this and I was incorrect because somebody had said they would have a new annual

473
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,400
pass program by the time at Disney open, but that's not obviously the case.

474
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,560
So I got very confused by looking at all these paragraphs.

475
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:23,040
And yes, it seems like all of this is a mess, like as usual and confusing.

476
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,880
But it's par for the course.

477
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,680
It's kind of interesting how Disney-esque syndromes have entered all of our lives with

478
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,160
the effort to get shots and vaccines.

479
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,480
I think it's been reminding a lot of people of trying to get into Galaxy's Edge, trying

480
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,320
to get onto Rise of the Resistance.

481
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,760
That's true.

482
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,760
In hindsight, getting into Galaxy's Edge in general and even getting onto Rise of the

483
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,440
Resistance that first day, that makes almost every other system we've had to deal with

484
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,060
in the last year and a half look like shit.

485
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,380
In hindsight, Galaxy's Edge worked very smoothly and the reservation system worked very smoothly

486
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,860
to even get on Rise of the Resistance.

487
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,620
It was hard to get there early and do all that stuff, but once it was done, we went

488
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,620
on.

489
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
It was great.

490
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,620
That was great.

491
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,940
It sounds like this thing is going to be a disaster for a lot of reasons and Universal

492
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,660
is also a disaster.

493
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,780
So people are frustrated.

494
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,260
We're not looking to go back first day.

495
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,460
I'm usually a first day guy, but in this instance, I'm going to let numbers go down more.

496
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,740
I will wait till I'm vaccinated.

497
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,780
How soon does everybody go though?

498
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,940
Once you get second shot, then you wait, what is it?

499
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Is it 10 days?

500
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
Is it 14 days?

501
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
It's 10 days, 14 or something.

502
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,740
How soon do you go?

503
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,580
It's a very good question.

504
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,820
It depends on the spread.

505
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,860
It depends on how we're doing numbers-wise in the area.

506
00:23:52,860 --> 00:24:00,340
So if we continue to go down like we are and I'm two weeks out, maybe.

507
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,380
It's a very flexible, I'm very flexible right now.

508
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm optimistic like a lot of people are.

509
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,220
There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic.

510
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,220
So the whole thing is flexible.

511
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,620
I think I've said this, there's a good chance I will be at Disney or Universal before maybe

512
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,980
I'm inside with a bunch of people that aren't living with me.

513
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:24,060
I think it is a rare time maybe ever that this will happen where Disneyland is competing

514
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:31,660
with my desire to go to the dentist and more importantly the eye doctor because this prescription

515
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,620
is aging rapidly and my eyes are starting to...

516
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Oh no.

517
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,740
Are your eyes going the last year?

518
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
Are your eyes deteriorating?

519
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,220
Well, on and off just from the amount of screen time.

520
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,380
Just from lack of being outside and lack of screen time.

521
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,780
I've figured out tricks.

522
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
It's better now.

523
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:58,460
I did go like a year ago, almost a year ago, I did go because my one eye was bothering

524
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,100
me, but that sometimes happens during allergy season.

525
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,020
The left eye kind of flares up because I didn't know this until I was like 32, 33 that you

526
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,020
can get allergies in your eyes.

527
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,060
I will probably get some new glasses soon.

528
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,380
That's kind of high on my list.

529
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,860
If you haven't noticed, I am like, God knows, 40%, 35% gray.

530
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,300
It's like really crazy at this point.

531
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,420
I have because I've seen you in person twice this whole time.

532
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,900
This is number three.

533
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,100
My hair is crazy right now, but that's going.

534
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,380
It's kind of like you're showing us stuff beneath the surface.

535
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,820
It seems like it's landing at the roots.

536
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,340
You're able to hide it still.

537
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,740
Yes, like I can hide it with the top.

538
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,100
The top hair is still brownish, but everything else is just going white.

539
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,580
Just so crazy fast.

540
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,140
I we made there was an audition I had a couple of weeks ago for a commercial that we shot

541
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,860
and I shot it outside on the little porch we have and the light on my hair.

542
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,260
I looked like Steve Martin.

543
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,380
That's looks wise, but hair wise.

544
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,140
I went, Oh my God.

545
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,220
Then I was emailing my agent, tell them I'll dye it.

546
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
Tell them I'll dye it.

547
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,940
Tell them I'll do whatever they want to my hair.

548
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
Oh man.

549
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,220
Do you have to change your type now?

550
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Well, yeah.

551
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:24,140
I changed it from a man in his 30s to aging grandparent.

552
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Aging grandparent.

553
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Yeah, very old.

554
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,260
You're still, your type is now 89.

555
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,820
Yeah, I'm 88 to 89.

556
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Or so.

557
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,100
And I have to like kind of in the headshot, I have like a hunch.

558
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,940
I added a hunch to my stance to really make it, really make it attractive to the casting

559
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
people.

560
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,140
So if it's a yeah, if it's like commercials for flip phones and medical bracelets.

561
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Oh yeah.

562
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,140
I got a call.

563
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm definitely going to be in commercials that are airing during Gutfeld.

564
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,660
That's absolutely what will be happening.

565
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,540
They're all non-union, but I'll, I'll go against sag.

566
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,820
I'll go against my union to, to work and make a thousand dollars forever.

567
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
Look Mike's in it.

568
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Is it a comedy sketch?

569
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,820
I don't know.

570
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,900
No, he all about Eve Chuck Woolery.

571
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,940
Snake Chuck Woolery.

572
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,820
For a catheter spot.

573
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,140
This is for a shower safety seat.

574
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Huh.

575
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Well, at least he's working.

576
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,660
Ow, I fell and hurt my butt.

577
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
Yeah.

578
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,580
Well, yeah, he's, he's getting a payday, I guess.

579
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,260
So yeah, look out for that please.

580
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,020
By the way, the next time we record in person, this thing's, I'm going to look so jet black.

581
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,340
I'm going to look like a 70 year old rock and roll guy in like your favorite classic

582
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,260
rock band on stage where you go there.

583
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,620
That hair cannot be real.

584
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,620
Oh yeah.

585
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,940
And special guest, Wayne Newton.

586
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Yeah.

587
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,500
I guess the ride.

588
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,900
I will have the fakest looking hair next time you see me.

589
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,500
It will look so bad.

590
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,060
Sopranos level.

591
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Yeah.

592
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,540
It might just be a piece.

593
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,580
It might just be a wig.

594
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,140
It might look better.

595
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
Go full Spectre.

596
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Just, oh yeah.

597
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,860
You know, might as well make it wild too.

598
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Just change the image.

599
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
Or I'll do a little Stephen.

600
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
I'll just do a do rag permanently.

601
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,540
Maybe I'll just sort of like a bandana around my head for the rest of my life.

602
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,060
You just like a fix this, these other little pins you can put in my skull so I always have

603
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,060
this bandana.

604
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Yeah.

605
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,460
It's a doctor will administer the bandana to make sure it's safe and then I'll never

606
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
take it off.

607
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,900
It's going to be tough for the airport.

608
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,900
That's the main thing.

609
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,980
You got to worry about 70 bandana pins.

610
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,940
Maybe I'll have like a doctor's note.

611
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,380
Let them know that this is a medical bandana.

612
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,380
It's medical Stevie-ism.

613
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
I see.

614
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
Yeah.

615
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,260
And then I can then I can meet Stephen.

616
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,860
I'll have something to talk to him about.

617
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
We got to go.

618
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,700
If everybody's feeling old, we got to go back to where the youths are.

619
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
That's Magic Mountain.

620
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,540
Magic Mountain is open now.

621
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
We could do it.

622
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,260
Go to Magic Mountain currently.

623
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,780
They got right to it.

624
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,620
I think April Fool's Day, but not a joke.

625
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,420
They have been open for a little bit.

626
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,300
Do we have any idea how it's going?

627
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
I did.

628
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,420
I was watching a YouTube, a YouTuber go there and it seemed fine.

629
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,820
It seemed like they didn't.

630
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,780
It was hard to tell, you know, if the upkeep has been okay there.

631
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,700
It's not like you don't know if that's like normal this normal year that was just there

632
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
before.

633
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,500
Yes, but it seems like the park looks okay.

634
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,860
It seemed like everything was running.

635
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,460
Quite a bit outdoors already.

636
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,460
Yeah, it helps them.

637
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Yeah.

638
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,500
I mean, obviously, like Justice League is inside and there's a couple other things.

639
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
The full throttle lounge.

640
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,860
I don't know that the YouTuber did not go in there.

641
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,700
So are there are there safety measures at the full throttle lounge?

642
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,740
This is what our listeners need to know.

643
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
It's what we need to know.

644
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:59,500
Are there advanced cleaning techniques being employed at Chop 6?

645
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
It's a good question.

646
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,140
I don't the YouTuber did not go into this detail.

647
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,740
I will say the top floor at full throttle does not allow a lot of social distance because

648
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,720
we were packed in there up there.

649
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,360
So maybe maybe only the first floor should be open at full throttle lounge.

650
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,300
But the people there seem to have a good time.

651
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,040
And yeah, they should really at least for a little while.

652
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,840
Keep it 25 percent throttle.

653
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Yeah.

654
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,880
Wait for more word for the governor to go full throttle.

655
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,320
When Joe Biden announces that they can go full throttle, then it's time or Dr. Fauci

656
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,540
or yeah, just make sure you listen to health officials when judging how hard you should

657
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,440
throttle it.

658
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,200
Make sure that's just something I think we should all really about.

659
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,800
Determining a throttle percentage.

660
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Yeah.

661
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,520
So yeah, we're depending on what tier we are in California.

662
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
What tier are we?

663
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,600
Are we purple tier?

664
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,760
No, we've dropped down to orange.

665
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Oh, OK.

666
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
That's good.

667
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Right.

668
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,320
And in some cases, right?

669
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,600
I think it dropped.

670
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,080
It dropped to where parks could open and then it dropped again to parks could open from

671
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
like 15 percent to 25 percent.

672
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Right.

673
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
I believe.

674
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Don't quote me on that.

675
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,520
I think that's somewhere in the ballpark.

676
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,280
They were going to like if things were stayed the way that they were the incredibly restrictive

677
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:27,040
Like, Chapek would have like gone to the governor's mansion and like held Newsom out by his legs

678
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,720
like out of a window, Suge Knight style.

679
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,520
It was going to get really ugly if they didn't change things.

680
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:38,080
Yeah, Chapek would have put like a bomb in the haunted mansion and said, I'm going to

681
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,720
blow this up and you all you Disney fans, you go in demand.

682
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,280
Like you would have done something like that, I think.

683
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Or Joker esque.

684
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,840
If you have a problem with this, here's where Newsom lives.

685
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
Exactly.

686
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,560
And then that would have been then you would see like a million mobilized people and that

687
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
would have happened.

688
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,440
I mean, he's still under the way.

689
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,200
Folks, if you don't know anything about California election law, if you get enough signatures

690
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,880
in California, you can hold an election for governor.

691
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,680
You can recall the governor.

692
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,680
I believe that's how Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor.

693
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Yeah, yeah.

694
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
So there's precedent.

695
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
There's insane precedent.

696
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:19,360
I don't I'm not the Gavin Newsom seems like a little bit of a dunce.

697
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,600
He seems like he sucks a little.

698
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,880
I don't know that much about.

699
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,000
Hey, I don't follow him that closely.

700
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,680
But God knows what sort of Orange County psychos would come out of the woodwork if he was called

701
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,760
what sort of like Tito Ortiz for governor.

702
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,720
He's already on like a city council or something.

703
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,600
Yeah, that's that's the issue.

704
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,840
Yeah, even if you're like, yeah, whatever, change him.

705
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,720
You can't be because it would be so horrific.

706
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,800
Whoever swept in there.

707
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,640
Yeah, yeah, there's no telling.

708
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,520
Doesn't seem like it'll happen.

709
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,160
But the only you know, the only plus side is, yeah, they may be like a crazy person, but

710
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,600
they would certainly let Disney do whatever they want as far as building new rides.

711
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,800
Yeah, really push.

712
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
They would let them.

713
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Oh, sure.

714
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Yeah, I guess that aligns with.

715
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,640
Yeah, this is the only area where our viewpoints might align with right wing is our desire

716
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,240
for there to be any and everything that Disney ever wants.

717
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,760
Yes, this guy, this governor mayor is a horrible right wing fascist.

718
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,440
But but he loves the secret of silver springs or whatever the hell that he said.

719
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,640
He'll open an X-Men's mansion.

720
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,840
And I want to see the beds.

721
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,080
I want to see Colossus's bed in the X-Mansion.

722
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
So please, Mr.

723
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,000
Fascist, please win this election.

724
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,240
They're going to do a rescuers ride.

725
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,320
We get to shrink down to the size of the little mice.

726
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,120
Oh, Bernard and Bianca.

727
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Thank you.

728
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Sorry.

729
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Sorry, everyone else.

730
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,560
Now, just now, I don't like that you poisoned the other candidate, but so just don't do

731
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,560
it again.

732
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,320
One other piece of news that I saw real quick as I was going out the door today and and

733
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:00,620
you know, Carly Weisel has the the more detailed breakdowns on a lot of this stuff as usual.

734
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:06,420
But I saw Scott Gustin on Twitter posted new beginning April 8th, Walt Disney World will

735
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:12,140
allow guests to remove their mask when, quote, taking an outdoor photo.

736
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:19,580
So I think that might be a little premature just because you've trained people to a certain

737
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:27,060
level of behavior and then to to I don't know, to scale it back this quickly.

738
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,940
I also saw like variant numbers.

739
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,540
There's a variant surge in Florida.

740
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,380
Again, I have not read a ton about this.

741
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Which one?

742
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,380
I who knows.

743
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,380
But it's a Florida.

744
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
It's a local.

745
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,380
It's the Orlando variant.

746
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,020
It was created at Islands of Adventure.

747
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,540
I mean, I think they've they've loosened vaccine.

748
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,980
Like I think a lot of people are eligible for the vaccine down there.

749
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,740
But I yeah, I don't know that taking the mask off for a photo.

750
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,620
I don't know how I feel about that.

751
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,260
Well, look, it's all confusing and weird.

752
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,060
It's like the thing is, even with like eating outside, it's like once you're eating, then

753
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,580
you don't have the mask on and it feels like you can get you maybe milk like an extra minute

754
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
out of that.

755
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,380
It's like you're not actually like eat mask, eat mask like the rest.

756
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,540
And it feels like, yeah, maybe you're taking a photo outside.

757
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,180
Obviously, if it's outside, it's a different story.

758
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,300
I I have I'm I'm so exhausted by all of it.

759
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,300
At this point, I just go, whatever.

760
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Like whatever.

761
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Yeah, I know what you mean.

762
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,700
I don't have it in me to get riled up about this.

763
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,220
Like it's not where I live.

764
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,220
Just other.

765
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Am I going to get the thing?

766
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,220
Great.

767
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
Can I go to the park?

768
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,020
Can I get my plastic wine and go on three rides?

769
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,620
See, this is going to all going to work out really well for the speed that I do.

770
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,620
Well, that's true.

771
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,620
Yeah.

772
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:49,820
And if you want more detail, I mean, the Disney Parks blog has a full list of dining and attractions

773
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,780
that will be open when Disneyland opens and DCA open.

774
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,860
So what's what's the thing that you have to like sign after like a countries go to war

775
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,900
and then they absolve each other of anything that happened?

776
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,340
A treaty like a treaty or something.

777
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,580
I have to blanket sign a treaty with like any of my scolding instincts of seeing somebody

778
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,100
on Instagram and I go, well, that's bad to do that.

779
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,260
I just have to wash it away and say, all right, you've all been pardoned.

780
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,860
I'm pardoning everyone in my brain.

781
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,780
I can't have this here.

782
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,260
I don't need to hold this.

783
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
It's been a long time.

784
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:28,300
It's been a long time of being edgy about every photograph we see every outing we had.

785
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,140
We have to let go of it for our own mental health.

786
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,300
And yes, I agree.

787
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,900
Probably not a great idea to take photos without a mask at this point.

788
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,740
But you do it quick, maybe.

789
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,740
And it's outside.

790
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,620
If it's just this little snap off, I think it depends on your your style.

791
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
Yes, it depends.

792
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Your technique.

793
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,180
And I was alluding to the fact that like certainly you're going to get your person that's going

794
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,820
to be like, well, I was just taking a photo for 10 minutes.

795
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,340
That's going to happen.

796
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,500
I know it's going to happen.

797
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,900
They've people have been fighting.

798
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,460
I think ultimately most people aren't.

799
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,260
You know what? I think it's crazy that there aren't more awful Florida stories.

800
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,100
There have been these.

801
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,020
Obviously, there was just one that got around a lot of a guy saying, hey, I paid $15,000

802
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,940
here. You can't file a trespassing charge against me.

803
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,660
That one was kind of wild.

804
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,220
So there's the spikes and you know that the media is going to pick up on them because

805
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,140
they are all crazy and that they're funny.

806
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,020
But like, I like that there's not one of these every three days.

807
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,700
Well, yeah, I have as far as catching it storylines.

808
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,140
Is that a child or a dog?

809
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
Yeah, it's kids.

810
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,900
That's going to be an occupational.

811
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Paperton.

812
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
It's like we're at the park.

813
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,940
Yeah, yeah, I'm good with it.

814
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,340
So yeah, no, I haven't heard it.

815
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,220
I would be interested to talk to a cast member and see if there's like low key versions,

816
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,700
because that would be the one you're describing is like that's such a I mean, it's not funny

817
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,540
or fun, but it is a crazy blow up of like a scene.

818
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,140
Somebody's making a huge scene about it.

819
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,460
I wonder if there are low key ones.

820
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,460
I don't know.

821
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,820
I'd be interested to talk to somebody who's been on the ground.

822
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:11,660
I saw a screen grab of a Facebook post where someone's like, hey, cast members, you got

823
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,780
to be nicer and smile.

824
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,620
We all need this right now.

825
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,940
And it's like, Jesus, what is your life?

826
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
What is your life?

827
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,100
You're posting that like, hey, come on, give that extra effort.

828
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,420
And it's like, what do you come on, lady?

829
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,800
What are you seeing where it's not like that?

830
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,460
Because I haven't been to fully operational Disney World.

831
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,620
I haven't been fully fully operational anywhere.

832
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,620
But I've been to Knott's Berry Farm for these food tasting things that everyone is so nice

833
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,920
and happy.

834
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,460
These employees are great.

835
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,060
I think you have to be looking for things to be upset about to have that point of view.

836
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,620
Yes, I agree.

837
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:57,380
I don't know how you couldn't go to these places and not just be like, you are the nicest

838
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,380
person.

839
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,380
Thank you for working.

840
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,100
You have put yourself at risk more than other people.

841
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,420
God bless you.

842
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,140
Or whatever, you know, denominational thing you want to say.

843
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,180
The people, as we've said before, one of my biggest complaints in general is I wish the

844
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,540
company had taken better care of these people in general because they're like the people

845
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,780
that make, it's nice to see these people.

846
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,380
99% of all the people that work at these places are really nice and make your time nice.

847
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:30,180
So yes, that is annoying of like, you should be smiling for me more.

848
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,660
I should be seeing you happy.

849
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,580
And you're like, shut the fuck up.

850
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,900
That's the thing to judge, I think, in the future.

851
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:45,380
If you are being unpleasant to, I mean, certainly theme park employees, but like wait staff

852
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,180
or any of these kinds of, just go.

853
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,260
Do not, this has to be dead.

854
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,260
We can't do this anymore after the year that we've had.

855
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,860
It shouldn't have been happening anyway.

856
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Yes.

857
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Got a siren now.

858
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,940
These things are going to happen.

859
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,940
But it's part of the fun.

860
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,740
You got to react and respond.

861
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,260
Could that be Jay Leno just driving around an old time police car?

862
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Hey.

863
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,860
Surely deputized in Sun jurisdiction.

864
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,460
Yeah, in Burbank, he has to be in Burbank.

865
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,060
He could probably make an arrest in Burbank.

866
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,860
Yeah, I could shoot some in the middle of the street, shoot some in the middle of Olive

867
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,900
Avenue and they wouldn't arrest me.

868
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
That would happen to me.

869
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
They wouldn't take my show away.

870
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,100
Jay Leno's garage on CNBC.

871
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,580
Oh man, I was watching a lot of Jay's garage the last couple of days.

872
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,420
Was a weird owl just gone?

873
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,940
Oh, I watched a weird owl clip.

874
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,220
They always do a funny bit at the end.

875
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,620
I was watching one with Bill Goldberg, the pro wrestler.

876
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,460
And then that ends with Jay doing a bit where he's hitting on Goldberg's wife.

877
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,100
And like Goldberg looks mixed mad and then they kick Jay out of the car and that's the

878
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,100
end of the bit.

879
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,180
And Jay is so, I love like 70 year old exhausted Jay.

880
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,540
There's something so funny about like just tired, not paying attention really when somebody

881
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,060
else is talking, which I think has been a criticism of him forever.

882
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,460
He's also, he's aging in such an interesting, bizarre way.

883
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
Tell me about it.

884
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,740
He's so top heavy and I don't mean like in a flabby way.

885
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,860
He's like an action figure.

886
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,980
He looks like a street shark or something.

887
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:19,020
But like little on the bottom, so much up there and the head's big as always.

888
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,140
I like the mane.

889
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,140
I like that.

890
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,260
Like he gets to have a little more fun with his hair.

891
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,700
You know, he used to have to be so put together on the Tonight Show, you know?

892
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
I do.

893
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,580
I don't know if he has it in him or if he'd want to or what would happen if he could,

894
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,140
I like boy, a beard would be something.

895
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,340
I'd just be so curious what that head does to a beard.

896
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,140
I'm totally into that.

897
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,380
Have you seen Jay Leno's garage where he's with Biden from a couple of years ago?

898
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,380
I did watch it post-election.

899
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,620
Yeah, actually, he's the president.

900
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,700
I should probably get to this.

901
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,740
Well, of course, it's an important piece of history now.

902
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,060
And then they're like, they do, there's a bit in it.

903
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,300
And Jay's like, oh, the guy driving up behind us, who could this be or whatever.

904
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:01,020
And then they like pull over in a parking lot and Colin Powell pulls up in a car with

905
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,980
sunglasses and I was like, what?

906
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,740
Yeah. Oh, man.

907
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,460
Anyway, check out Jay's garage on CNBC and YouTube clips.

908
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,380
Yeah. And if you're hungry for more comedy, Gutfeld.

909
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,780
And Gutfeld is always there for you too.

910
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,700
Is this the point in time where we should turn to some listener questions?

911
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,580
Make this a podcast to write post office.

912
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,420
Yeah. Unless you want a segment.

913
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,940
Do we want a palette cleanser, potentially?

914
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,060
Sure. Does someone want to do you as I have something?

915
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,300
Well, it's still your. OK, great.

916
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,620
So segments were segments, everybody.

917
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,100
Yeah, we have the time.

918
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,060
We've got some segments to celebrate.

919
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,140
And remember those.

920
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,340
So this is what I wrote down very early on in the show.

921
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,100
And we never had a spot for and at the time I called it the stitch like this.

922
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,340
And so if you if you weren't in the parks,

923
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,100
in the later aughts in the 2010s,

924
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,260
there was a period of time where Stitch was on a lot of theme park

925
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,740
merchandise, wearing theme park, you know, accoutrements,

926
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,460
mousiers, t-shirts, churros, turkey legs.

927
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,140
And that's all fine.

928
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,700
But Disney's very, you know, strict about like what they

929
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,900
let be on theme park merchandise.

930
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,700
And I wanted to see what the real stitch heads were about.

931
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,300
So I went to T-Public and I'm going to toss some some stuff out,

932
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,580
some collabs, if you will.

933
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,980
And you can tell you guys can guess whether I was able to find

934
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,580
like, say, like Stitch and Halloween.

935
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,900
OK, OK.

936
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Was I able to find a t-shirt of Stitch?

937
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,420
Wait, so that is one that is you're saying like you're going to throw us the combo.

938
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,860
And we're going to say we're going to say did they do it or not?

939
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
Well, that's pretty broad.

940
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,380
There's got to be some Stitch and Halloween.

941
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,180
Yeah. Yeah.

942
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,980
Here's a really cute like Stitch in a jack-o-lantern.

943
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,460
Wonderful. Yeah.

944
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,780
OK. So how about is there something?

945
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,780
Do you is there like a way to do is do you say like Stitch with a ding?

946
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,900
Or how do we deter if there is a Stitch or not a Stitch?

947
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,620
If Stitch wins the round, does it?

948
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,420
Oh, wait, then you have to say Ohana means family.

949
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,860
Oh, yeah. Stitch. Yeah. That's OK.

950
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,940
So the little thing. Ohana means family.

951
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,020
So that was just for the sample round.

952
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,340
OK, let's go on to the first one. Stitch and coffee.

953
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,060
That's yeah. Oh, yeah.

954
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,460
Of course. I don't care what day it is.

955
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,340
It's early. I'm grumpy. I want coffee. Stitch wants coffee.

956
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,860
So Ohana means family. Ohana means family.

957
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,260
Stitch and a Big Mac.

958
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,700
Hmm. Is that maybe there's a legal trouble there?

959
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,820
I want to say conceptually, somebody has done that, but maybe it's out on a technicality.

960
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,060
Yeah. No sign of Stitch in a Big Mac.

961
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,420
Wait. OK. So if you don't do you just do you just say no or OK?

962
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,700
That. Yeah. No. Great.

963
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,380
Stitch and adulting.

964
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,340
Yeah. Adulting. That seems that's right.

965
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,660
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good search.

966
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:30,900
Well, I did find it, but Stitch gave adulting one star overrated, overpriced, would not recommend.

967
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,500
So Ohana means family, but adulting.

968
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:39,860
No, thank you. Stitch understands the concept of adulting.

969
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,940
Stitch understands the concept of adulting.

970
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,780
Stitch and Superman.

971
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,300
Huh. Huh. That's a good question.

972
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:56,540
Now, it does Stitch playing Superman count some sort of superhero Stitch with an S on his chest?

973
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,540
I think that would count. Yeah.

974
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,140
There's got to be that right. Yes.

975
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,060
I found Batman. I found Deadpool.

976
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,340
I did not find Stitch and Superman.

977
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,860
So Deadpool. Do you remember what Deadpool was?

978
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,420
Was it just him with the mask? It's him in the costume.

979
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,420
It's him in the big red costume.

980
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,900
Hell yeah. Wear that on a first date and your date will know everything you're about.

981
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,700
And this has to be on T-Public? Oh, on T-Public.

982
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,620
OK, because there are plenty of Stitch dressed as Superman pictures.

983
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,540
Oh. OK.

984
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,460
You're looking for Mer- you're looking for all on Disney.

985
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,620
There's a way for someone to profit from this.

986
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:42,180
Right. How about Stitch and the Son of God Jesus Christ?

987
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,380
They seem like they could be opposites potentially.

988
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,820
But somebody must have combined them. I'll say Ohana means family.

989
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,220
Yeah, Ohana means family.

990
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,980
I fell in love with the man who died for me.

991
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,620
That is Stitch and the Cross. Whoa.

992
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,900
Stitch and the Cross. Wow.

993
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,940
I can't see what's on the shirt. What is Stitch's emotional state in this?

994
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,260
Stitch is gingerly holding the cross.

995
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,340
Like, just kind of gently.

996
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,820
It's not it's not a big it's not the cross he died on.

997
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,620
Or is it? It's a very big cross.

998
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,180
Yeah, it is a man sized. Wow.

999
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,340
Ohana means family.

1000
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,060
Stitch and Dreamcatchers.

1001
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,940
Interesting search.

1002
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,700
That is interesting.

1003
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,260
I'm going to say I'm just going to say no.

1004
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,100
I'll say no to switch it up.

1005
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:41,380
And unfortunately, Stitch, this is a Stitch Dreamcatcher.

1006
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,820
It is a Dreamcatcher.

1007
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,900
It's a Dreamcatcher Ohana means family.

1008
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,300
Oh, wait, it's with with ears.

1009
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,820
That's how it all makes ears. Wow. Wow.

1010
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,100
Just just a couple more. Stitch and antidepressants.

1011
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,660
Don't talk to me until I've had my antidepressants.

1012
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,500
I'll say yes. I think I'm going to say yes.

1013
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,260
And you would be correct.

1014
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,580
Here's Stitch coming out of a big bottle labeled antidepressants.

1015
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,900
If I made that up whole cloth, that would have been weird.

1016
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,260
But reality is much weirder.

1017
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,940
Coming out of one.

1018
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,700
What if he got in there and ate them all?

1019
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,660
Yeah, that's bad for him.

1020
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,620
That's bad for Stitch. Stitch.

1021
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,020
Ohana means family.

1022
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,060
Get me to a hospital.

1023
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,500
Stitch and the Blue Lies Matter movement.

1024
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,060
Oh, that's got to be yes.

1025
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,140
I hate saying yes, but of course.

1026
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:39,620
Not just one, but two different sellers.

1027
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,500
I'm surprised he's blue. Stitch, Back the Blue.

1028
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,580
Yeah. Oh my goodness.

1029
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,060
Don't bring him into this. He doesn't take sides.

1030
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,020
He's anti one thing, and that's adulting.

1031
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,780
And so to wrap it up, I'll change it up a little bit.

1032
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,740
I want you to fill in the blank

1033
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,300
of what ailment would go here.

1034
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,860
I have blank.

1035
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,220
I don't have the energy to pretend I like you today.

1036
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,580
I have blank.

1037
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,620
I don't have the energy to pretend to like you today.

1038
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,260
Oh, Stitch's ray gun.

1039
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:24,980
I have blank, like, you know, like Mondayitis.

1040
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,460
I'm sorry you're both wrong.

1041
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:32,060
I would have accepted epilepsy, fibromyalgia or diabetes.

1042
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,180
What?

1043
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,540
I have diabetes.

1044
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,380
I don't have the energy to pretend I like you today.

1045
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,260
OK, so it would be specific to whatever you have with Stitch.

1046
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,940
Interesting. Same seller.

1047
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:51,180
It might be a robot making these, but they are all different.

1048
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,380
And of course, Stitch says never give up

1049
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,820
for breast cancer awareness month.

1050
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,580
Well, that's nice.

1051
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,420
Which is nice.

1052
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,780
I thought something nice to add to it.

1053
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,540
So that's been Cross Stitch.

1054
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,580
I'm calling that Cross Stitch.

1055
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,620
Oh my god.

1056
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:13,860
I'm really stuck on you have a mood shirt about your epilepsy.

1057
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,540
No matter Stitch or not, it's bizarre.

1058
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,420
It's a little strange.

1059
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:18,940
Wow.

1060
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,100
Well, holiday means family.

1061
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,220
Oh, beautiful.

1062
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,700
OK, well, you want to crack into some some listener questions?

1063
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,460
Yes, yes.

1064
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,340
Do we need a break or anything?

1065
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:27,900
I'm good.

1066
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,500
But you know, if you guys want one.

1067
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,940
I'm probably fine.

1068
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,420
You cut the mention of the break.

1069
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,900
Sure.

1070
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,020
Just checking.

1071
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,500
Yeah.

1072
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,260
All right.

1073
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,740
Well, then let's turn to the socials,

1074
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,460
to our wonderful listeners.

1075
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,380
Thank you for helping out helping us out with Ep 200.

1076
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,900
And I have not looked at these at all.

1077
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,900
So I have not.

1078
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,180
They aren't organized whatsoever.

1079
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,700
The first one I'm seeing, if it wasn't the first I was seeing,

1080
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,220
I probably wouldn't read it because I

1081
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,540
don't like what it portends.

1082
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,540
Ryan Ritter, the real Ritter asks,

1083
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,900
as it appears California is on the verge of opening back up,

1084
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,220
Harbor Boulevard hoedown back on.

1085
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,980
And just to reacquaint you, we've done these.

1086
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,260
We got to 200 much faster than a lot of podcasts

1087
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,620
via our daily series, The City Walk Saga and the Denton Disney

1088
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,140
ordeal.

1089
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,500
There's been discussion of doing everything

1090
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,740
that's on Harbor Boulevard next to Disneyland, which seems like,

1091
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,100
yeah, it's theme park adjacent.

1092
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,980
But almost none of it is Disney affiliated.

1093
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,660
It's like a bunch of random restaurants and hotels.

1094
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,740
Right, yes.

1095
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,700
I don't want to lead with my answer.

1096
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,460
But how do you guys feel?

1097
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,580
I think I would want to, like Mike was saying,

1098
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,740
allow a little more time before we're back in.

1099
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,260
I'll run in a store once or twice a week

1100
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,860
if I can get in and out in five minutes.

1101
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:57,580
But I think I really want to get in the mix at Captain Kidd's Buffet.

1102
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,300
I really want to hunker down.

1103
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,340
Yeah, that's the thing with the Harbor Hoedown, which will happen,

1104
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,300
is happening for sure 100%.

1105
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,900
Well, I'm not saying this year.

1106
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,540
I'm just saying eventually it will have to happen.

1107
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,860
But it needs to happen the right way.

1108
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,100
We need to be able to maskless go into Captain Kidd's scoop

1109
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:22,020
from the same troughs of macaroni and cheese and day,

1110
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,860
half day old chicken wings with tongs.

1111
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,500
And we need to be able to get the full experience

1112
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,980
because I don't want to half ass the Harbor Hoedown,

1113
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,380
which is happening eventually 100%.

1114
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,220
Well, I like this maskless delay.

1115
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,900
That'll push it a while.

1116
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,300
So that'll do something for it.

1117
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,180
That might be, though, here's where I'm at.

1118
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:44,580
There's parts of me that have, you know, now thrill rides,

1119
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,740
I don't know, maybe I've lost the tolerance in general.

1120
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,420
Daily series sound better to me now after being holed up

1121
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,500
for a long time.

1122
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,340
And you know, not just disease, but baby have been in the same place.

1123
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,740
So getting out and mixing it up does sound interesting.

1124
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,980
I'm almost like maybe this has to happen sooner than later

1125
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,860
or you lose me.

1126
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,380
Interesting.

1127
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,100
Maybe I don't care anymore once I've got to do something actually fun.

1128
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,700
I hear what you're saying.

1129
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,860
So we'll we're monitoring the numbers.

1130
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,820
We're monitoring what's happening.

1131
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,900
And sooner rather than later, we could be enjoying like a big,

1132
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,620
thick glass of milk and Captain Kidd's buffet from one of those milk machines.

1133
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,820
You can get it a buffet and we're all going to sample the milk

1134
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,460
and see how it is.

1135
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,820
And we'll do an episode about just the milk.

1136
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,540
Do we have to like stay at the hotels?

1137
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,500
What are the rules of this?

1138
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,420
That's a very good question.

1139
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,820
Mostly hotels.

1140
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,020
A lot of hotels, some of them themed.

1141
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,980
I have stayed at one of the hotels on Harbor.

1142
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:41,820
Great.

1143
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,420
So I do have some information about that.

1144
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,500
I've eaten a personal pan pizza at the Pizza Hut Express in one of these hotels.

1145
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,540
So I can I can get my thoughts on that.

1146
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,220
So that's 30 minutes right there.

1147
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,020
Easy. Yeah.

1148
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,980
So we'll see.

1149
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,460
We'll see. Maybe we have Jason spend a night in one of them.

1150
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,340
Like, we'll see.

1151
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,580
Sure. This might be a good chance to reach out to some travel writers

1152
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,940
who have cataloged that sort of thing.

1153
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,140
That's possible to expert view.

1154
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,540
So, yeah, passing the buck, huh?

1155
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,620
You guys seen anything that's striking you?

1156
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,260
Yeah, this actually came in.

1157
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,340
I think it was yesterday or a couple of days ago.

1158
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,780
And I kept meaning to write back, but I thought it'd be better to tell on the air.

1159
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,380
Chris Daly, the CJVD on Twitter,

1160
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:33,180
asked, when can we expect the good boys podcast, the ride to cover the Easter

1161
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,780
Disney parade?

1162
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,700
Now, very early on in quarantine,

1163
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,780
we had plans to do a commentary on the Easter,

1164
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:47,460
one of the old Easter parades, and we had so many technical failures.

1165
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,100
We called it switches.

1166
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,380
The switches were such a mess. Yeah. Yeah.

1167
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:55,700
Yeah. You'll notice that we didn't get to our 200th twitch stream.

1168
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,380
That is not a number.

1169
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,660
I think we I think we bailed after three.

1170
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:04,740
I yeah, the daily life became so zoom based.

1171
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,940
The the video conferencing, which I'm already not super.

1172
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,660
I don't find supernatural to begin with.

1173
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,940
I've adjusted to it certainly as needed.

1174
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,300
But yeah, I we kind of put that on the back burner.

1175
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,900
But this specifically, we all ripped from YouTube one of the Easter parades

1176
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,620
and we're going to try to do a live commentary and then archive the audio somewhere.

1177
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,900
And it just just didn't.

1178
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,820
It was hard. It was so hard.

1179
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,380
It was hard. So but maybe in the future, because I always like the Easter.

1180
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Yeah. Yeah. Now that things are less than saying we'll find a new one.

1181
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,740
I want to just I want to just mention that there as usual,

1182
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,220
everyone has different opinions.

1183
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,660
Some people thrilled to be called Clifford's.

1184
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,860
Some people less than thrilled to be called Clifford's.

1185
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,700
And I just want to say, you know, unfortunately,

1186
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,180
I think everyone is Clifford's.

1187
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,660
That's just the way it goes.

1188
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,340
But I hear what you're saying.

1189
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,860
Imagine being a woman and being labeled a Clifford.

1190
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,500
That's one that I think can't that doesn't square.

1191
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,020
I don't know. I think I mean, I see some people here.

1192
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,700
No shoes. Zero three nine.

1193
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,980
And I don't know this person's gender, but they there's I'm just saying

1194
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,780
there's a lot of people.

1195
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,500
So there must be some women that are happy being Clifford's.

1196
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:27,580
Here's at Frog wife says, I absolutely identify more with being a Clifford

1197
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,620
than a good girl. So I welcome the shift.

1198
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,580
There's all right.

1199
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,580
So that's pro-Clifford.

1200
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,660
Shouldn't go making a judgment before we get some feedback.

1201
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,980
So we have feedback both pro pro and con about the Clifford situation.

1202
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,660
Let me find a different non Clifford related one that I think I'm I think

1203
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:50,060
this notion is really pushing me over the edge to me identifying as an Uncle Martin.

1204
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,340
OK, well, we can work on.

1205
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,700
Yeah, to one Uncle Martin and two Clifford.

1206
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,380
I can't you like normal things.

1207
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,660
You like this weird dinosaur that's peeing.

1208
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,380
It's not normal.

1209
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,900
You were I mean, you you were when we were talking when we had,

1210
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,420
you know, one of our most famous arguments, the Tokyo Disney Day argument.

1211
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,940
I think you were certainly being an uncle Martin back then.

1212
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,340
I guess so. Yeah.

1213
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,220
But I did. I was there for four days.

1214
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,180
I did. I know. Come around.

1215
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,260
I think you could still do it faster.

1216
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,500
But it's always possible to do it faster.

1217
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,780
But yeah, I think, look, we all we're all Uncle Martin once in a while.

1218
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,460
That's what I want to say.

1219
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,340
Oh, wait, am I up to find one?

1220
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:36,500
I don't really have if anybody has. Oh, I can I can go here.

1221
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,180
Kevin Lester is asking and this is this is a question.

1222
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,380
I mean, we talk about a lot.

1223
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,300
He says I would also love to hear each of your pitches for how to fix

1224
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,500
Tomorrowland if you were given the job.

1225
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,220
And this is obviously a big one.

1226
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,540
We could we could do a whole episode.

1227
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,940
I'm sure it is a whole episode about it.

1228
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,820
But really, I mean, they just here's here's the basics.

1229
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,540
What I what I think I need.

1230
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,620
I need movement of some kind.

1231
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,700
I can't just sit and look at an empty track.

1232
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,380
I need something. It doesn't even necessarily need to be a ride.

1233
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,100
I just need some movement going on.

1234
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,860
I need something to even be done.

1235
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,860
Like, I'm not even asking for very much at this point.

1236
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,620
What I love a giant, crazy ticket going in to the place where they have,

1237
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,460
you know, Star Wars launch bay, of course.

1238
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:26,100
That being said, just like put in a weird robot show in the center and some seats.

1239
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,180
Yeah, like just something like, oh, this is cool.

1240
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,260
And it's a fun, weird, like oddity out of the way thing with like an

1241
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,060
it could be original character, it could be a Star Wars character.

1242
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,780
It doesn't matter.

1243
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:41,060
Literally, you just need to take some of those sections right now that are dead.

1244
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,380
Yeah. And just give us a little treat.

1245
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,620
And we know what we like as far as treats are concerned.

1246
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,540
Like something, something.

1247
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:53,060
And I do like meeting the care I'd like, Kyle Oren or Chewbacca in that section.

1248
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,300
But like that's what it needs right now.

1249
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:59,540
Of course, long term, it needs some crazy overhaul.

1250
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,860
Makes space mountain, obviously is still pretty great.

1251
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,780
And that doesn't need a ton. But put in something.

1252
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,620
It could be the Tron coaster.

1253
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,740
It could be like put some other cool thing that goes all the way around Tomorrowland.

1254
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,860
I would love it to be a few like an original IP, but it's not going to be.

1255
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,180
What if you do? What if you demolish?

1256
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,020
I like the idea of carousel theater coming back.

1257
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:25,220
But what if instead what if maybe that mechanism is a roadblock, like it having to turn.

1258
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:30,220
And I don't like that Captain EO slash the audience theater has been

1259
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,420
movie previews for a long time.

1260
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,340
And I think that's garbage. That's a waste of space.

1261
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,140
So what if you do more of a stationary country bear kind of thing?

1262
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,060
Again, anything with robots will make us happy.

1263
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,460
Don't care premise. Truly anything you want.

1264
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,740
And in that, I'd be more OK with blowing up

1265
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,940
the carousel and having that be the base of Tron.

1266
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,860
If that space made any sense.

1267
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,700
I'm not sure if it does. Sure.

1268
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:00,100
This is also, by the way, how how beaten down we are about Tomorrowland.

1269
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,940
And I think we're trying to be realistic here.

1270
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,980
It's not even blue sky. Right.

1271
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,740
It's not blue sky. We're just like, give us something.

1272
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,860
Jason, any thoughts?

1273
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:14,060
Well, I always was very fond of I think I have one of the posters

1274
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,820
they used to sell of it of the, you know, retro future

1275
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,380
Tomorrowland 94 future that never was.

1276
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:24,740
I think a lot of that still looks pretty good.

1277
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,660
It seems like they've done like a half removed, like half of it

1278
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,140
and kind of like added in a lot more blue.

1279
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,100
I feel like you can still crib a lot of that,

1280
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,300
maybe updated a little to more modern

1281
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,780
design standards, modern tastes.

1282
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,460
I think some sort of people move or return would be great.

1283
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,100
Yeah. Some sort of.

1284
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,540
I didn't even say it, but of course. Yeah.

1285
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,300
Some sort of retro futurism.

1286
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,300
I think it's hard because anyone like who would be.

1287
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,940
There's a lot of very interesting writers and futurists out there

1288
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,380
that you can read in any sorts of publications.

1289
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,540
But so many public figures that are like,

1290
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,500
oh, they're looking towards the future like Elon Musk are so toxic.

1291
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,620
Like, I don't think Disney would get in business with them.

1292
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,780
If they're smart, they won't get in business with them.

1293
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,380
But I think, you know, if they'll need corporate sponsorships

1294
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,020
and I think the best rides that, you know, a lot of rides,

1295
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,700
most rides have had some sort of corporate sponsorship

1296
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,060
at some point in time.

1297
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,660
I think companies just need to take a back seat to their narrative.

1298
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,020
Like their narrative, the story, whatever, you know, Mitsubishi

1299
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,860
or Ford or whatever sponsor is telling needs to take a backseat

1300
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,100
to just pure entertainment.

1301
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,220
Yeah, yeah.

1302
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:50,860
So I don't think some like message driven

1303
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,980
like ad motto driven ride is going to play in 2025.

1304
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,740
I mean, I thought it was kind of cute.

1305
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,060
And I was a kid when you left Space Mountain in Florida

1306
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,260
and there was the little FedEx box on Mars. Sure.

1307
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,300
Like, I didn't mind that. That was that was enough.

1308
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:09,500
Not every sponsorship is so eye rolling for summer fun. Yeah.

1309
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:13,740
I mean, it was very funny to learn about, like, as we were doing

1310
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,820
some Epcot pavilions that like, oh, the parent company of this ride

1311
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,860
was in like a Cold War with the parent company of this ride.

1312
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:24,620
Yeah. Yeah.

1313
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,860
And the last thing I'll say, though, is if you're going to finally do

1314
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:31,180
something like what you're talking about, let all the rides

1315
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,900
intersect with the other rides.

1316
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,580
Yeah, we want that back. That's what I want back.

1317
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,780
It doesn't even matter what the ride, as long as it's moving

1318
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,620
and you can go through another ride and see into the other ride

1319
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,540
you're going into. So cool. So cool. Yeah.

1320
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,260
So but who knows, maybe it'll never happen because of Disney forward.

1321
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,700
Here's a speculative thing that I like.

1322
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,260
And this also opens up a whole episode can worms as it should.

1323
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,900
This is from Criley Tucker.

1324
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,860
Would Disney's America have been a cool Epcot lame

1325
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,140
or like a bad DCA 1.0 type lame?

1326
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:11,500
Disney's America, to fill you in what they were going to build in Virginia.

1327
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,500
That was a historical theme park

1328
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,860
in a broad strokes media term.

1329
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,380
It was always presented like it's going to be built on a real civil war

1330
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,820
battleground. I don't know that that's actually true, but near enough

1331
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,980
to like real historical sites, the people were upset.

1332
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,980
They got chased out of town.

1333
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,180
It was like a bad time PR wise.

1334
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,980
Eisner was on the decline.

1335
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,420
We'll get into all we really got to do that.

1336
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,300
That's a big, I just haven't thought about it in a while.

1337
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:43,140
But that specific question from what we know about it, because

1338
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,140
one thing I do and I like this question because I think it would be there

1339
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,460
and it'd be weird.

1340
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,180
I think it'd be I think in twenty twenty one. Yeah.

1341
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:56,380
Disney's America would be so strange and either they would have had

1342
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:00,500
to change it entirely or like there's no way just a ninety six

1343
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,100
like historical park.

1344
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,300
No, it's just what it is still many years later.

1345
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:09,380
There's Disney's America would have gone through so many different

1346
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:13,900
like changes to the robot show to include like a little more nuance

1347
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,420
when it came to American history. That would be my guess.

1348
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,620
I yeah, we've had to do some.

1349
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:22,860
I mean, the explainer, the Vox level explainers

1350
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,140
that takes on Disney's America would have in twenty twenty one,

1351
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,860
which would have been awful.

1352
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:31,380
Like, yeah, I would guess that whatever the version of history

1353
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,940
they would want to present in nineteen ninety six would not have aged so well

1354
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,380
by now. I don't think a lot of it each well.

1355
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,260
Nineteen ninety six. Of course.

1356
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,420
No, the whole it's good that they didn't do this.

1357
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,460
But yeah, like all right.

1358
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:49,140
In ninety six is it do we walk around and like this is sort of charming

1359
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,580
in a not so way or was it would it have been bad?

1360
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,100
That's that's the question.

1361
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,900
Is it going at ninety and ninety six?

1362
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,620
I'm trying to think what opens in around ninety six to see

1363
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:04,260
like what kind of level of theming, because I don't know that it would have been

1364
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:08,580
as bad as California Adventure 1.0 again, as far as theming is concerned,

1365
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:13,820
not as far as actual like not like information or what you learn.

1366
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,420
What version of the idealistic

1367
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:22,700
Walt loving type of like great white people history you're learning there.

1368
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,860
But as far as like how nice are the buildings?

1369
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,580
As far as that, you know, that question, it's like

1370
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,380
I could see it.

1371
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,500
I could see it being like very nicely themed and you go, well,

1372
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,500
the houses here look really nice and it looks like maybe very period authentic.

1373
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,660
Like I could see that still being the case.

1374
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,020
Like, you know, Disney's America, a real mess.

1375
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,140
Don't bring your kids there unless you're going to really sit them down

1376
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,420
and explain the actual reality of America.

1377
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,020
That being said, I want you to pay attention to the details in the rooms

1378
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,140
because the trim they used inside was actually the real trim.

1379
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,140
Like there is that chance.

1380
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,860
And I think it's I think it's likely that that might have happened.

1381
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,340
This one barbecue restaurant is very charming.

1382
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,020
But besides that, there's a lot of bad narratives in the.

1383
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:10,460
So I that I kind of think it might have actually ended up being like

1384
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,820
very aesthetically pleasing.

1385
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,940
And again, this is just from some art I've seen.

1386
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,140
Yeah, we don't know a lot, but we'll dive.

1387
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,980
Maybe we'll dive a little deeper.

1388
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,420
Maybe this year do Disney's America.

1389
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:24,500
Honestly, I like the idea of of us rolling up our sleeves on an episode

1390
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,540
and really fixing Tomorrowland.

1391
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,540
I know we should.

1392
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:28,860
I'm thinking we should do that for sure.

1393
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,820
Yeah, yeah, big time.

1394
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:33,060
Well, and analyze what have how did it get so bad?

1395
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,300
Where do we get to this point and how do we get out of it? Right.

1396
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,820
I've got one here from Corn Dare.

1397
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:44,460
In this hypothetical future, they've just announced a new season

1398
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,420
of Ryan Murphy's feud, and it's Eisner versus Katzenberg.

1399
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,220
Who plays who? Oh, man.

1400
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,780
I just project.

1401
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,740
I just finished the audio book of Disney War.

1402
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,420
And oh, yeah, you've been telling us good stuff from that.

1403
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,660
That book is a trip.

1404
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,340
I mean, an adaptation of that would be something. Right.

1405
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:09,060
I think the only person who the craziest thing coming out of it.

1406
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,700
One, the Frank Wells

1407
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,100
comes out as a saint.

1408
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,980
Like he there's not really a bad Frank Wells stuff.

1409
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:22,060
The most sympathetic character seemingly in that store, in the book,

1410
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,860
is oddly enough, CAA founder Michael Ovitz.

1411
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,980
Really interesting kind of gets tied in to like taking over

1412
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:35,340
for Wells and gets thrown into the deep end with no guidance and no help.

1413
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,020
And it's not really his he's an agent.

1414
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,380
He's not unapplicable, but it's not.

1415
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:43,220
Yeah, well, the same job he's put into. Yeah.

1416
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,580
Yeah. Like he really imploded in a big way.

1417
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:50,300
Like he was the king of Hollywood and then sort of faded.

1418
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:54,380
Yeah. He seemingly was brought into Disney because he was Eisner's best friend.

1419
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:55,940
And then he was given no support.

1420
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,660
And that was very interesting.

1421
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,660
There's a lot of interesting stuff in the book.

1422
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,820
The audiobooks pretty good.

1423
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:06,500
There's one or two moments where I don't know that I would have attempted to do

1424
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,060
a certain I wouldn't have done that.

1425
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,340
What the narrator did.

1426
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,100
I don't know if I would have done that voice inflection of the head of Sony.

1427
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,140
I don't know that. I would have just might have said that a little flat.

1428
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,140
But those are pretty quick.

1429
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,780
That was only happened once or twice.

1430
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,940
And 2004 was a different time, I guess.

1431
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,140
But overall, it's a very interesting book.

1432
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,980
So so who is it?

1433
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,020
Yeah, I'm looking at pictures of them just to I got a cheat.

1434
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,740
Well, my for all the time I had fries near like adjacent Momoa or

1435
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:41,980
I'm trying to think of a different like Brad Pitt's little too old,

1436
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,780
but it's in the zone.

1437
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:48,780
Yeah, yeah. I don't know a rod or, you know, who's like really handsome,

1438
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:52,380
charismatic and Chris Evans, maybe? Sure.

1439
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,420
Yeah, yeah. I think any Avenger would pretty much be.

1440
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,500
Yeah, Hemsworth Evans. Yeah.

1441
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,020
This, by the way, we're going to cut this part and we're going to send this

1442
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,900
to his company.

1443
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,580
This is just a random sample of the kind of thing they talk about

1444
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,060
on the show. We didn't even share.

1445
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,140
We just like snipped a random part. Right.

1446
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,140
So, you know, see if you like it.

1447
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,780
And we're all very excited for the tops IPO for the.

1448
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,780
Oh, yeah. Tops IPO.

1449
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,460
Talk about the tops IPO.

1450
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,420
We really want to get the word out. Yeah.

1451
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:26,500
I have been watching more baseball in 2020 and 2021 than I have in my life.

1452
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,340
I found it very soothing during the pandemic.

1453
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,540
You know, you know, we got to know who would have been good

1454
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:37,900
when he was younger is like vacation era Chevy Chase.

1455
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,700
Oh, I could see that.

1456
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,540
There's like an energy that I get from like seeing young

1457
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,700
younger Eisner and like meetings and like how I hear people describe him.

1458
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:49,060
Like he's very like kind of excitable, maybe a little erratic kind of.

1459
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:50,780
Like he's got a lot of energy.

1460
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,940
And like he's giving a lot of ideas and some of them are terrible.

1461
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,380
Some of them are great.

1462
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:57,660
I could I feel like Chevy chasing that era.

1463
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,140
I could I could see it.

1464
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,620
Yeah, that's really good.

1465
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:03,380
I think that the hair is a similar vibe.

1466
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,300
Similar level of the way his hair receded.

1467
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,500
Yeah. In the right era.

1468
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,740
Definitely could have been not now. I like that.

1469
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,500
Katzenberg.

1470
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,540
Yeah, I think he got to go.

1471
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,740
Giamatti, Paul Giamatti.

1472
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,180
I was thinking that.

1473
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:24,500
And he plays so many of the great like real world's nuts, you know,

1474
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,780
not that he well, whatever, you know, interesting figures from.

1475
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,060
He's he's Eugene Landy.

1476
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,620
He's the guy, the manager in the NWA story.

1477
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,620
I feel like there's a there's a bunch.

1478
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,860
Yeah, yeah, boy, that'd be a historic.

1479
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:42,740
I mean, and when we when he was alive, Philip Seymour Hoffman.

1480
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,340
I mean, he's just like the greatest actors.

1481
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:48,420
He's the greatest actors of all time.

1482
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,340
Is this the interesting character?

1483
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,020
Lewis could do it.

1484
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,300
Katzenberg in the book is a very interesting.

1485
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,580
He keeps scheduling like six a.m. meetings as a power play.

1486
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,820
He's just constantly pounding Diet Coke.

1487
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:04,460
He ends up there's like a massive lawsuit for him to get a proper bonus,

1488
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,900
which was very in plain English in the contract.

1489
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,020
And they fought him all the way.

1490
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,700
How about I throw out an idea, like an imaginary of Dr.

1491
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,900
Parnass, what's the guy's name, Parnassus?

1492
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:21,260
Yeah, we three of us play Eisner and we just take turns in different scenes

1493
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:26,140
or in that don't the Bob Dylan movie where he's played by like 10 different people.

1494
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,660
Yeah, yeah.

1495
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,820
And a child to show his childlike wonder.

1496
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,060
Right. That's good, too.

1497
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,820
So I could see that being when my son's old enough.

1498
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:41,420
I've figured out something very special for you to do.

1499
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,220
My my my biggest love will play my second biggest love.

1500
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,660
I'm sorry I miss those.

1501
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,860
Yeah. Yeah. Make sure you get that clear.

1502
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:59,100
I think also if Disney itself could make an Eisner movie

1503
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:03,100
and just make it obviously the the perfect history version,

1504
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,460
like they did with P.L. Travers with that movie,

1505
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:09,500
then you can start putting whoever plays Eisner into like the Avengers

1506
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,380
and the Star Wars or whatever.

1507
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:16,500
And like the girl who gets saved by Michael Eisner at the end of one of the.

1508
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,940
Well, you know, you want to talk retconning.

1509
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,300
Big fan of the late shift.

1510
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,140
I really love the late shift.

1511
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,020
Any interest in an episode about the late shift?

1512
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,300
Is that too off topic? It might be.

1513
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,540
Let us know.

1514
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,860
But if you're if you're up for it, you know, we would talk about the late shift,

1515
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,620
the HBO movie for for a long time.

1516
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,500
Michael Ovech.

1517
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,180
Podcast. Oh, yeah.

1518
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:41,940
I still think about the scripted podcast or just like doing a TV show of it

1519
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,860
like once a week. Yeah, God. Oh, a sequel.

1520
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,220
Oh, what a what a dream.

1521
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,700
You got to talk to Betty Thomas about this.

1522
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,260
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yes.

1523
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,980
She did a great job. She's back on board.

1524
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:55,340
Wouldn't it be funny if the first podcast to ride outside of podcast

1525
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,500
was we were working on a late shift show?

1526
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,780
So we're finally expanding the late shift.

1527
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:03,060
I mean, a lot of old IP is coming back.

1528
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,100
It's not a reality show where we go on roller coasters.

1529
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,900
It's where we want to like see more of Jay Leno in a closet,

1530
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,060
which honestly, now they say it makes perfect sense. Yeah.

1531
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:16,500
But I was going to say a character in the big character in that movie,

1532
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,100
Michael Ovech, has played by Treat Williams.

1533
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,140
Oh, yeah. Treat Williams comes back

1534
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,460
and now it's now it's all connected.

1535
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,260
Now we're building a Marvel universe. Right. Yeah.

1536
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,780
Yes. The Treat Williams.

1537
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,220
It would be I was thinking a potential Katzenberg is Bob Balaban.

1538
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,500
But if we were going to build this greater universe,

1539
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,300
Bob Balaban is already Warren Littlefield's famous, of course,

1540
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,460
late shift movie. So unless but now a double duty

1541
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,820
Balaban can only be good for a film. But right.

1542
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,900
You know, that's I don't want to, you know, push him into that.

1543
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,060
He's an esteemed actor.

1544
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,660
Wallace Shawn is Wallace Shawn.

1545
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,260
Is Wallace Shawn Roy E.

1546
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,700
Roy E. Disney, a big character in that era.

1547
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,620
Oh, good. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah.

1548
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:02,900
But can't you also see him getting riled up in the right way to be Katzenberg?

1549
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,860
Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.

1550
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,580
You could Irishman some of these people and de-age them.

1551
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,180
Why don't we just I mean, them, you know, we want the greatest.

1552
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,060
We want De Niro and De Niro and Pesci would be great.

1553
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,060
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

1554
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,660
That's a very good point.

1555
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,740
Well, who will pay young Gutfeld, though?

1556
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,060
OK, well, I have one here.

1557
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,460
This is a fun one.

1558
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:34,180
This is Ellie Warren at Ellie wrote that now this is addressed to Mike and Jason,

1559
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,140
but I'm going to throw it to Scott, of course, to Mike and Jason.

1560
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:39,540
Now that we're allowed to drink in Disneyland, I must know what famous person

1561
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:44,260
or duo would you task with creating a Disneyland exclusive celebrity tequila?

1562
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:47,540
And would the story of its creation be better than the briefcase story?

1563
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,940
Well, first of all, no, it could never whatever creates.

1564
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:53,580
There's never going to be a better tequila creation story

1565
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,820
than the Casamigo story. Yeah.

1566
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,460
Best story we've ever heard.

1567
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,060
I mean, the only thing that comes close is the saga The Hemisphere Dancer.

1568
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:04,740
And two stories that we like. What's that again? Oh.

1569
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:11,380
Jason, I discussed it on a podcast and I tried to tell it and I was cut off.

1570
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,380
Finally, a host and some balls.

1571
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,340
He didn't know he was Brett Davis.

1572
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,060
He didn't know what he was doing, but he accidentally cut me off

1573
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,100
in the middle of a hemisphere dancer explanation.

1574
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,500
Bless you, Brett. I don't blame you.

1575
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,500
I have no idea how much you helped.

1576
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,820
So wait, OK.

1577
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:37,180
But so we're I mean, is that is there an attempt to pimp the answer

1578
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,980
into being Clooney and Gerber? Well, that answer.

1579
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:42,300
Are we thinking? No, no, I don't think so.

1580
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,900
I think you guys.

1581
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,260
Well, obviously, that would be the dream is if we did it.

1582
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:49,020
But I think I think I think first, I think as long as the ground

1583
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,580
rules are laid down, that no, the origin story won't be better,

1584
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,060
but it could be a different duo of people.

1585
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:58,580
Who would it be? Who would make sense in 2021 and the Disney family

1586
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,420
that would make sense that they have a partnership with Disney?

1587
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:05,700
Because they have the wines from Kurt Russell and Parker and what have you.

1588
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,980
Right. Yeah.

1589
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,660
How's Robert Downey not in the liquor game?

1590
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,820
That's all the mega people.

1591
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,020
He's sober. So all right.

1592
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,660
Right. Oh, yeah. So he can't do that.

1593
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,180
That would be a bad thing.

1594
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,420
I mean, obviously, he doesn't have to have any involvement with it whatsoever,

1595
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,620
but probably in general. Yeah. Yeah.

1596
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,100
That would be a no go.

1597
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,140
As far as like, you know, big the rather getting the rock in the family.

1598
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,020
But he already has his own thing going on.

1599
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,300
So I don't think he wants to be tied to Disney completely.

1600
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,100
He has his own brand.

1601
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,100
I'm trying to think of who else, because like your stars of yesteryear,

1602
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:44,140
your Suzanne Pluchette and your Kurt Russell's Bob Newhart,

1603
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:50,060
Bob Newhart, you know, Bob Newhart's 90 year old Bob Newhart could be involved.

1604
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,820
The easy answer might be a Tom Hanks, Tim Allen duo

1605
01:16:56,980 --> 01:17:02,380
teaming up with a celebrity tequila, Woody and Buzz's tequila.

1606
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,940
And it's some like it's a translation from another language,

1607
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:09,380
and the translation is friend in me.

1608
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,940
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's friends?

1609
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,300
Oh, yeah. That would be great.

1610
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,180
But if you want the top shelf, like the Pappy Van Winkle,

1611
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:21,260
like top shelf tequila to go along with that, you get Chris Evans,

1612
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:24,140
because this is it's not the toy tequila.

1613
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:28,300
It's the tequila that the it's the raw from the barrel tequila

1614
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:31,820
from the pure agave that the raw agave is based on.

1615
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,340
Amigo en mi would be the that's

1616
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,780
yeah, friend in this.

1617
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,580
We could have known we could have guessed that one.

1618
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,020
I guess that was that difficult.

1619
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,100
But maybe you got to do it like a deeper.

1620
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,180
It's like, you know, it's we just we go into some,

1621
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:52,100
you know, Estonian type language to disguise it more. Right.

1622
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:56,900
But then, huh, I do like the do like the sound of that.

1623
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:00,740
The two of them, I mean, now that truck goes by.

1624
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:02,340
Oh, and what is it?

1625
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:06,700
Is it them? Like it's not them in the costumes and it's not Woody and Buzz

1626
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,980
because they don't want to associate the characters with alcohol.

1627
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,740
But is it like little nods in that?

1628
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:17,860
Is it like that one's in a cow that Tom's in a cool cowboy hat

1629
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:22,260
and Tim is in? What? I got it.

1630
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:26,620
I got it. It's just two hands like toasting glasses.

1631
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,420
And the one stir stick is like a cowboy hat on the end.

1632
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,820
And the other is a spaceman helmet on the end.

1633
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,380
Oh, that's pretty good.

1634
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,820
Light years ahead of any tequila on the market.

1635
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:40,420
Years ahead. That's pretty good.

1636
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,340
That's a little more.

1637
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:45,340
I was going to say the big duo right now is Falcon and Winter Soldier.

1638
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,620
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They could do it, too.

1639
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:50,900
I was going to pitch with Tim and Tim and Tom that the

1640
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:55,420
the truck is actually three motorcycles with the two of them

1641
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,220
and then Randy Newman, also next to them on a motorcycle.

1642
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,660
Seventy eight year old Randy Newman.

1643
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,460
You got to have a Randy if you're going to do a premium tequila.

1644
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,860
Yeah. Better have a Randy.

1645
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,940
I think Randy should be driving a motorcycle

1646
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,860
and then they should each be in a sidecar.

1647
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:09,900
Oh, that's good, too.

1648
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,900
A motorcycle with two sidecar stash.

1649
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,500
Somebody could draw that for us, please.

1650
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,460
Another potential tagline.

1651
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,900
You are a tequila.

1652
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,460
Sure. That's true.

1653
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,780
Randy, re-record it.

1654
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,460
Well, that's all that's all great.

1655
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,740
That should that should be made.

1656
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,420
Thank you, listeners, for your for your questions

1657
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:38,580
and for listening to this experimental in the elements episode.

1658
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,220
We got a couple more things, right?

1659
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,500
Mike, you got something to say?

1660
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,180
We could also do do we also do the other one in a track?

1661
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,940
Oh, sure.

1662
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:51,620
Mine is mine is a something that I realized as I was pulling up.

1663
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,740
I go, you know, I should have told him

1664
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,420
so we could work this out because the bit will be better.

1665
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,540
But let's do it anyway.

1666
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,340
OK, OK.

1667
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:02,300
I want to I want to debut a new segment called PTR 400.

1668
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:04,500
OK, OK.

1669
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,500
This is 200 episodes right now.

1670
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,700
And you're talking about 400.

1671
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,660
And what is and the idea I had and again, this is why I'm starting to doubt it,

1672
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:14,820
was that we format this much like the Conan O'Brien segment in the year 2000.

1673
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,580
Well, yes, those are yes, those were written an inch of their life.

1674
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:20,500
Like jokes.

1675
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,460
And I went, you know what?

1676
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,260
Hmm. I first said we should really have planned this.

1677
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,980
But, you know, we'll see what happens.

1678
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,900
And if we have to edit it out, we have to edit it out.

1679
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:34,140
OK, so we're imagining what is the 400th.

1680
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:38,980
So basically all I'm thinking is this will go around and we'll do a few,

1681
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:42,780
just a couple, and each one of us will say something that could be

1682
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:47,460
happened on the show by podcast, the right 400, maybe in each of our lives.

1683
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,420
It could be anything, really.

1684
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:53,820
But when we get to podcast the right 400, what will have happened? Yeah.

1685
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,340
By podcast, the right 400.

1686
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,940
One hundred and four of those will have been the harbor hoedown.

1687
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:07,540
So we'll be there approximately this time next year.

1688
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,020
And then we'll say podcast the right 400.

1689
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,220
Jason, do you want to go? Sure.

1690
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:17,660
By podcast, the right 400.

1691
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:23,380
I will have completed my trip to Japan to tour the theme.

1692
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,460
Whoa. Oh, then we get the real one.

1693
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:27,980
This is exciting because you can do real ones.

1694
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:28,820
So the segment is good.

1695
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:32,860
And I will also finally be being released

1696
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:36,500
from the Japanese prison I had been confined in.

1697
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,620
Podcast the right 400.

1698
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:43,900
We will have had Randy Gerber on the show.

1699
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:47,980
Podcast the right 400.

1700
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,420
We're talking real ones.

1701
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,140
This is a high bar. Maybe we should set it.

1702
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,420
Dollywood. Oh, yeah.

1703
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,300
Podcast the right 400.

1704
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,380
I don't like this part of it, but let's keep going.

1705
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,700
Greg Gutfeld

1706
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,380
will have really given Disney the business

1707
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:15,220
for introducing oat milk at their coffee outlets in the parks.

1708
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,020
Podcast the right 400.

1709
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:23,740
Liberal commie bunk.

1710
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:27,940
I will sit through at least two more

1711
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,220
Disney timeshare presentations

1712
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:35,780
for or maybe not for free fast passes.

1713
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,100
Podcast the right 400.

1714
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,100
But that's happening.

1715
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,820
That's regardless of if we stopped doing the show.

1716
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,900
Oh, that's a good point. So you would still.

1717
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,300
Yes, that is a good point.

1718
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,220
OK, well, I think

1719
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,740
let's see, we've got the second gate

1720
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,420
by podcast the right 400.

1721
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,300
We're up to the 12th gate, which is

1722
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:03,940
10 times we can avoid that ninth gate.

1723
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,500
We're up to

1724
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:11,420
and that is that's ten thousand dollars a month.

1725
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,980
But I don't know. But what's the what do you get for 10?

1726
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:17,580
What's what's the desired for ten thousand dollars a month?

1727
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,860
Jason will kiss you on the mouth.

1728
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,900
We book you a room at the Grand Californian

1729
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:27,420
that it's only five thousand dollars a month.

1730
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:30,740
So we live in the Grand Californian.

1731
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,740
No, just I it's just however long it gets you.

1732
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:37,380
But it's booked by Mike will book.

1733
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,420
Mike will place to live in the Grand Californian.

1734
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:43,940
Unfortunately, he takes a 100 percent commission.

1735
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:49,020
It appears by podcast the right 400, 400.

1736
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,300
Yes.

1737
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,740
Where were we? Who said the last?

1738
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,580
Oh, you said I just said one, but we could end it whenever.

1739
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,220
Any other dreams of a podcast?

1740
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:00,500
You know, I will podcast.

1741
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:04,420
I will say podcast, or I will do something maybe that's not a podcast.

1742
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,060
I don't even know where I'm going with that, but I feel like that would be good.

1743
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,100
Yeah, interesting.

1744
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,220
It could be the late shift.

1745
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,140
Could be something else.

1746
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:15,260
You're so OK. Oh, that count like our our first narrative project.

1747
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,140
Maybe. Yeah, yeah.

1748
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:20,740
Or it's just a yeah, we just record some more video and parks.

1749
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:21,900
And that's it.

1750
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,020
YouTube and yeah, great.

1751
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,620
Tick tocking. Don't have the tick tock presence yet.

1752
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,580
No pressure. Can't wait.

1753
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:30,300
Can't wait to do it.

1754
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:35,140
And that, I guess, is podcast the right 400.

1755
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,740
Except that I you know what will happen by then.

1756
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,460
A lot of good times.

1757
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,580
Good fun, good in person.

1758
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,940
Yes. God's sake.

1759
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,500
I can't wait to keep to it.

1760
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,220
We'll keep zooming a little unless I don't know.

1761
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,220
We'll see.

1762
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,260
I will. We'll just determine when we're back.

1763
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:53,980
We'll see. Yeah.

1764
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:58,020
But I think what it also hopefully leads to is getting out there

1765
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,380
and mixing it up in the world.

1766
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:02,300
You know what? We've been able to do a lot of research and stuff.

1767
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:04,940
And we've been able to go to drive through experiences.

1768
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:09,140
But getting back and doing things, going to place places we haven't been.

1769
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,620
This is what I'm excited for.

1770
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,580
There'll be a lot of this by podcast the right four.

1771
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,100
Yeah. Gradual steps.

1772
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,100
That's what I was saying to someone earlier.

1773
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,540
Baby steps.

1774
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:20,900
Don't do what I did last year and go from just sitting on a couch

1775
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,380
to suddenly in the middle of a set.

1776
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:27,940
Because that was a terrible move on my part.

1777
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,780
Yes. He's back and decided.

1778
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:34,620
But yes, well, there'll be they're going to let's we're going to milk

1779
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,260
going back to all these parks.

1780
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:39,060
We're going to get episodes out of these these journeys back

1781
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:42,460
and give you trip reports and yeah, that'll happen.

1782
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:47,220
And on that note, here's one one final thing.

1783
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:52,380
You know, in our feeling nostalgic for 2017, when we started doing the show

1784
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,780
and when we that's right, right?

1785
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:58,940
I think, yeah, 2017, 2017, about five or six months before it launched.

1786
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,740
Wow, that's right. Yeah, we're building up a little bit.

1787
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,220
And and we had we had segments back then and we had one that

1788
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:09,060
the intent was to do monthly until we realized we could just talk

1789
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:12,220
into infinity about any topic for over two hours easily.

1790
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:17,660
So we talked about doing every month was the animatronic of the month.

1791
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,460
That was going to be so recurring.

1792
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:23,700
And we've so let down on that we haven't named one of those in God knows when.

1793
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:28,380
And with that in mind, I think you got to go broader than the month.

1794
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:31,020
You got to go bigger being that it's been so long.

1795
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,580
I think that we need to name an animatronic of the year.

1796
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:38,220
And not just that, but my other thought on this,

1797
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:41,860
there's a lot of animatronics that are about to be turned back on.

1798
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:46,620
Wonderfully, magically for the first time in over a year.

1799
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:50,540
And, you know, we could honor the ones that have just been going in Florida.

1800
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,300
But why not give it up for the ones that have been been stuck,

1801
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:59,580
just gathering dust since last March when all the crazy crap happened.

1802
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:03,140
And so that's why I proposed the segment

1803
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:06,140
dormant animatronic of the year.

1804
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:11,140
Yeah. Give it up for these guys who are about to have purpose once once more.

1805
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:14,700
I think we can all agree the animatronic of 2020 was

1806
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,860
male functioning Donald in the Mexico Pavilion

1807
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,260
that was eventually replaced with a particle board cut out.

1808
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:25,020
And at one point in time, a potted plant and at one point in time,

1809
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:29,340
a potted plant with a sombrero thrown on it and then eventually nothing.

1810
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,700
I mean, that's a way to go out.

1811
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:35,860
Some animatronics just break and then you don't see them again.

1812
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:39,220
But Donald made a big stink on the way out.

1813
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,820
And and we'll never forget it.

1814
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:45,940
But dormant soon to come to life ones. Yes.

1815
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,020
Yeah. Yeah. Does anybody feel like you feel like starting?

1816
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,660
I don't, because I kind of think now that I'm thinking about it,

1817
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,020
I didn't follow the assignment so well. OK, that's fine.

1818
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,780
I have one. You go ahead first. Yeah. OK, great.

1819
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:00,100
I would like to nominate an animatronic

1820
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,660
that I learned had a name.

1821
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:07,420
I didn't realize he had a name. His name is Pickwick.

1822
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:12,460
He is the ghost hanging off the chandelier via cane,

1823
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:15,660
holding a glass of wine in the Haunted Mansion. Yes.

1824
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,060
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1825
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,460
Scene. Yes.

1826
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,780
Who maybe will get to Pickwick this year on the Haunted Mansion episode.

1827
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,420
We will see. It's like around the corner.

1828
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:25,860
We're going to get to Pickwick.

1829
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:28,860
There's a lot of crazy characters.

1830
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,260
There are a lot of different characters.

1831
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,620
I mean, we kind of laid out what we're going to do,

1832
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:34,860
but who knows what's going to happen when we actually get in there.

1833
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:40,620
Pickwick is like the closest to where it's like the first thing we'll see.

1834
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,460
I mean, maybe there's like some sort of secret

1835
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,580
rolly crump like artwork on the floor.

1836
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:45,940
We didn't notice. That's true.

1837
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:47,420
I know the track enough.

1838
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,260
What sort of woodworking was done in that room?

1839
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:53,300
There was an insect infestation in the exact hallway.

1840
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,140
We're going to pass through.

1841
01:28:55,140 --> 01:29:00,580
OK, Pickwick. Pickwick is hanging off the chandelier via his cane.

1842
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,940
He's having the time of his life.

1843
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:07,580
And I think he's a great representation of the optimism that

1844
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:12,460
much of us are all feeling after over a year of doom and gloom.

1845
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,860
And then suddenly, like, you know,

1846
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:20,420
you just stepped on the gas and everything started happening out here.

1847
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,980
It was like, you know, night and day recently.

1848
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:24,620
The seasons changed.

1849
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:27,180
And then suddenly everyone's just like,

1850
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,020
yeah, you can get it.

1851
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:30,780
You just drive to Bakersfield for the vaccine.

1852
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,100
Yeah, just crazy.

1853
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:37,060
Yeah. I mean, if, you know, they're talking about it's going to be a roaring 20s.

1854
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:41,260
It's going to be such an indulgent time and Pickwick's obviously indulgent.

1855
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,660
We're all we're all going to be Pickwick's hopefully soon enough.

1856
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:46,300
Hang on. We're all taking.

1857
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:50,700
It's much easier to take pictures of our food in 2020 as opposed to 1920.

1858
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:54,700
You used to have to have a big contraption and then wait days to get it back.

1859
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,820
And is that why he's on the chandelier?

1860
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,060
Is he trying to get an overhead shot of the food on the table?

1861
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,940
Oh, yes. Is he an influencer?

1862
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:06,580
The original influencer with an old film camera.

1863
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:10,900
Pickwick is a TikTok comedian now.

1864
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,900
TikTok.

1865
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,460
All right. Pickwick is our first nominee.

1866
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,860
I'm excited to talk about Pickwick whenever we get to.

1867
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,620
I am going to I am going to still pick my pick.

1868
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,300
And I'm just I've changed around to exactly how I'm formatting.

1869
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,580
Don't worry. It'll be the same.

1870
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:27,020
You know, we're saluting animatronics that are, you know, about to be turned on.

1871
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:31,860
But in the same way, what about saluting an animatronic that can't be turned on?

1872
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:35,740
Oh, and maybe you're saying that doesn't that's not an animatronic, Michael.

1873
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:39,580
Maybe you've accidentally said that you're going to salute a statue.

1874
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:40,860
And maybe that is what I'm doing.

1875
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:42,820
But I would like to salute Mr.

1876
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:46,340
Incredible, perpetually reaching for Jack Jack saying no no cookie.

1877
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:49,180
OK, he deserves credit.

1878
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:52,660
I consider him an animatronic because it sort of suggests movement.

1879
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:56,020
And maybe, yeah, technically, he's not a robot and he's not moving around.

1880
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,700
But we're going by so fast.

1881
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:01,220
You can you can sense like, oh, he's like really trying to do it.

1882
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:04,940
And I'd like to salute that that animatronic else call him

1883
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:08,300
because, you know, he he can't be turned on.

1884
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,820
That is what he's stuck like that forever.

1885
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:13,300
He's stuck like that for our enjoyment.

1886
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,860
And for the last year, he's had to be stuck in that.

1887
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:18,500
That looks like a very stressful position he's in.

1888
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,620
And he's had to not be entertaining people.

1889
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:23,700
At the very least, he could say, you know, I'm in a horrible position.

1890
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:26,020
I don't have a bottom half at all.

1891
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,260
But at least people are having enjoyment and they're smelling this

1892
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,620
slightly cookieish smell.

1893
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:35,500
I don't know that it always barely noticed it smells really a ton like cookies.

1894
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:40,220
But I think he deserves recognition, especially in the last year when

1895
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:44,220
he knows the other robots are going to be turned on, but he can't be turned on.

1896
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,300
He's stuck.

1897
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,860
That's a very good framing.

1898
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,620
And we do need to give that's a very specific plight.

1899
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:51,900
There's people who wish he was an animatronic, but he is not.

1900
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,820
We have to love him for what he is. Exactly.

1901
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:58,500
So Mr. Incredible in the tunnel is a candidate number two.

1902
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,660
Candidate number three.

1903
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:06,340
You know, for all of us, this this holiday season, the holidays in 2020

1904
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:07,740
were very difficult.

1905
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:11,500
Most of us could not see our families, could not gather

1906
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,740
and sing our favorite holiday songs.

1907
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:17,860
So imagine if you represented the holidays

1908
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:22,020
and the holidays came and went without a single visitor or jolt of electricity

1909
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,140
through your withered wires.

1910
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:27,860
Woe is the plight of the holiday overlay animatronic.

1911
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:33,020
Stuck in the crate where you already spend most of your lonely year as it is.

1912
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:37,220
And imagine then if you represented a second holiday, too,

1913
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:40,940
which you also miss and is also sad for everybody.

1914
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:45,500
And on top of that, an increasingly loud mob of unappreciative

1915
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:51,140
theme park fans are mad at you and that your overlay lasts too long,

1916
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:53,460
straddling too many holidays.

1917
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,100
And it's not just nerds throwing shade at you,

1918
01:32:56,260 --> 01:33:02,220
but Ryan Gosling, a cool guy, the gangster squatter himself.

1919
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:06,420
How much disrespect could there be for all of these characters?

1920
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,660
But which one am I going with?

1921
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:13,060
I'm going with one that I think though he's torn apart

1922
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:16,100
just for living his regular seasonal life,

1923
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:20,100
I believe that when this Halloween comes, he will ignore the barbs,

1924
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:25,660
grin as wide as ever and sing out his mocking song loud and proud.

1925
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,860
Scary singing plant number 15 in Haunted Mansion Holiday.

1926
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,460
You are my pick for dormant animatronic of the year.

1927
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:35,420
Oh, that's great.

1928
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:38,580
And that's one of those robots where you can really hear it working.

1929
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,780
Yes, absolutely.

1930
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:43,780
When I brought this up to Erin, she said, you know, I love about those

1931
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:48,740
clack, clack, clack, yes, like the Tiki birds, like the original animatronics.

1932
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:51,620
It's I think a fun throwback in that way.

1933
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:53,220
They're so loud.

1934
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:56,060
Also, real quick, just Gosling for Eisner, too.

1935
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,780
Decent choice. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1936
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:04,140
I think if you've been on like GQ or really any style magazine,

1937
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,700
I think you're a great Eisner. I agree.

1938
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:08,060
Well, and he would have met him, right?

1939
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,420
Because Gosling was in the 90s Mickey Mouse Club.

1940
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:14,860
You know, yeah, I bet Eisner probably swung by that at some point in time.

1941
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,740
Oh, yeah, he should.

1942
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:18,860
I mean, he was very busy in the Gosling era.

1943
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:19,820
That's kind of when it was.

1944
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,380
That's when Wells died and it all fell apart.

1945
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,380
Yes, that's true.

1946
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:26,540
Yeah. Tough time for Gosling and Timberlake to enter.

1947
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:27,900
Timberlake, another good candidate.

1948
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,940
Throw it in there. Yeah.

1949
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:30,140
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

1950
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:35,300
And throw in like, you know, Christina as Eisner's wife.

1951
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:40,100
I think that's great and have eyes and like rewrite everything.

1952
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:43,300
So Eisner like wrote some of the songs in the movies.

1953
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:47,620
He just like, yeah, clears the guy.

1954
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,940
Get out of here, like shoves Minkin to the side,

1955
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,500
rolls up his sleeves.

1956
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,780
Perfect on the first try.

1957
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:54,900
A whole new world. Look at this stuff.

1958
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:55,980
Isn't it neat?

1959
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:59,220
Wouldn't you think my ass just at the top of my head, but I don't know.

1960
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,180
Collections complete. OK, there is it is.

1961
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,180
That's so hard.

1962
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,580
Yeah. So, yeah, that'll be the PL.

1963
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:07,140
Trevor's saving Mr. Banks version.

1964
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,220
All great candidates. Yeah. Yeah.

1965
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:11,780
I like I like all of them very much.

1966
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,460
I believe that how we did this, I had to go back and check.

1967
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,100
I think we had the audience decide.

1968
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:19,300
I think that, OK, good. Unlike other things where we decide for them,

1969
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,660
we pick Clifford for them and we pick the name Clifford for them.

1970
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:25,580
And here we're giving the audience a little bit of choice.

1971
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:28,340
Yes. So we'll put that poll on the Twitter and you can decide

1972
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:30,660
the dormant animatronic of the year.

1973
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:35,220
I think you made a great case for that plant because it's in the box.

1974
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:37,020
Stuck in a box.

1975
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:39,460
Oh, yeah. Like how much they would.

1976
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:42,300
You would look forward to getting that crack of light.

1977
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,180
And I get to come out finally.

1978
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:47,140
And it didn't happen for the first time since the late 90s.

1979
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:50,460
Since its existence didn't get to come out. Right.

1980
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:53,420
So, yeah, you decide you listen, you decide.

1981
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,620
Yeah. Yeah.

1982
01:35:55,620 --> 01:36:00,860
And, you know, you can go do that, obviously, at Twitter, at podcast, the ride.

1983
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,620
We're on all the socials at podcast, the ride.

1984
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:06,460
And I'm just dovetailing it into the

1985
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:09,540
into the plugging stuff because you survived podcast, the right.

1986
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:11,940
And you've survived some of you have survived

1987
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:15,380
200 of these main feed episodes.

1988
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:19,020
And wait, I had to count because we're close to I believe there are 94

1989
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,980
patrons, so we're close to 300, which is a better, bigger.

1990
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:25,060
Wow. One in a way.

1991
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:29,340
And and to those of you who've listened to to all of these,

1992
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,420
we can't thank you enough.

1993
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,020
And thanks for being being with us for so many.

1994
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,060
And we hope to see you the next time.

1995
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,820
Not 300.

1996
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,820
We can't see you for that. That wouldn't be safe.

1997
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:41,500
We'll see you for anniversary or for not anniversary.

1998
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,620
We want to see everybody soon. Yeah.

1999
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:47,820
In the in this these mail back questions, some we didn't get to,

2000
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:50,500
some very good candidates for second gate episodes.

2001
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,220
I'll say that. Yeah. Yeah.

2002
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,100
Well, yeah, always, always send those.

2003
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,380
Please not just whatever you want us to do.

2004
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:02,140
And and if you want to hear those, obviously, there's always three bonus

2005
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:05,220
episodes every month at podcast, read the second gate at

2006
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:07,620
patreon.com slash podcast, the ride.

2007
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,700
Fellas, thanks for hanging out in the I've been looking for this for a long time.

2008
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:14,780
So we could we could do it.

2009
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:17,100
There's something to it. It's fun.

2010
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,340
It's nice to do it this way. Oh, yeah.

2011
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,060
No, there's not that.

2012
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,380
As I said before, there's not that half second before, you know,

2013
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:25,660
if that thing you thought you said that was funny is funny or not,

2014
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:28,020
because you have to wait for a delay in reaction.

2015
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:30,260
Yeah, boy. Where you have like a little terror of like,

2016
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:31,660
I thought that I said it was funny.

2017
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,460
And then so you get a little more immediate.

2018
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:35,860
So it's nice. It doesn't make me feel as crazy.

2019
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,060
Yeah. Yeah.

2020
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:41,140
And just in leaving the same room that we're in all the time.

2021
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,100
That helps. That's nice.

2022
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,860
Yeah. I mean, we've been wanting to do it this way for a long time.

2023
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:48,980
I feel like December was so bad.

2024
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,540
Couldn't do like a holiday thing.

2025
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:52,740
This seemed like the time there's optimism.

2026
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,020
I hope everybody's feeling it.

2027
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,420
So hopefully we are rather than later.

2028
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:59,780
We'll be having some sort of sort of jamboree.

2029
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:01,740
Oh, that's right.

2030
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:05,340
We again within doing this, I hope this has been nice to listen to.

2031
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,700
And you're happy that we did something together in person.

2032
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:11,740
But we did bail on the country bear promise.

2033
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,380
Well, sort of.

2034
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,780
I mean, it's half and half because we did say sort of when it's safe

2035
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,740
to be inside together, we would do country bears.

2036
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,300
Is that what we said? I think so.

2037
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:21,300
Yeah. Oh, OK.

2038
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,780
A jamboree is going to involve like, you know,

2039
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:29,740
maybe have to record in pieces and there'll be a cavalcade to start.

2040
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:33,620
You know, multiple family, multiple households would have to be involved.

2041
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:35,580
So that's the this is three.

2042
01:38:35,620 --> 01:38:38,060
This is fine. It's outside. It's massive and safe.

2043
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:40,820
The jamboree needs a lot more than that.

2044
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:42,020
Yeah, that will be. Yeah.

2045
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:45,700
This is the current California regulation of number of households

2046
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:48,180
who can wear at the max, I think, right now.

2047
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:50,020
That's right. So, yeah.

2048
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:53,460
So so when that hopefully that's again sooner rather than later.

2049
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,820
I was discussing a little bit of it today.

2050
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,540
I'll just say that in general.

2051
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:03,140
So, OK, that'll be that'll be coming up and we'll see again.

2052
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:05,260
You have to tell when Biden says we can jamboree.

2053
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,580
We'll jamboree.

2054
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:10,860
You got to listen to Biden when he says you can pull out.

2055
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:12,820
Hey, Mac, we'll have our jamborees back.

2056
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:16,140
By the way, the decent chance he says something about having a jamboree

2057
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,580
in the next few months. That's that's possible.

2058
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:21,140
Jamboree is just what he calls TikTok.

2059
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,500
Right. Sure.

2060
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,460
Kids getting on jamboree, doing their dances, doing the skadoos.

2061
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:30,540
Yeah. Well, this has been a blast.

2062
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,620
Thanks for listening, everybody.

2063
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,260
Back with more,

2064
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:37,260
hopefully less planes and stuff.

2065
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,220
But what am I apologizing for?

2066
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:42,100
I'm so happy we did it. This is great.

2067
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,820
Thanks for listening.

2068
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:46,500
Talk to you next time. Goodbye.
