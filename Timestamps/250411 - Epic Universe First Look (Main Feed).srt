1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,640
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, where we love theme parks more than Maya the Explorer and

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,320
her navigator, Captain Kakao, loves scouring the cosmos for new candies and confections

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,200
to share with the Celestians.

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Hello.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,800
And I will also say, but I don't know why, it was a more calm, it was like a nicer one.

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,880
That was you feeling calm and back at home with even the reference to Captain Kakao.

10
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,720
I was taking a deep breath from that, like not saying it's mealy-mouthed or complicated

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,200
in its mythology, it's just right.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
It's perfect.

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,080
Jason Sheridan, hi.

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:33,400
Hi, I learned about Maya the Explorer a few weeks ago and I've been wondering about her

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,440
background, her motivation.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
Oh sure.

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,160
So, that you answered it in one sentence, I feel a sense of relief.

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Yeah, I guess the motivation is scouring the cosmos.

19
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,160
You should make the noise too, go, ah.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Yeah, nice.

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
It feels good.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,760
Yeah, we should remember to breathe in these things, we don't have to just flap our gums

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,840
all the time, we can take deep breaths, center ourselves, which is something we're going

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,000
to have to do in this episode because a lot of excitement has occurred.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,480
We got big stuff to talk about here, via our social media you might be aware that Mike

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:15,200
and I took a whirlwind last minute trip to Orlando, Florida, recently, primarily to check

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,520
on the progress of a highly anticipated Orlando attraction, Taffers Tavern, on iDrive.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,160
We gave it a good look, see, I mean it was maybe going to be just that in and out, just

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,080
peer in that window, see how it's going, answer if you're curious, not well, seems like there's

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,160
nothing in there.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,520
Seems like it's really behind, he was making posts about that, we're opening soon, and

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,160
then we looked in and we're like, this doesn't look soon.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Define soon.

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Yeah, what?

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,600
I see on the show he does these things in like four days, but here we are looking into

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,720
a window, and I don't, how can you have a bar when you don't literally have a bar?

37
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
John Mayne, clock's ticking, you got a lot of, you're going to have traffic coming in

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,880
from new theme parks and you're not even going to be opening time.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,840
They're running previews, aren't you Mike too?

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
We very, pretty late, not so late, but kind of late at night, just had to wander in front

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,120
of this closed, never opened restaurant, and no one was around really, except like a couple

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
stragglers, I feel like.

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,160
Well people filing out of a, there was some like kind of martini bar feeling thing, was

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,720
it the bar or was it just the mall in general, which I believe is called the Point Orlando,

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,640
where was playing an old wrestling theme, was that coming out of the bar or was that

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,440
just on the speakers of the?

47
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,400
So I forget the name of the actual song, but the Monday Night Raw theme song, like my generation

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,880
across the nation, like that, whatever that one was, they were just playing and it sounded

49
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,600
like it might be coming from the mall, but I suspect it's coming from the bar or club.

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,400
That has not been the theme song for like 25 years.

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,360
Yeah, that's an old Monday Night Raw theme.

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,560
Wow, old wrestling theme, but there's, that's some Orlando shit, Orlando bars pumping an

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,080
old Monday Night Raw theme that rules, and that was also around the time as that was

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
playing.

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,200
Then we looked in a store window where we saw a couple of great signs, do you remember

56
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
them offhand?

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
You took a photo or video.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Yeah, I posted it too.

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,480
What do you, like, what were the ones that lit us up?

60
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Do you mind taking a sec?

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
And then we'll get into.

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I'll take a look, yeah, no.

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,960
This is very us to be more excited about some random signs we saw than the brand new theme

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
parts.

65
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
I truly thought that was from Margaritaville.

66
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,200
No, no, these are too bawdy for Margaritaville.

67
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,120
That's why I was surprised, I thought like, whoa, Florida Margaritaville plays by a different

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
set of rules.

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,960
There was one that lit us up a lot, and then there's all of them though are pretty good.

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,600
So there's a really Margaritaville looking like parrot with sunglasses and a cocktail

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,200
or a margarita, I guess, carved in a piece of painted wood that says screw the crackers,

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Polly wants a cocktail.

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,360
I missed that.

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:06,760
Then under it, there's like a kind of just a wooden sign that says bitch's kitchen.

75
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,320
And then there's a sign under that similar sign, just kind of basic white and then with

76
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,520
sort of black letters kind of thing.

77
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,560
Dear laundry, don't be sad, nobody's doing me either, which I don't know why you would

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
put that up.

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,520
And where would you would have to put that in a place in the house that faces the laundry?

80
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
I guess.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,000
Does that mean the machine or does it mean your hamper?

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
To make sense, it would be your hamper.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,400
It's hamper, but would the POV of a hamper be, would you have to put it on the ceiling

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,680
so that it would have a view of, how does a hamper see?

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
How does a hamper see?

86
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
It's a very good question.

87
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,600
If it has a lid on it, I guess you can draw a couple eyes.

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah, but if it has a lid on it, it ain't seeing no signs.

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,800
You know, that's true, that's true, the laundry thing.

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,400
That song, how does a hamper see, you know, that was going to be in the live action Tangled,

91
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,560
originally it was going to be in gigantic, but that got canceled, so.

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
It kept passing from movie to movie.

93
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,880
It kept passing from movie to movie, you know?

94
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,440
A little in somewhere, don't give up song.

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,760
And then the winner, I think is.

96
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,080
Oh my God, best sign of ever, it's the winner of best sign ever made.

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,240
Right, it says, we don't skinny dip, we chunky dunk.

98
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,200
Which, I don't know, we all LOL'd at that, I'm still LOL-ing at it later.

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,040
From the other side of the country, that just got seared in my mind like a cattle brand.

100
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,400
I sent it to you in GEO right after that.

101
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,520
And I think hopefully you guys enjoyed it as much.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,320
There's a couple other ones that got cut off here,

103
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,400
because I kinda took this photo quickly, but it is just,

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,520
it feels so good to be in Orlando, Florida.

105
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,240
Yeah, look, headline number one, it was great, it was great,

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,240
it was wild to do it in such a concise way.

107
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,640
It didn't let us do a ton of what there is to do there,

108
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,600
but it's really, I think what you've always dreamed of, Mike,

109
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,880
which is just quick pop-downs, just make Orlando your Vegas,

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,560
and it felt pretty good, it was fun to do,

111
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,400
even more fun than going chunky dunking.

112
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,520
Yo, sorry, go ahead.

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,880
No, no, I was gonna say Jason did not join us

114
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,360
for various reasons, among them being your marriage,

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,600
that occurred while we were, yes, congratulations.

116
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,720
I don't do anything really whirlwind nowadays,

117
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
but also I was busy getting married.

118
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,120
I was gonna comment on the video,

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,800
this is why you couldn't make the ceremony,

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,480
but we didn't really do guess.

121
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,680
Well, we should be clear, we were not being derelict

122
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,600
in any sort of way, we were not asked to be groomsmen

123
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,720
a year ago, and then we said, whoops, sorry,

124
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,280
Epic Universe, gotta go.

125
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
We were just doing, we've been talking about this

126
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,520
since October or November, and we missed,

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,200
we were gonna do it on our anniversary, March 14th,

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,640
and then we just got delayed for any number of reasons,

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,720
so we were able to do it like two weeks later,

130
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,800
and it was just us and the, it's not a justice of the peace,

131
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
she had some weird title, but she was really funny,

132
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
she was really fun, and then our friend, Andrew,

133
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,040
came and took some wonderful pictures

134
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,800
that we've been kind of rolling out,

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,480
Andrew, the guest on the horror award show

136
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
on Second Gate?

137
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,160
Friend of the show, Andrew Grissom.

138
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah, he comes up, said what a good man he is,

139
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,120
and he did a good job taking photos for y'all,

140
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,280
so congratulations. Yeah, thank you.

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,880
But anyway, we were not, let's be clear here,

142
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,720
we were not bailing on Jason.

143
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Because, I will be honest, multiple people thought that.

144
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,920
What?

145
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,120
Strangers, people without the information.

146
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
People that didn't know what was going on.

147
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,600
Or maybe not friends.

148
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
Some friends, some were texting me, wait a minute,

149
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
were you at the wedding?

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
And I go, no, no, no, no, it's a whole thing,

151
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,960
so we were, there was some, I had to do some.

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,520
We were trying to make it not a whole thing.

153
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,160
Well, it's okay, I'm not, it's okay,

154
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,120
I squashed the misinformation.

155
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,320
Yes, thank you, and we'll have an update on that stuff.

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,480
Some people wondered if it had happened in Florida.

157
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
That is very funny.

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,680
Because you guys are in Florida, so wait a minute,

159
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,840
and then some people, some friends of ours texted me,

160
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,640
and they were interested in the timeline of everything.

161
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
You got, yeah, at the top of the Helios Grand.

162
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
And you're where, yeah.

163
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,440
Or, like, you know what would be the thing to do now

164
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,600
is to get married, like, bride and groom are in different

165
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,200
cars on Sky, Sky, what is it called?

166
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,640
What's the racer ride?

167
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,040
Stardust Racers?

168
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,840
Stardust Racers, yeah, that was starting to go

169
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,280
Skyfall Racers, that's not correct.

170
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
Not a James Bond ride.

171
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,840
But you go on, you do it as a duel on Stardust Racers,

172
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,360
and you, like, exchange vows at the part

173
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,280
where the coaster cars get the closest.

174
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,120
Because you could put the ring on each other.

175
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,000
I do, I do, I'm trying to toss it up.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,320
Oh.

177
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
Nailed it.

178
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,080
Yeah, the cross, yeah, that cross, that was hard.

179
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,600
I was gonna say, yeah, we got married, we timed it,

180
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,920
we were the grand opening festivities

181
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,480
of the Terra Luna Hotel opening.

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,680
Oh, yeah.

183
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,840
Which, I believe, Terra Luna,

184
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,360
you cannot walk to Epic Universe.

185
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,200
We know.

186
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,480
But Stella Nova, you can, and you cannot walk

187
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,720
between Terra Nova and Stella Luna.

188
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,080
Did we go to Stella Nova?

189
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,920
I think we did.

190
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,640
It was the one with the tiles, which one is that?

191
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
They both have tiles.

192
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
They both have tiles.

193
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,400
Well, we popped in.

194
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,240
We popped in to see if there was a fun bar or something.

195
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,160
It's kind of a functional scene.

196
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,480
I think that somebody said the walking path wasn't open,

197
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,800
so perhaps it is Stella Nova,

198
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,760
but the walking from Epic Universe is not available yet.

199
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Okay. Okay.

200
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,480
Gotcha. Right.

201
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,680
Yes, I also heard that Helios Grand, the fancy hotel,

202
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,160
it is essentially in the park, is that the parking there,

203
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,920
if you're just visiting the hotel, the parking is $135.

204
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,280
Yo! Because they're trying to,

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,360
they're trying to chase people out of the,

206
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,480
they're trying to make sure you don't use that

207
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
as cheap parking for the, if you stay overnight,

208
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,000
it's a more reasonable amount of parking.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,080
Yeah, I don't know, $20 or $40 probably.

210
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,840
Yeah, they should have just gone full till with it.

211
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,520
If it was gonna be just a scare people away parking fee,

212
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,240
it should have just been like $7,000.

213
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,480
Have fun. Yeah.

214
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,560
You're setting the rules.

215
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,480
Have fun with it. Right.

216
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,360
And I thought 45 at the Beverly Hilton was a lot.

217
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
I was wondering how long it would take you

218
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,400
to start complaining about the parking

219
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,360
at your wedding hotel,

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
because you did before the wedding.

221
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I, the historic ones, they hit you with a lot of fees.

222
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
I knew parking was going to be.

223
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
You paid for that history.

224
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,040
I think they hit you with those

225
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,400
at the non-historic ones, too.

226
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
Well, the non-historic ones,

227
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,240
you can park on the street, you know.

228
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, depending, depending.

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
Yeah.

230
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,480
Welcome to our wedding dream suite.

231
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,280
What if we park on the street, just hike it in?

232
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,400
We'll save it, we'll save it.

233
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,360
I was gonna say, we'll save it,

234
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
we're gonna talk about this.

235
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,160
We have to save it because we've,

236
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,400
here we are dancing around and around

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,040
and not saying the big thing that needs to be said.

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
And the thing that needs to be said is,

239
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,040
Mike and I have been to Epic Universe.

240
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,880
Yeah.

241
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,520
We have been to Universal's.

242
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,120
Holy crap. Third.

243
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
That's right, I said it.

244
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
Gate. Third gate.

245
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,520
As far as I'm concerned.

246
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,280
Yeah, we've been to this park.

247
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,600
It feels crazy to say that.

248
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
It felt, especially right after

249
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,560
and given the whirlwind nature and then jet lag,

250
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,920
like truly the day or two after,

251
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,480
I was like, did we?

252
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
It feels so weird and we've been talking about it

253
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,080
for so long and anticipating it on the show forever.

254
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,920
Yeah.

255
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,520
And now we can say that we went, it's wild.

256
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,560
It is and what you're saying about it being surreal,

257
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,840
really like, you know, when you go to some place

258
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,280
when it's in previews, I suppose they would call that,

259
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,360
as if it's a Broadway show, it's in previews.

260
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,200
Yes.

261
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Obviously stuff is, they're ironing things out.

262
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
So sometimes stuff, you know,

263
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,920
you don't get on the ride you were trying to get on.

264
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,200
So now when I think about it in this surreal way,

265
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,360
it does feel like sometimes you have

266
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,480
that like frustrating dream where there's like one thing

267
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,440
you're trying to do in your dream.

268
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,520
You can't quite do it.

269
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,040
You're right there and it does, ah, but I, ah.

270
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,000
God, you're right.

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,200
So there are things, there's great stuff.

272
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,520
There's, of course, because we're frustrating things.

273
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,400
Specifically, I'll even just say right now,

274
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,320
like I got to walk through the queue of the Monster's Ride

275
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,840
twice, but I didn't get to go on it.

276
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,560
So this is specifically what I'm referring to

277
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,200
where you're like, did that happen?

278
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,120
Did we actually go to Orlando for a short amount of time?

279
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,160
And then, oh, it feels in my mind like I had a dream

280
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,840
where I just couldn't get to the thing.

281
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,040
Just behind a door, as opposed to like,

282
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
my baby's back there and I can't help him.

283
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,240
It's instead, it's Victoria Frankenstein is back there

284
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,720
and I can't see her.

285
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,920
I came all the way across the country.

286
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, that's a good caveat to say.

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,960
At the top is that like, you know,

288
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,840
we by no means could consider this a fully exhaustive,

289
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,920
expansive view of the park

290
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,200
because there were big, big old things

291
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,840
that we did not get to do.

292
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,160
And yeah, we were lucky enough to get this opportunity

293
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,320
to do it in kind of a preview period

294
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,840
in which you very much get the caveat of, you know,

295
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,960
not everything's gonna be open.

296
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,920
It's, you know, they were very strict about no photography

297
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,480
because there were things that weren't finished.

298
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
There were odds and ends where you're like,

299
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,840
I know that's gonna be glistening when it opens in May.

300
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,680
What is the day?

301
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,520
May 22nd.

302
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,840
That's pretty damn early.

303
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,960
And but, you know, yeah, we're like, oh my God,

304
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,320
this like wall isn't quite there.

305
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,480
The window's not quite there.

306
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,600
And it was very fun to get to see a park in that state.

307
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,560
Yeah, I was gonna say that's kind of one of the dreams

308
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,680
for theme park enthusiasts is like an in progress,

309
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,360
you know, walking through a live testing,

310
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,960
live construction site.

311
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,080
Oh yeah, absolutely.

312
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,760
I mean, I like, I was, when I shared with my mom

313
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,640
that I was doing this, she went straight to,

314
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,400
oh, you remember when you were a kid and we went,

315
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,920
we got to see, we were just in Universal Studios

316
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,920
and we just went near the building of T2 3D

317
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,960
and then suddenly people were going in.

318
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,120
And it wasn't scheduled open for a month or two

319
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,920
and we got a preview of it before it.

320
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,760
Like, I don't think then I knew that was even possible.

321
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
I don't think I knew that was a thing that they did.

322
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,160
And that really, I was so lit up about it

323
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,920
and my mom's thought about it forever.

324
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,960
So she was like, oh my God,

325
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,680
getting to do it for an entire park.

326
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,720
That's really crazy.

327
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,960
I think the stats also, I was thinking about

328
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,120
the headiness of getting to do this,

329
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
of like been theme park fans forever,

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,120
doing the show for nearly eight years.

331
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,600
This is the first time,

332
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,760
certainly that we've gotten to go to a park pre-opening.

333
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,120
It is the first time we've gotten to go to a brand new park

334
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,120
in Orlando since we were teenagers.

335
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
And I feel like if you told us back then

336
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
that we would have this opportunity now,

337
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,680
like how blown would our minds be?

338
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,240
And then if you added the fact that,

339
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,400
okay, you are gonna get to do that

340
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,680
and also you will be doing it

341
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,440
with a light jelly rolls hangover.

342
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,000
You at 40 will have hit it a tad hard

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,820
at the dueling piano bar.

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
I think, well, then you just go,

345
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,600
wow, you're sure that's 40 and not 17?

346
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,120
Seems like we really got it going on, don't we?

347
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,520
You'd be like, is my life perfect?

348
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,000
Did we win the lottery?

349
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,480
Are you a millionaire?

350
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,280
How, what?

351
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,800
My goodness.

352
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Yup, yup, hey, pretty good.

353
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,640
Living it up, living it up.

354
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,600
Jelly rolls, why at 14, 15,

355
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm not even allowed to go in there.

356
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,560
That's true, you only can imagine what it's like.

357
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,920
Let alone getting hung over.

358
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,040
What's the excitation?

359
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, again, we'll get to this stuff later,

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,120
but I spent two nights in a row at jelly rolls

361
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,480
while I was in Orlando.

362
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,360
And I spent. Two separate nights

363
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,480
in a short short trip. Half an hour.

364
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,000
I think it really does illustrate,

365
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,560
we'll save it for other, but like.

366
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
That's by the way, jelly rolls is the dueling piano bar

367
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,080
on the boardwalk right by Epcot.

368
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Soon to close.

369
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,560
Soon to close.

370
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,360
Which is part of, must have been part of you

371
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,680
fitting it in.

372
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
Absolutely.

373
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
Yeah, it is very like, you know,

374
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,240
we get a pretty tight amount of time in Orlando.

375
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,520
How do we play it?

376
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,520
I did a bunch of wandering of mostly empty hotel spaces.

377
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,800
You did two jelly rolls.

378
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,760
Two. Evenings.

379
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
Two jelly rolls with two separate groups of people.

380
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,640
Wow.

381
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,840
So it wasn't even, I didn't even intend to do it too.

382
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,400
Just that's how the nights lined up.

383
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,240
That's what the different parties.

384
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,080
You did not enter the first night thinking

385
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,000
that that's what it would be.

386
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,840
Right.

387
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,320
Yeah, yeah.

388
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,360
No, it worked out.

389
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,200
That's the thing.

390
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,320
It's like, as in a family vacation,

391
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,400
everybody gets what they want.

392
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,920
Everybody gets their own flavor.

393
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm very happy with mine.

394
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,400
You were very happy with yours.

395
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,920
I was thrilled.

396
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,760
I had a ball.

397
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, let me ask you guys a question.

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,560
How much time did you allocate for Islands of Adventure?

399
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,320
Well.

400
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,160
Jason, I got bad news.

401
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
I got bad news.

402
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,760
I have bad news as well.

403
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,040
It doesn't always work out.

404
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,520
Yeah.

405
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,360
I walked by it.

406
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,160
Can you even fathom going to Orlando

407
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,760
and not stepping foot in Islands of Adventure?

408
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,600
Oh no.

409
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
He's dying.

410
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,720
Save him.

411
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
Oh, I mean, I went in.

412
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,680
I went in and I went on all the rides.

413
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,800
I went in and I honored each and every

414
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,680
very special location at Port of Entry

415
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,600
and thought about its history and mythology.

416
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,080
I smoked a pack of cigarettes at Islands of Adventure.

417
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,920
Don't worry.

418
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,240
I smoked the longest cigarettes

419
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,880
that I could possibly find.

420
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Yeah.

421
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,920
So, no, I did not make it to Islands this time.

422
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,560
I ashed right on top of a cinnamon roll.

423
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,400
Yeah.

424
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,400
I did go, I did hang out at City Walk, though.

425
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,920
You did City Walk, but not, I don't think I knew that.

426
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,400
I spent a little time at City Walk, yeah.

427
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,240
My God.

428
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
I did wander the hotels as well.

429
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,800
There was the awkwardness of, like,

430
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,640
not every day getting to be a park stick

431
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,000
because two of them were traveled.

432
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,280
Yeah, I mean, I did it as fast as humanly possible.

433
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,440
Tried to be there for as many bedtimes back in LA as I could.

434
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,360
Yeah, my travel got delayed heavily the last day,

435
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,800
so then I ended up spending longer around the hotels

436
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,760
and City Walk than I expected.

437
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,640
I guess I should have, in hindsight, just, you know,

438
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,200
bought a ticket to Islands and gone.

439
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,480
In hindsight, I think I would have done that

440
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,600
if I knew it was going to keep getting

441
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,440
pushed back.

442
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,920
Sizeable delay, big, little delay.

443
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,600
Let's not delay too much further the talk of the park.

444
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,440
I mean, this is crazy.

445
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,800
It's like, it is almost overwhelming the amount

446
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,120
to talk about again, I would say.

447
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,640
Let's take the pressure off ourselves.

448
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,200
Let's take a deep breath, and audience, please,

449
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,640
take the pressure off of us to fully cover this play

450
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,800
because we'll be talking about it a ton.

451
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,920
Jason, you'll get the chance to go down,

452
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,040
and we'll be piecing off Epic Universe then,

453
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,520
but just think of this, I guess,

454
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,480
as just kind of a, like, I don't, I mean.

455
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,320
Overview.

456
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,080
A preview, a preview, as we got a preview,

457
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,520
this is a preview of our full thoughts about the place.

458
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,360
Why did you guys bring in the 12 foot sign

459
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,240
that says the Roast of Epic Universe then?

460
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
If you're hedging your bets.

461
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
All right, let's crack those knuckles.

462
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,800
Let's get into it.

463
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,880
We've got a lot of, we got a lot of.

464
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,760
Maybe it should be called Mid Universe.

465
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,560
Please welcome Tony Hedgeglove.

466
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,920
Yeah, we spent a million dollars

467
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,440
to get Tony Hedgeglove here to roast.

468
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,000
I assume that's how much he caused

469
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,840
because he's so famous.

470
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
He has Trumps here,

471
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,520
and he's trying to get Celestians deported.

472
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,040
Right.

473
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,600
No more safe harbor for Celestians.

474
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,880
I'm excited to learn about Celestians.

475
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,600
I didn't know there was a whole crew.

476
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,320
Yeah, okay, so, first of all, I'll say this.

477
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,200
Like, I don't want to spoil everything or anything,

478
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,720
but I guess if you really want to go in cold,

479
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,560
don't listen to this.

480
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,600
If you truly don't want to know anything,

481
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,080
I don't have a lot to say.

482
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,320
I don't think that's not already kind of announced.

483
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,160
Yeah, there's stuff that's out there.

484
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,400
A lot of my thoughts are gonna be like this thing

485
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,360
that maybe we've even talked about on the show.

486
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
I liked this, this thing, I wasn't sure.

487
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,160
Like, yeah, I don't intend to ruin experiences

488
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,760
for anybody, but if even this is too,

489
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,760
even if any dipping into it is too much,

490
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,800
check out one of the many great other episodes of the show,

491
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
especially at patreon.com slash bug guys, they're right.

492
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,200
Yes, so yeah, so Celeste, I will say this.

493
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,040
There wasn't as many Celestians walking around as I hoped,

494
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,880
but I don't know that.

495
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,080
Again, this is where you're in previews.

496
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,640
You know, they're adjusting things to live performances.

497
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,240
So, I think we'll be able to learn, hopefully,

498
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,280
fingers crossed about Celestians more when we all go

499
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
for our upcoming live shows in June.

500
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,040
Which, by the way, we have not mentioned

501
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,440
here on the main feed, one of the perks of the Patreon

502
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,040
is that we give you extra early heads up

503
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,040
about if we're doing a live show or anything.

504
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,720
So, we made the Patreon folks aware of it,

505
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,800
of the two shows that we're doing at Tin Roof,

506
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,240
which is in early June.

507
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,080
I don't have the date in front of me.

508
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah, June 8th.

509
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But we'll put the link in the show notes.

510
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,840
There is still standing room, how about that?

511
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,480
We're at the standing room point,

512
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,640
but if you're gonna be in Orlando,

513
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,120
if you wanna come to Orlando,

514
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
there is still standing room available,

515
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,240
which is not crazy, it's a comfortable and fun place.

516
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,760
It's back by the bar.

517
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,400
Yeah, yeah, and not that far.

518
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
You could also probably, it's not that long

519
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,280
of a little trek to see the empty,

520
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,320
I would assume empty still by then in June,

521
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,960
Taffer's Tavern.

522
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,240
Sunday, June 8th, and we're doing two shows.

523
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,400
So, yes, grab some standing tickets if you want.

524
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,240
How far is Taffer's Tavern

525
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,680
from the world's largest McDonald's?

526
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,560
Oh, I get turned around around there.

527
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,320
It's by car, maybe I'm probably gonna get it wrong,

528
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,400
but like 10 minutes by car, eight minutes by car.

529
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,040
But it's on the same strip as Tin Roof and the Orlando Eye.

530
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,880
It's all in beautiful eye drive.

531
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,560
Which we, there's so much eye drive we gotta get into.

532
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,520
I mean, that's a real show extender by the time you.

533
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,920
Oh, yeah.

534
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,920
But anyways, where exactly to begin here?

535
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
I mean, a part of me just wants to step through

536
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,960
the day a little bit, but also we don't have to do that.

537
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,400
We could just start calling out highlights.

538
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,560
Is there anything that you have been aching

539
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,280
to get off your chest right at the get-go?

540
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,680
I mean, here's what I, you know,

541
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,040
just because I brought it up and it is

542
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,240
at the forefront of my mind,

543
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,680
is yes, the Monster's Ride was down.

544
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,720
So there's, you know, this Monster's Unchained,

545
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,960
the Frankenstein experiment,

546
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,800
that was running in previews is what I saw online.

547
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,640
And then it was not really,

548
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
maybe it ran a couple times that day and then it broke down.

549
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,760
And that was obviously the thing,

550
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,560
the big thing that I was hoping to get on.

551
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,680
But I will say this, and I don't,

552
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,360
this is a very fun thing I got to do,

553
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,800
is that they were opening the queue to people

554
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,920
since the ride wasn't working.

555
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,320
So you could go in the queue.

556
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,320
And I got to go in the queue when a thunderstorm happened.

557
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,440
And I got to hang out outside the Frankenstein Castle,

558
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,640
sipping a drink, going into the queue,

559
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,480
and then lingering and taking my time

560
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
with the entirety of the Frankenstein queue.

561
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,280
Not many people in there, which is really like,

562
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,040
that's not gonna happen anytime in the next so many years

563
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,360
where that queue isn't gonna be packed with people.

564
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,080
Yes, well and what with my skippable queue feelings

565
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,800
and all that, it is like,

566
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,240
it really throws things for a loop to think like,

567
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,600
but would you not at a leisurely pace

568
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,320
with less people wander around this queue

569
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,720
because it's like a extremely cool walkthrough experience.

570
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,960
And that for sure, I didn't know,

571
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,160
I didn't get to do the queue.

572
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,560
You're the only keeper of the secrets of the Monster queue.

573
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,520
So I, yes, so I don't know, we'll see.

574
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,680
So yes, you were off doing something else

575
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,040
just because we got, our schedules got a little off.

576
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,360
We were not doing everything together on the day.

577
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,200
And I ended up just in the Monster's land alone.

578
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,240
I went to the Burning Blade Tavern.

579
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,480
I saw the fire.

580
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
You did go to the Burning Blade Tavern.

581
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,240
Yes.

582
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,400
I was recalling what is where,

583
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,040
and I forgot that I watched the preview video

584
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,160
and I recalled that it's, yeah,

585
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,800
there's the windmill that lights on fire

586
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,160
and that there is a bar in there,

587
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,440
which is different than the steakhouse.

588
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,440
And there's a bar in the steakhouse spelled S-T-A-K-E,

589
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,040
that kind of steak.

590
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,000
So I didn't realize, ooh, how's Burning Blade Tavern?

591
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,880
So Burning Blade, I'll say this is,

592
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,400
the outside of it is unbelievable.

593
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,720
Like the windmill bursting into flames is amazing.

594
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,680
That is as cool as anybody expects.

595
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,080
Yeah.

596
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
Inside is pretty simple.

597
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,880
It's cool, it's like dark.

598
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,000
It has like limited seating

599
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
like you can order something I think on the side,

600
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,080
just like a to-go window basically.

601
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,480
So inside it's not the most themed thing in the world,

602
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,240
but you know, it's cool to go in there,

603
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,960
grab something and come out.

604
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,800
And just cause I was talking about it,

605
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
it's like I'm hanging out.

606
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,120
I'm like wishing this ride opens.

607
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,280
And then I realized the queue is open

608
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,120
and then a rainstorm starts.

609
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
It had been fine weather-wise all day and all the whole trip.

610
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,960
And then it starts coming down just in a large amounts.

611
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,120
People are soaked and I'm kind of as wandering around

612
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
a little bit buzzed.

613
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,840
And then the Frankenstein Castle has a,

614
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,720
spoiler alert, has a little bit of a show that it does

615
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,960
when like the electricity turns on in like the whatever,

616
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,120
the top of it, the, I don't know, that attic,

617
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,480
but there's like kind of like coils at the top of it.

618
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,920
The Spire Tesla coil.

619
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,480
Sure, something like that, whatever.

620
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,120
And then that's happening during the light,

621
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,040
lightning storm, basically.

622
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
That's awesome.

623
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,400
And I'm just sipping and I'm like, this rules.

624
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,960
And then I go inside like, ah,

625
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,200
I'm like holding my coat and I'm soaked.

626
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,680
And they're like, hello fellow traveler,

627
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,000
welcome out of the, come in out of the rain

628
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,520
to the Frankenstein Castle.

629
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,360
And I'm like, okay.

630
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,120
And then there's nobody in there.

631
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,320
There's a few people, but I'm in rooms alone now.

632
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,880
Being in Frankenstein Manor with a thunderstorm going on,

633
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,800
that is something I never considered.

634
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,680
I didn't consider it either.

635
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,400
I didn't consider it either, but I was like,

636
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,240
cause I was out, I was like looking like,

637
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,000
well, this is the next best thing to not going

638
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,040
on the ride early is getting to sort of hang out here.

639
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,360
So I mean, I can say like, it's awesome.

640
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,680
There's a big staircase.

641
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,760
Should I mean, there's, I, okay, I'll say this.

642
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,640
There's, I saw the two pre-shows or two separate pre-shows.

643
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,480
Wow.

644
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,720
Maybe we're sort of in spoiler territory.

645
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Maybe.

646
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,400
Yeah.

647
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,240
You were gonna maybe skip ahead a little bit.

648
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,280
So I guess skip ahead.

649
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,240
I don't know.

650
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm conflicted.

651
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,720
35 minutes.

652
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,280
Skip ahead a minute, I guess.

653
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,120
Okay.

654
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,840
So there's sort of more of a video pre-show with Igor,

655
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,320
who we ran into in the land as a human performing

656
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,400
or character who's awesome.

657
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,160
And then there's a pre-show with two robots.

658
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,000
Wow.

659
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,960
Robots in queue.

660
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,240
Victoria and spoiler alert, Frankenstein.

661
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Wow.

662
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,400
And it rules.

663
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,640
And I will say it got me so psyched.

664
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,960
I was like, ah, no.

665
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
He's a big boy.

666
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,880
Oh, he's huge.

667
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,700
He's huge.

668
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,540
He's great.

669
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,940
So I mean, there's other little surprises and stuff,

670
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,060
but that was really fun.

671
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,700
And I left, I got out of there,

672
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,900
and I went right back into the line again to do it again.

673
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,740
Neat.

674
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,580
Cool.

675
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,740
And then you know what's funny

676
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,820
is that I'm going through it again,

677
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,220
even more of a leisurely pace.

678
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,260
Obviously I'm hoping something, a miracle happens

679
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,340
and the ride opens or whatever.

680
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,620
But then they stop us right before the pre-shows

681
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,140
and we're waiting there for five, 10 minutes.

682
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,100
The park's gonna close very soon.

683
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,060
And they say, no, something's wrong.

684
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,820
You can't see these two pre-shows.

685
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,260
So we get a pass, a front of the line pass

686
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,980
for Epic Universe for every ride.

687
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,540
Like it could be for any ride other than Ministry,

688
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,040
I think Donkey Kong, and then something else.

689
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,860
And I have it with me still.

690
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,700
Wow.

691
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,540
So I'm gonna try to use it when we go back in June.

692
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,220
Does it work on other days?

693
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,060
Yes.

694
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,880
Have you checked the fine print?

695
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,720
It does.

696
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,540
Wow.

697
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,380
Yes, it does.

698
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,480
And I was told, even though it might technically expire

699
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,980
a day or two before we go, they will honor it.

700
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,820
I've been told that.

701
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,660
Really?

702
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,220
So I now have a fast pass for Epic Universe.

703
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,100
Geez.

704
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,620
Which may be key.

705
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,820
Because I'd rather keep talking about exciting stuff

706
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,880
than get into the weeds here.

707
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,260
But certainly I think our experience made us

708
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,580
a little afraid of like, oh boy,

709
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,740
how are these crowds gonna be?

710
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,180
How are these lines gonna be?

711
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,860
I think that is a powerful weapon that you wield

712
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,820
being able to skip a line at this place.

713
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,740
Because for everything that's cool about it,

714
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,580
I am certainly nervous about what are these queues gonna be.

715
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,420
Well, depending on the crowds, yeah.

716
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,200
It's like the Frankenstein family's secret to life itself.

717
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,260
It is very similar, yes.

718
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,940
I did read something, I think it was in Attractions magazine.

719
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,860
One maybe theme park insider, someone was talking about,

720
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,860
it seems like Universal is limiting day ticket sales.

721
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,440
Okay, yeah.

722
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,560
To allow like, I don't know what the numbers are,

723
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,520
but like 20,000 people in the park at a time

724
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,740
as opposed to 40,000 people waiting

725
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,040
in three hour lines complaining.

726
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,280
Yes, that's what I've heard.

727
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,960
That's probably smart.

728
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,960
You don't wanna, Universal probably haunted still

729
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,920
to some degree by opening day 1990

730
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,600
of Universal Studios Florida proper.

731
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,680
And then of course the bad first day

732
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,360
of Disneyland looms large.

733
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,760
You don't wanna, and by virtue of that,

734
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,760
it is the year 2025 and how much has been learned

735
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,760
and that they do this long preview period.

736
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,780
I think that prevents things from truly being

737
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,760
in a disaster state, but we know.

738
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,400
When you're dealing with ride technology

739
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,320
that's unprecedented and when you've got things

740
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,400
that seem to be sort of in the rise of the resistance

741
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,580
neck of the woods in terms of technology,

742
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,020
or Tiana keeps shutting down.

743
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,820
It's definitely going to be a thing

744
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,060
that stuff is not fully up and running

745
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,420
and that there's frustration and not everybody's

746
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,820
gonna be able to dial it in the way we were able

747
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,700
to measure our expectations once the doors are open

748
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,500
to the public, I don't know if that's gonna be

749
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,140
fully possible, so they gotta be careful.

750
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,620
And I think capping capacity is a smart way to do it.

751
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,220
And more recently even, every time a Potter thing opened,

752
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,780
it was multi-hour wait, like four to eight hour waits.

753
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,620
Eight, god.

754
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,620
That might have been when the land first opened.

755
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,380
Well, I think that's definitely on the table

756
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,820
for the Potter stuff because Ministry of Magic

757
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,660
is the other one that we did not get.

758
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't think any, there was maybe,

759
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,660
at the time we had heard about a brief window

760
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,940
of people getting it, but I think that may have even been

761
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,580
like a VIP, sort of like a, that's not everybody.

762
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,540
So we weren't expecting that or certainly guaranteed that,

763
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,820
but I think that's gonna be close to the bone enough

764
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,820
that yeah, I could see that being completely

765
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,340
in the territory of that long of a wait.

766
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,300
Yeah, I waited three or four hours

767
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,100
opening summer for Gringotts and.

768
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,420
We waited four hours plus for Guardians Mission Breakout.

769
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,260
Wow.

770
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,700
Yeah, with very ad hoc switchbacks.

771
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,660
Geez, that is a lot of time to commit,

772
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,460
especially in like, the Florida park hours are not crazy.

773
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,460
I feel like I'm used to, you know, that a lot of the time,

774
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,100
Disneyland is open from eight to 12,

775
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,500
from eight a.m. to midnight, and then you go to Florida

776
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,540
and like, some of these are like 10 to six,

777
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,380
what do you mean? Seven o'clock, I know, it sucks.

778
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,500
Like that might be only enough for one line.

779
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,940
And that wasn't the case.

780
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,340
I know, the old days. In the 90s,

781
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,660
they used to be open really late,

782
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,980
extra magic hours would go to like two or three

783
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,020
in the morning. I know, it sucks.

784
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,580
And I was in Epcot at like two in the morning in 2021,

785
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,220
but it was only because we were staying

786
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,940
in Beach and Yacht Club,

787
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,500
and there were specific extra magic hours

788
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,740
if you were staying at Deluxe.

789
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,620
Like there were so many asterisks.

790
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,940
Okay, yeah, the Potter ride did not,

791
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,940
that was another where we got queue, but not ride.

792
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,740
Yeah.

793
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,980
That queue, holy shit.

794
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,060
I mean, it was built up to be holy shit,

795
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,180
and then sure enough, it is holy shit.

796
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,700
They have released images of this,

797
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,740
so this isn't particularly a spoiler,

798
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,140
but I like, this might be after,

799
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,580
but I hadn't seen the concept art for like,

800
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,060
it's the ministry of magic itself.

801
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,220
And I also have not seen those movies

802
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,700
as many people possibly have not.

803
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,860
So I didn't, I was told about a moment

804
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,500
that feels akin to the resistance,

805
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,780
the doors opening and you see all the stormtroopers

806
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,860
and everything in the scope of that room.

807
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,100
I was told something like that is coming,

808
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,420
and sure enough, the one corner that you round

809
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,780
is such a jaw dropper.

810
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,820
I don't think you've ever seen

811
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,820
just such a gigantic room in a queue.

812
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,500
Just the volume of space and the height of it.

813
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,980
I ended up looking at concept art later

814
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,140
and thinking this might be a case

815
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,220
where the reality is better than the concept art.

816
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,660
When does that happen?

817
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,300
When does that ever happen?

818
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,100
We've, there's been a lot of concept art letdowns

819
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,140
in theme park world in the last decade,

820
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,540
and this is like, I just, I don't wanna,

821
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,740
I will just prattle on and on

822
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,940
if I try to describe what the space is.

823
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,580
But as somebody said before we got to do it,

824
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,020
the tile budget alone, what does it take

825
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,340
to keep those tiles polished?

826
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,740
It is like, if you're a fan of tiles,

827
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,820
if you wanna see tiles sky high,

828
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,500
but inside a giant room, get ready.

829
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,220
It's four stories, basically.

830
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,540
Wow. Yes.

831
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,700
Which is, that's the scope of everything

832
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,340
in this Ministry of Magic world.

833
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,820
Somebody said the fact that the, what is it,

834
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,540
the tallest building in Diagon Alley

835
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,300
would be the smallest one here, completely insane.

836
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,180
Yeah, so beyond that, I don't have a lot to say.

837
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,860
Also, there is a room that I think

838
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,620
would have handily made it extremely far

839
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,340
in the fake office Final Four.

840
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,180
Oh yeah.

841
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,700
But I realize we have ignored a lot of potter

842
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,260
in that area in general.

843
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,180
Maybe some of that is the virtue of us paying less attention.

844
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,860
The current 2025 reality.

845
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know,

846
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,020
paying a little less potter attention

847
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,860
because fuck that lady.

848
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:16,860
This land is funny due to current unrelated hate monger

849
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,060
events, but current studio events of like,

850
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,700
ah, it's like France from the Fantastic Beast movies.

851
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,420
And Warner Brothers has gone like,

852
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,060
we are no longer making the Fantastic Beast movies.

853
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,100
Yes, the most cursed group of actors

854
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,300
and people involved in general.

855
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,580
I think there was, there was definitely a world

856
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,180
where this was all called like Fantastic Beasts land.

857
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,100
Ah, yes.

858
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,180
So like, it's still like the remains of some of it.

859
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,860
And they shied away from like,

860
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,660
let's make that the centerpiece.

861
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,820
I mean, what I was thinking just from walking in,

862
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,340
I mean, there's probably a little bit of backup

863
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,220
that we should do and maybe reminding people

864
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,020
that the premise of this park is portals,

865
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,620
this four major, there's a portal you walk into,

866
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,260
the Kronos to enter the park at all.

867
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,420
From there, you enter this connective realm

868
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,740
called Celestial Park, then it's your choice

869
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,380
of which portal of the main four that you head into,

870
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,060
which are very effective and cool,

871
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,700
much like the pipe in all the Mario lands

872
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,660
that kind of limit your view and then open it up wide again.

873
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,060
And I don't think there's a better iteration of that

874
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:31,060
than Ministry of Magic, than entering their depiction

875
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,500
of France, which you almost could just take

876
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,580
the potter out of it.

877
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,140
And like, the Fantastic Beasts and all,

878
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,540
it doesn't really matter, it is just Magic Europe.

879
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,620
If that was the name of it,

880
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,380
I'd rather it just be called that.

881
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,940
Now you're going to Magic Europe.

882
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,940
And it's kind of cheating, it's splitting the difference.

883
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,820
Like, it's Magic France, 20th century,

884
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,620
and you get transferred to the British magic ministry.

885
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,380
Don't worry about it, you're here for a ride.

886
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,460
Sure, no, no, no, yeah, I didn't find myself confused

887
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,820
terribly, despite not knowing any of the mythology.

888
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,860
That is also, it's a holy shit in that queue,

889
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,780
but it's also a holy shit seeing the scope

890
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,860
of those buildings and how, I was telling you,

891
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,580
Michael, over there, how a number of theme parks

892
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,380
have gone for the vibe of Europe,

893
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,180
even gone for the vibe of France.

894
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,220
And we'd been in World Showcase just the day before.

895
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,940
Like, it is not unfamiliar to do a Parisian vibe

896
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,980
in a theme park.

897
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,340
This is unreal, though, and no previous depiction

898
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:41,340
of France has made me bug out of my skin

899
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,260
and think I'm actually there.

900
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,260
It's so, it's just like, yeah, light years

901
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,260
beyond any depiction of a country or vibe, or I,

902
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,340
yeah, it's just insane.

903
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,820
And the level of detail, the signage,

904
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,060
to be in a place that is so new it's not even open

905
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,900
to the public, and yet it feels 1,000 years old.

906
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,540
You just really appreciate the art design

907
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,260
and the craft to it, and it's a true magic trick.

908
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,980
Yeah, no, it is so good.

909
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,220
I think on some level I took it for granted

910
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,420
because of how, I mean, I haven't been to France,

911
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,420
but how well it is recreating a very lived-in

912
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,340
over hundreds of years place.

913
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,180
Sometimes you take it, you're like,

914
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,140
oh, yeah, yeah, I'm just here.

915
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,380
You don't even think about it in the way

916
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,740
that when you're seeing the how to train

917
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,860
your dragon land or monsters, which are obviously

918
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,740
a little more unusual for you to come across.

919
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,900
Yeah, they're not trying to depict a type of place

920
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,500
that exists, you have nowhere to set your expectation,

921
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,780
but again, to go back to the dreaminess

922
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,300
that you were feeling, it was just a bug out.

923
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,700
I felt just weird jitters in my brain,

924
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,140
how much it was transporting me across the world

925
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,180
so realistically.

926
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,940
I think that an interesting thing

927
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,220
about theme park location design is like,

928
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,700
yeah, film sets communicate the place

929
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,260
the film's taking place, but then editing

930
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,540
like layers and layers of filters and camera cuts

931
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,700
and all that stuff, you have that at your disposal

932
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,780
with filmmaking, but theme parks need to make

933
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,580
the place look like the final product.

934
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,700
Yeah, sure, from the get-go for one unbroken shot,

935
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,700
as it were, and it's just, yeah, it's jaw-dropping.

936
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,620
I don't, without having been on the ride,

937
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,060
I'm in no place to say if this is the best

938
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,580
of wizarding world, but I do know

939
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,180
that that initial reveal is like,

940
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,700
I just wanted the most impressive sights

941
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,260
in any universe park or any park, I'd say.

942
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,700
I'll say this too, going back to the ride,

943
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,220
this isn't, I guess I don't have to say specifically how,

944
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,340
but they did the King's Cross station thing

945
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,060
where you see the person go through the wall

946
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,100
on the Hogwarts Express.

947
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,100
The way they do a magical transport in the line

948
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,100
for the queue for Ministry of Magic is the best.

949
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,020
It's so cool, I went backwards and did it again.

950
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,700
Oh, you did, of course, yes, you should,

951
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,340
because the way that the King's Cross station one is like,

952
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,220
you see somebody go through the wall,

953
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,020
so it's almost like the illusion isn't happening

954
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,180
to you, actually, the person,

955
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,580
you're just seeing someone in front of you.

956
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,540
So you go, oh, that's cool,

957
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,060
it looks like they went through the wall.

958
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,860
This, the way they do it now, or in this ride,

959
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,540
it happens to you.

960
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,380
Yes, yeah.

961
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,300
You get to experience it, and it's a very, it's.

962
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,980
I went back and I'm like, I just gotta do this

963
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,300
with like arms wide open again, I just have,

964
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,580
I gotta like, no, you didn't take it in,

965
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,220
you didn't really do it enough.

966
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,780
It's simple too, it's not like,

967
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,300
I don't know how they did it,

968
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,180
it's just, I was very impressed with it.

969
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,020
It's a cool thing to happen to you.

970
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,900
Just a cool thing that happens to you

971
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,500
right before the big reveal.

972
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,340
Yeah, yeah.

973
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,580
I almost want to, and we don't have to fully veer away

974
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,740
from Potter, certainly, but I'm almost like wanting to

975
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,180
go elsewhere just by, for the sake of,

976
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,500
because we know it better, because we got to do other stuff.

977
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,940
Yeah.

978
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,220
If you don't mind hopping over to Nintendo.

979
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,060
Oh, sure.

980
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,140
Which was, was that the first like actual portal

981
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,980
we went through?

982
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,100
I want to say. I think so, yeah.

983
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,060
Well, I mean, I did, I did Stardust Racers first,

984
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,900
but that's not a portal.

985
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,140
We can talk Stardust Racers.

986
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,980
I don't care.

987
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,820
By the way. Either way.

988
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,660
Well, let's, yeah, why not talk Nintendo a little bit,

989
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,180
because that's, you know, Nintendo, we know we have it here,

990
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,300
we've had mixed feelings about some of the offerings,

991
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,500
but we, of course, made a beeline through the portal,

992
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,220
which, what's best portal?

993
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,300
What's best portal?

994
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,140
You mean, well.

995
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,660
It's yourself, regardless of what you see

996
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,500
when you're at the end of it,

997
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,820
because we ranked what we thought they were going to be

998
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,660
in an episode.

999
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,140
I want to say that was on a second gate.

1000
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,220
Now that you've been, favorite portal.

1001
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,540
You mean the literal.

1002
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,380
It itself.

1003
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
Walking through the portal itself.

1004
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,220
Yes.

1005
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,040
I mean, I think it's probably.

1006
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,880
The design on the outside,

1007
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,820
but what happens on the inside,

1008
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,460
because some of them are longer than others.

1009
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,740
I think all have like screen components

1010
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,100
that kind of make it more magical.

1011
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,340
I think it's Nintendo.

1012
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,780
Yeah, I thought so too.

1013
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,220
I thought it was a little leading that I asked you

1014
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,060
that question at this moment.

1015
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,220
I mean, I knew what you were going for.

1016
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,100
But I, because I, the others are great.

1017
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,860
I like all the portals very much.

1018
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,700
Yeah.

1019
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,620
But the escalator, the fact that you got an escalator.

1020
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,180
Spoiler alert, there's an escalator

1021
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,020
that takes you into.

1022
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,540
Well, I like that.

1023
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,380
It's really neat.

1024
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,540
I love an escalator.

1025
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,460
Well, it kind of, and it kind of makes you feel,

1026
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,820
it feels a little vagacy.

1027
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,580
It feels like you're going into a Mario casino.

1028
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,500
That's a good point, yeah.

1029
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,320
Yes, yeah.

1030
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,580
Is it an escalator or a speed ramp?

1031
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,420
Escalator.

1032
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,740
It is steps, okay.

1033
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,260
Yes, yeah.

1034
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,100
Yeah.

1035
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,580
So it definitely builds up that reveal

1036
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,180
of the Mushroom Kingdom.

1037
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,700
You get more music then too,

1038
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,020
to really build up the reveal.

1039
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,860
Yes, true.

1040
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,180
You get a little hyped up.

1041
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,900
And then, you know, obviously cool to see

1042
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,180
the fully fleshed out version of Nintendo World

1043
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,420
that is not really what we have here.

1044
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,180
It has like the extra dimensions and room for Yoshi.

1045
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,740
But we go pretty quickly straight back to Donkey Kong

1046
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,580
and to Minecart Madness.

1047
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,420
Yes.

1048
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
Where to begin with Minecart Madness?

1049
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,500
Well, there was a little bit of question I'd say.

1050
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,880
I think we, I brought up the possibility

1051
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,460
that maybe this thing was gonna be a little lacking,

1052
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,300
a little underwhelmed.

1053
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,460
I was concerned from ride through videos that I watched.

1054
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,420
Yes.

1055
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,660
We had really though, we were hanging a lot on this ride.

1056
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,500
Yes.

1057
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,320
Yeah, I was.

1058
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,140
One of the first things we wanted to do,

1059
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,420
and it might have like set the tempo.

1060
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,260
Yeah.

1061
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,100
You know, if we really liked it,

1062
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,120
if we didn't really like it.

1063
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,140
Feelings?

1064
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,900
It's really fun.

1065
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,740
It's really good.

1066
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,580
It's really fun.

1067
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,000
I really like it.

1068
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,140
I can see there's a look, some of the,

1069
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,340
there's a little like parts

1070
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,460
where you really get jerked around.

1071
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,020
But I don't know, it's fun.

1072
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,860
It didn't bother me.

1073
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,680
That's what you're after though.

1074
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,400
You're always, you're wanting to get to.

1075
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,180
I want to be handled in a certain way.

1076
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,020
That's true.

1077
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,200
And I want to get fucked up.

1078
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,980
This is a new way.

1079
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,180
This is a new sensation of being handled.

1080
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,940
So I haven't gotten used to being handled that way yet.

1081
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,300
And maybe I will completely grow to like it.

1082
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,940
Now I will say, spoiler alert,

1083
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,940
a lot of these rides at Universal crush my genitals.

1084
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,020
Many of them, including Donkey Kong,

1085
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,660
got pretty close to crushing my genitals.

1086
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,740
I'm a tall guy.

1087
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,100
The way I sit on these weird seats to point up.

1088
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,820
And then I try to get away

1089
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,940
only putting it down a little bit.

1090
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,260
And then nine times out of 10,

1091
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,740
an employee comes by, jams it right down on my penis.

1092
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,420
Nine times out of 10, that's what happens.

1093
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,900
And I believe on Donkey Kong,

1094
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,940
I made it through not pushing it down.

1095
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,500
But then on one of the jumps,

1096
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,100
the thing ratcheted down anyway.

1097
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,860
So I got crushed anyway on Donkey Kong.

1098
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,780
Wow.

1099
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,940
I was going to bring this up later.

1100
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,620
I was going to address this in the curse

1101
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,300
of the werewolf zone,

1102
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,060
which is a spinning coaster in the monsters area.

1103
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,180
Because we were seated next to each other there.

1104
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,020
And it was at that point that you confided in me

1105
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,020
that you seem to believe there's some kind of conspiracy

1106
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,140
at Universal Studios specifically

1107
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,420
to get your crotch as crushed as possible.

1108
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,260
Yeah.

1109
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,080
It certainly seems like it.

1110
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,380
You said Diddy Kong looked at you and said,

1111
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,500
even you cannot escape original sin, Michael.

1112
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,580
It's being punished.

1113
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,420
You're being punished.

1114
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,260
I'm being punished.

1115
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,980
I don't know what the deal with that is,

1116
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,460
but something's going on.

1117
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,300
Yeah, what is it?

1118
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,300
Well, is it somehow related to the more serious size issue

1119
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,580
that is complained about a lot at Disney?

1120
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,420
To some degree it is.

1121
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,180
That curse of the werewolf, my legs,

1123
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,540
I had to cross my legs.

1124
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,460
The employees were like,

1125
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,620
you have to cross your legs for it

1126
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,180
to be kind of comfortable.

1127
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,020
My God.

1128
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,540
So yes, talking about size-wise,

1129
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,940
as far as just, I don't know, girth,

1130
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,860
but height as well seems to be,

1131
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,180
is that what I should say that's appropriate?

1132
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,020
I don't think so.

1133
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,860
Keep going.

1134
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,340
I'm gonna see where this goes.

1135
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,180
I'm just saying it's size-wise.

1136
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,820
The roller coaster crushed my girth.

1137
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,340
No, I didn't mean that.

1138
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,860
No, no, no, I was saying that for people of size,

1139
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,060
there's issues getting on the right.

1140
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,540
Larger folk.

1141
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,980
Yes, I'm not talking about.

1142
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,260
He was not, I see, he was not taking an opportunity.

1143
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,620
No, I'm not talking about his little soda can.

1144
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,460
Oh God.

1145
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,280
His full chub.

1146
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,340
Now I have to leave this in, though.

1147
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,180
No, I was just speaking to,

1148
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,700
that's obviously the number one complaint

1149
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,780
that people have is that they make these rides

1150
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,840
for smaller frames or whatever,

1151
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,780
but I also like, it seems like their ideal person

1152
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,780
that gets in a ride is 5'9", 135 pounds.

1153
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,820
Yes.

1154
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,380
It's weird, I don't know what, I don't know why.

1155
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,060
They want a roller coaster car full of chalamets.

1156
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,380
They want a bunch of slight little guys.

1157
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,220
Yeah.

1158
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,300
That's not how the world is.

1159
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,580
I can clear half of one of those.

1160
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,420
Okay, well you're halfway there.

1161
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,700
I can clear one of those, so.

1162
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,740
Yeah, so it is something about it.

1163
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,860
I mean, I noticed it first going on the mummy out here

1164
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,660
20 years ago or something, where I was just like,

1165
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,840
this is an odd angle, and if I don't,

1166
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,820
if I'm not perfectly in before I have,

1167
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,460
like there's a pressure that gets on you

1168
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,120
when you're trying to get all your stuff,

1169
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,980
put it away, clamp it down,

1170
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,420
and especially if you haven't been on the ride yet.

1171
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:29,420
So like, I need like a two minute prep time.

1172
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,380
To settle in.

1173
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,300
To settle in and make sure I'm sitting at the correct angle,

1174
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,780
not to have one of these restraints come and crush me.

1175
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,700
You would say you need a little foreplay

1176
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,580
and a little aftercare to recover from those.

1177
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,300
Is, be careful how you handle my girth.

1178
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,260
Is, is aftercare a real term?

1179
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,100
Yeah.

1180
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,940
It is.

1181
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:51,780
Yeah.

1182
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,180
I was hoping you would say yes,

1183
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,380
because I don't know what that.

1184
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,780
It's like, cuddling and.

1185
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,620
Oh, okay.

1186
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,060
And patting, and being affectionate.

1187
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,460
Now this is now, I don't,

1188
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,860
despite this being questioned in the past,

1189
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,500
I have been having sex for a long time.

1190
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,340
And.

1191
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,180
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

1192
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,980
I've never, yeah, well this is what I found is

1193
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,460
it's a great way to connect with my partner.

1194
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,300
Yeah.

1195
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,120
But when I, but I,

1196
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,500
and yet the word aftercare is brand new to me.

1197
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,340
Care?

1198
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,940
I've never heard aftercare before.

1199
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,020
Is this something the kids say?

1200
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,180
I, I.

1201
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,820
How long have you been saying it?

1202
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,060
I, I haven't been saying, I learned about it.

1203
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,580
I feel like a while ago.

1204
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,420
Well, that's a while.

1205
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,240
Five years?

1206
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,080
Yeah, five years.

1207
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:28,920
Maybe four, five years.

1208
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,740
Five years of aftercare.

1209
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,580
I mean, it's just.

1210
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,420
Because I'm familiar with the concepts.

1211
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,660
It's just politeness and.

1212
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,340
I'm familiar with the concept that you're not supposed

1213
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,340
to make love and then go see you later.

1214
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,180
I know that.

1215
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah.

1216
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,380
I'm not totally out of it.

1217
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,840
I know the cuddling is good.

1218
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,820
I know that, but aftercare is new to me.

1219
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,060
Oh, okay.

1220
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,660
Well, you learn something new every day.

1221
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,500
Yeah.

1222
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,940
Not AppleCare, that's different.

1223
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,780
That is different.

1224
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,500
Oh, boy, they got me on the hook for that.

1225
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
I don't care for that.

1226
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,620
I never, I never, I never go in on the aftercare.

1227
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,020
Just too, just too expensive.

1228
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,420
I'm just, I'm a cheater, this guy.

1229
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,900
Seven dollars a month for this goddamn watch.

1230
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,100
So, so I guess what I'm getting at with Donkey Kong is

1231
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,220
I was not sitting in a great position on Donkey Kong.

1232
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,100
So some of the jerking around.

1233
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,340
Well, from what it described,

1234
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,900
from what you've described,

1235
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,820
we ended up on the same flight,

1236
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,260
and it sounds like a plane ride is this for you.

1237
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,100
Oh, God.

1238
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,580
Let alone, and you're not getting

1239
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,780
your girth crunched on that.

1240
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,620
Not unless you buckle your own seatbelt

1241
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,060
in a very bizarre fashion.

1242
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,060
No, plane ride in basic economy is hell for me,

1243
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,780
knees-wise.

1244
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,460
Just brute, like, it's, and then even sometimes

1245
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,820
if you pay like a hundred dollars

1246
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,300
to sit in the slightly better seats,

1247
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,260
that's, you got, you're talking like four inches better.

1248
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,580
That just turns you into me.

1249
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,060
And now it becomes like the still not.

1250
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:45,900
Right, it sucks for you.

1251
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,020
It doesn't become first class.

1252
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,220
It just becomes like you are bumping the seat

1253
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,900
in front of you instead of squeezing

1254
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,700
the high angle, your lanky legs.

1255
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,940
So I need to really, I need to,

1256
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,860
I need to prep better next time when we're in Epic.

1257
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:05,140
I need to prep for all sorts of different ways

1258
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,540
that my dick will be crushed.

1259
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,260
I think, so that's a, if you are a fan of dick crushing,

1260
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,100
then this is the park for you.

1261
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,300
Well, yes, and that is a fetish.

1262
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,140
I've heard of this.

1263
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,980
Jason, you've heard of this, right?

1264
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,620
Is there a name for it?

1265
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,860
I don't know.

1266
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,420
Cause like, you know, the, like,

1267
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,300
in my mind, it's like a Wall Street guy.

1268
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,300
He's really stressed out and he, you know,

1269
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,700
he's into some dark stuff.

1270
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,860
So he pays. Step on me.

1271
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,980
He pays a lady with a high heeled shoe

1272
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,220
to step on his penis.

1273
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,420
It's like the cold open of the first,

1274
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,380
the pilot of billions.

1275
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,220
Oh, is that right?

1276
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,060
Is that right?

1277
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,180
But yeah, Paul Giamatti is like,

1278
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,300
Dominatrix is beating him up and peeing on him.

1279
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,860
And I believe that actor is eventually the woman

1280
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,140
he would go on to marry.

1281
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,980
Whoa.

1282
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,380
Well, that's nice.

1283
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,700
That's a nice love story.

1284
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,780
Wow.

1285
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,620
So yeah, no, I don't.

1286
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,660
How did you meet?

1287
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:58,100
Any rollercoaster just turns you into,

1288
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,860
I'm trying to find the name really quick.

1289
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,940
Chuck.

1290
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,060
If you are,

1291
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,780
God, like you get off these rides saying,

1292
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,180
God, what am I?

1293
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,620
US attorney Chuck Rhodes Jr.

1294
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,100
If you are, if you are a day trader

1295
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,980
and you're spending 10 grand, 20 grand on a mistress,

1296
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,100
no, no, no.

1297
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,620
Go down to Orlando, go to Universal Studios.

1298
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,460
Yeah.

1299
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,700
And you can get 150 bucks.

1300
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,060
You can get your dick crushed all day.

1301
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,900
And you're like, is this some weird,

1302
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,460
is there some club I gotta know about?

1303
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,300
No, no.

1304
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,140
Oh, there is.

1305
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,180
It's called Universal's Epic Universe.

1306
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,020
For just a slight cover charge,

1307
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,100
you can have, you can totally fulfill

1308
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,380
all your crushing fantasies. Splurge for that express pass.

1309
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,500
What's $200 to a day train?

1310
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,340
You know?

1311
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,300
Yeah, of course.

1312
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,420
Yeah, then you can speed through all the girth crushings.

1313
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,580
But, but-

1314
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,580
Poor Mike, poor Mike.

1315
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,980
Donkey Kong was really fun.

1316
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,100
I mean, I don't wanna put down-

1317
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,740
But despite the dick crushings,

1318
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,660
the children's roller coaster is a lot of fun.

1319
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,780
No, it's, it was great.

1320
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,060
I don't, I can't speak to how,

1321
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,180
I think I had the concern, like,

1322
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,140
how effective is that jumping feeling actually gonna be?

1323
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,100
And I might say, not terribly,

1324
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,900
it's not like the illusion was ever like,

1325
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,340
wow, I'm jumping track.

1326
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,620
But that, but maybe that's not what it's about.

1327
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,980
It was a lot of fun either way.

1328
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,420
And things that I, that seemed like okay in a video

1329
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,220
were a lot more exciting in person.

1330
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,060
A lot more exciting, yes.

1331
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:22,340
Dixie, I do, despite having me not played these games

1332
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,860
for a long time, I consider them my friends,

1333
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,100
Donkey and Diddy and Dixie.

1334
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,060
I was really excited to see Dixie, wow, Dixie!

1335
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,900
Dixie Kong, yeah.

1336
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,900
And then, and then Donkey Kong animatronic at the end

1337
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,540
is massive. Rules, rules.

1338
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,020
He's a big boy, he's great.

1339
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,380
It is, and even in the land, the land you go in,

1340
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,060
and it's playing the Donkey Kong country theme.

1341
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,460
Yeah, exciting, very exciting.

1342
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,140
And it's exciting to hear Mario and stuff,

1343
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,100
and some especially like the Mario 64 castle music,

1344
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,580
which they play when you kind of go up the escalator.

1345
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,180
And that's nice, and there's great Mario music.

1346
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,340
But for some reason, in a park setting,

1347
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,460
the Donkey Kong country theme hits hard.

1348
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,340
It really does, all of that, donk, donk, donk, donk, donk.

1349
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,180
Yeah.

1350
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,740
It is, it's so fun just being in an environment

1351
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,420
that's that big piles of bananas

1352
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,660
are just so aesthetically pleasing.

1353
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,340
I just wanted to, I know that they would just be

1354
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,260
rock hard, and I wouldn't just tumble into them

1355
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,740
and get to roll around in them,

1356
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,100
but I did want to just pounce backwards

1357
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,980
into the banana piles, they look so nice.

1358
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,140
Seeing those letters throughout the land,

1359
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,380
K-O-N-G, like in the game.

1360
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,180
And then also, I realize that it must especially appeal

1361
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,900
to you, and me too, because I do like,

1362
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,340
despite having complained about the food,

1363
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,020
I do like the vibe of Margaritaville very much.

1364
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,100
And you kind of do get, it is kind of like

1365
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,260
cartoon Margaritaville.

1366
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,100
Yes.

1367
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,780
Like, because you do have sea planes,

1368
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,260
and you do have island rhythms,

1369
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:57,220
and it is a new, it shows you how

1370
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,340
they cannot just, they can't just cram a thing together

1371
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,060
and say that's the Nintendo theme park presence.

1372
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,540
There's so much to do there,

1373
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,700
because Donkey Kong feels entirely different

1374
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,780
than Mushroom Kingdom.

1375
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,900
Yeah.

1376
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,700
And better, cooler, liked it.

1377
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,900
Fountain, fountain, water gushing out of the mouth,

1378
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,980
the big head on the temple, really cool to look at.

1379
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,940
Yeah, the temple itself looks awesome as well.

1380
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,700
The ride itself in the temple looks really cool.

1381
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,340
And in a lot of ways, that track jumping looks cooler

1382
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,100
if you're not on the ride.

1383
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,380
Yeah, yes.

1384
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,700
It almost plays better.

1385
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,460
Cool decor to, this is so appealing.

1386
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,460
I can't wait to have it in Los Angeles,

1387
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,380
assuming that's where things are heading.

1388
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,580
Yeah, really neat.

1389
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,860
Now, I am worried, especially this one,

1390
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,860
it is like, if this becomes two hour wait,

1391
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,780
I don't know how you feel about.

1392
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:54,620
I feel like I have the ideal wait time in my head

1393
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,740
that aligns with what is a good Disneyland day for me.

1394
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,580
You know what I mean?

1395
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,820
Where this one, ideal, I'd like to be,

1396
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,140
I'd like to be through Indy in 35 or something.

1397
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:05,980
Sure.

1398
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,140
And if that's an hour, I'm like, yeah, shit.

1399
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,100
And I think this park for a long time

1400
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,420
is gonna be like, excuse me?

1401
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,740
What does this wait?

1402
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,060
Yeah, maybe, it's a good question and point

1403
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,300
because I think once you're past,

1404
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,140
especially, I mean, the first couple months,

1405
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,780
I do think your average park goer will have,

1406
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,860
they know that this is not gonna be easy, I think,

1407
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,620
if it's opening week, month, opening year,

1408
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,460
I don't know, six months.

1409
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,980
They might not, we might be breaking this to them.

1410
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,860
Listener, if you've been planning to go,

1411
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,980
I would count, if it was the way it was in preview,

1412
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,020
maybe that's misrepresentative,

1413
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,060
but my guess would certainly be

1414
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,420
that these lines are gonna be outrageous.

1415
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,260
That's gonna be very,

1416
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,820
I mean, Donkey Kong's gonna be so popular.

1417
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,340
People are gonna really wanna do that.

1418
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,180
And rightfully so.

1419
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,020
And rightfully so.

1420
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,860
Yes.

1421
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,260
But it is interesting because I wonder,

1422
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,780
I wonder, I mean, this is something for a Lentesta

1423
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,900
to figure out, how crazy does the ride experience

1424
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,340
have to be to make you feel

1425
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,060
that an hour plus wait was worth it?

1426
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,820
I don't have this equation in my head,

1427
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,820
but for instance, when we first went on Spider-Man

1428
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,460
when I was whatever, in whatever year, 1999 or whatever,

1429
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,540
we waited, it felt like four hours,

1430
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,740
three or four hours to go on Spider-Man.

1431
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,420
And we got off it and we're like,

1432
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,900
it was worth it.

1433
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,420
We did think that.

1434
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,920
So it will be interesting to see if monsters in ministry

1435
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,060
are the ones where, if people get stuck in there

1436
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,900
for two hours, those things are so cool

1437
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,860
that ultimately people are like,

1438
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,620
well, I think it was awesome, though.

1439
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,900
I think those are the only ones

1440
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,740
that are really gonna happen.

1441
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,540
It's possible, yeah.

1442
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,020
Because Dunkin' is on the shorter side.

1443
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,980
It definitely is, yeah.

1444
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,980
And I could see, I don't know,

1445
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,260
I was just on the lookout for what are the things

1446
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,940
that are gonna tip anything into bad review territory.

1447
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,300
And I think that could certainly be one.

1448
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,260
Wait time wise, yeah.

1449
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,140
Another one that I think is a bellwether

1450
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,940
for what morale is gonna be like going through this park

1451
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,660
is not far, and a thing we didn't get to do

1452
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,540
because it's not in LA, Yoshi's Adventure.

1453
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,940
I think that is one.

1454
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,900
I'd had my questions about this, too,

1455
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,420
in watching videos from Japan.

1456
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,980
I have thought, is it like, I don't know,

1457
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,180
like, it's a little dinky, right?

1458
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,860
And if like, what if you waited 45 minutes for this,

1459
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,060
I think you'd end up mad.

1460
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,720
I think that you could see some lines that long

1461
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,980
for Yoshi's Adventure, which I'd be worried about.

1462
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,560
Now we got to do it, I think we did it twice

1463
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,980
and one at the most, it was like 20 minutes.

1464
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,000
I would like to go on record saying

1465
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,040
I'm a big fan of Yoshi's Adventure.

1466
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,800
I don't know if I'd be with a longer wait,

1467
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,800
but as it is, it feels very Disney in its fantasy land type.

1468
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,360
It doesn't promise much, but it really delivers

1469
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,560
on the not much that it promises.

1470
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,780
I think it's a key, I think it is the biggest error

1471
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:06,480
by far in Nintendo in Hollywood

1472
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,760
that they left this thing out.

1473
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,200
It is like the thing, much like,

1474
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,120
everybody talks about the Bantha thing

1475
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,240
in Resident Resistance, for sure Yoshi

1476
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,240
is the little, fun character, like the cute ride

1477
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,600
that becomes weirdly the most important part

1478
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,560
and the most fun part.

1479
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,240
It makes me so mad that I can't take my kids on this thing

1480
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,560
because I could take my little one,

1481
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,880
I could take my seven-month-old on this thing.

1482
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,320
That is truly a ride for everybody.

1483
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,280
It's so cute, so fun, so successful at hitting

1484
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,440
the kind of low bar that it sets for itself.

1485
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,160
I really like this, I'm like very,

1486
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,640
I don't know if I'm just like dad cute aglow

1487
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,520
over this Yoshi ride, but I wanted to take my boys

1488
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,360
very much.

1489
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,560
I wish that, yes, I could take my daughter on this

1490
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,120
because there is a really good big room,

1491
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,480
big-ish room of robots that represents a lot of-

1492
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,520
The show scene is a good, yeah.

1493
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,040
I mean, it also makes me not upset,

1494
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,240
but a little bit disappointed that you could have just

1495
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,400
tripled the size of this ride.

1496
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,960
It's not that big and had a really great-

1497
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,520
It was like people mover length.

1498
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,840
Well, that would be even better.

1499
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,680
It's just a 10-minute jump through the entire-

1500
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,280
That would be unbelievable, that would be unbelievable,

1501
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,960
but I don't, it seems short-sighted to me

1502
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,960
that you wouldn't put a actual kid's ride in Nintendo Land.

1503
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,080
Like this.

1504
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,280
And we've said before, I think some people with Mario Kart

1505
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,440
like Mario Kart, but really, we would be fine

1506
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,880
with a Mr. Toad Mario Kart.

1507
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,920
We would be fine with a small dark ride Mario Kart as well.

1508
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,600
It doesn't have to be Cars Land.

1509
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,720
Much more fine, I think, with that, yeah, absolutely.

1510
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,120
But so it is disappointing, I'm like,

1511
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,560
this is such a fun, slow, good kid's ride,

1512
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,960
but it gives you what you want,

1513
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,520
a bunch of really big, fun robots.

1514
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,560
Seeing baby Yoshi, would you call it baby Yoshi,

1515
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,240
or would you call it like-

1516
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,160
Well, they're like that.

1517
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,280
It's like pre, it's like Yoshi Mach 1.

1518
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,120
Yeah, well, yeah.

1519
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,440
Before they eat stuff and then get big.

1520
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,880
Super Mario World Yoshi, when he hatches

1521
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,480
right out of the egg, but he's not big yet.

1522
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,200
The ones that have to get carried around and fed.

1523
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,040
Yeah, you've got a few to three berries,

1524
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,160
and then he grows up into regular Yoshi.

1525
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,200
Yeah, that too, you saw me with those berries.

1526
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,040
I like stopped-

1527
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,240
You got very excited about the berries.

1528
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,680
I just like hugged them.

1529
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,520
Seeing the Yoshi berries-

1530
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,680
He did hug these physicalized?

1531
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,520
I'm not making that up.

1532
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,360
I did hug them at one point.

1533
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,200
No, I saw it, I'm not making it up either.

1534
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,040
He hugged the berries, I saw it.

1535
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,880
I thought I did, like I blacked out.

1536
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,760
What'd I do last night?

1537
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,080
Did I hug a bunch of Yoshi berries?

1538
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,120
Mike sent a picture of you at Jelly Rolls,

1539
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,400
and you still had Yoshi berry all over your face.

1540
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,240
Yeah.

1541
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,040
I'm never watching this face again.

1542
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,880
Yeah.

1543
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,920
Hey, sounds like some of this land

1544
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,920
already got hit with Donald Trump's tariffs, huh?

1545
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,920
What?

1546
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,760
What?

1547
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,960
Why?

1548
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,800
In what way?

1549
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,120
Well, I was trying to connect it to-

1550
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,960
Now explain.

1551
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,520
Nintendo delayed the pre-orders for the Switch 2.

1552
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,480
Oh, okay.

1553
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,320
Just this morning.

1554
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,160
That's because of-

1555
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,000
I didn't know that.

1556
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,840
I just thought you were maybe like a berry-

1557
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,880
Yeah, yeah, because it's gonna have to be imported.

1558
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,720
Okay.

1559
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,800
I thought you were doing like a berry delivery,

1560
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,840
because you said the land,

1561
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,040
so I was thinking like berries were-

1562
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,280
The berries are a thousand dollars a bushel?

1563
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,520
Yeah, I just got greedy, I don't know.

1564
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,360
I know, I saw him-

1565
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,600
And you threw a drumph in there too,

1566
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,840
which just really threw the whole-

1567
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,000
I didn't go, I'm just trying to contribute.

1568
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,800
I like your sitting there.

1569
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,840
That's the most defensive thing ever said.

1570
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,440
Well, I'm not mad at it, I just wanted to be clear.

1571
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,760
Yeah, I'll workshop it, I'll workshop it.

1572
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,760
Just kidding, yeah, yeah, get the clubs.

1573
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,440
I'll workshop for the live shows.

1574
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,440
If you can edit, well, if you wanna come up with it

1575
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,320
and then re-record the joke on your own,

1576
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,360
I'll insert it in the show.

1577
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,040
Just dub it in, yeah, yes.

1578
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,120
Do it like ADR, okay,

1579
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,600
you gotta drop it in exactly the same amount of time.

1580
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,480
And then Scott and I will do

1581
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,800
our own live reactions at home and I'll edit it all in.

1582
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,800
Okay, put a cup, pot of coffee on,

1583
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,680
get me some long cigarettes and I'll get to work.

1584
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,720
Long cigarettes.

1585
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,760
Oh, can I say something about your show too

1586
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,640
before we move on?

1587
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,000
We've touched on this on the show briefly,

1588
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,400
but if you haven't been on this ride,

1589
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,760
and you probably haven't,

1590
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,160
because it's only in Japan,

1591
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,440
to the public until this place opens,

1592
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,960
it is a little kind of omnimover,

1593
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,480
everybody gets the different colors of Yoshi

1594
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,800
and you get to explore rooftops that,

1595
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,320
technically you could see from a lot of places

1596
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,080
in the Super Nintendo world,

1597
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,880
but you get a special vantage point and little fun scenes

1598
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,480
and one Yoshi chomping the other who blew up a balloon

1599
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,560
and he's riding them around,

1600
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,840
and you get a talking toad instead.

1601
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,240
There's a lot of cute things you can only see

1602
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,160
from these vantage points,

1603
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,920
but there is a light,

1604
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,200
I don't know if you'd call it a story,

1605
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,960
I don't know if you'd call it a game,

1606
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,880
but it's kind of a task that you have,

1607
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,560
which is finding all three eggs of different colors.

1608
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,600
Let's say, I don't remember,

1609
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,840
I wanna say it's like spotted eggs

1610
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,200
and it's like red, green, and blue.

1611
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,440
The ride ended the first time,

1612
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,920
Mike and I both failed to find all of the eggs.

1613
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,880
We both just got a big old F

1614
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,840
on the children's spot the egg game.

1615
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,720
The children's word search kind of game.

1616
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,560
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, with big bold buttons.

1617
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,600
Yes, no, it looks like the worksheets

1618
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,960
that my son is bringing home from TK

1619
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,800
and we got a two out of three.

1620
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,560
I mean, that should be nicer, that's a D.

1621
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,400
We didn't get an F, we got a D.

1622
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,600
Well, look, we were taking in everything, you know?

1623
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,720
Yeah, not so goal-oriented.

1624
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,560
No.

1625
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,240
Just trying to be there, be in the moment,

1626
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,680
take a deep breath, but I felt very stupid

1627
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,040
that I missed only three eggs, but less stupid

1628
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,240
because you were also the same amount of stupid.

1629
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,680
That's true, yes, we must have both remarked

1630
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,480
about something we liked at the same time

1631
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,960
when that egg passed.

1632
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,880
It's just gonna be a cadre of millennial parents sobbing

1633
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,640
because they see Yoshi and then a generation

1634
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,880
of iPad kids going, what do you mean

1635
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,600
you didn't get all the eggs?

1636
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,440
Because they've spotted.

1637
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,640
It's the easiest game ever made.

1638
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,480
Yeah.

1639
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,560
I've been playing things more complex

1640
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,800
than this since I was four.

1641
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,520
You put me on Fruit Ninja when I was three months old.

1642
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,840
Yeah, no, I think about this all the time.

1643
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,440
My daughter, one of her favorite things

1644
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,560
is to watch me play video games now.

1645
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,880
I've never played, I have been playing video games

1646
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,880
the most in the last decade ever since she's been born

1647
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,440
because she loves video games, but can you imagine

1648
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,000
what she thinks a video game is

1649
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,880
versus what we thought a video game was at five years old?

1650
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,720
Oh, no.

1651
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,560
Oh, yeah.

1652
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,920
And then when I play Mario Odyssey and he turns 2D,

1653
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,480
she goes, no, no flat Mario.

1654
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,640
No, she doesn't like old school.

1655
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,280
Yeah, she does not like old school.

1656
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,240
She likes the bright 3D.

1657
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,800
Well, then she would hate the portal

1658
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,360
and the Kronos itself where it's like a coin

1659
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,000
that flips around and it has kind of classic current Mario

1660
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,200
but also 8-bit, which made me happy to see flat pixel Mario

1661
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,440
but your daughter would freak out.

1662
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,560
No, but not my toddler.

1663
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,240
She only likes Mario in three dimensions.

1664
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,480
Well, you just had to sit her down and explain the context.

1665
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,320
I did.

1666
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,480
Maybe put on some YouTube documentaries.

1667
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,680
I have, I said, this is how daddy played the game

1668
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,080
when he was your age, not your age,

1669
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,240
but a little older than you.

1670
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,400
And then she said her first words, shut up, daddy.

1671
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,360
Bored, daddy.

1672
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,480
No, she kinda says that. Daddy sucks.

1673
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,400
She kinda says that.

1674
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,560
Yeah, back to your Donkey Kong concern specifically,

1675
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,000
I did pull out the Fastpass and it does say

1676
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:51,040
it's not valid at the ministry and Minecart Madness.

1677
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,800
So that must mean they also are concerned capacity-wise

1678
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,680
because they don't wanna hand out a free

1679
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,360
skip the line pass to Donkey Kong.

1680
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,200
So I'm sure that-

1681
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,040
They chose those two.

1682
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,520
Those are the only two that you're restricted from buying.

1683
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,320
Oh, so you can use for monsters again.

1684
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,080
Use it for monsters or stardust or.

1685
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,440
Interesting, that's weird.

1686
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,360
Well, yeah, maybe it's less that they're considering

1687
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,440
the e-ticket and more of a capacity.

1688
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,560
This is, it's also really like, as we said about Yoshi,

1689
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,360
now imagine Donkey Kong and it's double

1690
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,560
and you really get cooking and you really get fast

1691
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,480
on that thing.

1692
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,160
That becomes one of the best rides ever made.

1693
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,560
100% it does.

1694
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,400
Yeah, yeah.

1695
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,080
Yes, there's a few things at Epic that do feel like

1696
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:36,240
if you doubled this, it would be top ride in the world.

1697
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,320
Yes, there's definitely a number of, oh, and we're done.

1698
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,600
That does happen a lot, unfortunately.

1699
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,280
Yeah, so, right.

1700
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,320
So yeah, as far as the quality of the robots

1701
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,560
and the quality of the jumps or the scares

1702
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,880
or whatever you'd like, there were a couple of places

1703
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,960
where like, ah, like I did go, like it got me for real

1704
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,280
on Donkey and yes, it is,

1705
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,280
Nintendo is so good and it feels like

1706
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,440
with just a couple different changes early on,

1707
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,600
it would have been like unbelievable.

1708
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,440
Yeah.

1709
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,280
Overall.

1710
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,160
Yeah. With everything.

1711
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,600
Well, it's just been crazy watching all of this migrate

1712
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,840
from like, you know, okay, so these like AR helmets,

1713
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,000
okay, well, it sounds like, boy,

1714
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,360
that could really be interesting that we try it.

1715
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,920
Oh God, not good.

1716
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:26,080
Weird, crazy, then like it's like the common talking point

1717
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:29,760
with like, you know, like other parents at school

1718
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,160
if theme parks come up or like, or my mother-in-law,

1719
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,720
that like, well, you know, I just tell the kids

1720
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,560
just take the helmet off.

1721
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,640
It's like, gone from like, it's something

1722
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,840
we the theme park nerds know too,

1723
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,280
it is the common talking point.

1724
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,120
Yeah.

1725
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:42,960
Those are people who just,

1726
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,040
anybody who goes to the parks,

1727
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,080
like the Mario Kart ride is fine if you don't have to wait

1728
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,800
and you don't wear the helmet.

1729
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,560
That was like the point of doing it.

1730
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,400
What happened?

1731
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,480
How does it land there?

1732
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,840
I think it's still well received

1733
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,000
by your average park goer in some ways.

1734
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,840
Yeah.

1735
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,680
Supposedly.

1736
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,520
I know, I know what you mean.

1737
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,320
I don't, and the fact that it'd be hard for them to say,

1738
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,640
like, it's a failure because the lines are so crazy long

1739
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,240
and it made it to the tidy two

1740
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,760
in the fake office Final Four.

1741
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,960
I mean, it has back and forth for it now too.

1742
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,800
Yeah.

1743
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,840
Like, you wanna talk about spoiler warning.

1744
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,680
Yeah, that's true.

1745
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,920
I'm sorry, if you hadn't listened to that.

1746
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,440
You have your draft kings, like I...

1747
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,840
How much you betting on this week's PTR?

1748
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,400
How much are you betting on the PTR fake offices?

1749
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,320
Can we go real quick?

1750
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,160
I forgot.

1751
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,840
I wanted to say, spoiler alert,

1752
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,720
say the name of the drink I got.

1753
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,680
I don't remember what was in it,

1754
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,200
but in Burning Blade,

1755
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,080
I really like the name of the drink.

1756
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,920
Yes, what is it?

1757
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,000
The name of the drink is My Only Weakness,

1758
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,480
which is really fun to order on My Only Weakness.

1759
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,720
That's really good.

1760
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,600
Maybe a good time to pivot to some other food stuff

1761
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,480
because actually the first thing we did when we came in

1762
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,800
was get a bite with a group that we were with

1763
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:57,120
and this gave you the opportunity.

1764
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,240
First of all, what was that restaurant?

1765
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,880
Was that called Oak and...

1766
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,080
Oh yeah, Oak and something Tavern, yes.

1767
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,360
Oak and Star Tavern, where I did not eat,

1768
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,600
but every piece of food I was looking at on the table

1769
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,120
looked pretty good.

1770
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:10,960
Was yours?

1771
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,160
It was, yeah, it was a little like,

1772
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,880
I ate a barbecue sandwich for lunch with brisket.

1773
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,560
Yeah, great, great.

1774
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,160
But it was good, I mean it was good

1775
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,880
and they had the Coke freestyle machines.

1776
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,000
And in there, something very special

1777
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,160
and that's what I wanted to get your thoughts on.

1778
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,000
Oh, sure.

1779
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,120
This is in How to Train Your Dragon, Isle of Berk.

1780
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,120
No, this is, no, confusingly from that name,

1781
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,920
now we are in Center of Park, Celestial Park.

1782
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,760
Well, here we are.

1783
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,880
Maybe there's a lot of, definitely it's like

1784
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,240
the food and beverage place,

1785
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,280
it's where sit-down restaurants are.

1786
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,760
And we'll get into it.

1787
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,560
Since you said Coke freestyle,

1788
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,360
I forgot until we were there

1789
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,000
that something very special is in there,

1790
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,560
a very special beverage is in there.

1791
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,200
Would you like to explain?

1792
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,880
Yes, I think it's called the Celestial Spritz.

1793
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,160
Jason, have you seen this?

1794
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,880
No, what is this?

1795
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,640
It's a soda that is only in Celestial Park.

1796
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,520
Or only in the park in general?

1797
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,880
Is this an Epic Universe specific soda?

1798
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,400
It is, but it's not the only Universal,

1799
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,680
Epic Universe specific soda

1800
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,600
because I had one in Monsters as well.

1801
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,440
Wow, wow.

1802
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,240
So I just, I didn't know that until later,

1803
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,840
but Celestial Spritz to me tasted like

1804
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,800
you had like a peach soda

1805
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,240
and then somebody dumped a bunch of water in it.

1806
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,800
I wrote down, you described it as watered down Fanta.

1807
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,480
Yeah, sure, yeah.

1808
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,680
That's not a good review.

1809
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,400
It wasn't my favorite thing I've ever had in the world.

1810
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,160
It was okay, but I was excited to try it.

1811
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,000
Yeah, all right, I'll try it.

1812
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,760
I'll try all the different sodas.

1813
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,760
Yes, but, but later in the Monsters land,

1814
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:52,600
I tried Screaming Berry, Screaming Berry Zero

1815
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,440
to be specific.

1816
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,960
That has Mike Carlson written all over it.

1817
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,400
And that was good.

1818
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,800
Screaming Berry I'm a big fan of.

1819
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,520
So I had one hand my only weakness

1820
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,160
and another Screaming Berry Zero.

1821
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,320
You were, so in the sandwich,

1822
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,480
you were double fisted.

1823
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,720
Carlson, one is alcoholic and one is far from alcoholic.

1824
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,560
Correct.

1825
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,600
Perfect cocktail.

1826
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,040
And it's in that neck of the woods

1827
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,000
that you're getting a little buzzed,

1828
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,840
you're seeing a windmill light on fire,

1829
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,920
real rain comes in.

1830
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,760
It's a downpour.

1831
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,040
It's a downpour, 25% of each drink was Florida rainwater.

1832
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,200
That's a lot, yes, it's true, it's true.

1833
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,320
What did Screaming Berry taste like?

1834
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,920
It tasted like, you know, mixed berry soda of some kind.

1835
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,160
And it wasn't so unique maybe,

1836
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,520
but it was a good taste, I liked it.

1837
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,760
Okay.

1838
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,880
So I adore Screaming Berry.

1839
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,720
Okay, okay.

1840
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,120
Maybe not, I wish Celestial Spritz was better.

1841
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,280
I know, that's, it would have been

1842
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,240
a really victorious start to the day

1843
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,440
that the Celestial Soda is a big hit.

1844
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,280
Yeah.

1845
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,400
I guess you can't say that it is.

1846
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,480
That place, the theming,

1847
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,480
the, just like, just the craft in the bar itself,

1848
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,280
in the bathrooms. Yeah, it was really.

1849
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,680
This was, they have really gone wild

1850
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,040
just getting these restaurant facilities

1851
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,000
looking real sharp, really well-adorned.

1852
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,040
I was pretty blown away.

1853
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,960
The place that, you know, you might think of like,

1854
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,720
as being like, okay, so that's like

1855
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,640
just the pizza place, right?

1856
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,480
Yeah.

1857
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,320
Pizza Moon.

1858
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,240
Pizza Moon. Pizza Moon.

1859
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,640
Jason, are you excited, do you know about this?

1860
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:34,640
I know Pizza Moon, it like has the early film,

1861
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,120
the moon with the rocket in the eye.

1862
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,360
Well, that's the thing.

1863
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,080
It's like, in any other restaurant,

1864
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,960
any other theme park, this would just be like,

1865
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,280
you know when there's a place to get pizza

1866
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,400
and the pizza's fine, and I can't really,

1867
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,200
I had a little bit and it seemed like

1868
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,560
better than average theme park pizza,

1869
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,520
which we've been talking about is typically very bad.

1870
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,880
The theming and the design in this thing,

1871
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,760
yes, it's full-on, I mean, the more clever reference

1872
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,000
would be like old school trip to the moon,

1873
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,120
but I went to the thing that tributes it,

1874
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,840
Smashing Pumpkins Tonight Tonight.

1875
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,320
You are in the Smashing Pumpkins Tonight Tonight video.

1876
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,240
I thought you were gonna say Hugo.

1877
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,080
Hi, Vart.

1878
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,960
Oh, Scott's beloved Hugo.

1879
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,600
Yeah, yeah.

1880
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,560
It might be like stepping into Hugo.

1881
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,800
Like for, all right, now open the door

1882
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,480
to the pizza restaurant.

1883
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,640
Dear God, crazy Disneyland Paris Discovery Land

1884
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,640
level theming, like living dioramas with moving parts.

1885
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,880
It is like so much cooler in there

1886
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,080
than it has any right to be.

1887
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,200
Pizza Moon is pretty wild, I gotta say.

1888
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,040
Great, yeah.

1889
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,640
I didn't spend, we walked through Pizza Moon,

1890
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,120
you were in there a little longer than I was later,

1891
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,640
but yeah, it is for quick service pizza.

1892
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,560
It's not like a sit-down, you know,

1893
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,080
you're not waited on or anything.

1894
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,760
For quick service pizza, it's pretty crazy

1895
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,440
that it's that detailed.

1896
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,720
Yes, pretty astounding.

1897
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,920
Then I was, oh yes, go ahead.

1898
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,920
Is that where there's the little tongue?

1899
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,080
Remind me.

1900
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,200
There's a, like the Pizza Moon has a little tongue

1901
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,040
and he goes.

1902
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,120
On the outside?

1903
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:09,960
I believe so.

1904
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,800
I think so.

1905
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,040
I think the moon has a little tongue.

1906
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,840
A lightly upsetting moon tongue, yes.

1907
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:18,480
The Pizza Moon tongue moves, and I was thrilled.

1908
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,320
I was really excited.

1909
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,360
Does it kind of back and forth?

1910
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,440
Yeah, yeah, like he's like hungry.

1911
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,000
You know, like when Jason gets hungry for a meal.

1912
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,320
He goes.

1913
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,440
I know it, I live it.

1914
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,720
It's what he does in the steps before the aftercare.

1915
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,560
Yeah, right.

1916
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,280
My God.

1917
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,480
Why was that so crazy?

1918
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,960
How is that a level beyond anything that's been said?

1919
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,120
Jason's offended for the first time on the show.

1920
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,200
He fanned himself, like he had a fan on a porch.

1921
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,040
He's just thinking about pizza.

1922
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,040
My word.

1923
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,200
He's just thinking about that pizza moon.

1924
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,120
I'm thinking about the piece of grease getting everywhere.

1925
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,120
It's quite the name, it's a lexicon.

1926
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:01,120
I then got to sit and eat at the Atlantic,

1927
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,160
that is the name of like the big sit down.

1928
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,960
Yes, yes, yes.

1929
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,800
Very early as you come into Celestial Park

1930
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,080
with like grand views of the entire place

1931
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,400
in the lake and the fountain.

1932
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,920
Food was fantastic, really good cocktail there.

1933
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,480
I think everybody was really happy.

1934
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,880
It was during previews, however,

1935
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,080
and it's hard to not say that it took 90 minutes

1936
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,520
for the food to come.

1937
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,840
This was sort of insane.

1938
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,560
Granted, we were warned, like it's a little crazy in here,

1939
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,480
but when you get to 90, you're like,

1940
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,280
oh, it's more than a little crazy.

1941
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,600
I don't mean to be a complainer.

1942
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,280
This is a cool thing to get to do,

1943
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,160
but you had a certain point.

1944
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,760
So I don't know, all I can say is they gotta get a bit

1945
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,360
of that before it opens to the public.

1946
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,200
Fingers crossed, yeah.

1947
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,480
Got a lot of very unhappy people.

1948
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,920
I split off from the group at that point

1949
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,920
because I had a feeling, I didn't know 90 minutes,

1950
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,920
I just had a feeling like there'll be shenanigans

1951
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,760
at a sit-down restaurant in previews.

1952
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,840
No, you were right, you intuited correctly.

1953
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,480
Yeah, I was like, you know what?

1954
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,360
I think I'm gonna not do it.

1955
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,160
So yeah, I wandered at this point.

1956
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,920
But it was kind of like, as far as how we played the day,

1957
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,560
I think there were no regrets on any end

1958
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,800
because you didn't have to do food hijinks,

1959
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,680
but I was like, what if we're sitting here forever

1960
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,040
not getting our food and then suddenly they open Monsters?

1961
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:16,860
They did not.

1962
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,060
Well, sure.

1963
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,100
As we're checking, we're watching ride after ride

1964
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:23,180
go down as we're sitting and not getting our food.

1965
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,580
We're like, what's happening?

1966
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,500
This has just melt down fully in this place.

1967
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,300
Again, our experience, I don't know if this is how

1968
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,980
it's gonna keep going, might have been only that day.

1969
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,620
Theme Park previews, interesting, I don't know.

1970
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,660
Just never gotten to do it.

1971
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:38,300
It's wild to hit points of like, whoa, what's going on?

1972
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,820
This is getting crazy around here.

1973
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,220
Yeah, it would have been fun to hang out.

1974
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,500
I mean, I mean this sincerely.

1975
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,860
It would have been kind of fun to hang out

1976
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,220
and go, oh my God, it's taking so long at this restaurant.

1977
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,900
I wouldn't have had a fit or anything

1978
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,620
because going in, that's sort of the whole thing.

1979
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,960
But I just get, I'm a little regular with my eating.

1980
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,980
I'm kind of like, I need a piece of bread.

1981
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,220
That's the sense I got when you went to do it

1982
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,500
is that you needed to eat.

1983
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,140
Yeah, right then and then from there,

1984
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,780
I waited and waited for this.

1985
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:02,620
Yes.

1986
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:03,460
Yeah.

1987
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,740
No, not great, didn't play out great.

1988
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,660
I wandered to the show, the Harry Potter show at that point.

1989
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,180
Oh, right, yes.

1990
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,500
Which I don't wanna, I guess I really

1991
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,780
don't wanna spoil that.

1992
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,700
Yeah, I know, I like it and I recommend it.

1993
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,660
I almost don't wanna go further.

1994
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:21,420
All I'll say is that that, go see it.

1995
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:26,420
And I am very impressed with them making me confused

1996
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:29,180
about the geography of where I am.

1997
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,180
I know where I entered.

1998
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,900
I know I could get back there if I was in the park.

1999
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:36,100
But I couldn't draw on a map where I was

2000
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,060
once the show happened.

2001
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,120
Because basically, and this'll be,

2002
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,500
I think this is a good way to talk about this

2003
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,660
without actually spoiling the show

2004
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,220
is that there's a little tent.

2005
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:46,780
You probably see pictures of it.

2006
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,740
It's a little tent like, oh, a little show, come on in.

2007
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,580
Because it's a circus.

2008
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:50,420
What is it?

2009
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,260
Circus show or whatever.

2010
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,700
Is it Cirque Arcanou?

2011
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,520
Yes.

2012
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,360
Is that the right word?

2013
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,620
I believe Cirque Arcanou, something like that.

2014
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,460
Cirque Arcanou.

2015
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:57,900
Yes, and there's a, spoiler alert,

2016
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,340
there's a guy that does talks like this, which is great.

2017
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,820
Maybe there is in the movie, I don't know.

2018
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,660
That might be a good story.

2019
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,500
Never seen it.

2020
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,340
Don't know.

2021
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,220
I don't know about the Cirque Arcanou.

2022
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,220
Never gonna see it.

2023
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,660
There's a tent, there's a tent.

2024
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,460
And yeah, and you go into it and it's a very small,

2025
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,140
this is operationally, I'm wondering how they will do this

2026
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,740
because there's not a queue to get in the tent.

2027
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:21,820
There's just a big clump of people all being funneled

2028
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,180
into a very small tent.

2029
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,900
And I was like, oh, this is gonna be interesting

2030
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,220
on an opening week or whatever.

2031
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,540
Because it felt very chaotic.

2032
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,500
It felt like, ah, people didn't know where they were going,

2033
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,820
whatever, and we're funneling into a small tent.

2034
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,940
And then you go in this queue that is really intimate.

2035
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,380
There's really kind of small, just like,

2036
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:41,780
and I'm like, I don't know anything about this.

2037
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,580
And then ultimately you filter into another room

2038
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,180
and you filter into a theater.

2039
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,020
But once we're in the theater,

2040
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,060
I was like, where are we in the park?

2041
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:53,060
Because it doesn't give you any hint

2042
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,500
of a full big theater show.

2043
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,020
So you obviously, you're somewhere backstage in some ways.

2044
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,740
It's a real, I wanna say it's like a Russian nesting doll,

2045
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,780
but that doesn't feel accurate

2046
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,420
because those get smaller and smaller.

2047
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,900
This is like, it's like an inverse.

2048
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,140
It gets so, I was there a bigger doll inside.

2049
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,540
It's an opposite Russian nesting doll.

2050
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,380
You see, you get it?

2051
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,220
Great.

2052
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,180
It feels like The Masked Magician,

2053
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,260
a lot of the tricks on Masked Magician,

2054
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,100
it's like, oh, they've actually been doing this

2055
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,020
for like 100 years.

2056
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,860
It's still just trickery and it still works.

2057
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,140
All it really was, I'm sure,

2058
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:25,820
is they just funnel you backstage.

2059
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,660
Yeah.

2060
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,020
It just doesn't, the way you kind of wind around

2061
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,820
in that initial line, then go into the pre-show

2062
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,300
and then go into a theater,

2063
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,020
it just, like your brain just doesn't quite know

2064
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,180
where you are.

2065
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,820
And I would, it'd be interesting,

2066
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,300
I didn't try this yet to go on Google Maps

2067
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,660
and go, oh, here's the theater.

2068
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,940
Figure out where the actual facility is.

2069
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:46,820
Because I'm just, it's a very effective way

2070
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:48,140
at disorienting you.

2071
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,260
It makes you think you're getting something

2072
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,100
that's smaller scale than what it ends up being.

2073
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:51,940
Yes, exactly.

2074
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,620
So, and then, yes.

2075
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,980
Then you go, oh, wow, this is a bigger thing.

2076
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,340
I thought maybe the pre-show was actually the show.

2077
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,180
Yeah, yes.

2078
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,020
For a half second.

2079
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,780
Because something fun happens.

2080
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:04,460
I'll say this, you see the show,

2081
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,060
you're like, oh, it's gonna be one of these

2082
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:06,980
and that'll be fun.

2083
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,220
And then there's something else happens

2084
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,340
and you go, oh, okay, okay.

2085
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:10,180
No, no, bigger, yeah, yeah.

2086
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,860
You got some bigger scale scope.

2087
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:14,380
Yeah, it's almost the most spoilery thing.

2088
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,540
It's, it is hard to talk about.

2089
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,380
Yeah, I don't wanna say it.

2090
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,220
I won't say it.

2091
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,460
So, here's what I would, I'm gonna, you know,

2092
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:20,540
I touched on the negative,

2093
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,020
the way that this food situation worked out.

2094
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:27,180
And here's where, Jason, I don't wanna,

2095
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,160
I don't wanna break your little heart here.

2096
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,220
But there is, I wanna touch on a little bit of downside

2097
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:33,300
of the trip.

2098
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,100
I think Mike may have already warned me

2099
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,060
about where you're going.

2100
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,860
Yeah, yes.

2101
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,860
And I don't wanna break the audience's little hearts either.

2102
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,380
But there's, you know, I think there's been a lot of buildup

2103
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,300
in the pre-materials about Celestial Park

2104
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,940
and about this, like, that it's, you know,

2105
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,820
it's not really like an entrance area and just that.

2106
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,260
That it's not, that it's like Main Street.

2107
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,740
And then it just ends.

2108
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:58,620
That it's like kind of this connective tissue

2109
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:01,340
that is a land in and of itself.

2110
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,860
I don't know if it's working.

2111
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:05,860
I'm not sure that I currently feel good about.

2112
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:07,060
Now, granted, this is previews.

2113
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,820
And granted, there were people who were saying,

2114
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,940
oh, you know what, now those trees

2115
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,020
and this and this and this,

2116
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,860
that wasn't here a couple weeks ago.

2117
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,500
So by the, when we get to May,

2118
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,060
things might be really humming here.

2119
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:17,900
It'll be interesting to see.

2120
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:20,740
But I would say that one, Celestial Park, for me,

2121
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:23,740
was the biggest disconnect between how it was built up

2122
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,380
and what was shown and what it actually is.

2123
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,220
I'm sorry.

2124
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,060
I don't wanna be negative.

2125
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,020
All I'll say, well, not all I'll say.

2126
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,780
All I'll kinda say.

2127
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:32,620
All I'll say is 10 things.

2128
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,940
There's a lot of concrete in Celestial Park.

2129
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:35,780
Yeah.

2130
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:39,260
So I don't, we'll see.

2131
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:42,900
I'm very curious to see what happens in two months.

2132
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,580
Because yes, it felt like there weren't really

2133
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,900
any walk-around performers.

2134
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,180
Not as much green as I wanted.

2135
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,020
No.

2136
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,820
And it felt like walking long distances

2137
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,260
on concrete between worlds.

2138
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,420
Where you want, in my mind, I was like,

2139
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,740
we're gonna be on the planet Vulcan,

2140
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,860
like the most beautiful part of Vulcan.

2141
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,300
Philosophers, everyone's in robes,

2142
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,420
people coming up to you.

2143
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:06,860
There's beautiful.

2144
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:10,900
As if you're on some sort of incredible

2145
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,300
creative, philosophical retreat.

2146
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,420
That's what I pictured, yeah.

2147
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:15,780
That you were in a mind-bending place.

2148
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:16,620
Exactly.

2149
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:17,700
But instead it feels a little bit like,

2150
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:21,700
this is a particularly nice mall in Newport Beach.

2151
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,460
Yes, and the architecture for the buildings is amazing.

2152
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,940
Don't get me wrong. And what's in there is amazing.

2153
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,980
And then there's a Mario gift shop outside of Mario,

2154
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:32,340
and that has stained glass and statues.

2155
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:35,260
There is beautiful stuff to see everywhere you go,

2156
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:37,780
and yet there's not a lot making me go,

2157
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,780
Celestial Park is magical.

2158
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,540
It's really the long, big,

2159
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,100
it's just how much pavement there is.

2160
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,940
Yeah.

2161
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:45,780
Open pavement with no shading.

2162
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,620
And it just becomes like,

2163
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,940
I'm annoyed when I'm in Celestial Park,

2164
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:51,220
because it's really far from here to there,

2165
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,540
and I wanna be over there,

2166
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,060
and right now I got nothing to look at.

2167
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,820
There's not even a design on this concrete,

2168
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:56,980
which I thought there was gonna be.

2169
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:00,300
It seems like they have to pack a lot more trees in.

2170
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,140
I think so.

2171
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:04,180
Which might also be like. Grass would be nice too.

2172
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:05,660
New growth tree,

2173
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,620
like I've watched a lot of videos about Lost Island,

2174
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,500
the park in Iowa, I think?

2175
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,940
And that seems like it has some trees,

2176
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,900
but some of the trees are very young saplings.

2177
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:19,740
Okay.

2178
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,860
That will not grow and really bloom.

2179
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:22,700
This is a newish park?

2180
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,540
I don't think I know about this park.

2181
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,180
In the last couple years,

2182
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,740
I think it's the one with the original Sally Dark Ride

2183
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,980
volcano kind of creation.

2184
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,060
Okay, okay.

2185
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,900
This is like,

2186
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,940
if I have complaints,

2187
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,700
it is things along these lines,

2188
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:39,540
and it is like,

2189
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,900
not really knowing what it's like to be

2190
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,580
in a fully brand new theme park.

2191
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,740
You can feel that thing.

2192
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:51,620
I'm sure being in Disneyland in 1955 felt like,

2193
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:52,660
this is it.

2194
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:55,460
There's plots of it that are just kinda nothing.

2195
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,180
I know that these things grow and evolve,

2196
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,700
and that tree growth is a massive thing.

2197
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:06,220
I have no doubts that in 10 years,

2198
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,260
this is gonna be immaculate,

2199
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,660
that all of it is gonna be,

2200
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:12,260
but I think the way that they've been hyping it up,

2201
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:13,300
I was thinking,

2202
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,620
oh my God, are we talking,

2203
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:16,540
is this Disney Sea or something?

2204
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:17,380
Yeah.

2205
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:21,380
And there is something about the grounds and sight lines,

2206
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,980
and again, maybe they're not done.

2207
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,500
I don't really know. Well, they're not done.

2208
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,820
Okay, okay.

2209
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:30,260
But I think that maybe at night,

2210
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:35,300
because we ended our preview at 7 p.m. before stuff.

2211
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,820
I have a feeling maybe at night,

2212
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:40,900
the wow factor of Celestial Park and everything else

2213
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,660
will be there.

2214
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,220
I'm guessing just from the things like

2215
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:48,460
the bioreconstruct pictures you see at night.

2216
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,780
It looks so great from the sky.

2217
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:54,540
But I'm a little disappointed by how it feels

2218
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,500
on the ground.

2219
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,820
I think the vibes,

2220
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:59,820
hopefully, fingers crossed, will be strong at night

2221
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,060
to the point where you go,

2222
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:01,980
wow, this is incredible to see

2223
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,700
all the different lights everywhere,

2224
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:04,820
and the hotel lit up,

2225
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,380
and the different built.

2226
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:11,300
I bet it achieves its mission there.

2227
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,620
It's just that I wonder, yes,

2228
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:17,220
if they can make the magic happen during the day.

2229
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,260
Because it definitely felt like

2230
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,780
a concrete jungle of some kind.

2231
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:22,860
Water features, fountains, stuff like that.

2232
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,020
That wasn't on, really, was it?

2233
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,420
No, I mean, fountains were going.

2234
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,620
But there wasn't a big show, though.

2235
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,140
Those weren't exactly shimmering,

2236
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,980
beautiful, Pandora way of water.

2237
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,220
There's something, it felt a little bit,

2238
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,220
somehow, chinchier than what I thought

2239
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:40,620
from the concept.

2240
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,020
I'm sure everyone knows.

2241
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,100
So I'm so curious to see in two months.

2242
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,940
That is, honestly, kind of what's fun to see.

2243
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,140
We could be so far off base.

2244
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,940
I could be dead wrong, I mean.

2245
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:55,620
And this isn't, I've read in the trades,

2246
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,180
not the trades, the rumor mill,

2247
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:02,540
that they've subbed out entertainment already, as well.

2248
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,380
So there was.

2249
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,220
And I guess, you know what,

2250
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:07,020
I talked to some people who did a preview, as well,

2251
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:11,220
that got to see celestial entertainment that was roaming,

2252
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:13,020
that apparently has been scrapped.

2253
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:13,860
Oh, man.

2254
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:15,820
So I think there are things happening.

2255
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:18,300
This is powering some galaxy's edge territory, uh-oh.

2256
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,420
And I don't know if it's scrapped because of a budget,

2257
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:22,220
or it's just scrapped because, okay, that's not working,

2258
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,700
let's try this.

2259
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,740
Oh, maybe, maybe.

2260
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,780
Yeah, so I don't wanna make it seem like

2261
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,580
I think they've cut the budget, or maybe they have,

2262
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:33,300
I don't know, but like, stuff is changing.

2263
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,220
Yeah, yeah.

2264
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:37,180
I don't wanna be like a,

2265
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:40,220
you know, like they show early cuts of movies,

2266
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:43,540
and I don't wanna be the audience member going,

2267
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,220
there's one part where it's just green behind the guy.

2268
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:47,700
Are you gonna fix that?

2269
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,900
I hope I'm not that.

2270
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:53,260
I hope that I'm not so just ignorant of like,

2271
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,740
yeah, they're gonna fix that.

2272
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:56,580
I don't know.

2273
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,460
But I would say Celestial Park is the area

2274
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:03,460
that made me the most nervous as far as this being like,

2275
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,140
truly next level versus like every nook and cranny

2276
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:08,980
of this place.

2277
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,900
I also think there's something up with,

2278
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,740
and maybe this will slowly get addressed too,

2279
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:16,220
I think that this plot of land

2280
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,300
is not a particularly magical plot of land.

2281
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,020
You know how in theme park concept art,

2282
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,140
it's always like, here's the land,

2283
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:26,540
then it just kinda like casts off into trees and stuff?

2284
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:30,860
And Disney World is like, they're very lucky there.

2285
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,620
That's such ideal land because it does feel like

2286
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:36,940
past space mountain and contemporary,

2287
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:39,060
it just turns into forest, right?

2288
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:41,660
Here, it's extremely clear that it's like,

2289
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,780
then over there is the road.

2290
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:46,500
Over there is like where they deliver shit.

2291
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,620
Like everything around it is not particularly,

2292
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:53,140
you could feel that this was just like industrial land

2293
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,820
seven years ago or whatever.

2294
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,460
And I think that will kind of like go away,

2295
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,420
but it does need some like,

2296
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:02,140
they gotta like plant some trees and cover some shit

2297
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:05,780
because there are parts where you're in the queue

2298
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,100
or on the ride and you do see like loading docks.

2299
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,660
And again, this is not so like,

2300
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,980
we've all been going on test track for decades.

2301
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:16,500
Test track is a ride that takes you through a parking lot.

2302
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,380
It's not like this is specifically a universal problem,

2303
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,660
but like, I don't know,

2304
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,380
there's like a little bit of magicing up,

2305
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:24,740
I think they still gotta do.

2306
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,980
I think that universal fans,

2307
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,260
three of us certainly are universal fans.

2308
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:32,060
I think there's certainly a desire

2309
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,940
from the public at large to want universal

2310
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:38,780
to get a couple shots in on Disney.

2311
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,900
Yeah, we want it to be way better, yeah.

2312
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:43,060
Right, we do desire that.

2313
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:43,900
And I think people,

2314
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,820
because people are a little bit annoyed with Disney

2315
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,780
for many, many reasons over the last so many years

2316
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,220
that I do think you can see it online

2317
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:51,820
where it's like, oh my God, Disney killer.

2318
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:54,740
Some people are a little over-hypey about everything.

2319
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:58,260
We've heard plenty of stuff and that's just,

2320
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:01,420
people's personality tends to wanna do that over-hype.

2321
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:02,980
I am guilty of that sometimes.

2322
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,380
And you're an online person and you wanna go

2323
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:08,540
greatest thing ever or worst thing ever.

2324
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:09,700
As opposed to what we're doing here,

2325
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,900
which is kind of like, I like this,

2326
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:14,100
this is a very gray area kind of discussion.

2327
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:17,300
Yeah, so honestly, somewhat expectations

2328
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,420
have to be tempered in general.

2329
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:24,380
But I do think the first impression

2330
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:28,460
going into a park is very important.

2331
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:33,060
And all, Jason, all joking aside with Islands of Adventure,

2332
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,020
we did a very controversial Port of Entry episode

2333
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:39,500
a year or two ago where I was joshing around a little bit.

2334
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,620
Some people thought that might,

2335
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:43,740
I was maybe being serious that I didn't like Port of Entry.

2336
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:48,660
But Port of Entry is legit music-wise, architecture-wise.

2337
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,500
You do go in there.

2338
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:50,500
You're a character pretty immediately.

2339
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,100
There's a lot of character, you see the whole,

2340
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:56,220
why can't I think of the name of it?

2341
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,260
Ferris Lighthouse?

2342
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,100
The Ferris Lighthouse.

2343
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:58,940
You can't think of the name of it

2344
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,900
because none of us knew the name of it three years ago.

2345
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,740
That's maybe why.

2346
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,780
But the lighthouse, I should've said the lighthouse.

2347
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,300
Recreation, one of the modern,

2348
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,700
the wonders of the ancient world.

2349
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,660
Well, of course, now I remember everything about it.

2350
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,940
As opposed to the modern world

2351
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:13,500
where we have like the Bass Pro Shop pyramid.

2352
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,540
Right, but that's one of the wonders of the world

2353
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:17,540
as far as I'm concerned.

2354
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,380
Sure.

2355
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,220
Dream destination.

2356
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,660
When you talk about Tokyo Disney Sea,

2357
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,980
you walk in Tokyo Disney Sea,

2358
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,740
you go, holy fuck, I've never been in a place like this

2359
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:26,580
before. Yes, yeah.

2360
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:28,180
Which, and we're holding it to the best of the best.

2361
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:29,020
And that's an insane standard.

2362
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:31,300
But also, let's go back to Island's Adventure, too.

2363
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,620
Yes, it's Port of Entry and all that,

2364
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,620
but then it delivers you to this grand lagoon.

2365
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,660
Which, even though it is nothing, right?

2366
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:41,380
It is water, there's not a bunch of,

2367
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:43,180
they did go in a different direction

2368
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,940
by not making it a big body of water,

2369
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,500
which is a great way to fill a bunch of land

2370
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,020
and make it feel very lived in.

2371
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:51,300
So it is kind of like risky and different,

2372
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,940
what they've done, that it's more like,

2373
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,660
there is some water that it ebbs and flows,

2374
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:56,740
and then there's a lot of just open space.

2375
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,580
Yeah.

2376
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:00,980
But it, yeah, I don't know that it's a holy shit,

2377
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:03,420
and you know, I'm so sorry to say this,

2378
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,380
with all appall-

2379
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:07,340
this is not one of these spicy takes that I revel in.

2380
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,980
I am not proud as I say this.

2381
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:12,100
I don't know about that Kronos.

2382
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,300
I don't think that Kronos is like,

2383
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,740
it doesn't top Ferris Lighthouse, I'll tell you that.

2384
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,580
Yeah, I think you're more-

2385
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:18,420
Not by a long shot.

2386
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:20,220
I think you're more down on the Kronos than I am.

2387
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:23,660
I'm not saying it beats the lighthouse.

2388
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,420
I'm not saying it beats it.

2389
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:28,860
It wasn't running, it wasn't really running.

2390
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:29,700
That hurts it.

2391
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,180
And from a distance, we saw some night effects

2392
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:33,540
after we were on the way.

2393
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:37,540
I'm reserving my Kronos judgment for opening day.

2394
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:38,380
I'm gonna wait-

2395
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,700
For the two hour Kronos episode.

2396
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,620
Yes, we're gonna do a lot of Kronos,

2397
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:45,220
maybe one episode per Kronos.

2398
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,860
Per medallion.

2399
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,620
Per different, yeah.

2400
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,020
Are you talking about per portal or per,

2401
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:52,940
there's only one Kronos.

2402
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:53,780
No, I guess you're right, yeah,

2403
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:54,620
there's only one Kronos.

2404
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:55,700
But you're talking about each portal

2405
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:58,780
with its own Kronos-like structure on top.

2406
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,900
We could do an episode about multiple Kronoses

2407
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,740
because they are taking, and if you don't know,

2408
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,380
this is like the entrance of the park,

2409
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:09,500
we should say, the tower that you walk through,

2410
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,700
the very first portal that you enter for the day.

2411
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,340
They're doing a tour of a Kronos replica.

2412
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,180
That's fun.

2413
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:17,020
It's going city to city.

2414
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,220
We're taking it on the road.

2415
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,980
Yeah, yeah, I forget where.

2416
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:22,100
It's not LA, but you can go to Chicago

2417
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,140
and a couple other cities

2418
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,340
and see a slightly smaller Kronos.

2419
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:26,820
That is fun.

2420
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:29,220
So, I hear what you're saying

2421
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,860
and I don't disagree with the instinct,

2422
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:34,420
but I wanna wait a second before I make my ruling.

2423
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,140
I mean, I like getting our thoughts out in this way

2424
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:37,700
because, and not in a negative way,

2425
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,900
because I am interested to see what they do in two months.

2426
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,340
I do find that fascinating.

2427
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:44,220
I want people to say Scott was a fool.

2428
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,500
A creative decision.

2429
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,020
He judged early.

2430
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,940
He didn't understand that the sound wasn't mixed yet

2431
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:53,020
and they hadn't finished the color correct.

2432
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:56,180
And that's why he was judging the, I hope that's the case.

2433
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,020
It's possible that will happen.

2434
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:03,020
So yeah, I do wonder how it will shake out

2435
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,260
by opening day and then a year from now,

2436
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:07,540
because yeah, I want,

2437
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,700
I did have my expectations high for getting in there

2438
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:13,860
and seeing Helios Grand and seeing everything

2439
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:16,620
and wanting to feel like that land,

2440
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,620
because I think you've been saying,

2441
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:20,980
oh, that land is maybe my most desired location.

2442
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:21,820
That's the one I wanna go to the most.

2443
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:24,660
Well, I think it's the Monster's Ride in Celestial Park

2444
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:28,140
were high on my list and then everything else

2445
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:28,980
is kind of great,

2446
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:32,140
because I don't know how much I'll be able to get done

2447
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,540
when it's officially open.

2448
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:37,580
So, there's something needs, something that's needed there.

2449
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:38,500
Maybe they're doing it.

2450
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,340
I hope they're doing it.

2451
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,580
Maybe they'll do it.

2452
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:41,420
I'll say this.

2453
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:43,940
We were talking about sight lines

2454
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:46,580
and the area in which the park was built.

2455
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:49,180
I do, and maybe internally they've thought of this

2456
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:51,140
and there's just, they can't do it,

2457
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:56,140
but the number one thing I think Universal needs to do

2458
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:59,860
is fight against the Disney bubble

2459
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:04,860
and the Disney culture of hotels and things to do.

2460
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:09,660
I kind of think that's the magic sauce to Disney World,

2461
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:11,420
because we always have these arguments with people.

2462
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,660
Disney World's better.

2463
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:15,100
Obviously these are people that don't go as often as we do,

2464
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,100
but what they're talking about

2465
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:21,860
is the trees covering the hotels, the sight lines.

2466
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,900
They're talking about that.

2467
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,700
They're talking about the multiple hotels.

2468
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,460
Whether they're saying it or not,

2469
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,660
their memory of Disney World is based on the Disney bubble.

2470
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:33,860
You're fully immersed and especially if you went as a kid

2471
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,660
when it was vastly more affordable to stay at

2472
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:39,620
Grand Floridian or Polynesian or Contemporary,

2473
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:43,860
that if you're, like, you know,

2474
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:46,020
because we can talk all day.

2475
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,180
Stella Nova's interesting, it's like a building.

2476
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:50,820
You know, that's how Disney builds things now, too.

2477
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:55,100
But not to say it's a pretty decent building,

2478
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:58,860
but if you went to Disney World as a kid, as we did,

2479
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,140
and you enter a magical world for the day

2480
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,420
and then you go back to the hotel

2481
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,460
and the hotel is also a magical world.

2482
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,180
I'm in an island paradise.

2483
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:09,080
I'm in a sleek structure of the future.

2484
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:13,200
I'm in this, like, Victorian grand, you know,

2485
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,520
like, high status place.

2486
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,360
Yeah.

2487
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,880
I'm in the wilderness lodge.

2488
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,720
I'm in nature.

2489
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,080
I'm, like, that it doesn't end when you go back to your room

2490
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,920
and then for adults and for parents that, like,

2491
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,020
oh, and then there's, like, actually good restaurants

2492
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:29,640
and there's good drinks and, like, this stuff.

2493
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:34,040
Because you're right that Universal has some of that,

2494
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,820
but what it has a lot of is, like,

2495
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:38,160
and then technically we do have a little bar

2496
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,520
and it's, like, very bright and not a lot to look at.

2497
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,360
Right.

2498
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,520
And there's kind of, like, a cafeteria there.

2499
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,320
Well, one of the criticisms of Universal Hotels I've heard

2500
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,400
is, like, it's a Lowe's Hotel.

2501
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,400
It's just endless hallways.

2502
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,800
It just keeps wrapping and wrapping.

2503
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, certainly.

2504
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:58,400
And, yes, so.

2505
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,740
Disney has always had magic to the grounds

2506
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:05,700
and some of that is that Walt bought, however many make,

2507
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,520
he bought, you know, bigger than Manhattan

2508
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,080
and so it just is, like, some of that is just what they got

2509
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,880
and a lot of it's literally undeveloped.

2510
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,400
And, but, whereas Universal has piecemealed it

2511
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,920
from these odd, all right, let's buy this from Lockheed,

2512
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,660
okay, we can buy a hotel over here

2513
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:24,040
and you can take a bus and, like, they've had to do it

2514
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,600
in this piecemeal janky way and they've done a great job.

2515
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,000
Everything they've made is great.

2516
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,680
But, yeah, there's not, you could, I think, say,

2517
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,400
with a fairly straight face, you know,

2518
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,360
I just chase that Disney magic

2519
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,720
and I don't think anybody says,

2520
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,240
I just chase that Universal magic.

2521
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:43,560
Yes, and what, again, somebody might tell me

2522
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,560
that it's impossible to do what you're saying.

2523
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,680
Just the size they have, the land they bought for cheap,

2524
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:52,200
the trees that were already there,

2525
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,200
because that's, it's just impossible.

2526
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,560
But that's actually the thing that would flip,

2527
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:02,480
I mean, obviously, prices could flip people's vacation habits.

2528
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,960
But that's the thing if people started feeling

2529
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,160
like they were going into the little magical world

2530
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,760
of Universal, whatever version of bubble

2531
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,640
they could construct, that is the thing that I think.

2532
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,320
And they have it a little.

2533
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,160
They have it a little.

2534
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,340
Yeah, like, as we've, we talked so highly

2535
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:20,440
about those boats and getting, what we,

2536
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,220
for as much as there were, there were problems

2537
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:25,880
with forcing ourselves to live at City Walk, essentially,

2538
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:26,880
for a little bit. Yeah.

2539
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,640
The part that was good was like, wow,

2540
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,920
this system of canals and getting on the boat

2541
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,920
and getting a little ride at the beginning

2542
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,600
and the end of the day. Yeah.

2543
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,280
And some of those hotels have magic.

2544
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,400
I think when they made that switch from

2545
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,200
Universal Studios is a parking lot

2546
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,160
and you walk up to it and that's your day,

2547
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,760
to it's this world of waterways

2548
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,240
and there's a zillion things to do.

2549
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,040
They got some of the way there,

2550
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,920
but it's the challenge of we built a park down the road

2551
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,680
is like, well, how do you make a bubble

2552
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,400
when you gotta go out on a real road?

2553
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,400
I know. It's enough.

2554
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,560
Yeah, I mean, the first thing you're describing

2555
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,680
is it requires a huge capital investment.

2556
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,520
Oh, yeah.

2557
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,760
But it also, to some extent, there's design priorities

2558
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,240
because Island's Adventure felt pretty lived in

2559
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,560
even the first two years.

2560
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,400
Certainly, yeah.

2561
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,880
And I think they did hide the real,

2562
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:18,800
there is a high school right behind Island's Adventure.

2563
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:19,640
Right, right.

2564
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,200
But you might not know that, you know?

2565
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:22,160
Yeah, there's something, I don't know,

2566
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,920
it feels like there's more of a burn moon

2567
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,960
if there is a little. That got hit better,

2568
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,520
but then like- Yeah, but now there's I-4

2569
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,320
if you're building down the road.

2570
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,680
And Volcano Bay, if you're waiting in line up the stairs

2571
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:37,280
on one of the water slides, there's just houses,

2572
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,120
you could see, you're just like,

2573
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,960
oh, mother of a road and houses.

2574
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:43,240
I'm in my bathing suit on an elevated platform

2575
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,400
looking into somebody's house.

2576
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,960
So- Yeah, kind of close to what like Knott's Berry Farm

2577
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,480
kind of uses their advantage of being like,

2578
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,080
oh, it's a neighborhood theme park.

2579
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,480
Right, so again, they're gonna,

2580
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,640
I'm sure someone will tell me it's impossible

2581
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,200
to do more of what I'm saying, and I get that,

2582
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,520
but it does feel like, oh, Stellaluna,

2583
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,280
or whatever the hell the name of it is, Stellanova.

2584
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,440
You know, you peek your head and you're like,

2585
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,040
there should be like one cool, unique thing in this hotel,

2586
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,560
whether it's the bar or something that you could go into,

2587
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,000
and you wanna go and look at the hotels of Universal.

2588
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,720
You wanna, and maybe this is a 10-year plan

2589
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,440
that there's gonna be a walkway from these hotels to Epic,

2590
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:24,600
and Epic will start its own little location

2591
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:28,680
that has maybe a city, I don't know how much they own there.

2592
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,320
What if they, also if they, you know,

2593
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:34,120
some of that, not an insignificant amount

2594
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:36,800
of that Disney World magic is monorail,

2595
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,360
and now Skyliner, and that the ways you get around

2596
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,440
are magical, too.

2597
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,280
Yes, right.

2598
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,120
If Universal could figure out something

2599
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,280
that isn't just buses, it would be, I don't know,

2600
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:52,440
like if they're little magical potter carriages

2601
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:55,120
that can take you from, or that's part of it.

2602
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:57,680
It's not crucial, and this is really,

2603
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:00,200
we really are like, we went to a brand new theme park,

2604
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,040
but we think also that the buses should be neat, too.

2605
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:07,680
I don't mean to be like a little complainy toddler,

2606
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,280
but I think, you know, I think we are,

2607
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:12,320
what we want is Disney World's magical and immersive,

2608
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:13,400
Universal's magical and immersive,

2609
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,160
like both have it all, and they all,

2610
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,080
it's all perfect, and they all fight,

2611
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,880
and they make each other better.

2612
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,680
Yeah, I think in Florida, the main requirements are

2613
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,800
the buses are reliable and cold.

2614
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,200
So that's bare minimum.

2615
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,840
As long as they do that, you're honest.

2616
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:33,040
I wanna get to stuff we haven't touched on yet.

2617
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,200
Isle of Berk.

2618
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,040
Oh yeah.

2619
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:35,880
You guys saw it already.

2620
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,720
Isle of Berk.

2621
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,040
Loved, Isle of Berk.

2622
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,880
I think Isle of Berk is maybe the best land.

2623
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,560
I think it's maybe the winner.

2624
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:44,560
There's, I think, yeah, there's something about the like,

2625
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,080
the lower expectations of like,

2626
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,120
what's this, how to train your dragon, why,

2627
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,680
who likes that, well, obviously lots of kids like it,

2628
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:54,840
and it's gonna blow up even bigger than it already is

2629
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,760
with the live action coming out, and like,

2630
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,840
but it really, you know, with this thing that we've hit

2631
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,000
over and over through the years of,

2632
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
we don't care what the IP is,

2633
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,800
as long as it's rendered wonderfully and magically.

2634
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,200
I don't know anything about this franchise,

2635
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:12,520
and I thought it was so great and charming.

2636
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,920
And you don't need to, it almost reads to me

2637
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,800
as just an original theme park world.

2638
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:22,080
It just, like, Vikings plus dragons, wonderful, cool.

2639
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:26,920
I think with Nintendo, you have, and especially Donkey Kong,

2640
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,160
you've got a very, like, that's the fantasy land,

2641
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,320
or that's the Toon Lagoon, and I think it's like,

2642
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:36,160
that's like the kid place, bright, colorful poppy.

2643
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,920
This is kind of the, this is like,

2644
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,600
I think the really successful family land,

2645
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,240
where everything is stuff that you can do together.

2646
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,240
Just aesthetically, without even getting on anything,

2647
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:50,000
I think, all this, just the placemaking's really neat.

2648
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,080
And there's a lot going on, too,

2649
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,800
because there's a lot of meet and greets with the dragons.

2650
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,800
I saw the Boston Dynamics, like, robot dog

2651
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:05,120
dressed up as a dragon, walking autonomously.

2652
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:05,960
What? I didn't see that.

2653
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:08,240
Yeah, so there was just a dragon walking around,

2654
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:12,080
but it was the, like, Boston Dynamics dog, basically,

2655
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,760
that robot dog that they used for Dr. Toothsome.

2656
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,760
Toothsome's dog.

2657
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:16,600
What was his name?

2658
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,440
Widget?

2659
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,960
No, it was...

2660
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:19,960
Coco?

2661
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:20,800
What was it?

2662
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,840
Was it Coco or Truffle, or?

2663
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:23,680
Let's call him Truffle.

2664
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,640
I feel like it was a chocolate-based one.

2665
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,480
Maybe it was Truffle.

2666
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,680
Bon Bon?

2667
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:29,000
Bon Bon, let's call him all of them.

2668
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,640
2020, I don't particularly remember

2669
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:33,800
limited run theme park attractions.

2670
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:36,400
It's Bon Bon, but it's the O's or zeroes.

2671
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,600
That's how you make it a robot.

2672
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,440
Well, that's good.

2673
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,280
I was gonna call him Dollar,

2674
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,520
but I think that's Richie Rich's dog.

2675
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,360
I think Dollar is Richie Rich's dog.

2676
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:45,720
I'm gonna go ahead and say that's Richie Rich's dog.

2677
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,000
I got Richie Rich on the brain, I don't know.

2678
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,560
Well, I was gonna say, I don't know what's going on.

2679
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,640
I know what's going on, it's my brain.

2680
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,840
I got Richie Rich on the brain.

2681
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:56,000
Finally firing up that live-action Netflix series

2682
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,440
12 years later.

2683
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:01,560
With the weird 12-year-old maid robot one?

2684
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,400
That's weird, it's a weird show.

2685
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,280
I've watched one episode, but not classic Richie Rich.

2686
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,600
That's good and pure.

2687
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,520
The comic strip, cartoon, you know.

2688
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,840
Yeah, the Harvey, yeah.

2689
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:13,680
The Harvey comic book.

2690
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:14,800
We're all thinking about it.

2691
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,040
They should build Richie Rich world at Epic Universe.

2692
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,640
All right, all right, calm down.

2693
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,440
At the very least, the Harvey comics portal.

2694
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:23,640
I wanna see their laser carved Mount Rushmore

2695
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:24,480
of the family spades.

2696
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,720
That would be awesome, that would be great.

2697
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,040
John Larrick Kow attacks the monkey.

2698
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:27,880
Casper Lee.

2699
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,280
So, Isla Burke from Marks too.

2700
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,760
Yes, and there's a meet and greet.

2701
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,960
It might be with Toothless.

2702
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,760
I know one of the dragons that's the big dragon

2703
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:38,600
is Toothless, the dragon.

2704
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,640
Toothless is the black one that's like that.

2705
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:41,840
I know him from posters.

2706
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:42,680
Right.

2707
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,400
I know him from, there is a meet and greet,

2708
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,760
and I'm watching it.

2709
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,360
Again, I've never seen these movies,

2710
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,240
and I will, these movies I will probably see.

2711
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,560
Sooner rather than later.

2712
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,600
There's a meet and greet with Toothless,

2713
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,600
and there's like a handler, and they play like nice,

2714
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:02,520
I don't know, sad music.

2715
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,960
I don't know, like sentimental music

2716
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,280
while the kids are going up to meet the dragon.

2717
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:12,160
I tear up so hard, so quickly.

2718
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,200
It wasn't even like I'm sitting and watching

2719
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,800
multiple kids go through.

2720
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,600
Literally, I walk by, I see a kid meeting a dragon.

2721
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,440
I don't know if it's because the dads left their kids

2722
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,480
behind on this trip, and that's part of it.

2723
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,960
I'm sure it is on some level,

2724
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,440
but immediately I tear up seeing kids hearing this music

2725
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,080
with Toothless with these characters

2726
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,120
I have no connection with whatsoever.

2727
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:33,880
So I go, well, I guess this works.

2728
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,240
I guess this is doing well.

2729
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,520
I had a similar reaction.

2730
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,840
You sent me that longer Superman trailer

2731
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,120
that I'm assuming is from like CinemaCon.

2732
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:41,960
Yes.

2733
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,780
It came out.

2734
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:44,080
With crypto, yes, which I showed my daughter.

2735
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,760
Crypto's jumping on him like a real dog.

2736
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,280
Like I was freaking out.

2737
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,600
You know what, I'll say this about that.

2738
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,120
They showed the five-minute scene from Superman.

2739
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:52,200
They showed the trailer, and I was like,

2740
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,280
ah, is this gonna work?

2741
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,360
And I see that they did the longer one

2742
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,160
where crypto's like beating the shit out of,

2743
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,000
already beaten to shit Superman.

2744
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,480
Because he's excited to see him.

2745
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:02,480
And I was like, well, this is kind of good, I guess.

2746
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,720
I guess I kind of like this.

2747
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,640
Okay, huh, Superman hope.

2748
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,960
So yeah, so I was like, oh man,

2749
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:09,480
these meet and greets are gonna be awesome

2750
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,320
for kids and for parents watching them.

2751
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,240
You know, I wasn't paying a lot of attention to like the,

2752
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:18,360
I don't even know if it was all open.

2753
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,080
There's like a kid run around area in there,

2754
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,280
kind of like a rope and climb zone.

2755
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,120
Oh yeah, yeah.

2756
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:25,880
And then I actually don't know if they were running

2757
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,560
like the boats that you like fire.

2758
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:28,380
They weren't.

2759
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,220
They weren't.

2760
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,060
Okay, okay.

2761
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:30,880
And that looks awesome too.

2762
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,720
But yeah, they weren't running.

2763
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,600
And it felt like full of life without even those goings.

2764
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,800
So I can, I just, I feel like this is just like,

2765
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,560
families will really post up here for a long time.

2766
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,800
I bet the weights are gonna be bad

2767
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,560
because it's gonna be very popular around here.

2768
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,400
Yeah, yes.

2769
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,160
We popped into the, like their quick service

2770
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,240
and that was like a little like mead hole.

2771
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,680
Obviously they don't, maybe they serve.

2772
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:49,520
I didn't go in there.

2773
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,160
I would have liked to, it looks cool in the concept.

2774
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,480
The show wasn't running also,

2775
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:53,920
which I've heard very good things about.

2776
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,440
There's also a show in that land.

2777
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:56,280
Which is also, it's in Beijing.

2778
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,200
It's in Beijing, okay.

2779
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,080
Yes, so you can see it online too,

2780
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:00,760
but like, and probably everything's online

2781
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,440
by the time we put this out, but.

2782
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:06,760
The main coaster there, Hiccups Wing gliders,

2783
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,400
which does not stay in my brain,

2784
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,200
me not knowing these movies at all.

2785
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,440
I really was like, is Hiccup a dragon?

2786
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,280
Main guy.

2787
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,120
No, Hiccup is main guy.

2788
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:14,960
Hiccup is.

2789
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:15,800
What's his name?

2790
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,640
Jay.

2791
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:17,480
I'm so ignorant of this thing, Jay Berischel.

2792
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,320
Yeah.

2793
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,720
Yeah, Hiccup, I'm Hiccup, it's Hiccup.

2794
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:25,720
But I, this I think, I think we all had this reaction

2795
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,480
because you only see bits and pieces of it

2796
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,600
as you're in the line and as you're in the land.

2797
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:33,640
And you're thinking, okay, family coaster,

2798
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,760
Goofy's Barnstormer, sounds good.

2799
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:38,320
Well, I'm here, I'll do it.

2800
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,440
I don't think I realized this is like,

2801
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:44,280
as somebody in our group described it, like Hagrid's Jr.

2802
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:45,320
Yes, absolutely.

2803
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:47,360
It's so fun.

2804
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,360
This is a little sneaker-upper.

2805
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,200
Yeah, it is.

2806
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,640
It's not, you know, obviously like, it's a coaster

2807
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,520
with multiple launches that they meant to be cool

2808
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,640
and high-tech and fun.

2809
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,080
But I was not prepared for,

2810
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,640
and I'll sort of leave it a little spoiler-free, I guess,

2811
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:03,000
and maybe I already did too many, sorry.

2812
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,400
Just like, hey, don't sleep on Hiccup's Wing glider.

2813
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:07,400
I don't know.

2814
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:11,680
That is a good ride and a good like kind of trainer ride,

2815
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:14,080
you know, maybe for me to take my children on

2816
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,240
so that they end up launch queens and not no launch queens.

2817
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,280
I was happy.

2818
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,960
I was like, oh, good, maybe I take my wife on this

2819
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,920
because after Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind,

2820
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,800
I'm like, all of these new rides,

2821
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,920
she's gonna get off and run to a trash can and puke.

2822
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,200
Well, Werewolf, maybe.

2823
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,760
Werewolf, maybe, okay.

2824
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,600
Although it's short.

2825
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:35,420
It's short, yeah.

2826
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,260
Maybe, okay.

2827
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:37,100
Okay.

2828
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:38,940
Yeah, I think this would be totally fine.

2829
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:39,780
This would be fine.

2830
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:42,700
The fun fake-outs, show scenes,

2831
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:44,380
things you don't expect it to do.

2832
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:49,380
It's, yeah, no, just caught me off guard.

2833
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:51,260
High on my list, very high on my list.

2834
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:54,060
I agree, and what's fun about it too is that

2835
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:59,900
they use the actual land itself as the show scenes

2836
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,740
in most of it.

2837
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:01,580
Oh, great.

2838
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:03,420
There's some stuff that's hidden that happens

2839
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,740
that you can't see from the line or from the land,

2840
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:10,740
but it's like using, it's like as if the fantasy land

2841
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,300
had a ride that used fantasy land,

2842
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:17,540
the backdrop and the castle for the show scenes.

2843
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:18,380
Yes, yeah.

2844
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,460
Which I think is cool.

2845
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:24,460
And it's kind of a similar effect in Donkey Kong Country.

2846
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:25,660
Yeah, to some degree.

2847
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:28,380
And a little bit Curse of the Werewolf as well.

2848
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:30,260
You kind of explore the grounds a little bit.

2849
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:31,100
A little bit.

2850
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,300
And you might think, well, it's a ride

2851
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:34,300
that just takes me through all the other stuff in the land.

2852
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,340
That seems repetitive.

2853
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:38,260
But actually, no, it gives you new perspectives.

2854
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:39,100
It's economical.

2855
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:42,460
You get to see things in cool, new ways.

2856
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:45,460
But I think having not gotten on the e-tickets,

2857
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,940
my big headline, and when people have been asking me,

2858
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:50,340
I just keep saying it's like trilogy

2859
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:53,060
of not that intense family coasters

2860
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,380
that are all pretty remarkable.

2861
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:55,220
I think those three.

2862
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:56,060
Yeah.

2863
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:56,900
That's great.

2864
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,780
Yeah, Werewolf Kong and this.

2865
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:03,260
I think that's a design trend I am very fond of

2866
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:07,340
is like augmented reality or gamification.

2867
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:10,860
It's like, I don't know if those have the,

2868
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:13,220
can stack up.

2869
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,060
Yeah.

2870
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:19,060
Like using the landscape to see a different perspective.

2871
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,020
Yeah.

2872
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:20,840
It's pretty cool.

2873
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,740
Yeah, no, cool and clever.

2874
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:26,580
And also just like being on some like smooth new coasters

2875
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,620
feels really great,

2876
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:30,460
which maybe loops us around to Stardust Racers.

2877
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:31,820
Stardust Racers.

2878
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:34,740
Because I'll cop to it.

2879
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:35,580
I chickened out.

2880
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:36,420
I didn't do it.

2881
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,820
It was the first thing everybody went to Ridewise.

2882
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,740
I just, I think when I learned

2883
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:45,300
that it didn't have a harness mommy,

2884
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:47,020
that there wasn't a thing that I could hold.

2885
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,260
This has become my,

2886
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,660
I will go on things as long as I can grip that.

2887
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:51,500
I can grip that.

2888
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:54,340
I can give a big pillow a big hug.

2889
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:55,980
But I, yeah, I don't know.

2890
01:49:55,980 --> 01:49:57,340
There's things on the sides maybe,

2891
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:59,300
but that would have been uncomfortable to grip.

2892
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,140
Yeah.

2893
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,900
The crotch restraint.

2894
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,660
Oh yeah, how'd your crotch do?

2895
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:05,140
It was mildly crushed.

2896
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:05,980
Mild.

2897
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:07,820
See, I find that comforting.

2898
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:10,820
Like on hot sauce ratings.

2899
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:13,380
From mild, medium and hot crushing.

2900
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:15,180
Yeah, give us the Scovilles.

2901
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:17,980
Mild crushing.

2902
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:19,260
It was not as bad.

2903
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:20,820
I mean, the worst crushing was

2904
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:23,260
Twisted Colossus at Six Flags,

2905
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:25,060
but that was a purely lap restraints.

2906
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:26,180
First time I've ever done it.

2907
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:28,540
I am so interested to do Twisted Colossus again now

2908
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,900
because I've done Velocicoaster's only lap,

2909
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:31,900
Stardust's only lap.

2910
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,940
So I wonder if-

2911
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:34,180
You're liking it, you're into it.

2912
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:36,660
Yes, I wonder if now I go on Twisted Colossus

2913
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,180
and I'm a pro at these,

2914
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:39,940
and that first time on Twisted Colossus

2915
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:41,420
freaked me out badly

2916
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:44,140
because I just wasn't familiar with that type of coaster.

2917
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:44,980
You should do it.

2918
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:46,980
I've seen it suggested as a second gate.

2919
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:48,900
I think there's probably a lot to the history

2920
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:52,140
and when it was just Colossus and the Twisted Colossus,

2921
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:53,780
step-by-step opening, obviously.

2922
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,460
That's the one, right?

2923
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:57,460
Oh, so yeah. It is, yeah.

2924
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,100
But you know what?

2925
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,420
It'll be the best episode it can be

2926
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:03,180
if you go on and brave a crushing again.

2927
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:04,460
I'll brave the crushing.

2928
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,940
I think you should go on Velocicoaster

2929
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:11,740
before you go on Stardust.

2930
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:13,060
Wow.

2931
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:16,620
Just because, there were definitely more moments

2932
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:18,300
on Stardust where I went, ah!

2933
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:21,580
In a way that just made me go, ah!

2934
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:24,380
Like, I swear with Velocicoaster,

2935
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:25,340
and I didn't do it this time,

2936
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:26,900
but Velocicoaster, literally,

2937
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,700
I was just euphoric the whole time,

2938
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:30,140
even though it's insane.

2939
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:31,500
It's so intense, but.

2940
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,060
And that might override it for me.

2941
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:34,780
Maybe. I mean, you're still not gonna like it,

2942
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:37,980
but I think it will be more of a pure.

2943
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:38,980
I got a wall still.

2944
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,820
I mean, we're gonna see.

2945
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:41,380
There's gonna be a lot of pressure coming.

2946
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:44,300
Fast and Furious Coaster literally opening

2947
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,140
within this next year. I'm really, well,

2948
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:46,220
James out on that, right?

2949
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:47,060
I mean, there's no way.

2950
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,740
I don't think you're tripping on that.

2951
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:49,940
I don't know what I've been on.

2952
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,780
I'm scared of that thing.

2953
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:52,740
That's gonna be Velocicoaster that flips around.

2954
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:54,620
Like, that's gonna be intense,

2955
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:57,300
but it's gonna be staring at you every day

2956
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:59,340
you're driving around the San Fernando Valley.

2957
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:00,180
Yeah, I know.

2958
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,580
I'll be thinking about it all the time,

2959
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,460
but I'm on Guardians going like,

2960
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,940
I think I'm like one wrong look away

2961
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:08,220
from this being too much.

2962
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,780
Like, I'm thinking about it.

2963
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,060
I'm on it, and I'm like, this is a performance.

2964
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:13,780
And if you make one false move,

2965
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:15,620
it's like I'm doing a figure skating routine,

2966
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:18,260
and the tiniest thing could just unravel every,

2967
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:19,500
one bad landing.

2968
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:23,420
Yeah, I mean, Guardians, they had trash cans everywhere,

2969
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:25,500
and they were so fast with hand towels and waters.

2970
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,900
Puking is a different.

2971
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,340
They do this a lot, yeah.

2972
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:32,380
Again, I feel 5% sick after Guardians,

2973
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:37,260
but I don't feel queasy on Starduster Velocicoaster.

2974
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:39,060
It's not like that for me.

2975
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:41,140
It's literally my motion sense.

2976
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:43,580
So there's a possibility that if Fast has the,

2977
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:46,660
Fast and Furious coaster has the flipping cars

2978
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:47,500
that I feel ill on it.

2979
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:50,380
Maybe the difference between real landscape

2980
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:54,860
and filmic landscapes, or like special effects landscapes.

2981
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:57,220
A possible, I think it's literally just the same

2982
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:59,820
kind of principle where you're having a 3D movie

2983
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:04,380
and your body doesn't quite know where it's going.

2984
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:05,740
It's like when you get sick in a car

2985
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:08,980
when you're looking at your phone and you're not driving.

2986
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:10,140
I shouldn't be driving looking at your phone,

2987
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,020
but you know what I'm saying?

2988
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:13,980
It's because your body is experiencing movement

2989
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:16,940
that your eyes aren't experiencing.

2990
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:19,060
Like, it's the disconnect between the two.

2991
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:21,420
This is the dumbest way I'm sure to explain this phenomenon,

2992
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:25,820
but it's like because Guardians flips you around,

2993
01:53:25,820 --> 01:53:28,900
your body doesn't quite know where to look.

2994
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:32,780
There's different things, big asteroid or big planet,

2995
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:34,940
but your body twists in a different way

2996
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:37,260
and you're moving and it's not lining up

2997
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:39,100
with your vision and your body.

2998
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:41,780
That's the dumbest way I possibly can explain this.

2999
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:43,700
It's not one fluid experience.

3000
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:45,940
Anything's mismatched and not dialed correctly.

3001
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:48,740
Exactly, you have to be dialed in with your vision,

3002
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:50,260
it has to know where you're headed

3003
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:52,060
and your body has to feel that way.

3004
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:53,380
And I think when it gets off,

3005
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:56,020
apparently body wars initially made people sick

3006
01:53:56,020 --> 01:54:00,220
because it didn't have a point to look at.

3007
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:02,460
You want to, I guess in a 3D movie like that,

3008
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,340
to have something that the audience has their eye trained on

3009
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:07,380
so everybody's looking at a specific place

3010
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:10,460
so your stomach doesn't get messed up.

3011
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:11,900
That's why I'm nervous about Fast and Furious

3012
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:13,740
because I'm like, the whole city,

3013
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:15,860
you have the entire city to look at?

3014
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:18,020
You got this whole San Fernando Valley?

3015
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:20,980
Yes, and it may be, I could potentially

3016
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:22,300
get sick on it in that way.

3017
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:24,900
So I'm just saying there's a lot of pressure

3018
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,820
and there's gonna be new coasters

3019
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:28,820
replacing rip ride rockets.

3020
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,140
I mean, one of these days,

3021
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,980
you may have to do one of these is what I'm saying.

3022
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:35,140
One of these days you may have to graduate yet again.

3023
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:38,660
Yeah, no, I know there's another level for sure.

3024
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,500
There's another level.

3025
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,980
It would be good, it would allow me

3026
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:43,020
to experience cool need rides.

3027
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:47,740
Yes, and so I would still say Velocicoaster,

3028
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:50,740
I think you should do because it's just so much smoother.

3029
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:53,300
Stardust Racers is really fun.

3030
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:56,060
I have heard that they're still adjusting,

3031
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:58,500
they're figuring speed out apparently on it,

3032
01:54:58,500 --> 01:54:59,980
which is also something you never really think about

3033
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:01,700
because in my mind these days,

3034
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:05,620
you would plug in new roller coaster on a computer.

3035
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:08,260
It would tell you exactly the speed to go.

3036
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:10,360
It would tell you like, all that stuff in my mind

3037
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:11,940
should be just like worked out and they know it,

3038
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:14,100
but I guess it makes sense that they're like,

3039
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:15,620
they run it with some people and people go,

3040
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:17,660
ah, that was a little, that hurt.

3041
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:19,420
I don't know this firsthand, I'm just saying.

3042
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:20,780
Wow, still dialing it in.

3043
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:23,140
So there's still, and this is not uncommon.

3044
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:24,580
I think every coaster goes through this,

3045
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:27,660
I don't think Velocicoaster landed perfectly.

3046
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:32,100
Well that one especially has a couple crisscross moments.

3047
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:32,940
Stardust, you're talking about?

3048
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:35,740
Yeah, that they probably need to time out.

3049
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:36,700
Yes, they have to time that,

3050
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:38,620
but I think more of the speed adjustment

3051
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:42,180
is just because some people felt like it was too rough

3052
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:44,020
maybe when it was faster.

3053
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,780
Oh, interesting.

3054
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:47,620
Because I would say my experience

3055
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:49,500
going on whatever this speed,

3056
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:50,800
I don't know the specific speed,

3057
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:55,800
but my experience on it was you definitely round

3058
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,620
whatever a top hat type situation,

3059
01:55:57,620 --> 01:56:00,180
which is that big curve that Velocicoaster has.

3060
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:03,380
You definitely round a top hat thing like that,

3061
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:05,820
and there's definitely a moment where you go boom.

3062
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:07,940
It feels very much like you're kind of banging

3063
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:10,020
into your restraint a little bit.

3064
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:13,280
So it's not, Velocicoaster for some reason

3065
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,140
doesn't make me feel like that.

3066
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:17,780
It makes me feel like I'm flying over it

3067
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:19,300
and then sort of more of a smooth thing.

3068
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:22,460
So there was more moments of like kind of that thing

3069
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,500
where you hit into your restraint

3070
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:27,620
on a big whatever hill or something,

3071
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:29,780
and it's still really fun.

3072
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:32,540
It's just not quite the same,

3073
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:36,060
I feel like I'm Superman flying like Velocicoaster has.

3074
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,980
Now, as you just said,

3075
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:40,980
there's a soundtrack to the ride

3076
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:42,820
that's really good from what I could hear,

3077
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:45,180
and there's a moment where both,

3078
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:48,260
so you're launching at the same time,

3079
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:52,020
two different long trains, two long roller coaster trains,

3080
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:56,260
and there's a moment where basically both coasters

3081
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,180
are in the exact same spot

3082
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:02,220
and your heads are looking up at each other as you,

3083
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,540
I don't know, I can't even,

3084
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,500
I'm trying to think if you're going straight up

3085
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:07,540
or you're going, I don't know what direction even it was.

3086
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:08,380
I really should look.

3087
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:11,060
But you can like lock eyes with your equivalent.

3088
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:11,900
Yes.

3089
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:13,540
It's a completely mirrored track.

3090
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:16,380
So let's just say like one track is up

3091
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:17,340
and one track is down,

3092
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:20,140
and you look up and you are looking at a mirror image

3093
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:24,180
of your car with a different set of people in it,

3094
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:27,460
and the soundtrack helps make this feel

3095
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:29,740
like it's Matrix bullet time,

3096
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:31,720
which is what definitely like the highlight

3097
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:32,560
of the whole thing.

3098
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:33,900
It's toward the end,

3099
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:37,020
is that you feel like when you look up

3100
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:38,420
and you're just like looking

3101
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:40,820
a bunch of other people in the eyes.

3102
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:41,660
Who are you?

3103
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:44,340
You're like, I'm a man of an entire life

3104
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:46,180
that is not mine.

3105
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:48,260
It's a ride that allows you to Sonder.

3106
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:50,980
Sonder, stop and Sonder.

3107
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,300
Bullet time and Sonder.

3108
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:53,300
Bullet time and Sonder.

3109
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:56,540
This was an original selling point to Dueling Dragons.

3110
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:57,540
Yes, right, right.

3111
01:57:57,540 --> 01:58:00,260
But at the time, Universal didn't send you

3112
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:03,300
through a metal detector and make you put your bags away.

3113
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:05,660
So everyone's shit was flying out of the pockets

3114
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,180
for a decade, and then they're like,

3115
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:10,140
oh, we gotta do something about this.

3116
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:11,620
A quarter sliced my eye.

3117
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,340
You get an iPhone right in the nose.

3118
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:17,180
I think someone did get injured by a flying cell phone.

3119
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:18,460
I'm sure they did.

3120
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:19,660
And it cost.

3121
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:22,980
So now you bring things into the selfie stick era.

3122
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:23,820
Oh my God.

3123
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,820
We're talking decapitations.

3124
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:28,340
Well, selfie sticks should just be for boat.

3125
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:31,860
I'm glad they, yeah, the theme parks took a stand.

3126
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,700
They had to.

3127
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:37,700
My last point of inquiry, merchandising.

3128
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:40,540
Did you like the merchandise for sale?

3129
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:44,940
Yeah, yes.

3130
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:47,980
I didn't get a ton of time to look around at merchandise

3131
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:51,820
just because I wanted to do more of the actual stuff.

3132
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:54,300
There wasn't a ton of Celestial Park stuff.

3133
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:57,260
I did bring Captain Cacao home for my daughter

3134
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:01,140
who was happy but confused to who this was.

3135
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:01,980
You don't say.

3136
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:03,660
There's something confusing about it.

3137
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:07,300
Because I swear we had an entire conversation on this show

3138
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:12,260
about Captain Cacao, this original Epic Universe character

3139
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:14,580
before I realized that it was a bear.

3140
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:15,420
Oh yeah.

3141
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:17,220
I think I was in the park and you were showing me

3142
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:19,460
Captain Cacao and I went, it's a bear?

3143
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:20,300
Yeah, yeah.

3144
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,140
And we missed that point.

3145
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:22,460
Yeah, he's got a little hat and a little star.

3146
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:23,300
He's cute.

3147
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:24,140
He's a cute bear.

3148
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:24,980
He does seem cute.

3149
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:29,820
But I could see he's not immediately understandable

3150
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:31,500
to a two-year-old brain.

3151
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:32,340
Yeah.

3152
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:34,300
I will say this about the merchandise in general.

3153
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:38,780
It is just, I didn't see a lot of next level

3154
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:39,980
theme park merch.

3155
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:42,500
There's some Isle of Berk stuff that's really striking

3156
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,420
in its different graphic design.

3157
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:45,260
Yeah.

3158
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:46,540
But mostly, you go Harry Potter,

3159
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:50,420
it's the same Hogwarts aesthetic clothing, wands.

3160
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:54,740
Monsters, there's some cool stuff in Monsters

3161
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:57,540
but nothing so striking to me.

3162
01:59:57,540 --> 02:00:01,300
So I didn't do such a comprehensive look

3163
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:03,300
at all the merchandise but it didn't seem like

3164
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:04,780
theme park merchandise basically

3165
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:06,900
and nothing that stood out to me like,

3166
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,340
oh my God, I have to have this or that.

3167
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:14,340
Well, the ideal goal, I think, of theme park merchandise

3168
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:17,060
is to bring a little piece of the park back,

3169
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:19,620
to bring a little feeling of what you experienced

3170
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:20,540
back with you.

3171
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:22,460
I can't be there all the time but I can,

3172
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:25,340
in this little way, do something or see something at home

3173
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:27,020
that is something I could do there.

3174
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:29,860
And to that end, as we talk about what are the big headlines

3175
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,580
of what you can do in Epic Universe,

3176
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:33,140
I feel like what they should offer

3177
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:36,380
is miniature crotch crushers.

3178
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:39,580
There should be some little item or toy

3179
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:41,980
and I can't speak to this, I think Jason would be the guy

3180
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:43,540
who could maybe help us figure out

3181
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:45,100
what the item would be like.

3182
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:50,100
But just a little bar that you can bring back home

3183
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:55,380
and just give that little extra team member press

3184
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:59,100
that makes you, that gets you ready for that ride

3185
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:04,300
and feeling, the universal magic, what that is for you

3186
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:07,580
is the numbness you feel in your crotch

3187
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:08,740
when the ride's about to start.

3188
02:01:08,740 --> 02:01:10,060
That's right, yeah.

3189
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:12,460
It's not something you feel in your heart.

3190
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:13,700
No, I feel it in my loins.

3191
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:16,540
It's something you feel in your chub.

3192
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:21,540
Yeah, well I think you get a little Kronos

3193
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:27,180
and 80% of the time it holds your pens in your home office.

3194
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:28,180
But that 20%.

3195
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,460
And then the 20% of the time it's a very restrictive,

3196
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:34,460
like chastity, like a cage, you know?

3197
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:36,180
Yeah, I do know, I do know.

3198
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:39,900
Ooh, this is a portal to somewhere extremely interesting.

3199
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,180
Yeah, it's true.

3200
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:43,300
All right, well, hey, free merch tip.

3201
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:46,100
They'll be really glad we got to go when they hear this.

3202
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:47,940
Oh, Mike, you went to Citi.

3203
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:49,580
Did you go in the preview center at all?

3204
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:50,540
Oh, I did, it's awesome, yeah.

3205
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:51,380
Yeah.

3206
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,820
You've seen pictures of the model

3207
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:55,340
but it's much bigger than you think.

3208
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:58,660
Part of me is almost as much more excited

3209
02:01:58,660 --> 02:02:01,460
about the preview center than the actual park.

3210
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:02,900
I love a preview center.

3211
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:07,540
I also ate like a B minus turkey club at Margaritaville.

3212
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:09,500
Oh, why, why did you do that?

3213
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:10,820
I knew you'd end up back there.

3214
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:12,700
I knew there was no way.

3215
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:15,660
You suggested it after we went, or we could,

3216
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:16,580
Margaritaville, and I said,

3217
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:18,860
or we could go to any other restaurant in this city.

3218
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:21,380
So we went to Disney Springs, okay.

3219
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,780
Yeah, yeah.

3220
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:26,380
All right, well, fun stuff.

3221
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:29,380
What an experience, so cool to get to do it.

3222
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:30,700
Sorry you couldn't join us, Jason.

3223
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:32,180
We'll get you down there.

3224
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:34,420
You will get your Epic Universe experience,

3225
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:38,100
or at least your Epic Universe preview experience.

3226
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:39,660
But if, maybe that's all you want.

3227
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:41,700
Hey, well, depending.

3228
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:42,540
No line for that.

3229
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:44,180
Preview center to boat,

3230
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:46,580
and then you can buy some merch at the preview center.

3231
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:48,620
Hey, you know, I'm a simple man.

3232
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:49,460
It's a pretty good day.

3233
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:51,020
That's a pretty good day.

3234
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,620
But we had a pretty good day in the place,

3235
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:56,820
thanks to anybody who helped this happen,

3236

02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:12,660
the ride, including on The Second Gate on Wednesday.

3242
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:15,820
This, we really wanted to be focused on Epic Universe,

3243
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:17,940
but we did fit in some Disney World time

3244
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:18,900
while we were down there as well.

3245
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:22,260
And on Wednesday, Mike and I are going to talk about

3246
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:26,660
what we are positive was the most cool,

3247
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:30,580
transcendent experience we had during this little trip.

3248
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:33,980
I'm excited for the drop of what the episode is

3249
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:34,980
and what the title is,

3250
02:03:34,980 --> 02:03:36,580
because as soon as it happened, we were like,

3251
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:37,420
is there an episode there?

3252
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:38,820
Yep, I think so.

3253
02:03:38,820 --> 02:03:41,860
It might seem like, you might not get it when you see it,

3254
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:43,980
but I think when we start blabbing,

3255
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:47,940
you will see, you will go into a portal into our hearts

3256
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:50,420
and hopefully experience what we experienced,

3257
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:52,540
because it was really, I don't know,

3258
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:56,820
I hope none of this is like a slideshow of a vacation

3259
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:57,860
you didn't get to go on.

3260
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:59,820
Jason, is that how you feel?

3261
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:00,780
Are we just showing you?

3262
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:02,620
And then we went here, click, click.

3263
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:05,180
Then we went here, click, click.

3264
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,380
No, not really.

3265
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:07,220
That's good to hear.

3266
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:10,300
Even as a child, I would have been excited for that,

3267
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:12,860
because I've been like, oh, what things did they do?

3268
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:14,540
What did they prioritize?

3269
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:18,500
Can you summon a relative who went to a place

3270
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:21,620
who showed you postcards or a slideshow of a trip,

3271
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:22,780
an eight-year-old you is like,

3272
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:25,620
wow, I didn't know that was a factory tour you could take.

3273
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:27,900
I don't know.

3274
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:32,660
I feel like my Aunt Betty went to Florida a lot growing up.

3275
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:36,220
Disney World Florida or just looking at botanical gardens?

3276
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:37,260
Oh, Disney World.

3277
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,700
Oh, yeah, Big Disney World.

3278
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:39,540
Oh, okay.

3279
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:42,540
That chunk of the side of the family, yeah.

3280
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:43,860
I was hoping it was just like,

3281
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:46,420
and they had a sunflower exhibit.

3282
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:49,420
There were sunflowers as far as the eye could see.

3283
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:51,540
70 sunflowers, I believe.

3284
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:53,060
Then we went to Gator World,

3285
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:55,660
and boy, there certainly was a lot of them.

3286
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:58,700
He went on all the trips.

3287
02:04:58,700 --> 02:04:59,940
He didn't have to be told.

3288
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:00,940
