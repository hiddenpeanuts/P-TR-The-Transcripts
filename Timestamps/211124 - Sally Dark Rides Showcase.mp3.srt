1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey, Disney Imagineers, get bent.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,720
We've got a new favorite set of ride makers

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,040
and it's Sally Dark Rides.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,600
This is podcast The Ride, the second gate.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,880
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson with us as always.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm with you as always and I wanna back up

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,520
what you're saying.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,360
Eat shit, Disney Imagineers.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,920
You are nothing but dirt to me.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,840
You're nothing but dirt, dirt in the dirt.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,680
That's what I say.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,120
After what we've learned, what we have to bring

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
to the table today, a great set of rides

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,040
from a great set of guys, which also includes

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,960
Jason Sheridan, hi.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,520
Hi, yeah, this will be fun.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,760
This has been like a recurring company

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,480
that keeps coming up on the show

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,240
and a number of times recently.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,760
Yeah, exactly and then that's sort of what we're doing

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,680
here today.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,440
So just to say it at the top, we are focusing

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,680
on a group called Sally Dark Rides.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,520
If you're an avid listener and you really pay attention,

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,480
you might have heard us talk about them.

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,640
You might have heard attractions come up here and there

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,560
that they did.

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,200
Basically, what has kept happening is

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
if there is a non, typically a non-Disney,

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
non-universal place that has a dark ride

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,880
that is somewhat strange, very often it is made

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,080
by Sally Dark Rides.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,120
They've been in it for decades and what's happening today

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
is we're gonna talk a little about the company

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,120
and some of the stuff they've done,

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,280
but mainly the three of us, we have each picked

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,120
a different strange ride from the collection

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,080
of Sally Dark Rides and we're gonna sort of surprise

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,360
the others with it.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,320
I think we might know the tiniest amount,

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,960
but mainly we're all, we're doing a little potluck

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,560
of dark ride information and I'm excited.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm excited to share mine.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm excited for what you guys have.

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
I truly have no idea.

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,600
Yes, I got very excited doing this

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,160
because there's, if you don't know anything,

49
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,320
yeah, we kind of mentioned it,

50
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,320
but this company has done so many things for decades.

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,960
So going back through, there's so many things

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
that I was like, well, maybe I'll talk about this,

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,960
maybe we'll talk about this and there were literally

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,120
10 things I could have picked, I feel like,

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,800
that we could have talked about,

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,200
but I decided to pick something that I have experienced.

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
I'll say that as a tease.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, that's good.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,080
I didn't realize Sally was behind it.

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,600
This is how much Sally is in our lives,

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,320
is that I experienced something as a youth

62
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,920
that Sally was responsible for.

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,560
So I say thank you to Sally for what I will be sharing.

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,520
When I was very young.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,640
I think I have a guess as what it is.

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,280
If I can say, I think one of the notable things about Sally

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,160
and I wasn't quite sure what to call this,

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
and then I got their latest email newsletter

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
because I'm on their listserv,

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,040
because in 2020, a lot of the theme park industry

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
conventions had to go digital,

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,960
so anyone could attend them throughout the world.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,800
And I watched some presentations and visited digital booths

74
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,240
where you could look at pitch documents and blueprints.

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,600
And so there it is. Digital booths.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Digital booths, that's right.

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
And they're Ioppa, one of the trade groups,

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
is having an in-person convention this year.

79
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,680
Actually, as this episode is coming out, it just passed.

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,160
But Sally sent out their email promoting it.

81
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,440
And a big part of the email was discussing

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,040
their turnkey process.

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
And this is their language.

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,080
From dark rides to animated productions,

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,000
we use our turnkey capabilities

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,840
to create unforgettable attractions from start to finish.

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
And then there's a little graphic

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,400
about how they designed the story,

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,720
the design of the attraction, the build of the attraction,

90
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,040
and the installation.

91
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
And a lot of this stuff, too,

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,480
is customizable to people's budgets,

93
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,440
parks' budgets, and park spaces.

94
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,440
And I think this is where they make their bread and butter.

95
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,600
This is where smaller parks can get a little taste

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,040
of a bigger park dark ride experience.

97
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,880
A little taste.

98
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,240
Wait, what does turnkey, though, mean in that context?

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,360
Okay, turnkey is a phrase,

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,400
it literally means a product that is ready to go.

101
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,320
You are handed the key, and it's like you were given a car.

102
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,280
You put the key in, turn it on, it's ready to drive.

103
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,720
Got it, okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

104
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
So all set, like a fully furnished house or apartment.

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,680
This is their way of saying,

106
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
listen, park that never deals with stuff like this,

107
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,880
we got it, don't worry about it.

108
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah, so if you're cutting a check

109
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,400
to put a Ghost Blasters in your park,

110
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,720
a Ghost Blasters ride, one of their rides,

111
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,840
they're ready to go.

112
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,080
And in addition to the original properties,

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,160
they have IPs they work with.

114
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,320
They've been commissioned,

115
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,280
they have made proof of concept stuff

116
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,480
for like Aardman Attract, like Shaun the Sheep,

117
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,480
or Five Nights at Freddy's, a video game that

118
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
gets brought up to us a lot.

119
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,320
And they had the Goosebumps license for a while,

120
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,360
and even made, here, I'll share the screen real quick.

121
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
They even made a slappy animatronic of like,

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
here's what the pre-show animatronic would be.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
Oh yeah.

124
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,680
There's like a little carnival barker, Slappy.

125
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Slappy is the dummy.

126
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,520
Yes, the Knight of the Living Dummy, I think it is.

127
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
Yes.

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,200
The haunted ventriloquist dummy

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,920
shows up in a bunch of Goosebumps.

130
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
Gotcha.

131
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,160
He's not Caesar from Twilight Zone, he's Slappy.

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
That's right.

133
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,160
Yes, he's not Slappy.

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,720
So they've worked with IPs,

135
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,320
so they would make a ride fully ready to go

136
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,440
for some of these IPs, and just in some cases,

137
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,160
these have not been commissioned anywhere officially

138
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,320
and not built.

139
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,800
Yeah, that's correct.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,280
They have a big, on their website,

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
showing all their Ioppa presentation,

142
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,800
their booths through the ages,

143
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,640
and in the 80s, they had done Care Bear shows

144
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,000
at a few parks, and they even had a design and concept

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,360
for a Ghostbusters ride, but not the one

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,600
that Bally's was making that we talked about

147
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
on a previous show, the Filmation Ghostbusters,

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
the one with the gorilla.

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,000
The one with Tracy the Gorilla.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,320
The other Ghostbusters.

151
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,160
Yeah.

152
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Wow.

153
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,480
This was a mind blow that came from,

154
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,120
this might have been from a friend of the show,

155
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,200
Kyle Mooney, who told me that they,

156
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,720
we know that thing about how there was the Ghostbusters

157
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,600
and then the real Ghostbusters,

158
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
and they had to call the Ghostbusters cartoon

159
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,680
the real Ghostbusters because there was this other

160
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,560
Ghostbusters property.

161
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
This is sort of known.

162
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,040
What I didn't know is that the other Ghostbusters

163
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,360
involved a gorilla and that it was based on a film

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,360
that also had, Ghostbusters existed already

165
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
in live action form before, I mean, really,

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,440
they are the real Ghostbusters, honestly,

167
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,920
if they were to it in two mediums

168
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,160
well before the Dan Aykroyd version.

169
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,520
It was like decades before.

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,160
I believe they called them,

171
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,760
one was the real Ghostbusters

172
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,680
and one was the original Ghostbusters.

173
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,440
Is that right?

174
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Maybe.

175
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,280
I don't know about original.

176
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,400
I think it was a TV show.

177
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,240
I think it was like a chintzy,

178
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,640
like Sid and Marty Croft produced a TV show.

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,200
Oh, okay, okay.

180
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,240
It was a black and white thing.

181
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Oh, you're right, not a film.

182
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,840
No, yeah, 1975 kids.

183
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,680
Okay, okay, yeah.

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,880
Okay, like less than a little over a decade.

185
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
Yeah, that's so, I actually missed that.

186
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,920
I would like to see that

187
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
because I was a big fan of both

188
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,640
Ghostbusters cartoons as a child.

189
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,480
Yeah.

190
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,320
I liked the gorilla one.

191
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,280
I have zero familiarity with the other.

192
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,840
I do not know the other one whatsoever.

193
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,680
Yeah.

194
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,520
We had toys.

195
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,960
We had toys from the other one.

196
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,960
I just always, always purchased dirty at a garage sale,

197
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,600
but we had the guys.

198
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,120
I didn't have, I'm jealous of that.

199
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
I gotta get my hands on those.

200
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Or somebody's gotta make new versions.

201
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,760
NECA or Super Seven's gotta get on making me

202
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,680
an original Ghostbusters line of toys.

203
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,320
So yeah, Jason, yeah, they've done, I saw that.

204
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,680
There's like a weird Care Bear show I watched from the 80s.

205
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,520
The bears look nightmarish.

206
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
The show is-

207
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Was that me?

208
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,040
Does that exist somewhere?

209
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
There's a show.

210
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,720
Dorni Park?

211
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Yeah, Dorni Park.

212
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,720
It's a robot show.

213
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,240
The bears all look like something's wrong

214
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,360
and it's really, it looks scary.

215
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,360
At least just the way the video is,

216
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
but I'm very impressed by that.

217
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,160
There's like Flintstone rock and roll show.

218
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,320
I don't know if you saw that.

219
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,040
It's Fred and Wilma and Dino playing instruments

220
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,280
and it's just a little Chuck E. Cheese Flintstone show.

221
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
Where did that exist, do we know?

222
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,040
That might have been at the Bedrock,

223
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,480
the Bedrock, what is that, like the little roadside spot?

224
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Oh yeah, it's kind of a desert play, like now abandoned?

225
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,600
Yeah, something like that.

226
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm pretty fuzzy on this.

227
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,760
I don't think I know, I don't have my facts straight

228
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,120
about this Flintstones thing.

229
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,960
I don't either.

230
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,520
I saw a little bit of the video and I was like,

231
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,360
well, that's weird.

232
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,680
So it's just, you can find so many bizarre things

233
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,000
in the, like on the website too.

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,360
It's just a lot of it's on the website,

235
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,960
a lot of it's on their YouTube

236
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,280
and you can get a little history for just how much stuff

237
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,040
this company has been involved in.

238
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,280
This is, here's my big theory I'm gonna present.

239
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,320
If we want to, as we're want to do sometimes,

240
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,920
put things in rock and roll terms.

241
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,800
When we got to introduce Tony Baxter in our live show,

242
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,640
we called him the Mick Jagger of, I don't know,

243
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,560
of attractions, I don't know what the general umbrella is,

244
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,440
but I think that's correct.

245
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,040
He's the rock star, he's the icon.

246
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,800
He's never listened to a Rolling Stone song,

247
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,880
but he is the Mick Jagger for sure.

248
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,400
Through context clues, he would understand.

249
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,640
Yeah, yeah, I think he understood

250
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,280
that kind of reference, yeah.

251
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,920
But I think Sally Dark Rides,

252
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,840
I'm gonna invoke one of my favorite bands

253
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,320
and say that Sally Dark Rides

254
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,960
is like the sparks of ride makers.

255
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,680
They are, they've been around for decades.

256
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,080
They are this odd, it's this weird singular body of work.

257
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,280
It's like incredibly strange and they don't chase trends.

258
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,840
They've just been plugging away quietly.

259
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,760
Sometimes some of the things spike,

260
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,440
oh, I've heard of that one, but then they just,

261
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,680
it's back to the grind.

262
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,200
They keep cranking out their odd body of work.

263
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,320
Or it's like whatever you wanna fill in

264
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,440
for the syndrome I just described.

265
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,000
They're like the Zappa of ride makers.

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Whatever, it's the weirdo oddball

267
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,760
doesn't need to be part of the mainstream.

268
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Although they might, if people from Sally Dark Rides

269
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
listen to this, they might not agree.

270
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
We're not trying to be some cult entity.

271
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,760
We're trying to sell rides and be a business,

272
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,680
which they are and do very well.

273
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,080
Well, like, yeah, Sparks wasn't out against

274
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,120
doing a song, a Disney song or something.

275
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,880
Oh yes, they happily did.

276
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,240
Yeah, I'm trying to bridge that

277
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
because it's like they do Justice.

278
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,640
Songs for terrible movies, like the movie Rad,

279
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,480
which is in a, I think they perform in an amusement park.

280
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
So this is fairly accurate.

281
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,480
Justice League, that's a big property.

282
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,800
Six Flags, a big park, a big franchise.

283
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,080
So yeah, so they do stuff like that too.

284
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,240
Justice League, well, they have hits today.

285
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,040
Justice League Battle for Metropolis is their,

286
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,880
the rhythm thief.

287
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,240
It's a 2000s entry that's surprisingly strong.

288
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,240
Reese's Cup Fusion, I guess, would be there.

289
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,280
When do I get to sing My Way?

290
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,080
I'll try to keep forming these.

291
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,280
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

292
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,680
And it's, there's so much stuff.

293
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,120
We were talking a little bit about just picking one each,

294
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,080
but there were a couple things.

295
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,440
I don't know if you guys, if this is too,

296
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,880
am I getting ahead of myself?

297
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,200
I found just a couple quick things that I just,

298
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,240
I love so much because I'll say this

299
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,680
about what my choice is today.

300
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,600
It is not a dark ride.

301
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
So maybe I'm already blowing it.

302
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,360
Maybe I'm blowing the rules here.

303
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,200
I apologize.

304
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
I had to do it though.

305
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,880
No, no, no, and they,

306
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,280
I think there's that brand Sally Dark Rides,

307
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,960
but I think it's also the Sally Corporation.

308
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,800
Yes.

309
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
So they are not, I even thought about saying that,

310
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,640
that feel free to pick as your choice

311
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,680
for your little book report, a single animatronic.

312
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,120
There are those.

313
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,200
You're gonna say some quick hits.

314
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,240
Mine's such a quick hit.

315
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,440
I might as well just throw it out very quickly.

316
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,520
Actually, there's two, two single animatronics.

317
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,160
I was, it blew up my brain to find out

318
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,800
that they made the animatronic of Lyndon Baines Johnson

319
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,440
that's at the LBJ library in Austin, Texas,

320
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,920
which I saw in person when I was 15.

321
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,680
It's one of the weirdest things ever.

322
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,960
It's a pretty standard kind of sleepy presidential library.

323
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,160
Then you're around a corner and then there's LBJ

324
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,600
leaning up against a post telling stories.

325
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
I always thought it was so strange.

326
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,520
Then, oh my God, they made it.

327
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,400
And then check this.

328
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,440
I feel like this is gonna be very well received

329
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,000
with all you guys, if you didn't see it already,

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
they made an animatronic of Elsie the Borden Cow.

331
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,560
Oh, oh baby.

332
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,280
I knew Jason loved the Borden Cow.

333
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,400
How could you not?

334
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,760
Dairy mascot.

335
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,680
I hunted for a video of this, but I couldn't find it.

336
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,520
Oh, damn.

337
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,320
Beautiful photo.

338
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Beautiful photo.

339
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,560
She's, yeah, I don't, she's a lovely cow, I guess.

340
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Elsie's iconic neck wreath of daisies.

341
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,680
We all know this about Elsie the Cow.

342
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,840
And then they supposed that Elsie the Cow,

343
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,280
this is what, if you're looking at a photo

344
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,520
of Elsie the Borden Cow, you would know what it was,

345
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,160
but maybe not if you hear it out loud.

346
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,280
But suffice it to say,

347
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,200
fantastic animatronic for a great IP.

348
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,920
Fantastic.

349
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,400
So yeah, Quick Hits.

350
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,200
I found that just that they, yeah,

351
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,640
they do like little shows.

352
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,320
There's a show in Nashville,

353
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
or I believe at Nashville in a hotel,

354
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
I don't know if you guys saw this,

355
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,520
called the Cross-eyed Critters,

356
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,600
where you can do karaoke with three animals.

357
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,120
Like an animal band.

358
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,320
And I don't even, that's not even in my list.

359
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
You'd think I would have wanted to play that the most,

360
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,040
but it's just, that's just how much like

361
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,120
different kinds of experience,

362
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,640
different types of experiences they're doing.

363
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,440
But here, let me, they've been doing stuff like this,

364
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,680
or sort of outside of the genre of like theme parks

365
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
and stuff for a little while.

366
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,280
So here, let me do this.

367
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,520
I don't know if you saw this.

368
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,000
This is an animatronic character named Sally at the piano.

369
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,080
Here we go.

370
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,040
["Southern Nights"]

371
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
She's talented, good-looking,

372
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,760
and an entertainer par excellence.

373
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,000
Meet Sally, our piano playing lady.

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,480
It's a department store mannequin.

375
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
It's not even like her to me.

376
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,680
Sally's realistic, good looks, lovely voice,

377
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,480
and piano playing finesse have surprised and delighted

378
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,320
many restaurant, hotel, and lounge guests across the nation.

379
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,400
This is 1984, so it's not all that surprising

380
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,840
to see a robot singing and playing the piano.

381
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,120
Like Sally's been doing here at Gene's restaurant

382
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,440
in the Tudor Hotel since Tuesday.

383
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,640
The Tudor Hotel?

384
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,920
She's fantastic.

385
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,480
She plays good music.

386
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,440
She's attractive.

387
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,480
First class all the way.

388
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,040
All right, calm down.

389
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,880
Thank you.

390
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,240
She's always sober, doesn't take breaks,

391
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,800
and even comes with a warranty.

392
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,200
And they zoom in on a newspaper that says,

393
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,160
and give the lady a screwdriver.

394
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
Sally is a guaranteed winner.

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Available for booking into your place today.

396
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,120
So play it again, Sally.

397
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,760
Wow.

398
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Terrifying.

399
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
Just a terrifying mannequin robot playing piano

400
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,080
in like a hotel or a department store.

401
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,640
This was sort of their big idea, I think, at the time.

402
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,520
Terribly dead-eyed and kind of like,

403
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,320
but also creepily made up.

404
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,840
Like it looks like a made-up corpse.

405
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,240
And I called the Borden cow lovely,

406
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,520
but they call this robot lady lovely or attractive

407
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,200
like three times in this video for some reason.

408
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,760
Sober.

409
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,880
She's got a damn blush like the other piano players.

410
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,720
I think, yeah.

411
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,680
Not gonna drain this bar of its booze

412
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,640
like everyone else we hire.

413
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
But you might think, okay.

414
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Family musicians.

415
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,560
Sally has probably thought,

416
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,800
okay, that's kind of an odd thing.

417
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,440
We probably won't do something like that.

418
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
We won't update that.

419
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,680
You are incorrect.

420
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,840
How about DJ Sally in the year 2021?

421
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
Yes.

422
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,280
It's like Sia hair, Sivir bangs.

423
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,840
And she's just like lazily listening to headphones

424
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,880
that she's holding.

425
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,440
Much like less.

426
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,360
Kind of like silver, like Lady Gaga costume.

427
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,040
And then a DJ booth that has the Sally Dark Rides logo on it.

428
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,880
Yeah.

429
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,400
And this is not, this is basically it.

430
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,480
The robot actually is less good than the original.

431
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
She doesn't do that much.

432
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,240
But obviously they're thinking the same thing here

433
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,200
is that if you wanna rent a robot to DJ a party, you can.

434
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
That's what Sally Dark Rides or Sally Corporation

435
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,200
can do for you in your party or hotel.

436
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,080
So that's a little quick hit there.

437
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,840
I love it.

438
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Do you think they've ever entertained the sex doll market?

439
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,040
Do you think they've ever had discussions with,

440
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,880
yeah, they must have.

441
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,160
Yeah, they call it some other brand.

442
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,360
It's like they translate Sally into another language.

443
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,520
And then like, so it's a related name

444
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,640
but you wouldn't recognize it immediately.

445
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,320
But, cause I watched this very miserable documentary

446
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,880
about like individuals trying to make realistic sex dolls

447
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,360
in their garages.

448
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Like, and this is from, it was very seedy

449
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,640
and British and from 13 years ago.

450
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,920
So you're watching all these like robot creatures

451
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,000
that wanna be put out of their misery,

452
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,680
little like spasm for no reason and just start like,

453
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,320
like their eyes roll back in their head,

454
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
like they're possessed.

455
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,280
Unpleasant.

456
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,640
And I just know these people would be toiling away

457
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,320
in their garage, putting, using hammer and nail

458
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,480
to make a realistic vagina.

459
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,200
They're like, if only we could get Sally.

460
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,040
There is.

461
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,920
I really upset you with that.

462
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,040
It was an upsetting, it's an upsetting thought.

463
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
It's an upsetting thought, yes, for sure.

464
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,840
But there's gotta be a file folder in a file cabinet

465
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,640
somewhere that's like in case of emergency,

466
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,680
like there was probably deep in COVID,

467
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,680
they were like, if we don't recover,

468
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,280
we have to maybe pivot to a different market.

469
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,320
And they thought about it.

470
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,640
There were days when deep in the pandemic,

471
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,400
when they were like, well, maybe,

472
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,680
and they pulled it out and somebody like the boss

473
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,120
like hit it out of the, like, Bill, we're not doing that.

474
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,400
I told you, it's not that bleak yet.

475
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,360
He's like, you're crazy.

476
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,400
The company is gonna go under if we don't do this.

477
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840
And there was a huge argument.

478
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,600
And then like, luckily like cooler heads prevailed

479
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,480
and then the company sort of got back on track.

480
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,440
But there's no, there's no reason,

481
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,680
there's no way they haven't thought about it.

482
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,600
That is plan Z, understood?

483
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
Yeah. Not plan B.

484
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,800
You don't wait for, you don't pull that out

485
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,720
after eight months. Yeah.

486
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,400
You do it after 10 years of zero business.

487
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,640
It's a suicide mission.

488
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,760
We'll never be able to make Yosemite Sam animatronics again.

489
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Are you crazy?

490
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,520
You can't come back from that.

491
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,680
You can't just suddenly switch from sex dolls

492
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,720
to Paw Patrol.

493
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
Are you out of your mind?

494
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,440
It's like a fist fight ensues in the Sally offices.

495
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,400
Look, Yosemite Sam as is, is like waist height.

496
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,800
So if we had to take the existing robots.

497
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,120
No, no, no, no, god damn it.

498
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,920
Change their function.

499
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,400
You sick freak.

500
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,360
You never mix the IP with our weird sex ideas.

501
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,440
Mute his Zoom window, mute his Zoom window.

502
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
We'll call him Sequoia Steve, we'll change it.

503
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,720
What did you, wait, what did you say?

504
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,720
That's wait, that's a brilliant idea.

505
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,560
Now it works.

506
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,120
Yeah, now, yeah, of course, of course.

507
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,760
This all has happened.

508
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,120
Every bit of this has happened.

509
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,920
I mean, it's an immense body of work

510
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,320
with strange moments throughout.

511
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,280
Let me list a few just to like get them out of the way.

512
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,800
The ones that we're not gonna talk about for a while,

513
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,800
but just to give you a sense of a little bit of the history.

514
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
I mentioned LBJ.

515
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
We've mentioned Justice League Battle for Metropolis,

516
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,480
which I think was considered a surprisingly good dark ride.

517
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,280
Six Flags First Reel committed venture into that territory.

518
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
So that's a big success for them lately.

519
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
They have come up on other episodes

520
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,800
because of a ride called Mine of Lost Souls

521
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,440
at Canobie Lake Park, which we talked about

522
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,960
when we did New Hampshire theme parks.

523
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,640
In the same episode, we talked about,

524
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,480
I was so delighted by this ride,

525
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,280
the great Humbug Adventure.

526
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,400
This shooting gallery ride with Scrooge

527
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,400
where Humbugs are real and you got a fired lasers at them.

528
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,840
I forget, or it was like chocolates

529
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,440
or I don't remember how it works.

530
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,480
A ride, I don't remember how much we talked about it

531
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,720
with Kelly Nugent and the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk,

532
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,160
but they did a ride called the Haunted Castle up there

533
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,760
that I think people are fond of.

534
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,800
Two Hershey Park rides,

535
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,680
which we gotta delve a little deeper into Hershey.

536
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,280
We can maybe we just piece off these rides

537
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,040
because they did a fascinating ride and its replacement.

538
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,160
First they did Reese's Extreme Cup Challenge

539
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,560
with like a X Games type event,

540
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,280
which I remember having like very creepy humanoid

541
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,680
Dick Vitale-esque play-by-play announcers.

542
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,520
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,920
And then they remastered it.

544
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,120
They remastered it like the Paul McCartney,

545
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,400
like the collection of the solo albums.

546
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,960
No, no, the solo albums that came with a bonus discs

547
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,080
of like McCartney and McCartney 2 and the Wings record.

548
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,920
Right, right, right.

549
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,240
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,920
Well, then they flipped it around

551
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,560
and turned it into Reese's Cup Fusion,

552
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,960
which I don't know a lot about offhand.

553
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
I just really liked the name.

554
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,440
That one might be,

555
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,600
probably the least essential or interesting stuff they do

556
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,400
is like a lot of parks shooting gallery rides,

557
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
some of which, you know,

558
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,400
as we found with some of what Knott's has done,

559
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
maybe you do need the Disney caliber and budget

560
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,960
to really pull those off,

561
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,400
although we found some charming other examples,

562
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,240
but I could be wrong.

563
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,920
Reese's Cup Fusion might be as great as its name.

564
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,120
It's a very good name.

565
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Big one too, oddly they haven't talked about it so much.

566
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,680
And if I were them, I'd be bragging about this nonstop.

567
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,680
They were part of the ET adventure.

568
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,280
I mean, that's as big of cred as it comes.

569
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,480
It's kind of specific.

570
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
I think in a lot of cases,

571
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,720
they don't make the ride vehicle and mechanisms,

572
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,040
but it's stuff like animatronics and scenic design,

573
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,800
which of course with that attraction is the best stuff.

574
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,840
And I found somewhere specifically where they said,

575
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,600
it's animatronics in the queue.

576
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,040
And we know what animatronics are in the queue.

577
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,880
We certainly do.

578
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,600
The ET adventure, our good friend,

579
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,760
recently refurbished apparently is what we saw.

580
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,720
Oh yeah, right, right.

581
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,280
Nutanicus is fresh and doing great.

582
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,240
So, I mean, incredible.

583
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
Like they were, these guys were part of making

584
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,880
our best friends, Magdahl and Orbadon and-

585
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Flop Glopple.

586
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,320
Flop Glopple.

587
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,480
But the big one and probably why they came up

588
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,080
the first time for us and the hardest,

589
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,280
and frequently it's hard to stop bringing up this attraction

590
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,800
because it's so intriguing,

591
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,000
a little ride from a little place called Hard Rock Park.

592
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And that ride is called Knights in White Satin, The Trip.

593
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,480
The psychedelic dark ride based on the movie Blue's song.

594
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,120
I mean, we, right, this, we just like, we talk about it,

595
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,320
it comes up so frequently.

596
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,520
It's just like, solid candidate for weirdest ride ever

597
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
to exist anywhere.

598
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,720
Gone too soon.

599
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,560
Yeah.

600
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,760
Maybe at the top of my list of things that I like,

601
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,760
am sad I never got to ride.

602
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,840
Never, top five at least.

603
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,680
Yeah.

604
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,400
Because it was so strange.

605
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,760
And the more and more I thought about it,

606
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,120
looking across the room, I can see the,

607
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,120
one of my manic pandemic purchases of the odd shaped

608
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,760
Knights in White Satin, The Trip coffee mug from eBay.

609
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Um, I, um, I, I think,

610
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,480
I thought about this ride a lot since we did those episodes

611
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,920
because I think it was kind of ahead of its time

612
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,040
because what came after it?

613
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,800
The Navi River journey, a kind of weird, ethereal ride

614
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,680
meant to invoke, I think Joe Rody said like all,

615
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,120
or serenity, like feelings that don't often necessarily

616
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,720
come up in dark rides.

617
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,080
And then every six months or once a year, what happens?

618
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Meow Wolf opens a unique idiosyncratic walkthrough attraction,

619
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,080
ride attraction, and everyone goes wild for it.

620
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,360
And what preceded all of that?

621
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,920
Knights in White Satin The Trip, baby.

622
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Yeah. Trippy, for adults, abstract, psychedelic.

623
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,600
Yeah. It's pretty, uh, it's pretty heavy

624
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
and pretty different.

625
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,960
Groundbreaking. Yeah.

626
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,800
Yeah. Um, I mean, to think that we wouldn't have

627
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,080
Navi River journey without it.

628
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,040
Well, everyone's favorite.

629
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,680
I should say, I don't think you can draw a straight line,

630
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,760
but just in terms of like what's in the air,

631
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,600
like what the industry is doing.

632
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,440
Like a wavy line, man.

633
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,400
You can draw a wavy line.

634
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,800
Or some relaxed lines.

635
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,640
Yeah.

636
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Candles.

637
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,320
Mm-hmm.

638
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,560
Um, you know, we, Mike, you've mentioned this here and there,

639
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,640
how we probably do need to do more with Hard Rock Park.

640
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,960
I think there's another shot at it,

641
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,960
especially because like, you know, we were so,

642
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
that was our whole thing with that episode,

643
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,280
is we were so like stressed and like,

644
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,600
finding how many materials were there,

645
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,120
like more than we usually find for stuff.

646
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,960
Right.

647
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
And I don't think we even scratched the surface.

648
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,680
And I say that partially because I just, due to this,

649
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,080
I was like, well, I got to rewatch a video of

650
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,480
Knights in White Satin The Trip, which is pretty,

651
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,920
I mean, parts of it you could be highfalutin' about,

652
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,960
and then it'll just like pass by a box with a mirror in it,

653
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,840
or like a wavy spiral.

654
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,000
You know, like what is this?

655
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,840
Sure.

656
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,880
But anyway, I just watched a bunch of other

657
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,480
Hard Rock Park videos, the like abandoned video of it,

658
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,680
I think you guys told me about.

659
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,880
I was so amazed by, correctly hyped.

660
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,400
It's so creepy around there now,

661
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,280
but then I watched a, just a,

662
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,080
their fireworks show of Bohemian Rhapsody.

663
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Oh my God, which Hard Rock founder, creator,

664
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,960
John Bukowski is on record saying somewhere like,

665
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,400
it's the best nighttime show there is.

666
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,880
We're doing better than Disney and Universal.

667
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,800
And then you watch it and just like,

668
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,960
sort of correctly timed, just like burst,

669
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,720
like splooges of animatronics.

670
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,560
Mama.

671
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,600
Of fireworks, rather.

672
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
At that point, yeah.

673
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,840
What's that?

674
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,120
Like mama, and then explosion.

675
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it won't be quite like,

676
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,200
mama, like it's a little like, mama.

677
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,520
It's a little, a little off throughout.

678
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,480
Half beat.

679
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,920
And then you're wondering where, like,

680
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,240
where are they gonna go from here?

681
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,280
They've been doing pyro the whole time.

682
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,520
When it gets into the head banging portion,

683
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
what do we do?

684
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,960
And here come the lasers.

685
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,800
Oh good.

686
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,880
Green lasers all over the lagoon.

687
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
And it's, and the fireworks are so much louder

688
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,800
than the music.

689
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,680
It's just, it's such a funny.

690
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Yeah.

691
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,560
It was great walking down Hard Rock memory lane.

692
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
So yeah, I think there's,

693
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,080
Hard Rock, goodbye yellow brick road,

694
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,600
I guess is what they would say.

695
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,440
Oh yeah.

696
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Hard Rock Park anthology.

697
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,280
The, yeah, the unbuilt stuff.

698
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,320
The, it's very funny to say unbuilt about a park

699
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,920
that was demolished almost as soon as they unlocked the gates.

700
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,600
But their plans for like,

701
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,960
hotel condos, shopping, kind of like,

702
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,800
city walks or shopping area and like all the unbuilt lands

703
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,040
and like the, the wedding chapel, you know,

704
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,960
really, really terrific.

705
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Sally Dark Rides is probably gonna do more for them.

706
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,800
They were gonna build a life-sized animatronic

707
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,160
hairy shaping.

708
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,120
Wow.

709
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,600
They got the rights to Flo and Eddie.

710
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,400
Those look exactly like what I assume

711
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,000
Flo and Eddie look like.

712
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,320
Well, the Velvet Underground ride doesn't have a huge line,

713
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,680
but everyone who wrote it immediately went

714
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,720
into the theme park business afterwards.

715
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,840
That's true.

716
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,200
There would be no Navi River Journey without that.

717
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,920
That's what we're saying.

718
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,760
We got rock metaphors.

719
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
They all work.

720
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,440
Just more.

721
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,920
I mean, we were robbed of just more rides

722
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,120
based on specific songs.

723
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,200
That is, I wish. That's probably the craziest.

724
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,760
That trend.

725
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,440
Life in the fast lane.

726
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,320
And the ride, I also watched,

727
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,800
I forgot that they had a ride where you board into,

728
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,720
your roller coaster car goes into a Ferris wheel,

729
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,760
which lifts it up into the drop.

730
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,200
And on the Ferris wheel, it's playing Gary Newman's cars.

731
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,480
And then for the like 45 seconds of roller coaster remaining,

732
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,480
they play everybody wing shung tonight.

733
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,800
It's incredible soundtrack.

734
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,640
All right.

735
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
So yeah, we'll find a way.

736
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,360
I mean, we got to do it bigger and better

737
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,480
than we did it before.

738
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,520
And maybe we have to reach out to a certain person.

739
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,400
I know, we're saying that too.

740
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,320
Yeah, yeah.

741
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,160
Tap the vein.

742
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Anyways, so that's some of the great work

743
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,760
of Sally Dark Rides that we knew.

744
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,640
But we were here to discover stuff in the catalog

745
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
that we didn't know about.

746
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,840
And we each picked something, rides or a show apparently,

747
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,680
or I don't even know where Mike's going with it.

748
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,960
Where do we begin?

749
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,680
Does anyone want to volunteer to go first?

750
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,440
I will go first because I inadvertently realized

751
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,920
that I picked a semi-timely ride

752
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,440
because Thanksgiving is coming up.

753
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,680
And I have picked what may be the only Thanksgiving themed

754
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,040
Dark Ride in the world.

755
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm assuming I would be interested to hear

756
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,920
about other Thanksgiving rides.

757
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,600
I'm of course talking about the Sally Dark Ride designed

758
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
Gobbler Getaway.

759
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
This opened, Gobbler Getaway opened 2006.

760
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,400
That holiday world in Santa Claus, Indiana,

761
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,880
a park we've been told about a lot,

762
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,000
I believe was in the news a long time ago

763
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,800
because an urban legend started that they had replaced

764
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,440
the water fountains with soda.

765
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,800
And it was just that, I believe you could get free soda

766
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,680
at soda fountains if you, it was one of the parks.

767
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
It's like parks.

768
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,840
Parks going like free parking, free, you know,

769
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,160
free soda with your meal.

770
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,520
Like it was one of those things that got blown

771
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,960
way out of proportion.

772
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,400
It was just brown water.

773
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,120
Yeah, it's just brown water.

774
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,160
It's just very hard water.

775
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,200
So holiday world is a park where like each section

776
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,040
is themed to different holidays.

777
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,160
There's like a Christmas section, a Halloween section

778
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,920
and a more recent Thanksgiving section.

779
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,120
And so Gobbler Getaway, I'm just gonna read the description,

780
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,800
the simplified description on Wikipedia.

781
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,120
The ride is centered on the fictional

782
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,160
Jamestown evoking autumn falls,

783
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,720
where the residents presented as pilgrim fathers

784
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,080
must gather turkeys for the year's Thanksgiving.

785
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,960
Guests are equipped with turkey collars

786
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,760
that you use to tag birds as they pass through the town

787
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,080
and the environs.

788
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,760
At the conclusion of the ride, guest scores are tallied up

789
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,880
and a winner is decided between the four guests

790
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,200
in each vehicle.

791
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,800
The vehicles are called Trotters.

792
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,480
Wow.

793
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,160
Go to your Trotter, go to old Jamestown.

794
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,520
So that's, it's in the past, it's in early America?

795
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,880
Yeah, kind of early America

796
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,880
because the ride itself is, you know,

797
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,120
pilgrim-y kind of people, but then as you are in the queue,

798
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,320
there is an animatronic of someone telling you

799
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,000
how the ride works and the animatronic of course is grandma.

800
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,160
There's that Sally style, oh my God.

801
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,400
They really, they make some like, just mannequin,

802
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,640
like scarily realistic.

803
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,360
What is, sorry, sorry.

804
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,720
Bring that back up, Jason.

805
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,440
Yeah, we gotta see that gun for longer.

806
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,280
Is that the tagger, the collar, what is it?

807
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,720
I'm gonna bring up another picture

808
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,520
because this is 2020 grandma,

809
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,880
so of course she's wearing a mask.

810
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
Oh my God.

811
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,400
Thanks grandma.

812
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,760
So no, that is the turkey collar.

813
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,520
It does look like a gun,

814
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,600
but you're not blasting the turkeys,

815
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,600
you're calling them, you know?

816
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,680
Okay.

817
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
So wait, okay, so she's got grandma here,

818
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,840
I just wanna paint the picture.

819
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,840
She has one single cookie left out on her plate

820
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,720
by her little table on her right

821
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,480
and then she has a big glass of milk

822
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,960
and she's holding what looks like either a card sorting gun

823
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,360
or like a police radar gun to me,

824
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,360
but it is actually a turkey calling device.

825
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,240
And a big cat, she's got a big cat on her lap.

826
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,320
It's also like kind of like a Klingon phaser.

827
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,200
Yeah.

828
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,040
Like what a Klingon would use to,

829
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,960
what their phasers look like.

830
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,560
It's not, I'm just not used to seeing a kindly old grandma

831
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
holding anything weapon looking.

832
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,400
Yeah.

833
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,240
So this is shocking already.

834
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,040
I mean, this is already shocking and great

835
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,520
and I can see immediately why Jason picked it.

836
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,960
What an image.

837
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,800
What is this?

838
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,840
So turkey collar implies that it,

839
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,720
does it make a turkey sound?

840
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,080
Is it like a duck call?

841
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Well, it makes a infrared ride zapping sound

842
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,280
as all of these attractions do.

843
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,400
So you're saying that's not a real device.

844
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,160
That is a made up fictional device.

845
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,760
Yeah. A turkey collar, like a bird collar

846
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,920
is usually like a little,

847
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,280
looks almost like a kazoo or a whistle.

848
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,520
Yeah. They put it in your mouth.

849
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,640
And certainly, I don't think theme parks,

850
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,960
nowadays certainly not, but ever would want,

851
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,880
you know, to like get in a ride vehicle

852
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,000
and stick this whistle in your mouth.

853
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,560
Yeah. Like Toy Story, Minway Mania,

854
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,600
but instead of like pulling that string,

855
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,320
you have to like put a gun in your mouth and shoot or blow.

856
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,240
That's not as good, I think.

857
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,160
Doesn't work.

858
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,960
Can I, can I go, can you roll back real quick?

859
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,840
You said it's not Jamestown.

860
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,800
It is a fictional Autumn Falls.

861
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,640
Is that what you said?

862
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,960
Yeah. It's Autumn Falls.

863
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,200
Do you want to see a little footage?

864
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,040
Do you want me to play some?

865
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,800
Yeah, of course I'd like to see a little footage.

866
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,480
And I have to give both the Knights of White Satin,

867
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
thankfully preserved,

868
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,560
because Sally has a YouTube page

869
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,080
where they have a pretty good quality ride through of it.

870
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,520
And this is Holiday World a few years ago,

871
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,520
put up a POV ride through of Gobbler Getaway.

872
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,600
So let me bring up this video real quick.

873
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,600
The last Autumn Falls.

874
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,400
A UV vibe.

875
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,040
Turkey Town USA is the unofficial name.

876
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,320
Pretty calm so far.

877
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,520
Looks like the poo ride at Disneyland.

878
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,440
A lot like poo. Yeah.

879
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,720
Yeah, yeah.

880
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,960
Doors swing open.

881
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,200
That's so much like poo.

882
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,880
Oh.

883
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,240
A goofy guy with an apple barrel.

884
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,480
Like tricorner hats.

885
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,800
Yeah.

886
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,880
But not specific.

887
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,240
You got to get, it's not actually real what happened.

888
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,920
All right, you got to help them find these turkeys.

889
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,600
They're really good at hiding.

890
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,960
Okay, so we're going to shoot a gun at them.

891
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,120
Well, we're going to call them.

892
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,960
We're going to, I saltly refer to it as tagging the turkeys.

893
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,800
Okay.

894
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,560
So yeah.

895
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,400
We're not killing them now.

896
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,880
We're rounding them up to be killed soon.

897
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,240
Well, hold on to that.

898
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,720
Hold on to that thought.

899
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,120
Uh oh.

900
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,040
So there's a cheery horse here.

901
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
This is interesting.

902
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,600
Why this?

903
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,520
I thought this was going to be more historically accurate.

904
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,720
I'll be honest with you.

905
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,600
Even invoking Jamestown, I thought perhaps

906
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,760
a lot more like slaughter and people dying of diphtheria.

907
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,520
Yeah, exactly.

908
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,120
I guess that's where they had a lot of lost colony with pro a toa.

909
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,840
Yeah. So now you're in the tree.

910
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,760
You're in like a straightaway barn.

911
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,880
Love this art design.

912
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
That's a very appealing bright red.

913
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,720
Yeah.

914
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,400
I mean, just design wise, this is very good.

915
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,200
There's a woman with a wash.

916
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,640
She's got a big thing of wash to do.

917
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,120
Yeah, there's a lot of targets everywhere.

918
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,160
I'm just going to let it.

919
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,080
Yeah.

920
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,920
So now we're in like a shop area.

921
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
Very Roger Rabbit.

922
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,000
Where like mayhem is conveyed via like one big circle going around

923
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,120
your door, your heart, the guys struggling to hold your car.

924
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,800
Looks like it smacks the door open.

925
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,520
Mm hmm.

926
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,720
We're just talking about that with some I think I like it.

927
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,800
Yeah, I agree.

928
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
I am.

929
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,920
So.

930
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,280
All right, wait for it.

931
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,600
Happy Thanksgiving, it says.

932
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,760
Oh, there's an empty table.

933
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,280
They lift the tray.

934
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,880
There's no turkey there.

935
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah. And he's he screams happy pizza day.

936
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,760
And now the turkeys do a musical number.

937
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,840
Oh, my God, I like that.

938
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,760
They're all lined up as a big science is happy Thanksgiving.

939
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,800
For a turkey toad.

940
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,400
There's your scores, I think.

941
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
You know, the score levels.

942
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah, I'll bring up.

943
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,320
I have the picture of the score levels and, you know, I think

944
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,240
they're pretty forgiving.

945
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,880
I feel like they're pretty like giving of, you know.

946
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,440
That's still a little blurry, but.

947
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,840
It it they are.

948
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,080
So it's like one of those stakes.

949
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,600
Yeah, low scoring.

950
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,520
Gobbler wannabe.

951
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,960
Just another turkey beginner turkey

952
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,160
caller apprentice turkey caller master turkey caller.

953
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,880
OK, all right.

954
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,240
That's some historical accuracy that we're dealing with apprentices.

955
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,040
That's true. Yeah.

956
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,760
So there you go. That's close to the original.

957
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,560
Yeah, I really I'm not even sure why they had to invoke like old like Jamestown.

958
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,040
Like, I don't know.

959
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,240
Oh, yeah, there it is.

960
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,600
That's the the turkey toad.

961
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,400
The scores are like 200.

962
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,480
So this is like a low scoring game here.

963
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,840
I mean, I looked at there weren't that many turkeys around as far as I could see,

964
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,560
just looking at it once.

965
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,160
That's a complaint that I would have had watching that right through.

966
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,360
Yeah, I feel like I saw about seven turkeys in, you know, eight show scenes.

967
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,240
Yeah, it's like if you were going on Men in Black

968
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,080
and there was one tiny monster in every room.

969
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,240
Yeah, a lot of targets on like wooden beams or like bushes.

970
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,040
Yeah. Give me more turkeys.

971
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,880
Well, sure. I mean, obviously, yes, this is a budget conscious decision

972
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,120
because obviously, like you'd want a full they were going with the Mr.

973
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,400
Toad, the least the most like 75 percent of the first part of Mr.

974
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,520
Toad style or Winnie the Pooh, a lot of flats, a few animatronics here and there.

975
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,280
But obviously, cost was a factor.

976
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,840
So I suppose that probably influences the decision to have about 10 turkeys

977
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,680
and have the score reach no higher than 2000 points.

978
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,520
Yeah, I will give them credit, though, that like the the colors are

979
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,040
the day glow colors are very bright.

980
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,560
The black lights of it's very bright and the dark areas are very dark.

981
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,960
And like often both those effects can be difficult to achieve.

982
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,680
Yeah, it looks good in video for sure.

983
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,440
I like colors are appealing, as Scott was saying.

984
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,440
And I definitely like it.

985
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,800
And as a kid, I would have liked it.

986
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,640
There are still like I still am kind of conflicted about shooting rides in general.

987
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,720
I saw that they also are just making I don't know where it is.

988
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,240
They're making a Sesame Street ride that also has a shooting element.

989
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,320
And it doesn't isn't there one that exists already?

990
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,360
Like, did they make it in fact?

991
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,880
Maybe there's one in Spain, I think.

992
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,840
In Spain, maybe that's what I'm thinking of.

993
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,080
Maybe that actually is open already.

994
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,440
And I thought it was opening. Yeah, you're probably I think it isn't

995
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,600
because it was not English, the video I was watching.

996
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,840
So you're probably right.

997
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,280
It's a cookie. Is it cookies are shooting like cookies on Sesame Street?

998
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,480
Yeah. Or flashlights.

999
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Their concept art for the Five Nights at Freddy's is that you have a flashlight

1000
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,480
and you shine it to scare the animatronics away.

1001
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,280
Like Monsters Monsters Inc. in Tokyo is like that. Yeah.

1002
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,400
So, yeah. So I guess I guess what I'm saying is, as I talk this through,

1003
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,480
maybe I like it that there's not a ton of stuff to shoot

1004
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,120
because then you get to enjoy like the tinker and you get to enjoy.

1005
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,400
I don't know if there's a shoe cobbler in there, but I assume

1006
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,800
that's the type of business when we walked.

1007
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,040
We went through the end there right before the feast.

1008
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,120
Well, the work in these shooting rides can detract from just

1009
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,080
actually sitting and enjoying it.

1010
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,160
And I guess with what you want is a trip into the seventeen hundreds, then.

1011
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Who does want that? Yes.

1012
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,040
Oh, my gosh. Just to see

1013
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,560
the tinkerers at work, to see a traditional mercantile.

1014
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,720
All a bustle.

1015
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,040
Yeah. So so I mean, that's a great choice, Jason.

1016
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,920
Is that so? That's something.

1017
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,800
Yeah. Is that what's the closest to a Thanksgiving ride there even is

1018
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,680
before that we saw that?

1019
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,080
Like, do we even have one that comes close to being like that with pilgrims?

1020
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,360
Or I don't think so.

1021
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,040
Carousel of Progress hits like the other holidays, right?

1022
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,240
Like, it's right.

1023
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,440
Fourth of July at one time.

1024
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,720
Another time.

1025
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,560
It's Christmas at the end.

1026
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,160
Is it Halloween?

1027
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,120
I think at some point in one of them.

1028
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,360
Oh, yeah, they're dressing up.

1029
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,400
They're dressing up. Yeah.

1030
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,800
Oh, yeah, because the kid has the spooky little mask on.

1031
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,080
So so wow. OK.

1032
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,560
Not a very represented holiday.

1033
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,800
Is there anything else we'd like to see in a in a Thanksgiving holiday?

1034
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,120
I mean, like, you know, the I don't know the reason to do it,

1035
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,200
but is there some way that the turkey itself could be your weapon

1036
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,000
and that you have to like shove your hand up into?

1037
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,880
It's not just holding a little gun

1038
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,120
that you have to like manipulate an entire turkey and get your full,

1039
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,200
you know, get it to the waist deep.

1040
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,800
Mm hmm. That's a good. Yeah, I think they could definitely pull that.

1041
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,560
I mean, look, I think Sally's willing to work with any idea we have.

1042
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,720
That's the sense I get.

1043
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,120
So what you're saying is possibly probably possible with the budget

1044
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,360
and sell in just talking to Sally and hashing it out with budget.

1045
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,880
What's budget going to going to be? Yeah.

1046
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,720
Yeah. Key, as long as we have somewhere to put the door.

1047
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,480
Yeah, I would want I guess you don't really want historical accuracy

1048
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,400
for this period.

1049
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,000
So, I mean, maybe it's a new Thanksgiving ride.

1050
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,040
I mean, you do want it, but if you're trying to have fun,

1051
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,360
you don't want the horrors of the realities.

1052
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,040
But so a new Thanksgiving, like what's what's happening now at Thanksgiving,

1053
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,880
maybe like a some sort of a robot show

1054
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,640
with just like mom and dad trying to fix a turkey

1055
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,360
and singing Thanksgiving songs, maybe something like that.

1056
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,680
It's a quaint little show.

1057
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,160
If you were shrunk on a Thanksgiving table, that could be something.

1058
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,160
And then you're like, OK, that's going down like a gravy rapids.

1059
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,120
Like you end up in the little in the in the gravy boats

1060
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,800
or in the little like lake that you make with the mashed potatoes.

1061
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,120
All right. All right. Now you're yes.

1062
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,600
Now you got me. That's thinking, OK, gravy boat like it's Pirates of Caribbean.

1063
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,360
But the water is gravy and is legit gravy that you can drink.

1064
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,280
Oh, the ride is the gravy boat.

1065
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,040
Yes. Yes.

1066
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,640
There you go. Full gravy river.

1067
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,560
Yeah, full gravy river.

1068
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,360
And you can drink it.

1069
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,080
You get a little cup before and you get to scoop the gravy out

1070
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,920
while you while you while you ride down on the boat.

1071
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,240
Go ahead. Dig in.

1072
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,800
Put that way. You got a ladle for a reason.

1073
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,080
Maybe there's some very tedious message about like,

1074
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,480
it's like, well, you know, there's the family you're born with

1075
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,840
and the family you choose.

1076
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,440
Like it's laid on really thick about like orphan Thanksgiving and like,

1077
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,960
oh, it's the family you choose, you know, and

1078
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,760
and everyone, you know, the table looks like shit.

1079
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,840
Everyone messed up. Everyone brought the lights.

1080
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,280
There's no turkey.

1081
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,280
Yeah. And you have to go like you have to go up on the mashed potatoes

1082
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,320
and you kind of circle the drain like there's some sort of a circuit

1083
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,440
like you're kind of going in a loop down as you kind of go into the mashed potatoes.

1084
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,360
And then Dad takes a big spoon and we have to go down.

1085
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,200
Dad's body and inside his body.

1086
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,160
Oh, yeah.

1087
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,000
But then he has indigestion and throws you back up.

1088
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,120
Yes. So we go to be stuck going the other way or just like

1089
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,040
or just like becoming part of Dad.

1090
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,600
Yeah, you're going to be you are in cells now.

1091
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,920
So you go down a splash mountain style esophagus

1092
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,280
into Dad's stomach acid and it's choppy.

1093
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,840
It's choppy. And don't drink that.

1094
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,400
Now you have your ladle in your cup, but do not drink the water in Dad's stomach.

1095
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,080
It's highly important.

1096
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,040
They tell you all this in the pre-ride video.

1097
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,320
So I hope you're paying attention.

1098
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,400
It's a lot of bourbon in there, too. So.

1099
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,400
Yes. You got to watch out for your like

1100
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,040
aunt who talks too much.

1101
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,320
It's like she's just on a tear of like, I'm surprised

1102
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,960
they even give the kids Thanksgiving off anymore.

1103
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,760
I'm sure they'd like to get rid of this holiday, too.

1104
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,280
Like they got rid of Columbus.

1105
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,400
Your aunt is also Paul Linde.

1106
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,800
Like they got they canceled Columbus.

1107
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,480
So upset.

1108
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,440
So, yeah. So then, yeah, you go in the toilet.

1109
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,760
You're thrown up in the toilet.

1110
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,200
And then I guess you another yet another splash mountain down through a toilet.

1111
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,200
Again, don't drink.

1112
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,640
Don't drink that water either.

1113
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,120
It's not gravy. It's not gravy.

1114
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,880
Well, she's got she's got thoughts on splash mountain, too, for sure.

1115
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,320
Oh, no.

1116
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,840
Yeah, watch out.

1117
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,080
Turn quick turn.

1118
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,960
Don't go that go the other way.

1119
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,760
So you learn that it's better to be in the sewer for Thanksgiving

1120
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,920
than listening to your aunt and her opinions.

1121
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,520
Yeah, so that's what you learn from the ride.

1122
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,200
Purposeful holiday loneliness. Right.

1123
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,480
Quick, sit on the couch with your teenage cousin and their boyfriend

1124
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,800
who are just looking at their phones and not making eye contact with anyone.

1125
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,360
So it's a scary ride, I guess, is what we determine.

1126
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,080
The real horrors.

1127
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,280
Yeah, it's a haunted mansion.

1128
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,200
It's much scarier than Haunted Mansion.

1129
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,000
It could be.

1130
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,240
Or and it could you could do a shooter with it.

1131
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,360
And it's more wholesome.

1132
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,640
Like you have a can of whipped cream and you're trying to.

1133
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,440
You're trying to whip cream everyone's pie slices like.

1134
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,680
Oh, well, that's cute.

1135
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,480
Yeah. You should come up with a bunch of different sketches for that

1136
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,080
and just send it into Sally Unsolicited to see if they would just kind of take you

1137
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,440
on to come up with different Thanksgiving themed ideas.

1138
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,120
Are you talking about comedy sketches

1139
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,520
or like the scrawlings of a madman with no artistic drawing talent?

1140
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,320
Scrawlings of a madman, I think. Oh, OK.

1141
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,480
I prefer you to send in just Unsolicited to Sally.

1142
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,720
I think a crumbled pile of odd Thanksgiving.

1143
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,800
Like self taking pictures of yourself, like at the table with a pie

1144
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,680
and pointing to things and like a makeshift gun that you've made up.

1145
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,880
It's like all pieced together in a sloppy way and it's impossible to follow.

1146
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,360
Someone.

1147
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,520
But where did where did a 36 year old man find construction paper?

1148
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,040
Hobby Lobby.

1149
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,040
Yeah, his favorite store, his favorite store and company.

1150
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,440
Hold on a second.

1151
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,000
Oh, your aunt, excuse me, your aunt's favorite store.

1152
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,680
She brought us all cuneiform.

1153
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,880
She brought us all like stone tablets for Christmas. Sure.

1154
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,320
All right. Well, there's a lot of Thanksgiving.

1155
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,880
I think Holiday World, I don't know much about this holiday world,

1156
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,200
but I think they could build a full Thanksgiving Springs, you could call it.

1157
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,120
And there's infinite ideas and Sally Dark Rides should be doing them.

1158
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,720
Yeah. All right. I'm up next here.

1159
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,240
I've mentioned this on the show before.

1160
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,360
A place that I got to go as a kid once in a while, even up through

1161
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,720
I want to say for junior high or high school and Chuck E.

1162
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,160
Cheese we had around the corner.

1163
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,000
We didn't go a lot, but it was always there. We drove by it.

1164
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,880
There was one place that existed in Lombard, Illinois,

1165
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,160
that was a real special occasion that we would go to.

1166
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,000
And it was called Enchanted Castle.

1167
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,440
OK. And like Enchanted, if I really search my feelings, I have obviously

1168
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,720
I love Chuck E.

1169
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,000
Cheese and all those characters, but I was most excited to go to Enchanted Castle.

1170
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,680
It was like I would turn into Cartman and the Casa Bonita episode.

1171
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,360
Like, that's how cool Enchanted Castle was.

1172
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,200
And Enchanted Castle had more arcade games.

1173
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,440
It had like go kart rides.

1174
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,680
It had laser tag.

1175
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,280
And what I forgot up until I was doing the research,

1176
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:06,160
their own animatronic show and their own characters.

1177
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,200
And Sally made this like thing that looms large.

1178
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,400
Yeah. Wow. Yes. Company.

1179
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,960
And certainly in my teen years, when I was going to Enchanted Castle,

1180
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,320
I did not see the show.

1181
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,360
But when I was younger and they had like, you know, it's the same

1182
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,440
thing as Chuck E.

1183
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,520
Cheese, a pizza party for a birthday.

1184
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,800
I absolutely saw this.

1185
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,960
Now, it's different on the website than it is from the videos I was looking up.

1186
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,760
And I'll show you here what they have on the Sally website.

1187
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,080
They call these characters.

1188
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,840
Gwen and the Magical Music Makers.

1189
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,160
Oh, this group. Oh, my.

1190
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,080
And I love them.

1191
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,840
It's like, I guess, like Gwenevere.

1192
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,640
She's like a blonde lady with a crown.

1193
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,400
And these are dragons.

1194
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,200
These are four dragons.

1195
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,120
One is at a piano.

1196
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,480
One is a trumpet.

1197
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,680
One is at like a little drum thing.

1198
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,240
And then the guy in the back has got like a little mandolin.

1199
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,040
And he's close to like a mule, like a few of them have kind of like

1200
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,280
all shucks teeth, like Mater or Goofy.

1201
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,760
Exactly. Yes.

1202
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,040
So so they're I'm pretty sure they're all dragons.

1203
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,360
But yes, they don't necessarily look like scary dragons or whatever.

1204
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,360
So what I think has happened and I there's no believe it or not,

1205
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,360
there's no oral history on what's happened to Gwen and the Magical Music Makers.

1206
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,440
But I believe they are now called the Jammin' Jesters.

1207
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,760
And there's no video I can find of the original show,

1208
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:44,120
but you can find video of the newer version of the show,

1209
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,440
which is what I have here.

1210
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,240
And I'm like, my memory is sort of to the like left,

1211
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,360
very left side of this enchanted castle is where you would go into this big pizza room

1212
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,760
and you would eat and watch a show.

1213
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,320
So this is these I wish I had the original videos of what they were.

1214
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,520
But those don't appear to be well preserved.

1215
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,520
This is amazing, by the way.

1216
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,720
This is like how like we maybe commented before,

1217
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,640
how like every TV show ever has had their version of Chuck E.

1218
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,880
Cheese and often they aren't accurate.

1219
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,360
They don't feel like true to me.

1220
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,880
They don't. And like you so rarely see a non Chuck E.

1221
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:29,720
Cheese animatronic band at a pizza place with kind of a thin theme.

1222
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,200
And this is just it.

1223
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,240
Like a little a Renaissance dragon and princess band.

1224
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,600
This is this is straight out of this would have been on a TGIF show

1225
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,800
or on Tiny Tunes or something.

1226
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,760
This is like I'm amazed this exists.

1227
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,040
Yes. And I'm amazed that even when I talked about Enchanted Castle

1228
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,640
last time on the show, it actually didn't bring back the memory

1229
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,960
of the full animatronic show, because I guess the so many of the time

1230
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,880
the last times I had gone, which has been over 20 years at this point.

1231
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,880
And it's still, by the way, Enchanted Castle still there.

1232
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,040
This is still he still exists.

1233
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,360
So I think these are still these shows are still going

1234
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,800
as the jam and jesters. But yeah, it's wild.

1235
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,760
So there's two videos I have of two separate shows.

1236
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,880
I don't know which one is like the birthday show and which one's a general show.

1237
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,160
But here, I'll give you a taste a little bit of what like

1238
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,440
what the starting out song is.

1239
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,960
And.

1240
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,640
Can you make heads or tails of these allegations?

1241
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,560
It's I think it's well, I know one of the because it was their tagline

1242
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,480
Enchanted Castle, king size fun for everyone.

1243
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,640
Yes. What they would say on the on the commercial.

1244
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,560
So I think it's some variation on that.

1245
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,080
So at this point, yeah,

1246
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,920
it opens up and you get to see like now newish versions.

1247
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,040
Now, when Guinevere is like in the back

1248
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,120
and there's a tiny dragon sort of on a little podium in front.

1249
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,400
And there's the addition of some characters on the side here, like

1250
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,480
you'll meet him. His name is Wally Wizard.

1251
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,560
Welcome to the Enchanted Castle, where there's king sized fun for everyone.

1252
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,280
And why was the finest restaurant

1253
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,320
and the finest restaurants are usually French?

1254
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,000
So Wally has just said that the finest restaurants are usually French.

1255
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,560
He's letting a bunch of eight year olds know

1256
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,560
that all this American cuisine is garbage.

1257
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,560
It's bullshit.

1258
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,440
Yeah, the way we all we all still agree that French food is the best.

1259
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,000
Exactly. No matter what.

1260
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,440
That is Wally's philosophy.

1261
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,440
So here we go.

1262
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,560
Bonjour, I am your

1263
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,080
mate, Wally the Wizard.

1264
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,120
It is with the greatest pride and the deepest pleasure

1265
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,800
we welcome you tonight.

1266
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,840
Now we invite you to relax.

1267
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,320
You just pull up a chair as the castle proudly presents your.

1268
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,560
Wait, hold on a sec.

1269
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,480
Yes. Yes, Jason, you have any questions?

1270
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:32,800
Um, that, I don't know, just that delivery and vibe seemed very familiar.

1271
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,840
OK, all right. Well, hold on. Let me play a little more in case.

1272
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,160
I think this is I don't know what you're thinking,

1273
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,120
but let me see if you're on the same page.

1274
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,400
OK, were you thinking Wally was going to sing be our guest?

1275
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,200
Um, I I had some money on it.

1276
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,320
Yeah, yeah, OK.

1277
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,480
That was a pretty safe bet. Yeah.

1278
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,080
OK, yeah. So Wally performs be our guests.

1279
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:09,200
A wizard with a silent big dopey dragon named Toby.

1280
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,960
Name Toby. Yes.

1281
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,560
So they do. So they do that.

1282
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,960
And that's strange. That's certainly strange.

1283
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,320
And I don't know rock band.

1284
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,600
This isn't a rock song. Right.

1285
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,760
So OK, so music choices I find interesting on this in the other video.

1286
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,480
And this is going to be a little bit imprecise when I when I started.

1287
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,760
But we'll go get there.

1288
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,880
So basically, this little dragon's name is cute.

1289
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,160
See you. T.E.

1290
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,040
And some of the dragons do a little routine.

1291
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,480
Oh, this dragon looks like Robbie from dinosaurs.

1292
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,200
Does he not? A little bit.

1293
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,240
He does. And the bay and cute looks like baby dinosaur.

1294
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,400
Yes, very similar.

1295
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,520
So they do a little like who's on first routine of like

1296
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,960
cute. She's cute.

1297
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,240
Yeah, she sure is.

1298
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,240
But what's her name?

1299
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,320
Like they do a whole thing like that, which, again, no child.

1300
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,640
I didn't enjoy that routine as a child.

1301
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,440
I don't know who keeps making this bit go on and on.

1302
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,400
Maybe an Animaniacs.

1303
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,440
I kind of liked it. I liked that. Yeah.

1304
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,680
Now you might say, oh, was that was a great segue, Mike.

1305
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,800
That was a good example.

1306
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,800
But Animaniacs is going to come into play right now, I think.

1307
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,800
I can't help it.

1308
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,920
But what can I do when you're cute?

1309
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,200
Get your show.

1310
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,560
With these two dollars, I'm the only cute girl.

1311
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,080
No, no, no, no.

1312
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,920
So cute is performing the Animaniacs song that Dot sings

1313
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,040
called I'm Cute.

1314
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,440
I don't know. I don't remember this song.

1315
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,640
This song. I remember this song pretty well.

1316
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,920
And I was like, oh, is that like an old song, old time song?

1317
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,080
No, it's an Animaniacs song.

1318
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,480
So this show is has Animaniacs and Beauty and the Beast so far.

1319
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,600
Now stealing everything, stealing everything.

1320
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,000
Now, let me let me go to this other video real quick.

1321
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,200
OK, so we so far we know that this show has Beauty and the Beast.

1322
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,600
It has Animaniacs.

1323
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,680
What do you think might come next?

1324
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,280
Does anybody I mean, it's impossible to guess, but so I'll just play it here.

1325
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,640
The full end of Abbey Road.

1326
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,280
Now, this is a video that's very close to the robot,

1327
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,720
so you can hear every whirring gear and every head turn,

1328
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,080
and it's really distracting.

1329
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,520
Yeah, they're an inch away.

1330
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
They're an inch away.

1331
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:37,000
This video. But OK, let me keep playing just in case you don't know the song yet.

1332
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,600
This video.

1333
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,760
But OK, let me keep playing just in case you don't know the song yet.

1334

Join us.

1335
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,760

1340

Join us.

1341
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,760
I don't know what this is.

1342
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,760
I feel the first second.

1343
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,760
We're getting to a chorus here.

1344
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,760
We got magic to do just for you.

1345
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,760
We got me with the place to play.

1346
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,760
We got hearts to the farm.

1347
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,760
Hearts to warm.

1348
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,760
Here's a feast to tip my storm.

1349
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,760
So other than this video being terrifying, this song is Magic to Do from the Stephen

1350
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,760
Schwartz musical Pippin.

1351
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:41,760
Right.

1352
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:48,760
We're kids love Pippin in the year whatever 2020 whatever this video is from to do.

1353
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,760
Kids love Pippin.

1354
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,760
This is second Stephen Schwartz Pippin reference in one second game month.

1355
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
Exactly.

1356
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,760
Yes.

1357
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,760
So there Magic to Do in this video, which again is so creepy.

1358
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:06,760
You can see like Guinevere's like her mouth is falling off as she does like she sings.

1359
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,760
She is awful.

1360
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,760
She's playing it like a like a piano type or an organ.

1361
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,760
You get some more up close personal time with the robots, which I do like.

1362
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,760
It's weird.

1363
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:22,760
They just shove this big dragon out the door of the cave and he's just on the carpet of the restaurant.

1364
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,760
Yes.

1365
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,760
He's not elevated.

1366
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,760
None of them are.

1367
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,760
They're all on the carpet.

1368
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,760
It's like a fucking house show.

1369
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,760
It's like a punk band playing house show.

1370
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,760
Toby also barely clears that curtain.

1371
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,760
Like the curtain is still kind of on him in both videos.

1372
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:47,760
So yeah, you get close ups of cute and she does a little song that's not very good that I don't think is I think might be an original song.

1373
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:55,760
Speaking of who's on first routines and cute, I guess it's time to ask the question is cute cute.

1374
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,760
The answer is yes.

1375
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,760
Cute is cute.

1376
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,760
Yeah, I think he is cute.

1377
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
I guess so.

1378
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,760
I'm not creeped out by it.

1379
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,760
I've seen worse.

1380
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,760
Believe me, I've seen worse.

1381
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,760
Do you want cute to talk a little more up in front in the video here?

1382
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,760
And let's see.

1383
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,760
We can really judge it here.

1384
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,760
Yeah.

1385
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,760
Yeah.

1386
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,760
It's my pleasure to introduce our newest and youngest center here.

1387
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Just a little bit of a thing.

1388
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,760
She is ladies and gentlemen.

1389
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,760
May I have a large round of applause for the wee little dragon.

1390
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,760
Cute.

1391
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,760
Cute.

1392
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,760
Wait a minute.

1393
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,760
I'm not that small.

1394
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,760
You're pretty small, cute.

1395
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,760
I'm big enough.

1396
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,760
Look, I wouldn't buy a plush of it.

1397
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,760
I wouldn't sleep with cute, but I don't hate cute.

1398
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,760
So that's something for me.

1399
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,760
That's pretty good.

1400
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,760
Yeah.

1401
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,760
All right.

1402
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,760
Cute is cute.

1403
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,760
Fine.

1404
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,760
Cute is cute.

1405
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,760
And now, yeah, there's some more songs in this.

1406
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,760
Later, Guinevere does.

1407
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,760
There's no business like show business.

1408
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,760
Oh, great.

1409
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
For some reason.

1410
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,760
Things kids love.

1411
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Kids love this.

1412
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,760
And so let me play this.

1413
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,760
There's another song.

1414
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,760
Not sure if you'll.

1415
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,760
Well, cute, that's how I got started, you know.

1416
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,760
How extraordinary.

1417
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:09,760
Hats in the room and pigeon in the hay.

1418
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,760
Is not my idea of a perfect day.

1419
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:19,760
When you're extraordinary, you gotta do extraordinary things.

1420
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,760
Do you guys know that song?

1421
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,760
No.

1422
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,760
That is that's from a musical, too.

1423
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,760
I just can't think of it, right?

1424
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,760
It is from musical.

1425
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:34,760
The musical is Pippin.

1426
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:43,760
The the dragons who are names jesters and who have the word jammin in their name,

1427
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,760
like a rock band would do, who play multiple songs from Pippin.

1428
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,760
Pippin.

1429
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:53,760
This is a very Pippin heavy show and in a chan.

1430
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,760
A channing castle jammin Pippin dragons.

1431
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,760
Got it.

1432
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,760
Yeah.

1433
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,760
So I don't I wish I knew what songs they played when I was little.

1434
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,760
It could have been Pippin.

1435
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,760
It could have not been.

1436
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,760
There's no way this has changed since you were.

1437
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,760
Well, I guess there's been a general change into the jammin jesters.

1438
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,760
Right.

1439
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,760
You never saw you've never seen the jammin jesters in person.

1440
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,760
I don't think so.

1441
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,760
I would have to really go and find like an enchanted castle person that knew the

1442
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,760
history to know when that changeover happened.

1443
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,760
But maybe that maybe the old band did maybe going in the magical music

1444
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
makers did all Pippin songs.

1445
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,760
We don't know.

1446
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,760
So maybe that didn't like that.

1447
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,760
That didn't change.

1448
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,760
But don't see why they wouldn't.

1449
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,760
They will be more likely to have.

1450
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,760
So I love here.

1451
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,760
I'm more of a show.

1452
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,760
When I'm going to show going real quick playing the song and I want to watch

1453
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,760
everyone just focus on how unnerving it is to watch the robot sing.

1454
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,760
The company.

1455
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,760
There's no business.

1456
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,760
I know.

1457
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:07,760
This looks exactly like the sex dolls in the British documentary.

1458
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,760
I see.

1459
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,760
You she's got like a zombie like there.

1460
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,760
She's got weird like like flushing threads.

1461
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,760
You got Joker scars.

1462
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
Yes.

1463
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,760
Yes.

1464
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
You got Joker.

1465
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,760
Yeah.

1466
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,760
Oh my God.

1467
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,760
So this is great.

1468
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,760
Now for our grand finale.

1469
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,760
A reprise of magic to do.

1470
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,760
Hit it.

1471
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,760
So here's a bunch of characters that I have gotten reacquainted with from my

1472
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,760
childhood.

1473
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,760
Thank you.

1474
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,760
Sally Dark Ride.

1475
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,760
Sally Corporation for this.

1476
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,760
Next time I do I have to go back to Enchanted Castle.

1477
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:52,760
I have to see what show what Pippin songs they're doing this month in 2021.

1478
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,760
I got to go to Lombard.

1479
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,760
If anyone's around there and you got to go check out and see how many Pippin

1480
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,760
songs they're still performing.

1481
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,760
Please let us know.

1482
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Calling all Lombarders.

1483
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,760
Go get a camera way up in Gwen's face at the Jammin' Jester's show.

1484
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,760
Yeah.

1485
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,760
They might.

1486
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,760
I mean maybe that was done by an employee.

1487
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,760
I would maybe not recommend getting that close to the robots but maybe they don't

1488
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,760
care.

1489
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,760
That was an upsetting video.

1490
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,760
It is.

1491
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:21,760
Yeah I don't know that the security is so tight at Enchanted Castle.

1492
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,760
I don't think kids go there anymore.

1493
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:28,760
I think they like I think they've pivoted into they've made the pivot that Sally

1494
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,760
has contemplated doing.

1495
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:35,760
This is entirely like looky-loos who have dirty thoughts about Gwen.

1496
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:43,760
It's possible that the whole animatronic market is now just for older creeps.

1497
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,760
It's possible.

1498
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,760
I hope it's not.

1499
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,760
Go where the money is.

1500
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,760
I hope little kids still like animatronics.

1501
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,760
Oof.

1502
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,760
Well, wow.

1503
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Frightening childhood memories unlocked.

1504
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:59,760
And if you thought we were out of the woods in terms of frightening humanoids you thought

1505
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,760
wrong.

1506
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:08,760
I don't think anyone thought that but we're diving even further in with a ride called

1507
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,760
Vipa Salt Kraken.

1508
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:11,760
Oh.

1509
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,760
Vipa Salt Kraken.

1510
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,760
I gravitated to on the Sally website just on name alone.

1511
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,760
I'm like oh this could be fun to just pick and I don't know what it is.

1512
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,760
I don't even know the language offhand.

1513
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,760
Now I know that this is Swedish.

1514
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,760
This is a ride in Sweden.

1515
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,760
Right off the bat.

1516
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,760
I'm just going to say this might be the weirdest ride I've ever run into.

1517
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,760
I saw a little bit.

1518
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:42,760
I saw a little bit of it and like I it was so immediately interesting that I dove into

1519
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,760
it just out of force of like oh my god oh my god.

1520
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,760
You can't not.

1521
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,760
And then like halfway through it I was like oh shit this is was this what Scott picked?

1522
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,760
It has to be like this is the most interesting thing I've ever read.

1523
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,760
And then I looked back and I went oh shit Scott picked it.

1524
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,760
Alright I'm done I'm done I'm done.

1525
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,760
Well you know you needn't have done that.

1526
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,760
It doesn't have to be a surprise.

1527
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,760
But I'm glad.

1528
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,760
I hope it will be in Canby for Jason and for the audience.

1529
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,760
Because boy this is this is something.

1530
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,760
Vipa Salt Kraken.

1531
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:19,760
This is okay so first of all this is at a park in Vimrby Sweden.

1532
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,760
A park called Astrid Lindgren's World.

1533
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,760
Who is Astrid Lindgren you ask?

1534
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,760
Well Astrid Lindgren is the author behind the tales of Pippi Longstocking.

1535
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,760
So this is a whole park devoted to Pippi Longstocking and similar byproducts.

1536
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:44,760
Now here's where I'm confused because we did a whole month where the point was to find weird European parks.

1537
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,760
And nobody came across Astrid Lindgren's World and Vipa Salt Kraken.

1538
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,760
I don't know how we missed it.

1539
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:51,760
This is shocking.

1540
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,760
Yes this was shocking to me.

1541
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,760
An author has an entire theme park basically.

1542
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,760
One author's properties are in a theme park.

1543
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,760
Who has you know like a little bit of media.

1544
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:11,760
There's many strange upsetting Pippi Longstocking movies and shows out there.

1545
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,760
Do you remember that from oh go ahead Jason.

1546
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,760
Oh I was going to say Pippi Longstocking when I was growing I always thought of it like Anne of Green Gables.

1547
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,760
Like there's a lot of adaptations of this.

1548
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,760
I don't really know the original source material.

1549
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,760
I know I believe they're from other.

1550
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,760
I think Anne of Green Gables is Canadian.

1551
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,760
Is that right?

1552
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,760
I think so yeah.

1553
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,760
Yeah.

1554
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,760
Yeah that's I think the vibe of the ride that we're going to talk about.

1555
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,760
I just in general like Pippi Longstocking I just remember being a rant.

1556
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:49,760
Do you remember just when we were kids how if you would like put on a channel that was for kids movies

1557
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,760
or you'd go to the kids video section at the library and there weren't as many things back then.

1558
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,760
Now there's just like there's such a massive oversaturated kids market.

1559
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,760
But when we were kids it was still kind of the creepy 80s.

1560
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:08,760
So Robert Altman Popeye counts as a kids movie.

1561
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,760
Right.

1562
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,760
And Pippi Longstocking is there for kids.

1563
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:16,760
And like I just remember any time diving in it like because it was one of the 10 movies you had to.

1564
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,760
And I was just always like what's wrong with this.

1565
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,760
Pippi Longstocking is weird and I don't remember why.

1566
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,760
Probably a audience remind me what is up with Pippi Longstocking.

1567
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,760
Put a scary video in my feed.

1568
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,760
Unless I'm wrong.

1569
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,760
Am I I just remember always being like this is scary.

1570
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,760
What is it?

1571
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:40,760
I hear I have a guess because I always as a kid associated Pippi Longstocking even though this isn't correct.

1572
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,760
She was a little girl.

1573
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,760
I always associated her with Raggedy Anne and Raggedy Andy.

1574
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,760
Because they all fell in the similar genre to me in my kid mind.

1575
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,760
Big bright freckles and pigtails.

1576
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,760
And we've established that I don't like this for adults to dress up.

1577
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:02,760
Which is so I could not go to this park because it is adults playing Pippi Longstocking and live shows.

1578
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,760
I mean it seems this does not seem like some demented park to me.

1579
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,760
It seems very charming.

1580
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:17,760
I would say not even nearly as scary and seedy as Popeye Village in Malta seems to be.

1581
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,760
As much as I'm dying to go there I would really like to.

1582
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,760
But yeah it is strange.

1583
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,760
It's all devoted to the kind of like pleasant if scary to me works of this author.

1584
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,760
And this ride.

1585
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,760
I don't think there's a lot of like dark rides here.

1586
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,760
So this is sort of a I don't know it's an outlier.

1587
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:45,760
And Vipassaltkraken is a translation if he translates to English that is we on Salt Crow Island.

1588
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,760
Yes.

1589
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,760
Oh.

1590
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
Salt Crow.

1591
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,760
Which is that does that mean seagull?

1592
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,760
Is that what it is?

1593
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,760
What's a Salt Crow?

1594
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,760
I have no idea but this is a very popular show or book series.

1595
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,760
It is very popular in Sweden.

1596
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:10,760
Do you know about this already for some reason or you just from from your perusing of this stuff?

1597
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:19,760
No no I just I looked up like just to make sure I looked up the name of your thing just to make sure.

1598
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,760
But I didn't go as deep as Mike.

1599
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,760
I just saw like a beloved Swedish story.

1600
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:33,760
That's what I yeah I like I was like would people know this for some reason because apparently this is a hugely popular show from the 60s in Sweden.

1601
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,760
One season was made.

1602
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,760
One season 13 episodes.

1603
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:46,760
In 1964 I believe and there were like four TV movies after it and this ride was made in 2007.

1604
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:54,760
That's how popular like what one season television show dead let's say Deadly Games on UPN.

1605
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:03,760
Say that was being like every year you just gather the family around and you watch Sebastian Jackle with the family around Christmas time.

1606
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:09,760
And then 50 years later they were like you know what it's time to make a dark ride.

1607
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,760
Sally Dark Rides made a Deadly Games dark ride.

1608
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,760
That's like I think they would and they will.

1609
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,760
I think we're going to be part eventually we're going to be part of proliferating the myth of Sebastian Jackle and it's going to get made.

1610
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,760
So that's the ride we get from them.

1611
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,760
That's how like popular a one season show is in Sweden.

1612
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,760
I know in Europe they don't like one season doesn't mean a failure necessarily.

1613
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:38,760
That's out of you know it's not necessarily a failure if you do one season in Europe.

1614
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:46,760
Well and I think they also cut this into like a movie basically or a limited run series like it's been repackaged in various other ways.

1615
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:59,760
What could be so popular that it's like that a ride of it is made a very realistic accurate ride where all the actors look exactly right.

1616
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,760
That this is made over 40 years after the event.

1617
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:07,760
What are the events of this transformative beloved Swedish show?

1618
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,760
Let me read the IMDB synopsis.

1619
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,760
I have a guess and I want to see it.

1620
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,760
Go ahead.

1621
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,760
I want to see it.

1622
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,760
Go ahead.

1623
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,760
I was like I want to see if I'm right.

1624
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,760
Well either you're going to be right on or we're way off because you're way off.

1625
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,760
Well yeah.

1626
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,760
All right.

1627
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,760
What is it?

1628
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,760
The Melkerson family decides to leave the city for the summer to rent a house in the Stockholm archipelago.

1629
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:36,760
They come to enjoy the simple life there and all adventures that come their way together with the resident family the Granck Vists.

1630
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:44,760
So I say that maybe you were right because like if you guessed a pleasant time on Salt Crow Island then that was correct.

1631
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,760
But did you have another guess?

1632
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:58,760
No it was going to be about like kids maybe a full family experiencing the simple life in some sort of countryside like that that sort of little house on a prairie.

1633
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:03,760
I don't quite know what time period is this like modern times that takes place in.

1634
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,760
I'm not even sure.

1635
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:14,760
I think it might be modern times but they go to Salt Crow Island where it is not like modern times where it's the you were like slower.

1636
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,760
Modern times in 1964.

1637
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,760
Yeah.

1638
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:24,760
So it's the 40 it's it's 60s nostalgia for the 1910s.

1639
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:39,760
The vibe of it is very this is where it might be good to just start to look at the the animatronics or what have you because the vibe of it is very like I mean it's very von Trapp.

1640
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:46,760
It's very Brady's I guess.

1641
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,760
Walton's like to me whether that's right or not.

1642
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,760
Yeah I think Jason's right on with Little House.

1643
01:17:52,760 --> 01:18:06,760
That's what Aaron said like yeah this seems like if like something is low stakes as Little House on the Prairie and just like it's a night it's about a family that supports each other in a simple time and they then love gets them through.

1644
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:24,760
And this it's all so strange to make because in America rides are made out of Indiana Jones and Star Wars like movies with a lot of action and stakes and I guess in Sweden people are just dying to go have a pleasant time on Salt Crow Island.

1645
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:53,760
So you know you're right you get in a vehicle it's like I'm just a pretty generic kind of like a you know a little machine that takes you around just like a two you know it's I guess it's sort of like the Pinocchio or Snow White but not themed it's just a car and forgive me for just I'm just going to sort of step through this you know when VO is interesting I'll play it when not I'll just show you captions and read them but you can.

1646
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:16,760
You can do narration in Swedish and in English you can choose and Sally has provided the English narration the conceit of the show and of the ride is that an older woman is narrating from the future so from the 80s I guess about her time with her family on Salt Crow Island.

1647
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:26,760
I wonder what God was thinking when he created this island.

1648
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:34,760
I guess he thought I want rough great cliffs green trees, oaks, birches and meadows of flowers.

1649
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:48,760
I wonder what a what a heady statement to then have a nice answer like you can imagine in a very different film or show I wonder what God was thinking when he created this island.

1650
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,760
Like Dr. Moreau or Jurassic World.

1651
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:59,760
I bet it was nice his thoughts were nice.

1652
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:19,760
This is a big big difference from what I think of like modern Swedish pop culture exports is just like the bleakest like crime like I might be a different country but like the snowman like I'm not sure who made the snowman yeah yeah.

1653
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:30,760
I mean I would be right of that but I don't want anything from the movie in it I just want like it's me the snowman come with me I'll give you all the clues.

1654
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:42,760
Yes it's up in the air whether author Joe Nesbo has authorized Detective Harry Hole for licensing purposes but I'd love to see it.

1655
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:47,760
I refuse to say how late it can't be it's always Harry Hole to me.

1656
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,760
What?

1657
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,760
Detective Harry Hole.

1658
01:20:51,760 --> 01:21:04,760
So, in a pretty cool effect the woman morphs from older to younger. She's like looking at a photo album of sea wait but she said sea crow.

1659
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,760
It's sea crow or I don't know look it's salt cracking that's what I know.

1660
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,760
I'll let's let's just see where this goes.

1661
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:23,760
Yes, because I want the whole island to flow with pink thorn roses and white hawthorn in big drifts on that day in June when Marlin Melkishon arrives there.

1662
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,760
Next bridge is Sandflågan.

1663
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,760
Next stop, Sea Crow Island.

1664
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:33,760
Do you know what I think? When we get there, we'll sit on the top of the tower and we'll sit in the sun.

1665
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:40,760
So here's a let's pause on this frame so you can see these guys and the subtitle translation will eat dinner in the garden.

1666
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:50,760
This is the equivalent of you round the corner you've seen Mara you whip around oh my god there's Indiana Jones and he's shutting the portals of hell for us.

1667
01:21:50,760 --> 01:22:03,760
The equivalent here is a multi-generational family in the in the front of a boat looking at an island and thinking about what dinner they're going to have.

1668
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:11,760
Yes, and the dad looks like George's boss in the play now and this late season Seinfeld.

1669
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,760
I can't think of the character's name.

1670
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,760
Oh, that guy. Yes. Yeah, not Mr. Wilhelm.

1671
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,760
No, I know who you mean.

1672
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,760
The guy who doesn't care about anything.

1673
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,760
Yeah, yeah.

1674
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:29,760
And the family, I mean, it's sort of, they don't all have blonde hair, but a lot of them do.

1675
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:45,760
There's a similar vibe to a lot of them and when all of the characters, while I find these characters less creepy than other Sally humanoids, they also are all kind of squinting in an unsettling manner.

1676
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:52,760
It's just like really narrow eyes and if they are feeling joy it's hard to tell because they're just a little cross.

1677
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,760
It's like as much joy as you could have back then when you work hard.

1678
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:05,760
And they, I don't know, this kind of like, especially the kid is kind of like a children of the corn sort of deal.

1679
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,760
Oh yeah.

1680
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,760
I'll keep playing. I'll read the volume a little.

1681
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,760
What if it rains?

1682
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:19,760
The sun always shines on Seekro Island.

1683
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:25,760
And the dog is a Bozman.

1684
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,760
Our house is called Carpenter's Cottage.

1685
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,760
It's what they call a nice old weekend cottage.

1686
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,760
And then the people on the ride, the real people, look exactly like the characters in the show.

1687
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,760
The robots were dressed up and put on an actual ride vehicle.

1688
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,760
I mean I can see why it resonates with this audience.

1689
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:54,760
But then, and truly like, if you look up a picture of Vipassol cracking the joe and then the ride, it is exceedingly accurate.

1690
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,760
I mean this is like being in a slightly animated wax museum.

1691
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,760
It's pretty amazing.

1692
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:07,760
They also like, now that you start getting into like gadgets and you know, wicker chairs and here's an old stove.

1693
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,760
And at this point you start feeling, well, it's very carousel of progress, isn't it?

1694
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:20,760
It's like a, it's a family growing up and inventions affecting their lives in various ways.

1695
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,760
Coughing at a stove.

1696
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,760
Maybe there's an owl in the chimney.

1697
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:41,760
And then there's an old man balancing with a, like some iron implement to get to fish the owl out of the chimney.

1698
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,760
I think this is, I think there was a pretty clumsy, I don't know if it's the dad or the grandfather, I'm not totally sure.

1699
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,760
But he's got the wackiest face.

1700
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,760
I mean this is, he's the comedian of the show I guess.

1701
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,760
This one looks like, like a Peter O'Toole animatronic was melted a little bit.

1702
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:07,760
And now he is balancing on one foot on a roof and he's just like bouncing back and forth and that's the show scene.

1703
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:22,760
See, I gotta give Sally credit because there's not a lot of companies turning out theme park rides that achieve like Knights in White Satin, ethereal, abstract.

1704
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:30,760
V-Pod Salt Kraken, pleasant, the interesting joy of daily life, the little moments of daily life.

1705
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,760
Yeah, the last scene was just that the oven was, something was burning in the oven.

1706
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,760
That was the first scene you see.

1707
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,760
You know, a lot of rides do not show you that. Jason's right.

1708
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:51,760
Again, yeah. Indiana Jones at this point, there is a, you're in a scary temple and there's rats and bugs around here.

1709
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,760
There's the potential of an owl being in the chimney.

1710
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,760
Yes.

1711
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,760
Anybody can buy, I like what Jason's saying though.

1712
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:04,760
Any company could do an adventure or a war or a battle.

1713
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:13,760
But who, how do you, even, even Walt never really married like a ride with the pleasantness of like,

1714
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:22,760
Even like the scene in the scenes in Carousel of Progress where like all the inventions are like the doors are open and shut and like, and he's talking about the rat race.

1715
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,760
There's nothing as stressful as the rat race in this ride.

1716
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,760
I say with Carousel of Progress, too exciting.

1717
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,760
Too much going on.

1718
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,760
Yeah.

1719
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,760
Too much drama.

1720
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,760
Yeah.

1721
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,760
No, I don't have room for drama in my life.

1722
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,760
I want to go to Seacrow Island.

1723
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,760
I agree.

1724
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,760
What should I hold on to?

1725
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,760
Hold on to the poker.

1726
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,760
Then does he get electrocuted?

1727
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:51,760
If someone saw us when we are supposed to eat, they would think we are insane.

1728
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,760
Yeah.

1729
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,760
I don't know what happens there.

1730
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:02,760
If someone saw us when we were supposed to, when we were going to eat, we would look insane and then a table is picked up and slammed down.

1731
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,760
Mm hmm.

1732
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,760
Don't really know.

1733
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,760
But I feel like.

1734
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,760
But I feel like.

1735
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:12,760
But again, the like, you'll never see a happier crew than the families riding this ride.

1736
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:13,760
They know what it is.

1737
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,760
They love it.

1738
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,760
It's the table shaking scene.

1739
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,760
Yeah.

1740
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,760
He's writing in the diary again.

1741
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,760
Steiner lives with her grandfather, old man Sordaman.

1742
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,760
She has a raven called Jump Along Jack.

1743
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,760
Yes.

1744
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,760
Yeah.

1745
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,760
Jump Along Jack.

1746
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,760
Jump Along Jack.

1747
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,760
This kid is after me.

1748
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,760
A kid is teaching English to.

1749
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,760
Not English, teaching language to a raven.

1750
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,760
On our street in town is a lady with 48 kids.

1751
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,760
Now you're lying again, Steiner.

1752
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,760
Yes, I'm lying.

1753
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,760
No one could possibly have 48 kids.

1754
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,760
He just has 45.

1755
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:10,760
And that was like a little skit being done essentially between two children dressed in their Sunday best with a big St. Bernard between them, listening eagerly.

1756
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:15,760
And the Steiner looks like an old lady was put in a shrinking machine.

1757
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:21,760
Steiner is like a stern 80 year old, but child size.

1758
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:28,760
There's like a woman in like horror movies or like kind of.

1759
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,760
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1760
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,760
Who am I talking about?

1761
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,760
I forget her name. She's in the she's in Poltergeist.

1762
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,760
Yes. Yes. Who is that?

1763
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,760
Yeah. Yeah. It's a.

1764
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,760
Whatever her name is. Yeah.

1765
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,760
It's a little girl version of that actress.

1766
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,760
Frustrated. I can't think of the name.

1767
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,760
And then look at that big creepy speaking of Joker smiles.

1768
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,760
This dog.

1769
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,760
What a massive mouth on this dog.

1770
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,760
I like him.

1771
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,760
That's a mutant dog of some kind.

1772
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,760
What's the name of the.

1773
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,760
Who's the raven again?

1774
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,760
Jump along Jack.

1775
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,760
Jump along Jack.

1776
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:00,760
Jump along Jack.

1777
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,760
A little raven named Jump along Jack.

1778
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,760
And there was a dog there.

1779
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,760
And of course, the crows.

1780
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,760
What a time.

1781
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,760
The children would tell jokes.

1782
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,760
They were just kidding, of course.

1783
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,760
I want everyone to remember these were the most exciting moments of the summer.

1784
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,760
We're showing them to you now.

1785
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,760
The scrapbook ride.

1786
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,760
Scrapbook ride.

1787
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,760
What a day.

1788
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,760
What a life.

1789
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,760
Says an old man at a typewriter under a tree.

1790
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,760
But then.

1791
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:42,760
Now a bunch of bees conveyed with lights are sort of buzzing around him.

1792
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,760
Not so serene anymore.

1793
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,760
Then you go to the best subtitle in the ride or in any ride.

1794
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,760
Melker installs a water flume.

1795
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,760
Now it's just an old man.

1796
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:58,760
He's got like a big wooden rig that's kind of like water is going to pour down into the kitchen.

1797
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,760
And then you kind of travel with it and you see how it works.

1798
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:03,760
Wow.

1799
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,760
OK, so it goes into the window.

1800
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,760
Very good.

1801
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,760
And then into the sink.

1802
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,760
And the children are excited because Melker has done a good job installing the flume.

1803
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:20,760
You know that I'm like halfway through that Netflix show Midnight Mass and it takes place on an island.

1804
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,760
Off the coast of New England.

1805
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:30,760
And there's a number of islands like that off the coast of New England where it's like only a few dozen and maybe a few hundred people live on the island.

1806
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,760
There's a few ferries every day.

1807
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,760
And you know, it's modern.

1808
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,760
They have the Internet and stuff and iPhones.

1809
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:43,760
But like a lot of stuff moves really slowly because such a pain in the ass to get everything from the mainland.

1810
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:49,760
And I'm going to say Midnight Mass, too much religious phenomenon and supernatural weirdness happening.

1811
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,760
I just want the simple island life of V-Paw Salt Crack.

1812
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,760
And I want an American adaptation of that.

1813
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,760
Seacrow Island is where you belong.

1814
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:07,760
The whole thing is like the it's like the beginning of a horror movie where things are still a little too still.

1815
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:08,760
But then they aren't.

1816
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,760
They're perfectly still.

1817
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,760
Just as life should be sometimes.

1818
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,760
Wow.

1819
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,760
Man, Jason, you've got to get this on DVD.

1820
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,760
Let's see.

1821
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,760
This is a big salt crack and fiend.

1822
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,760
July 1960s.

1823
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,760
More diary entries.

1824
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,760
He has really done some hard work.

1825
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,760
There's a little kid goes nuts with the paints.

1826
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,760
Oh, what a mess.

1827
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,760
But he stands proudly of the he doesn't know it's a problem.

1828
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,760
He's expressing himself in his little diaper and socks and smock.

1829
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,760
Lovely diary.

1830
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,760
Just being a kid.

1831
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,760
I got my prints.

1832
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,760
Yes.

1833
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,760
Then the old grandpa is in a tux.

1834
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,760
This is a wedding.

1835
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,760
I think he falls off.

1836
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,760
I love us.

1837
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,760
Wait, did I did I miss something?

1838
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,760
Well, I just the tux the tux.

1839
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,760
The tux.

1840
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,760
Yeah.

1841
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,760
Uncle Melker.

1842
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,760
Why do you always swim with your clothes on?

1843
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,760
It is strange.

1844
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:02,760
A lot of people.

1845
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,760
I don't know.

1846
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,760
I don't know.

1847
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,760
I don't know.

1848
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,760
I don't know.

1849
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:07,760
It is strange.

1850
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,760
A lot.

1851
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,760
Then you go through a door and it's just stills from the show.

1852
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,760
I will always the woman ages up again.

1853
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,760
It's the structure of Titanic.

1854
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:22,760
You see, it's all of story that a woman is telling in her autumn years.

1855
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,760
But why?

1856
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,760
But that story is a little violent and a lot sexy.

1857
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,760
And we don't want that kind of arousal.

1858
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,760
Why does sea travel have to be so dramatic?

1859
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,760
Yeah.

1860
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:38,760
That old woman in Titanic should have kept the story to herself.

1861
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,760
Yeah.

1862
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,760
Tell us a nice story, lady.

1863
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,760
Right.

1864
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,760
Where was the accidental paint mix up?

1865
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:52,760
The synopsis of this ride is lice little hiccups, but no one got hurt and we all laughed about them afterwards.

1866
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,760
It's kind of nice.

1867
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,760
I like that.

1868
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,760
It is. I'll be honest.

1869
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:57,760
It is kind of nice.

1870
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,760
And because it's so unusual, I wish I.

1871
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,760
I wish I.

1872
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:06,760
Yeah, it's I wish there were at least a few more rides that were as mundane as this.

1873
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:14,760
You know, it's almost it's like if you think about it, it's a similar amount of mundane to the Winnie the Pooh ride.

1874
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:20,760
Right. But you think of Winnie the Pooh as being more exciting because you get to see a living tiger and a donkey.

1875
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,760
Yeah.

1876
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,760
And he trips out.

1877
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,760
He trips out.

1878
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,760
And there's a yeah, yeah, yeah.

1879
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:27,760
There's nothing nearly as exciting as that in this ride.

1880
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:36,760
But it's like so this is sort of like if the Winnie the Pooh ride was all humans, it's like what is what who else does Christopher Robin hang out with?

1881
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,760
What's Christopher Robin's uncle like?

1882
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,760
That's what this ride is.

1883
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,760
Well, they made a movie about that and America went not interested.

1884
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,760
No, thank you.

1885
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,760
I wonder how it did in Sweden.

1886
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:55,760
Maybe it I think that the Salt Cracken fans were like finally a return to form.

1887
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:06,760
This is like if they were to make a ride out of Jason going back to the shore for a vacation, it's like, ah, Jason relaxes with a crime novel in a lounge chair.

1888
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:11,760
Ah, look at this saltwater taffy for sale.

1889
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,760
Don't mind if I do, says Jason.

1890
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,760
Where are we going for dinner tonight?

1891
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,760
The fish house or the Italian restaurant?

1892
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,760
Those are the those are the options.

1893
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,760
There's a number of both.

1894
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:32,760
It took a minute to decide, but ultimately we were pleased with Italian and we did the fish house the next night.

1895
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:36,760
We did not consider this a hiccup.

1896
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,760
I met a crow fellow.

1897
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:44,760
I have a crow friend named Jump Along Jason.

1898
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,760
Out of swordfish, but you should have gotten there earlier.

1899
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,760
The specials always go fast.

1900
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,760
Yeah, that's nice.

1901
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,760
This is really nice.

1902
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:01,760
I mean, you know, I came into it describing it as weird or even like thinking about or what are my angles here?

1903
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,760
How can I say how this ride is creepy?

1904
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,760
But having kind of lived in it with you guys, it's been it's been very pleasant.

1905
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:16,760
I feel calmer for having visited Sea Crow Island and I bet all the guests at Astrid Blingren Park.

1906
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,760
Was that it?

1907
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,760
I bet they all were just as relaxed.

1908
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,760
Yes, Astrid Blingren's world.

1909
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,760
I mean, it's so pleasant.

1910
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:33,760
Can I ask, did you know did you stumble on another of Astrid's IPs that might have been interest to this podcast?

1911
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,760
No, no.

1912
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,760
OK, let me show you real quick.

1913
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,760
This shouldn't take too long.

1914
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,760
But here's a character she's created.

1915
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,760
Carlson on the roof.

1916
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,760
Wow.

1917
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,760
Carlson on the roof.

1918
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:54,760
Well, you were enjoying the antics of Velker, whatever up on the roof.

1919
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,760
And there's now there's a Carlson to go on the roof too.

1920
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,760
Yes, here they are.

1921
01:35:58,760 --> 01:35:59,760
I'm not exactly sure.

1922
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,760
But apparently Russians love Carlson on the roof as well.

1923
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,760
This article says here he is.

1924
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,760
I think this is Carlson on the roof.

1925
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,760
This is like a little he's like a red headed Ed Asner.

1926
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,760
He's like a little red headed as there he has like he kind of like flies.

1927
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,760
He's got like a propeller on his back of his overalls.

1928
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,760
Yeah, to get up to the roof to get up to the roof.

1929
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,760
And I know this is familiar, but I've never investigated exactly.

1930
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,760
Carlson, by the way, is spelled K.A.R.L.S.S.O.N.

1931
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:29,760
Not how I spell mine.

1932
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,760
But still, I feel a kinship with Carlson as long as he's not problematic.

1933
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,760
I haven't read the books.

1934
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,760
Wait, read that description.

1935
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,760
Hang on.

1936
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,760
Yeah, yeah.

1937
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:41,760
Here we go.

1938
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:49,760
It says I am a handsome, remarkably wise and reasonably plump man in the prime of my life.

1939
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,760
Carlson on the roof.

1940
01:36:53,760 --> 01:37:04,760
Now, look, fellows, I wouldn't describe either of you as reasonably plump, but I were you to be this.

1941
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:08,760
I could see either of you like proudly owning this.

1942
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,760
Yes.

1943
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,760
Yes.

1944
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,760
Yes.

1945
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:18,760
And we would definitely if we were that, we would have a little propeller on our back of our overalls as well.

1946
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,760
I guess next year for Halloween, I should go as Carlson on the roof with the propeller.

1947
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,760
So anyway, the costume is bombing hard.

1948
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,760
You're explaining it sweatily all night.

1949
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:39,760
And then you go to little Sweden, deep in Los Angeles, rarely talked about area and like Carlson, put him on the roof.

1950
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,760
To the roof.

1951
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,760
And they lift you up there and then they, your real name is Carlson.

1952
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,760
Oh, you're the king of little Sweden.

1953
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,760
Live here forever.

1954
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:52,760
Rent free.

1955
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,760
I mean, it sounds nice what you're describing.

1956
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,760
It sounds nice.

1957
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,760
It's all nice.

1958
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,760
What a wonderful.

1959
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,760
I don't know.

1960
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:02,760
Maybe I got to read some Astrid Lindgren.

1961
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,760
Everything is nice.

1962
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:05,760
Astrid is nice.

1963
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:17,760
I think we don't go digging as with America, not America, England's most popular female children's author who has pretty not good things about her lately.

1964
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,760
Hopefully Astrid Lindgren is nowhere near that.

1965
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:24,760
And it's just like a nice good step in it.

1966
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:30,760
By the way, yeah, for us to not have done any research and talk about a woman who was born in 1902, Scott.

1967
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:34,760
I think in Europe with all the things that could have happened in Europe.

1968
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,760
Dangerous, very dangerous.

1969
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,760
Well, Sweden stayed out of World War II, right?

1970
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,760
Weren't they in neutral territory?

1971
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,760
As far as I know.

1972
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,760
So that's a good start.

1973
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,760
Well, I'm not seeing anything.

1974
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:50,760
Let me see.

1975
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,760
Animal protection.

1976
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:58,760
Look, I haven't gotten to children animal rights or opposition to corporal punishment.

1977
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,760
So far, so good.

1978
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,760
So far, good.

1979
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,760
She made a speech called Never Violence.

1980
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,760
Never means never.

1981
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,760
That's true.

1982
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,760
That doesn't mean just sometimes.

1983
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,760
Oh, no.

1984
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,760
This.

1985
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,760
Oh, God.

1986
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:18,760
I was going to say this section of her Wikipedia says the scourge of redheads.

1987
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:21,760
Oh, no.

1988
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,760
Shit.

1989
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,760
Carlson on the roof was.

1990
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,760
To do character assassination of dumb redheads.

1991
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:30,760
She did.

1992
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:38,760
You know, Vipassault Kraken seems like a nice palate cleanser to like the the antics of Carlson and Pippi, you know.

1993
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:39,760
Right, right, right.

1994
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,760
Too mischievous.

1995
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:41,760
Yeah, calm down.

1996
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,760
There's no mischief in Vipassault Kraken.

1997
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:48,760
Maybe the weirdest ride I've ever found.

1998
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,760
I don't know if you guys agree.

1999
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:59,760
But I would venture to say if we were to list the three weirdest rides we found being theme park fans doing this show, at least one or two of them would be would have been made by Sally Dark Rides.

2000
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,760
For sure.

2001
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,760
I mean, boy, oh boy.

2002
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:07,760
We thought we thought it was an odd body of work and we didn't even know the full extent of it.

2003
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,760
Well, well, we might have to go digging again.

2004
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,760
Audience, tell us your favorites.

2005
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,760
If you're aware of other rides they've done that we should be aware of.

2006
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,760
Let us know.

2007
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,760
But this is great.

2008
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:27,760
I think this is because we wouldn't have ended up in Astrid Lindgren's world or a holiday where these are or the or Lombard.

2009
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,760
They're all like these.

2010
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:33,760
They're their works are spread out disparately all over weird parts of the world.

2011
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,760
But they all add up into an insane greater whole.

2012
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,760
They have that Sally voice.

2013
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:44,760
You know, they talk about an artist, an artist as a voice and the Sally company as a whole as a voice.

2014
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,760
And I like that the voice is everywhere around the world.

2015
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,760
Yeah, that's nice.

2016
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:50,760
It's fantastic.

2017
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,760
I mean, so great job, Sally.

2018
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,760
Keep on keeping on.

2019
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,760
Keep it weird.

2020
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:56,760
Keep Sally weird.

2021
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:05,760
You survived podcast Ride the Second Gate and keep it tuned here to podcast the Ride the Second Gate for three bonus episodes every month.

2022
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,760
Perhaps more Sally to come, perhaps more Hard Rock Park to come.

2023
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,760
Lots of possibilities.

2024
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,760
And it's also and of course, let's hope for more Pippin to come.

2025
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:23,760
Of course, the jam and jesters do the entire do it front to back bands do front to back.

2026
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,760
All the time.

2027
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,760
Now that's yeah.

2028
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,760
But do the whole show.

2029
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:32,760
Did Ben Varine ever sit in with the jesters and do Pippin stuff?

2030
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,760
I hope he did.

2031
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,760
I haven't found the video yet, though.

2032
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,760
We'll find out and many more things.

2033
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,760
Thanks for listening.

2034
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,760
Goodbye.

2035
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:43,040
Bye.
