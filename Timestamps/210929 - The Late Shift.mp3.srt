1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
where we hope that it's just the three of us here

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and that no one is secretly listening in from a closet.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hi.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have some thoughts on the closet.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I mean, it's probably the biggest thing to have thoughts about.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That is the iconic, that's the one perfect shot of the film,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
of the story in reality.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's the one perfect shot of his life, I think.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I had a lot of misconceptions about the closet.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I thought it was, I've always pictured a lot dirtier,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I didn't realize he already was doing the show at that point.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You also never, oh yeah, yeah, that is important.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The timeline is, it is an odd juncture in the timeline.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's an odd moment, yeah.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, well there's a lot to go, but it's also all fictionalized,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
so who knows?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We will unpack everything about the closet.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This might have to turn into a saga with an entire sector

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
devoted to the closet.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mike Carlson, what do you think?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm here, yeah.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The person at the closet is probably, you know,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
when we were all negotiating our deals for the podcast initially,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
it was very tumultuous, and there were, you know,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
there were a lot of other people that wanted this gig,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
this Podcast The Ride gig.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So it could be anyone.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It could be Mitch, it could be Anthony Gio,

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
all the people that were in contention for hosting.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's weird.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I mean, I don't know if we should be talking about this,

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but like you wonder why Nick Mundy has the contentious relationship

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
with the show that he does, and let's just say offers were made,

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and offers were rescinded, and deals were pulled, and...

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, that's show business.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Podcast CEOs, you can't trust them.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They go back on their word.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, let's be honest.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Nick Mundy's manager was too aggressive, you know?

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She just like kept calling everybody involved like chicken shit

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and tiny balls and...

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, too much.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, and he's nice.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, and I guess, see, that's why he needed somebody to be the bulldog.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He got it, but the bulldog bit too hard,

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and thus he's not able to, you know, be here.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I mean, would it be the same podcast? I don't know.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Or would it just largely be about Boston?

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Boston.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Boston.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There would be a lot of Boston.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Instead of the bad boys of Boston,

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
it would just be Boston on the show if Mundy was around.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
As a weekly presence.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Instead of constant references to tennis,

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
it would be constant references to, what do you play? Rugby.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Rugby, yeah.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So much rugby talk.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, and it wouldn't be Mike Love, it would be Peter Chris.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You know, it would be a totally different show.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Different rock monster.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I forget if he's a monster. I assume.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't know if Peter Chris is.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Gene Simmons we know is a monster, of course.

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, Gene and Paul, but yeah, I don't know.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know actually much about Peter Chris.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's the kind of thing the audience would know.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mundy or every year.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But yeah, look, there's drama in the formation of shows.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And when we took over podcast The Ride from the previous three hosts.

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Exactly, yeah.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It was, was it, it wasn't, we wanted it to be a smoother transition,

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but it wasn't, it was a little rocky.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We should promise right now that when we hand it over to those other three guys

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
in five years, there's not going to be any of this nonsense.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's going to be so smooth.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because after last time, we don't want it to be over.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We don't want it.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I just want to say those three guys, they're good family guys.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Good guys, family guys.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Great guys and they've, nobody's worked harder than they have following us

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
on the podcast that follows ours.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, we're not going to turn around and do exactly what was done to us.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Like less than 25 years later.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Precisely, exactly the same thing with no lessons learned.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, that's not us.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Uncontributely close, yeah.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This bit is really funny if you know what we're talking about.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I just want to say it.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And if you don't, yeah, today it's happening, the long threatened episode,

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
all about the HBO film The Late Shift.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This year celebrating its 25th anniversary, Happy 25 Late Shift.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, this is no fictional thing.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is a film that is based on the battle for The Tonight Show in the early 90s

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
when Johnny Carson retired and NBC had a difficult time deciding

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
whether to hand it over to Jay Leno or to David Letterman.

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And this was all portrayed in this HBO film.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There was a book written about it by Bill Carter,

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the same writer Bill Carter wrote a film of it which was made for HBO several years later.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And it's, yes, it's come up on the show a lot, I think.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A lot of times.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think a lot.

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So it's like, yeah, long threatened to do this.

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You might say, again, there's people who will be like, this is some theme park stuff.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen the movie,

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but Bob Iger is a character in the movie.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So this is theme park related in addition to just being podcast a ride related.

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
An actor plays Bob Iger.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Has that ever happened in another thing?

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't think so.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Will it ever happen again?

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I hope so.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But it might not.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And someone else plays a man often identified as Bob Iger's best friend, at the time best friend.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Who is it?

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Is it the time best friend?

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Michael Owitz.

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They were best friends?

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And that's why, yeah, when he brought him in as the president of Disney for like a very short tumultuous, like, I,

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Owitz is in the Disney war book, like one of the most sympathetic characters in there.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And then after he left Disney, he had some remarks where it's like, oh, you, you know, you kind of.

139
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The least sympathetic people.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah.

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So there's relevant stuff.

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The other thing is we did put it to the audience.

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We got stats on this.

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We got numbers on it.

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I looked it up.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I tweeted late shift episode in or out.

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And with 565 votes, 87.3% said in.

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's good.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So thank you to the ins that are listening to the outs.

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know what to tell you.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Maybe you're not even hearing this.

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And if you are listening, expecting theme park content, you might want to recalibrate your expectations.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The only thing and I was trying to like justify, is there anything remotely theme parky about it?

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't know.

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There is.

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't think there.

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, like I would say there is.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But you go.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OK.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What I was going to say, it's more like this might be a rationale.

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know.

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It is.

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It does like activate the same part of my brain that enjoys that there's this weird ride with Drew Carey and Regis Philbin that they would like.

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like, why would you do that?

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Why would you put these real people in a ride or that, you know, there's a whatever is a Harry and the Hendersons thing there way later than there should be your water world is there like it's just the fact that this exists, that there is a sometimes dramatic film with dramatic scenes with a plastic looking Jay Leno and a bizarre dyed hair.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
David Letterman.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It maybe feels a little like like a Bill and Ted show or something.

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, that's what I was going to say.

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I was going to say Bill and Ted and I was going to say like you like this is like a Universal Studios walk around Jay Leno.

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is like if you saw him, we would go.

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's funny that there's like a guy playing Jay Leno.

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look how crazy he looks as a grunt in a grunt type mode.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And that's probably how you would portray it is sort of broadly right spray spray painted hair.

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I know that's not how they did it, but unfortunately it doesn't like.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It doesn't.

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It doesn't hold up.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It doesn't.

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think Carson's rich little doing cars.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I got to give John Michael Higgins credit because I think of the three hosts.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He is the one doing the best in terms of a reasonable impression, but like a performance as an actor interpreting a real life person.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, he's doing his absolute.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, no, you're right.

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He's doing his absolute best.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's still an impossible mountain to climb.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Really hard and he also had not been in nearly as many.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, I don't think he was the actor then that he is now or was even several years later.

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He's mostly a stage actor, so that's a pretty tall like you haven't been in so many things on camera and you go into that like a thing that is where there is a target on your back.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, no, this is and and I think it is funny that I feel like in other things.

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sure this has happened that there have been films or TV shows or TV movies where a recent personality is portrayed as a character.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sure that there have been actors who have said, well, see, I didn't want to just do an impression.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I didn't want to do like the rich little of it.

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I know this has happened.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And then in this you have literal rich little who, if you don't know of the famous impressionist, mainly of the seventies and like variety show era.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Still in Vegas, still alive.

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, still doing shows.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, is he doing about that kind of wow.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, makes sense.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But like and he was he's good at what he's good at.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But it's sort of like, you know, cheeseball impressions of people's personas.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So to then have him act, he really has like almost the dramatic center of the movie where he has to like give this advice one on one to Letterman.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So interesting because each OK, each three hosts are sort of there's a each have a different take on the character.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, Rich Little is doing his Vegas actors Branson act.

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The what's the guy's name?

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Plus, Leno I've written down a Daniel Roebuck.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Daniel Roebuck is doing a cartoon version of Lennon doing a face character.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He walk around universal and also like a like a snow white is what you're saying.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, basically. Yeah. He's a face character.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I mean, this movie is like a theme park interpretation of movies or the behind the scenes of Hollywood very much feels a piece, like you're saying of universal.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And John Michael Higgins is, I think, doing the same thing like the Chris Pine is doing in the JJ Abrams Star Trek movies.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He's not trying to imitate the actor who is the actual actor.

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He's trying to channel the vibe of the guy.

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He has a little bit of the voice down, but he is not completely trying to just do a cartoon character.

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, and I think it works in those movies.

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think it works in this. Yes, to an extent. Yeah, yeah, yeah, to an extent.

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I mean, again, it's there's there's very few people that like talk show hosts are the people like celebrities that we see the most.

217
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They are on TV the most.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So they're the freshest in your mind. Yeah.

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like like I just read I just made my parents watch Behind the Candelabra, one of our favorite movies.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Eventually that we will, I guess, do on this Patreon.

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah.

222
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And it's like Liberace has been dead for many years.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So you've kind of forgotten how Liberace is.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But you go, oh, that seems like Michael Douglas doing a really great performance.

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But you also kind of just ease in and you forget.

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Or perhaps for other people our age, we don't know what Liberace was like at all.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's true. I know that your pop culture is rooted in such a sense that you know Liberace very well.

228
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Liberace is the sun in which my pop culture universe, they all rotate around.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
One season 70s variety shows that we can't do any more of these.

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It almost ruined 100 people's lives.

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's like a sun and it's like Al Lewis from the Munsters face, Liberace, Paul and Lidsville.

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Lidsville.

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Bobby Darin.

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Bobby Darin. Yeah.

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes, exactly. So.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But yeah, yeah, we know we were sort of taking the movie's word for it in a way.

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What Liberace was like. And then we don't know Scott Thorson.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Right. Yeah.

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Scott.

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We don't know how Liberace said Scott. That was behind closed doors, behind the candelabra.

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Here we are asked to see them.

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We see them in the show. We see a lot of that with Higgins Letterman.

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We see him like him like dangling a dog off of his leg.

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Going to Paul, Paul and sandwich. I think he does that stuff pretty well.

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He does.

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He does the straighter impression stuff well. But then he like, he certainly carries the dramatic scenes a little bit.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, he's great. I just don't know if Daniel D. Lewis could have fully immersed himself in this role in the way this movie is shot as well.

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The way this movie is shot, especially in H like in high def, like it looks, you can see the makeup.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can see his teeth is like Letterman teeth, like the fake teeth.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, the hair is too bright. It's like it is not what Letterman's hair is.

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't get me started on the Leno. Like you can see it's like it's like when they up res Star Trek Next Generation and people are like, you really can see warf's makeup now.

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think that's a little unfair to the to the movie and private. I've got a lot of things don't survive the transfer super well.

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And yeah, I'm sure the HD is not kind to it.

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was now you one thing you forget is that though the makeup is very strange in this movie.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I looked it up and it was done by a like a completely reputable group like a family.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The Westmore's Monte Westmore is the main one. You know, the Westmore's is just that name.

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I feel like it just sounds like is I feel like I've just seen it on like kits or doors.

258
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, yeah. Reminds me of my dad would point out the name mole Richardson on lights.

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I think he knew the real person mole Richards like a family like that sounds like a fifties kind of.

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And this guy Monte Westmore was the makeup artist for seven seasons of Ozzie and Harriet.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Wow, legendary. And then I don't know if it was him or somebody else in the family.

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But so one of the people doing the makeup on this movie was the Joan Crawford's personal makeup artist on whatever happened to baby Jane.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, that is very funny because the makeup in that movie is insane, is insane and very heightened.

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah. And so, yeah, when you add all that up, that is man, that's like a perfect line.

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That is like a perfect line from one to the other.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But isn't that why it's good? Like it is part of it.

267
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have to admit I never saw a feud, the FX feud.

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, I love it.

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I like now I'm watching like I need to see that.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I've meant to see it for a while. But isn't like is it a similar vibe in a way?

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Like isn't there some like sort of like kitschy campiness to it?

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I yeah, I think I think Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon are doing much more grounded performances.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And then they have to, you know, for behind the scenes stuff.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And then when they're playing, the actors playing parts, then they can go crazy and you can kind of see like the animosity between them all.

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You compare that to the animosity between them off stage.

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Stanley Tucci as one of the Warners is just having the time of his life.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He's just at like at 11.

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I feel like.

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Boy.

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

281
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That sounds like a blast.

282
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, yeah, maybe that I know, you know, I do.

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think if the makeup were more subtle, would we like it?

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, no, it's part of the image, because when we tweeted, we're going to do something.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
People responded with a very like sometimes you'd see it's very like broad cover or a promotional photo that does not really reflect what the movie is like because the hosts all meet pretty rarely.

286
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's photos where it's the three, it's Carson, Leno, Letterman, and they're all kind of like putting up the fisticuffs or like fake choking the other.

287
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And like that image is just so silly.

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And I think you imagine a dumber movie than this, which is a good movie.

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
They are surrounded by heavy hitters.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Bob Alaban, a Bigley Jr.

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And of course, Kathy Bates is so great in this as Helen Kushnick.

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You know, she was having a lot of fun.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
These big stretches of like insane hyper verbal swearing jags.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Like she must have really just eaten it up.

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It seemed like she was having the time of her life like that seemed like it was such a fun part to do.

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Emmy nominated.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
As was Treat Williams as Michael Lobitz.

299
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm not sure when to talk about there if we want to like delve into the movie itself a little bit.

300
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But you know, actually, before we do any of that, I have to like I got to get something.

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't want to wait too long in the episode for this reveal because I think a lot of in asking ourselves, why are we obsessed with this movie?

302
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think a lot of it is the Leno of it all.

303
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think like like, of course, you're not going to see like a lot of movies where Letterman is being.

304
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This may never happen again.

305
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But Leno especially seems weird, like Letterman at this point is regarded in this like Kennedy Center Peabody sort of way.

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And maybe Jay Leno has received some of those little things.

307
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not sure.

308
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But like he still is kind of like working man's, you know, every day.

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You don't regard him as like this untouchable prestige guy, which Letterman sort of became and is with the Netflix show.

310
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you guys know that Jay Leno is doing a new show right now?

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, I do. I missed this entirely.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a new old very old show.

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes. One of the oldest shows.

314
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You bet your life.

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The Groucho Marx show.

316
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I found out about this because I think because I've been watching some Leno Letterman stuff in preparation for this YouTube algorithm to me that Leno was on the local news.

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
For the full half hour, like Fox 11, he went to the affiliate and just sat there.

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They introduced him and he does a joke or two at the top and then like, oh, we're going to do some stories and then we'll talk to you.

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
OK, sure.

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then they talk about like, well, vaccines may soon be available for age five.

321
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And you just like sometimes it'll cut wide to the studio and Leno's just sitting there just waiting.

322
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And then they give him more to do later.

323
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But they still do the top stories while Leno just sits.

324
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The guy is like it comes up in this movie.

325
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Visiting affiliates is his thing.

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He loves to go shake the hands in the small towns.

327
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's Trump and the rallies.

328
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And with this show, with doing a new game show, he gets to go meet the affiliates again.

329
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He gets to do his favorite part of the job.

330
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Because it's in syndication, right?

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It is a syndicated show.

332
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It is not NBC.

333
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's not even in the family like Jay Leno's garage is.

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's kind of weird to see him in syndication or on Fox.

335
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But now it's just you can look around on YouTube.

336
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There's so many 80 view videos of Jay Leno talking to an affiliate.

337
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Wow.

338
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And then plus, you know who's with him on the show?

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No.

340
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Kevin Eubanks.

341
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No.

342
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Kevin Eubanks is back, you guys.

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And he's not playing an instrument.

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He's just there.

345
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He's just sitting in a chair next to him.

346
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So Kevin Eubanks has graduated.

347
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I didn't know that.

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He's bandleader.

349
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He is no longer.

351
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He's made the full transition to comedian.

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He's not asked to play guitar anymore.

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He's been promoted to the Andy Richter, Ed McMahon spot.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

355
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But Kevin left and left the last couple seasons.

356
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He left.

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It was Ricky Miner.

358
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It was Ricky Miner.

359
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I know that.

360
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We went to see them.

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They did All American.

362
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You went to see Ricky Miner?

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, we saw Jay and Ricky when the last couple years of The Tonight Show.

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You went to a taping?

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I went to a taping.

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And they played All American Reject's Dirty Little Secret in between commercials.

367
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I was like, oh, that's an interesting choice.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like a percussionist singing it or with like...

369
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I think it was just maybe an instrumental version of it.

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Which I kind of like that song.

371
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Here's a question for you.

372
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And now I'm remembering this because I get like blanket casting notices or like even

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
audience stuff from like LA casting.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And I have seen many things called Jay Leno, You Bet Your Life.

375
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ah.

376
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So I did know about that.

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,500
But I've also seen things for something that just says, it's just the title is Jay Leno

378
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,000
at his best.

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Exclamation point.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Uh huh.

381
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't...

382
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Is that the same thing?

383
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Well, what does the body of the email tell you?

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We need an enthusiastic audience who likes Jay Leno and his humor.

385
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We need people who will make a very, very enthusiastic impression.

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You must be fully vaccinated by September 9th.

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There will be no COVID testing.

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Call time Thursday.

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay.

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It says it's in Pacoima.

391
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So let's see if the other casting notices...

392
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you feel like people who are really enthusiastic about Jay Leno in Pacoima are maybe that vaccination

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
part is...

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's where it becomes a no deal for them?

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's possible.

396
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay.

397
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I think this is for some reason they're late.

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's the same thing.

399
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because this is You Bet Your Life and it says Leno fans tomorrow and it's the exact same

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
copy.

401
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Okay.

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So for some reason...

403
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So for some reason they were naming it different.

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
They were just doing different names.

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We're recording in my garage right now.

406
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That was...

407
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
A car just went by.

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
In Burbank.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
In Burbank.

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And that car could be heading to the Big Dog garage.

411
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You never know.

412
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's entirely possible Jay was driving it.

413
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That was one of my eye points of the first year of COVID was driving by the Gus's Fried

414
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Chicken in Burbank and seeing a sports car parked outside, a man coming out with two

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
giant bags dressed in old denim.

416
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I slowed down.

417
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I was just like, no, no way.

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And sure enough, it was Jay.

419
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Wouldn't it be buying a bunch of chicken?

420
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's wonderful.

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Of course.

422
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's all...

423
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sidetracking, Scott.

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Sorry.

425
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But I do want to emphasize to this, to the audience, if you don't live in here in Burbank,

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
anytime you think it's Jay, it's Jay.

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah.

428
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It happens a lot.

429
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If you see a car, if you see a flash of denim...

430
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's always Jay.

431
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And we've been making this joke since we started recording in my yard.

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's come up a couple of times.

433
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And then several days ago, I am out on a bike ride.

434
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I am but five blocks away from my house.

435
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And who should I see when I round a corner?

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But there's a classic car.

437
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There is a flash of denim.

438
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And sure enough, and we like...

439
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay.

440
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I waited around for a minute.

441
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm like, well, this is...

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh my God.

443
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm doing the late shift episode in a couple of days.

444
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I wonder if I can get a moment somehow or what can I do?

445
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But he was sort of already wrapping up an autograph and then getting in an old timey

446
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
car.

447
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But I was able, because I had a little bike seat with me and my little buddy, my son with

448
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
me, and I got a photo of Jay making weird brief eye contact with my son.

449
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Wow.

450
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Wow.

451
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I feel like the dad of the century.

452
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He didn't even know.

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He didn't...

454
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You know, my son, God bless him, he sees everyone as the same, whether it be some scumbag loser

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
or the king of television, Jay Leno.

456
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Driving the car Alec Baldwin drives in that shadow remake from the 90s.

457
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Driving Lamont Cranston's shiny big car.

458
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Or a like D cobwebbed Munster's vehicle.

459
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Half a Dracula.

460
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Dracula.

461
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And he fired it.

462
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It took a big crank to do it.

463
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, wow.

464
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And then it kind of exploded big.

465
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And I was worried it would upset my son, but it did not.

466
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
He loved it, I bet.

467
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I think he knew he was in the presence of greatness.

468
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And then, so like, oh my God, this is great.

469
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Right before we do this.

470
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Wow.

471
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And then, right before we started recording, like a half hour ago, I got a text from a

472
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
friend who was at a market up the street and was like, I saw Jay at the market.

473
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Jay's at the market right now.

474
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He was within several blocks of this house.

475
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.

476
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Really, several times recently.

477
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
People will think when I said that right before these stories that I was like, we coordinated.

478
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But I did not know that there's two.

479
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm truly, you will see Jay Leno all the time if you live here.

480
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I saw him like two months ago.

481
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I was just pulling out of the apartment and I saw an old timey car and I squinted and

482
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I went, oh, guy in denim.

483
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There he is.

484
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

485
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It made me nervous.

486
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I like, my heart started beating so fast.

487
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yeah.

488
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I was like, you're not prepared for that.

489
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And I think that it is him in his signature uniform.

490
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's like seeing Superman in the Superman suit.

491
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Superman running into Peketo Moss for a bag of burritos.

492
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And as Scott said many months ago at this point, Jay is a larger than life character.

493
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He looks like a street shark.

494
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's what you said.

495
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That's right.

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I forgot that.

497
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So it's like you're seeing a Ninja Turtle or a Biker Mice from Mars, one of the Biker

498
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Mice from Mars in person.

499
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
He's sort of top heavy and he's belted off, which I think that helps it too.

500
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That you never see.

501
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's always tucked in with a belt denim, which just sort of like forces the upper girth.

502
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I would not call him a like chubby.

503
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And I feel like he is like a, he is like, like older bodybuilder fits like all.

504
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Top shoulder.

505
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

506
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah.

507
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's the fashion.

508
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
There's a man of a certain age are fascinated with Jay.

509
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We are the age.

510
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
A friend of the show, Evan Susser, not long ago said to me, Hey, do you ever watch the

511
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
YouTube clip where David Letterman says, don't blame Conan?

512
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Well, that's an, that's an algorithm classic.

513
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Also, they're always trying to, if you watch anything related to any of this, you'll get

514
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
recommended that.

515
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But it's just this whole sphere, I think is just so fascinating to a certain, a man of

516
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
a certain age of a certain interest.

517
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, yeah.

518
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Well, and I think if you're remotely in comedy for sure.

519
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And then it's, it's like part of the fascination with this movie and the story that it's based

520
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
on it.

521
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's like only amplified by the fact that it all happened again.

522
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But worse.

523
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Like the network wanted to avoid it.

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
This is the Jay himself wanted to avoid it.

525
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And it was so much worse the second time over.

526
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It was so much worse because of the internet.

527
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And I don't think I realized how much like it's happening again.

528
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Like I didn't realize even though like we were just so close to it.

529
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Like I had a universal studios, Hollywood annual pass Conan's taping on the universal

530
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
back lot.

531
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Like I was so close to it so many times.

532
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You know?

533
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yeah.

534
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah.

535
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's yeah.

536
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's that's what is that?

537
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Ten years ago already at this point.

538
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And some, some people more age, the first examples of, you know, getting out there,

539
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
political activism.

540
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Obama elected and that's saved.

541
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke.

542
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

543
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

544
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Well, that's kind of how I view it is that like that felt like this sort of, you know,

545
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
the people are speaking and the people are demanding that justice be brought to this

546
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
situation.

547
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And it really felt like, you know, like, boy, everybody's showing up in full force and you

548
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
can't deny the masses.

549
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And there is going to be, once they see this, there is going to be some change here.

550
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And then the people, the three people in the room said, nah, actually, they're not going

551
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
to do that.

552
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And that gets you pretty used to how everything, how more important things are going to go

553
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
for the next decade.

554
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's right.

555
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's a lesson.

556
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah.

557
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It very much felt like the low stakes version of like, oh, being a mouthy high schooler

558
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
speaking out against the Iraq war, the war happens.

559
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Being a college sophomore, George W. Bush gets reelected.

560
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We did nothing.

561
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
We didn't stop that.

562
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay.

563
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah.

564
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
All right.

565
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Conan's Conan's gone now too.

566
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I, you know, say what you will about you.

567
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I always associate less bloodshed.

568
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah.

569
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The significant amount of money spent flushed down the drain.

570
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

571
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I do remember as a kid, my mom referencing like, you know, at breakfast, you know, well,

572
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
when did you go to bed last night?

573
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Mom, she's like, oh, I watched Len was monologue and then turned in.

574
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Like that was a measurement of time.

575
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And my dad always was more of a night out.

576
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So I think would stay up like in the living room watching TV.

577
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I'm wondering if he was a letterman guy.

578
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I should text him and ask, like, were you, were you also watching letterman or were you

579
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
also watching Leno and just knew you were going to stay up longer or like, were you

580
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
a letterman guy?

581
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think I had the most Leno we family still do.

582
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I was pretty deep into making like YouTube videos.

583
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
This may have happened when I was that funny or die.

584
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I might have been like, I might have had a job and my mom is still like, you should

585
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
send some of your stuff to Jay Leno.

586
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I think you'd get a kick out of it.

587
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You might put it on the show.

588
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Well, you would already been on Jay Leno.

589
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Well, yes, as we've been, yes, I was a trick or treater in a sketch with a Nixon mask on

590
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
in 94.

591
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So I would have brought up to him and had I had a second to talk, but I snapped the

592
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
photo instead.

593
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But yeah, I don't know.

594
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah, so I mean, he's just going to like press play on videos.

595
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't know what she's thinking is going to, but God bless her.

596
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That is her way of encouraging her.

597
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, get out there.

598
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, comedy.

599
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But I, my mom was Leno.

600
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
My dad was letterman.

601
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Okay.

602
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
We have split household.

603
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We'd always watch headlines.

604
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
My mom loved headlines.

605
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He's doing headlines on the new show.

606
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
He's doing headlines on the game show.

607
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You bet your life.

608
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Really?

609
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah.

610
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Wow.

611
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's like everything's back.

612
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He just found this way to, I'm just going to go again.

613
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Don't change horses in mid-stream.

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Here's my question.

615
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What took so long?

616
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

617
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm being serious.

618
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
How, how has he been off TV?

619
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Like main, I know that we all watch the garage, but how has he been off TV, TV for so long?

620
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And, and yeah.

621
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And then why am I any, why am I surprised at all that he just managed to go back to

622
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the same thing in sort of a lower rent fashion?

623
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Is he going to, is he going to do a green card challenge?

624
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Is he going to drive from the Jay Leno?

625
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The, the, what is it called?

626
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The Jay Leno show?

627
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Uh huh.

628
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The green car challenge Jason is of course on the Jay Leno show when he moved to that

629
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
slot before Conan, he would race a green car around a track sometimes.

630
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Uh, can you explain for me, is it a car painted green or like?

631
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No, no, it was like electric.

632
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Environmental.

633
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That was the idea.

634
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like a sound.

635
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Promoting.

636
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

637
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Green car challenge.

638
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Okay.

639
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I got it.

640
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So they, cause they had a lot of time to eat up on that show and how do we, well, let's

641
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
just have him like race against Kevin James or whatever.

642
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Like it takes a while.

643
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It'll take a while to get in the car and they do the laps because that was the problem with,

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
if you read the other book, which of course I have the war for late night, the Jay Leno

645
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
show when he, when they moved him to 10 o'clock, that was their solve for the previous pro

646
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and like, uh, they were just bleeding comedy the entire time.

647
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Like they, like from the get go, they did not have enough segments loaded up.

648
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The whole thing was an exercise in killing time and they wanted to end with a comedy

649
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
piece.

650
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So that, you know, it's not like other talk shows where it just kind of trickles out.

651
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Maybe you do just watch the monologue.

652
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
They're trying to get people to the local news.

653
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So they want to save something really good at the end, like him racing against Kevin

654
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
James in a, in a leaf, in a Nissan leaf.

655
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And weren't there rules though, in the same way that Carson put down rules for Letterman,

656
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Letterman was not allowed to do a full traditional monologue.

657
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Letterman was not allowed to have the same type of like maybe musical guests as well.

658
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Wasn't there also a look rules like for the Jay Leno show versus Conan tonight show.

659
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Wait, who dictated that NBC said if you're going Johnny did, I believe.

660
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Well, the others.

661
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah.

662
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You're saying, uh, for Letterman.

663
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah.

664
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Oh, for, for, I don't know if NBC may be like, Oh, this dude will be, it's a different show.

665
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's a variety show.

666
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's not a late night talk show.

667
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Oh, Jay, you're saying they gave Jay, they gave, they were trying to do some different

668
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
stuff to try to make it, to pretend it wasn't just the same tonight show before Conan.

669
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Tonight show.

670
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Because again, the, the, the very uncomfortable situation that Conan has put in that he is

671
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
like asked to do an hour long show after a show that has done the same format at a time

672
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
where no one is used to watching.

673
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Like, like the human brain is not calibrated to watching talk shows at that hour.

674
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That is the hour where there are medical dramas and police dramas.

675
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes.

676
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And now the first, for the first time ever, ever in TV history, there's going to be a

677
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
nightly talk show and it's with a guy who's like been doing this for you.

678
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That's who you want to reinvent the wheel is somebody who's been at it for decades.

679
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Right.

680
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And then of course, regular TV shows get a better lead in, which leads into the news,

681
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
which leads in like so many late, so much of like late night talk shows is just keeping

682
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
old people's TVs on while they fall asleep.

683
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Well, that's why Jay is doing affiliate tours again, cause his audience would be the ones

684
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
watching the local affiliates.

685
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
They do watch.

686
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, I'm here saying that all these videos only have 80 views, but that doesn't, I think

687
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
anyone's tracking that.

688
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Like nobody's watching the local news clips on YouTube.

689
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
They're watching it as it airs and that is his audience.

690
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah.

691
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
They, JR's, JR, Jay's PR people like would send him here into this garage and he'd be

692
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
like, yeah, okay, let's go show up.

693
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Like he's just, he does it.

694
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That's why I'm always trying to hedge my, have we said too much bad stuff about him?

695
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Because I kind of feel like he might do it.

696
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I kind of think he would get it.

697
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
When I heard he was at the market down the street, I was like, should I just go up there

698
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and either ask him what he thought about the movie?

699
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And I think he would answer me.

700
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't think he'd blow me off or like if I really felt comfortable, like you want to

701
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
pop over?

702
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Do you want to come in?

703
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
My friends are coming.

704
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Do you want to do the Omnibus episode?

705
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I don't want to be.

706
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Do you want to do the Main Street fire truck?

707
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That's a good idea.

708
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's a great idea.

709
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't think.

710
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Main Street Omnibus with Jay Leno.

711
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
As much as we go for, okay, here's, here, let me even, and I, this is not, I'm not trying

712
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
to kiss Jay's ass now so cause we can get him on, but the, the fact of the matter is

713
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
this, Jay was like the hottest, hippest, edgiest comedian until he did the tonight show.

714
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And I think the combination of Jay sort of turning a little bit more family friendly

715
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and then this movie and then the denim has turned him into a character that we just are

716
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
endlessly fascinated and turned him into a full cartoon character.

717
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And that ends up being sort of what we all end up joking about a lot is a guy who just

718
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
makes Monica Lewinsky jokes, wears all denim, like, like, you know, like, yeah, like a street

719
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
like whatever the street shark uniform is.

720
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Achieved the highest heights of show business, fought tooth and nail to do so as portrayed

721
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
in the film, did it again and is like, like toppled more enemies.

722
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And yet does he now enjoy the spoils of his efforts?

723
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
No, he's just did flappers.

724
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
He did flappers every weekend.

725
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh yeah, lately.

726
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like, yeah, the pandemic's still going on.

727
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
He's an old man.

728
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
He does, he just shows up.

729
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
He does a show.

730
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
He does, he has never done a special about, he has never done like a night show.

731
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
He has never done like a Netflix special, a live standup special because he wants, he

732
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
knows the value of his jokes in a standup comedy.

733
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So he doesn't want to just give it away.

734
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
He won't just give it away.

735
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That's been his philosophy.

736
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You compare it to Carson who stepped away in this monumental television event.

737
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Like everyone is watching that and cares about it.

738
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's recreated in this movie.

739
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And he's only appears on television three more times in his life.

740
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
He's like utterly unaccessible, refuses everything.

741
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Leno says yes to everything.

742
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
He's never gone away.

743
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It is fascinating.

744
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
He is like his, his kind of like passive aggressive stuff is fascinating because he's like, he's

745
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
trying to project sort of every man guy with a denim and stuff.

746
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And you know, he doesn't touch his tonight show money.

747
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He's a fascinating character.

748
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
There's two Norm MacDonald stories that spring to mind here.

749
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Of course, the clip from Conan where Norm goes, you know, Jay Leno, he goes, you know,

750
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
everybody has a voice or whatever.

751
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
He goes, meanwhile, he's a shrewdest guy.

752
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He goes, every 20 years, a redheaded Rube gets out of a car and he out foxes them again.

753
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Jay Leno out foxed you again.

754
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Out foxes.

755
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Hell yeah.

756
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You can have it after me.

757
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Which I do usually think about him positively, but the obsession with like, I'm a nice guy.

758
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I don't know.

759
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm just nice guy.

760
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm caught.

761
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I find a little.

762
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's fascinating.

763
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Letterman during the Conan thing when Letterman was, by the way, this is going to go four

764
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
hours.

765
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I have too much to talk about this.

766
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah.

767
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Letterman during the Conan thing where he's like, you know, you know, you know, somebody

768
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
would stop over and help a person who like had the flat tire.

769
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But of course, Jay would bring a camera crew with, which is something he would say very

770
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
often, which is really funny.

771
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
The other I'm trying to think the other.

772
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh, the other norm thing.

773
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Speaking of Carson, just as a side note, because I just heard this norm claims that in the

774
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
mid nineties, he was called to Johnny Carson's office and all and Johnny had printed out

775
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
his like Larry King sketch that he had done or just printed out Larry King's like USA Today

776
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
column, which is King's Things, where Larry would say like, for my money, the best juice

777
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
is orange juice, which he would still tweet about that even like a couple of years ago.

778
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Some really nothing thought.

779
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah, which I think one of the like if you one of the jokes from the sketch, I think

780
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
is like, for my money, the best movie of this year is Mickey Blue Eyes.

781
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, yeah, no, because I think even Norm was like, we didn't have to parody it very

782
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
much at all because it was like that.

783
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Apparently, Johnny had like had just a bunch of Larry King's thing.

784
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He handed that like a copy to Norman said, let's just read them.

785
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And Norm sat in Johnny Carson's office, which he still kept up until when he died and had

786
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
a secretary for no reason.

787
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And he just sat there awkwardly with Johnny and traded off reading the script.

788
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Like Larry King thoughts, which is a weird like little backdoor shit talk like a lot

789
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
of people would do to like little like quiet text thread about so and so very fascinating.

790
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Wow.

791
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Wow.

792
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I never heard that.

793
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's fascinating.

794
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'll say that since Johnny came up again, one thing this movie, I think, does kind of

795
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
pressure like predicts the the thing about Rich Little doing his own thing is that he

796
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
does kind of like it's his impression of Carson, but he's also acting a little.

797
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
He captures the what I think in 2020s America, we think of as Johnny Carson, which is the

798
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
hits that are on Tubi for free.

799
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh, yeah.

800
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Best of segments.

801
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's what if anyone thinks about Johnny Carson, anyone younger than 30 thinks about

802
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Johnny Carson.

803
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
They've likely seen the time life infomercials.

804
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah.

805
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The Tomahawk goes in between the guy's legs.

806
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah.

807
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Probably a Joan Embree.

808
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
There's something with animals, maybe a Karnak line or two.

809
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah.

810
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Like some of the least less offensive Rickles clip because there's some you watch and go,

811
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Oh God, he's sometimes you go, Oh, it's like that's on the line.

812
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And that's sometimes you go, Oh, wait a minute.

813
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I know that one's not in the greatest hits anymore.

814
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
OK.

815
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah.

816
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I know.

817
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Carson's a whole different story because like there were plenty of bad Carson monologues

818
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
where if you watch on YouTube, you're like his whole monologue ain't shit.

819
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
He looks like he looks like just an old man who's like not funny at all.

820
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Undercut his own joke and not like purpose was just like gave up on it halfway through.

821
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yes.

822
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Everyone sort of remembers the John, the Dana Carvey or the rich little version like this

823
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
kindly old man.

824
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Meanwhile, read the books, you know, read about when Johnny was Johnny was a complicated

825
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
character.

826
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And then there's a documentary narrated by Kevin Spacey.

827
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, of course, took over as primary impressionist for which he did so prominently on the Tony's.

828
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Of course, you know, the what the 2016 Tony's he comes out and does Johnny Carson, you know,

829
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
another person way awards, you know, adds up.

830
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah.

831
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
He did.

832
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Bill Clinton.

833
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I believe.

834
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
OK.

835
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
All right.

836
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And then there's a piece.

837
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah.

838
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The master class he takes to I forget if we said this in our space, he was that he like

839
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
teaches.

840
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
He is, you know, actors who want to learn about acting.

841
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
He has him come in and like, you know, see Carson would have he had this thing where

842
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
he would kind of lean back.

843
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He'd do the joke and he'd lean.

844
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It was it was always a pivot.

845
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
See, it's the pivot.

846
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And he like puts his arms around somebody's shoulders.

847
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Let me show you.

848
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah.

849
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Watch that if it's available, I guess, but it's probably not available.

850
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah.

851
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's probably not easily.

852
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Although maybe like Eva had clipped it.

853
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah.

854
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
No, Eva message.

855
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Eva to get it.

856
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yeah, she's got it.

857
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
OK, let's let's get into the because we could talk about the people forever.

858
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah.

859
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And I don't know that we have to like, you know, scene by scene it.

860
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But if it helps to group it, like generally when things happen, I don't even know how

861
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
to to tackle it.

862
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I mean, so if you don't know the the the tail, I guess the main stuff is, you know,

863
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
is NBC knows that Carson is going to retire at some point and they better line up

864
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
the next guy.

865
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Leno has become the permanent guest host of The Tonight Show, which side note, I was

866
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
listening to him on Bullseye with Jesse Thorne.

867
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
He had Leno on.

868
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I didn't realize where he tells the story that how he got to be the permanent guest

869
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
host of The Tonight Show was like other people started demanding like a lot of money.

870
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Like Letterman was another one of the people doing that.

871
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
He'd come in and like I think for a long time, I think Carson was off every Monday.

872
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So other people would do it or Gary Shanley or great John Rivers, I think, was in the

873
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, sure.

874
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah.

875
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Before her show.

876
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah.

877
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So but they'd start kind of like asking for decent amounts of money, you know, like

878
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Carson himself might may or like anyone should be making on TV.

879
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Leno says his own number.

880
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
He's like, I cost five hundred twenty dollars an episode.

881
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Wow.

882
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So they're looking at it and like, well, this person wants, you know, five thousand.

883
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This guy wants five hundred twenty.

884
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Well, let's go with Jay.

885
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He like he he himself he like undercut the competition.

886
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He's the working man's comedian.

887
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He's he didn't even spend that money.

888
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
He said that old thing about not spending tonight your money.

889
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He says I didn't spend that five hundred twenty dollars I made.

890
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
He is so fascinating.

891
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I mean, this is getting a little bit to the thing in the movie.

892
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But one of the main reasons is that Letterman wanted to own the show.

893
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And Jay didn't care.

894
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Jay was just like, I'm getting in whatever it takes.

895
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Yeah. Pay me as little as possible.

896
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Obviously, eventually he got paid well.

897
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah. Yeah.

898
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So he's guest hosting the show.

899
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
David Letterman's following Carson for many years.

900
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It makes so much sense that he would move up and do it.

901
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But he's very prickly.

902
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
He's weird to executives.

903
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You know, there's never a good relationship there.

904
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Jay, however, aims to please the nicest guy in the world.

905
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And he's able to do that because he's the good cop and the bad cop is his manager.

906
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Helen Kushnick.

907
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And I think Helen Kushnick is why this got made into a movie.

908
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah, she's the fascinating character.

909
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Because whoever who knew about that, I don't know that there's any like footage really still like that you can go find of her.

910
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Right. And how bizarre it is and what a weird revelation of the movie that Leno like,

911
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
how you doing that he had this like really severe manager like Tom Hague.

912
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Like a godfather as consignly air like an enforcer that really.

913
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah. Yes.

914
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That enforcer.

915
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
That's like a wrestling term or like a heater.

916
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yes. Yeah.

917
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
A heater. They also call it a wrestling.

918
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah.

919
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
He's got a heater.

920
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's like you got like a like a tough guy behind you that like takes care of beating somebody up.

921
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah. Yeah.

922
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
For sure.

923
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
She was Jay Leno's ward low.

924
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The guys.

925
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Scary guys.

926
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes.

927
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Not to jump around too much, but as things are unraveling and all of these secrets are unfurled,

928
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I think one of the best lines in the movie and potentially a line from reality that so that summarizes the whole thing with her that she tells Leno,

929
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
you just want me to keep serving you the stakes.

930
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You never want to know how I'm slaughtering the cow.

931
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Amazing.

932
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
What are we like?

933
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And that's why we have him and we're at night.

934
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
If he did not ride in on this wave of brutality.

935
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah.

936
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And it's also that's also psychologically part of why for the last couple of years he was always like, I don't have an agent.

937
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't have a manager.

938
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
He kept saying that.

939
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And I feel like it was like him like trying to be like, Helen's not here anymore.

940
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah.

941
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Helen's gone.

942
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
He did have a manager.

943
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's funny because in the movie, one of the plot points is that like Letterman,

944
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Letterman's people are like his producer, like he didn't have an agent.

945
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
He was very skeptical and seemingly maybe disgusted by them.

946
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And, you know, but then ultimate then caves to get his way and gets the biggest agent you can.

947
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That's sort of what how it goes down is that she really she's got kind of a better she really guns for it to get Leno the spot.

948
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Suddenly, this article appears in the New York Post.

949
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
NBC wants Carson out.

950
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
She swears up and down to Jay.

951
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I had nothing to do with this.

952
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:52,000
He calls Carson on the phone like right then and there in front of her who you hear.

953
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You hear subtle detail.

954
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It's conveyed in the movie that Carson made didn't care for Leno terribly much.

955
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So he answers the phone.

956
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Hello.

957
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, it's Jay.

958
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Hi.

959
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
He goes way down.

960
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
As soon as he realizes.

961
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah.

962
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So they sort of push Carson out the door or the heat is on.

963
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
He suddenly makes this surprise announcement out of nowhere at this affiliates event that he will be stepping down in a year.

964
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And NBC sort of caught without an answer and without any particular plan except that.

965
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But I might correct that by this point, they had secretly locked in Leno without telling Carson who would have liked to have had a say in all this.

966
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Right.

967
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Without telling Letterman who would have left as soon as he found out.

968
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yes.

969
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Secret deals.

970
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah, because the story was always that like Johnny wanted Dave to take over.

971
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Right.

972
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Or at least liked him.

973
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That's Johnny for sure.

974
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Like Dave and then would have appeared twice on Dave's show later after he retired.

975
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So that obviously seems like an endorsement.

976
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
What I put it past Johnny to be like that show should die with me.

977
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Like, no, I don't know it, Johnny.

978
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And I've never I don't know if he's on the record.

979
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's like they should just put infomercials on after this.

980
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Like, assault the earth where my tonight show used to be.

981
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I don't know.

982
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Just film the moon.

983
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah.

984
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I know he liked Dave as much as Johnny liked any of those people.

985
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Right.

986
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah.

987
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
OK.

988
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So that's about what I thought.

989
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
As much as he was capable of liking any human being.

990
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah.

991
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Because he was still like very nervous, I think, about like, well, he can't do you know, he was really insecure and again, wouldn't let Dave do like a monologue.

992
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Like very in the same way, though, that people speculate Dave was insecure and put Tom Snyder on after him because Tom Snyder was no competition for entertainment.

993
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's a very boring shit.

994
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah.

995
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah.

996
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So yeah, that wasn't a dynamo song and dance man in out in the street.

997
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Well, people's cars like he got in that slot now.

998
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yeah.

999
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You've got Mr. Entertainment, of course, that time.

1000
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Dave does not own that show, though, right?

1001
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Or does he?

1002
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I don't know.

1003
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Does Dave own Colbert still?

1004
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I don't think so.

1005
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't think so either.

1006
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But that's interesting.

1007
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Worldwide Pants because Dave's company.

1008
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah.

1009
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So Dave got a big deal with CBS and Worldwide Pants is his company.

1010
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But then he also owned the show after.

1011
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So Dave made a ton of money, more money than he would have made an NBC if he stayed.

1012
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Right.

1013
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And the other big thing I remember from the writer's strike days is Letterman was one of the first shows back with written material because Worldwide Pants negotiated with the WGA.

1014
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
They signed a new contract with the WGA.

1015
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So they were able to make new stuff.

1016
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Meanwhile, like, you know, while Conan and Colbert are like ziplining from the top of the audience to the desk because they can't have writers and they can only write so much.

1017
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And they're stuck with them because their shows are owned by NBC and NBC hasn't sorted out any of this stuff.

1018
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I believe so.

1019
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah.

1020
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
There's a little detail I'd like to point out in this like right before Carson makes his announcement.

1021
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And this is one of my favorite things in the movie for some reason.

1022
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It cuts to this like boring Carnegie Hall event where the that year's fall lineup is trotted out.

1023
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah.

1024
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And then there's this part where Warren Littlefields is played by Bob Balaban who's the NBC executive.

1025
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Very mild mannered.

1026
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's the that's the beauty of Bob Balaban in general.

1027
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
What a wonderfully like that compelling flatness of Bob Balaban.

1028
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
No one does it better, I feel like.

1029
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
One of the best at doing that.

1030
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Man, the greatest deadpan ever.

1031
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Even like throughout the movie whenever like like you'd really do that you'd fire me.

1032
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Yes, we feel that upset about this.

1033
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's how strongly we feel.

1034
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And that's still as high as he ever gets.

1035
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Never.

1036
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
This is one part where he goes like Christ.

1037
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But it's sort of like he plays.

1038
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I feel like Bob Balaban in real life could lose his shit.

1039
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
He's really great at playing characters who have a cap and he knows that's what's funny about them.

1040
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
That they're just like timid by nature.

1041
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I think too, especially if that's your type, you you probably deal with a lot of frustration where people think you are like that all the time in real life.

1042
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And I imagine that is very annoying to everybody's trying to fuck over all the time.

1043
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Charging for this meal.

1044
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And what do you think?

1045
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Look, he's going to do.

1046
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Hey, man, you left the menus right here.

1047
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I can see the check.

1048
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Like, come on.

1049
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Bob Balaban punched me.

1050
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
He threw me to the ground.

1051
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I like the idea that the world is so familiar with Bob Balaban's work that they're constantly fucking with him.

1052
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Well, you think Mr. Gosford Park is going to give us shit?

1053
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Can't walk down the street.

1054
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Can't walk down the street.

1055
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And then, of course, I'm sure you were getting there, but Bob Balaban, of course, plays a Warren Littlefield analog on Seinfeld years later, which is crazy because it's like kind of like.

1056
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That's before.

1057
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You're right.

1058
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You're right. Yes.

1059
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That's crazy.

1060
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
He's already in the in the self reflexive Seinfeld season where they make a TV show.

1061
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
He's playing a character clearly based on Warren Littlefield.

1062
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And then he plays the real Warren Littlefield in the movie.

1063
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So it's not it's not completely Michael Keaton playing the same character from the Elmore Leonard universe, but it's close.

1064
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's close.

1065
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's kind of neat.

1066
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It is a little consistent tying stuff together.

1067
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah.

1068
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Wait, what is the Keaton one?

1069
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
What's like he's in Jackie Brown and then he's in a different movie, too.

1070
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Oh, that's the same character.

1071
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I believe so.

1072
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Let me make sure.

1073
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Why is it out of sight?

1074
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I think it's out of sight, right?

1075
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh, yeah.

1076
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Those you made around the same.

1077
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That's really funny.

1078
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I've read a bunch of Elmore.

1079
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah.

1080
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Characters show up in a lot of a lot of the same characters crossover in some of those books.

1081
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
This is some Marvel stuff.

1082
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

1083
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
They were they were they were way ahead of it.

1084
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It is Elmore Leonard and Kurt Vonnegut.

1085
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
They got should have gotten on that crossover journey.

1086
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Ray.

1087
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Ray Nicolette is the character Keaton is in out of sight and in Jackie Brown.

1088
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Right.

1089
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
OK.

1090
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

1091
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You've also got Seinfeld royalty with the other executive.

1092
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
John Agolia is the real guy's name and he's played by Rennie Santoni.

1093
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
What a name.

1094
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Rennie Santoni is the actor who was also Poppy on Seinfeld.

1095
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yes.

1096
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yes.

1097
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
He's on the couch.

1098
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Wonderful performance.

1099
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Completely different.

1100
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I didn't put it together until this viewing that he's that guy.

1101
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh really.

1102
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah.

1103
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah.

1104
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Because that's a different.

1105
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah.

1106
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah.

1107
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And he's really funny.

1108
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
What I was starting to get at though was this that mild mannered one little field like all

1109
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
right.

1110
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And how about a hand for NBC's fall lineup?

1111
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And then he cuts to this great like rainbow.

1112
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Here's all the days of the week Saturday through Friday in peacock colors and then this weird

1113
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
lineup of who is on their shows.

1114
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I had that.

1115
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I have a question.

1116
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah.

1117
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah.

1118
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I had a question.

1119
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
What's your what's your observation?

1120
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
The one closest to Bob Avalon.

1121
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,880
Is that a false Seinfeld?

1122
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,880
Is that a fake side?

1123
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,880
I think so.

1124
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
Yeah.

1125
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,880
That was Aaron's observation.

1126
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,880
I didn't catch that till this this time.

1127
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,040
I didn't know if this was like nonsense.

1128
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,680
They're all like it's just like a very diverse group and some of them are in pseudo costumes

1129
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,880
and some of them aren't.

1130
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,720
In my head, one of them was wearing a construction hat like it was the village people.

1131
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,720
I'm just not correct about that.

1132
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,280
But I thought they were all like representing their jobs on their sitcoms.

1133
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,920
But yeah, I think you've got to like from this distance where you're looking at my screen,

1134
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,080
that's clearly a fake Seinfeld.

1135
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:44,320
Well when they there's a cut to the side to like Balabi on a profile and the one as they're

1136
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,440
walking away as the guy turns, I'm like, is that fake Seinfeld?

1137
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,480
I think that's they cast an act a lookalike Seinfeld like I think it's a fake.

1138
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,480
I think it's a fake Seinfeld.

1139
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,480
I think that's a fake Seinfeld.

1140
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,480
It's a fake Seinfeld.

1141
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,480
It's a fake Seinfeld.

1142
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,160
I did the fake Seinfeld.

1143
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,920
And then you've got I think you got like a fake blossom here too because you got like

1144
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
a hat.

1145
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,720
It is so funny in the movie when they all get put like off they walk off stage.

1146
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,040
This line up all I do.

1147
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,040
It's so funny.

1148
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,240
I think it's supposed to be a Will Smith and a Carlton.

1149
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,240
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,280
And then the rest of them I'm not sure.

1151
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,480
Maybe it's a fake wings.

1152
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,040
Maybe it's a fake LA law.

1153
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,680
Is there a fake empty nest in there?

1154
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Oh, could.

1155
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,960
Oh, maybe the guy next to fake Carlton is fake empty nest.

1156
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,440
Because empty nest is on the list is on the banner.

1157
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,440
One of the banners.

1158
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,440
It could be.

1159
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,440
What else is on a different world?

1160
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:43,160
I don't think there's is there a fake quantum leap is on here is this is there a false back?

1161
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,160
Could be.

1162
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,280
And then a lot of shows that I think are made up unless these are I just don't know these

1163
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,200
like Secret Service final appeal.

1164
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,200
What happened?

1165
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,040
Love the line up.

1166
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,440
Anyways, you know, I also don't need to like synopsize the film.

1167
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:07,160
I mean, just like if we want to just call out parts that we enjoy that give us joy because

1168
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,720
there's there is so much so many scenes that have been burned into my brain for so many

1169
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,720
years.

1170
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,440
Well, I should mention because I haven't yet I didn't want to forget I had never watched

1171
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,720
start to finish until Monday until the other day.

1172
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,600
And I say, folks, if you think we're like into the campy nest, we are into the campaign

1173
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,160
that's certain elements of that.

1174
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,960
I thought this was a really solid movie.

1175
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,360
Yes, I thought this was great for it.

1176
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,560
Yeah, I thought it was like very solid.

1177
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,640
The there's the bone of fetus, the people who bone of fetus.

1178
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,360
I never get that word right.

1179
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,520
The people worked on it.

1180
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,200
Bill Carter co wrote it.

1181
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,000
The other guy who co wrote it, George Armitage, I was saying before we start directed Gross

1182
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,040
Point Blank, which was like one of the big I think of that as like the pre the era of

1183
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,220
John Cusack movies like right before High Fidelity, like this in High Fidelity back

1184
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,360
to back.

1185
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
That's cool.

1186
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Very much a line up.

1187
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,360
Yeah.

1188
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,280
And Betty Thomas, the director, directed the Brady Bunch movie.

1189
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,240
Love the Brady Bunch movie.

1190
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,280
Yeah, both of both movies.

1191
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,280
Yeah.

1192
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,560
The Brady Bunch movie.

1193
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,560
Sorry.

1194
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,920
The the Dr. Doolittle and Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Squeakwell.

1195
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,920
That's right.

1196
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,920
She directed the third.

1197
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,120
Which is notable of her filmography as it's the only one of them that I am in.

1198
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,120
What?

1199
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,240
Yes, I am in a crowd scene.

1200
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,200
That is one of my few forays into background acting.

1201
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,960
I'm in the football scene when Alvin scores the big touchdown.

1202
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,960
I'm in the bleachers.

1203
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,520
And I found the clip.

1204
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,520
The clip is online.

1205
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
Whoa.

1206
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Can you identify yourself?

1207
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,640
I could because I was like, well, there was two older people in front of me that just

1208
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,160
like talked for eight hours.

1209
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,560
Like I was sitting on those bleachers getting sunburned for like eight hours and they just

1210
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,280
talked about everything and anything under the sun.

1211
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,240
And sure enough, I clocked them and then clocked myself immediately behind it.

1212
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,240
Wow.

1213
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,240
Wow.

1214
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,600
Well, this has to be posted.

1215
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,600
That's news to me.

1216
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Yes.

1217
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,600
Sheridan and the Squeakwell.

1218
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,600
Boy, oh boy.

1219
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I don't even think I'm.

1220
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,600
Did I know that?

1221
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,600
I, I, I don't know.

1222
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,880
I, I, I might have been like right before we met.

1223
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,880
It was like 2009.

1224
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,600
You've been hiding that from me because I did say I do say I never forgot a single thing

1225
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,040
about you and I would remember that you were in the squeak wall.

1226
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,520
I remember that.

1227
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,640
That was like a few months before I think I auditioned to be a Universal Studios tour

1228
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:34,840
guide with three to four hundred of my closest friends going down city walk because there

1229
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,600
was a recession going on and people were trying to get any job.

1230
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,640
And my buddy, meanwhile, I'm rehashing all of these old shitty jobs and a buddy I went

1231
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,800
to that Universal Studios audition with was nominated for an Emmy a few days ago.

1232
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,920
So, you know, we're all moving at our own speed.

1233
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
You have a Patreon.

1234
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
That is true.

1235
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
No, I do.

1236
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm happy to rehash it.

1237
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,360
I'm happy to monetize it now because Lord knows Central Casting was not, you know, paying

1238
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,360
non-union background.

1239
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:09,200
Consider this now you're making the money you were owed for the squeak wall for the

1240
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,560
talking about it on a page.

1241
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,560
Yeah.

1242
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,280
When you're a 20 year high school reunion comes up in a very few short few months, really

1243
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,520
almost like as if it was the plot of gross point.

1244
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,520
Yeah.

1245
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
Yeah.

1246
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,600
I mean, obviously I'm hitting mine quicker soon, but yeah, you'll be able to say squeak

1247
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,600
wall and Patreon.

1248
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,960
Did you go to the 10 year?

1249
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,680
I didn't know I did not go to 10.

1250
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,960
Kind of want to go to 20.

1251
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,760
I kind of want to go to 22.

1252
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,160
But I also was like, it feels like it should be like, it doesn't feel like 20 years.

1253
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,640
I mean, Jesus Christ.

1254
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,640
Yeah, I did.

1255
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
It's all right.

1256
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,040
I went to the my 10 somehow despite being very antisocial and it's so it was a huge

1257
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,040
mistake.

1258
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,200
I don't know what got me thinking that would be a good idea to do.

1259
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
Don't do it.

1260
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
I say don't do it.

1261
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,200
Really?

1262
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
I don't know.

1263
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,000
I mean, there's there are like 25 people, maybe 20 people that I had like a good time

1264
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,560
talking to for four years that I never talked to after that that I go, Oh, hey, I don't

1265
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,560
think we would.

1266
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,840
We didn't have those.

1267
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,240
I I keep in touch with the.

1268
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Yeah.

1269
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,320
We are the only people I like from my high school.

1270
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,240
I married him.

1271
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,000
OK, so I'm spoken for.

1272
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,560
Yeah, we had an interesting I was like we had like a floater group that kind of grew.

1273
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,680
I was lucky to have people that would like do dumb stuff and movies and stuff in high

1274
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,680
school.

1275
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,320
But I talked to a lot of them are still so well, good for you.

1276
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,320
Not me.

1277
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,040
I went and got so I was I got so bored and just started like drinking a bunch.

1278
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,400
And then I took a dessert.

1279
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Nobody was taking the dessert.

1280
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,840
So I took just like a like too much cake and grabbed it and just kind of shoved my face

1281
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,760
into it in a Homer fashion.

1282
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,920
Somebody took a photo and this girl I never particularly got along with in high school

1283
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,080
just said, you and that's all I remember.

1284
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,800
I got a flashback.

1285
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,960
Yeah. You like recreated like one of those weird high school memories.

1286
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,720
It's no stature change.

1287
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,920
What's going on when we talk about Bonifitas, if that's the way to say it.

1288
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,920
I like that.

1289
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,920
I like saying that. So I hope that's what it is.

1290
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,280
Daniel Roebuck, as we said, some of these other people like a lot of other folks in

1291
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,920
the film have done great things.

1292
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,440
Truly Betty Thomas. What an underrated director.

1293
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,560
Yeah, not in a pretty much movie.

1294
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,480
This and parts right after what a run in a fascinating.

1295
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,400
She was second city.

1296
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,920
She has like a real fascinating career.

1297
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,960
She's in stuff, too.

1298
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,960
She's acted a lot.

1299
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1300
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,160
But yeah, not a lot anymore.

1301
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,160
I don't know why.

1302
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,520
Shoot Troop Everlane as well.

1303
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,600
Right. People. Yeah.

1304
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,080
So, yeah, which people love.

1305
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:44,960
But Daniel Roebuck maybe has not gone on to do so like maybe is primarily known as

1306
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,880
Fake J in this.

1307
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,680
There hasn't been like the other thing, but he never stopped working.

1308
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,840
There's a ton of other stuff that he's done and been in.

1309
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,880
Here's a photo, by the way, of him getting the J prosthetics put on him like

1310
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:06,080
Flabber from the Bible man villain.

1311
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,360
We got to get to know not Bible.

1312
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,200
No, no, no.

1313
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,240
Big bad Beatle Borg.

1314
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,800
Oh, flabber is big bad.

1315
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,800
Beatle Borg.

1316
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,760
And Fibbler is Fabbler is not Fibbler.

1317
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,360
Scott Fabbler.

1318
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,000
I went over at home to say it out loud.

1319
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:32,920
Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler, Fabbler,

1320
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,800
because there is no Fabbler and flabber is not Fibbler.

1321
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,520
It was from Bible man and the others from Big Bad Beatle Borgs.

1322
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,800
Two promised Patreons that we got to get to.

1323
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,640
People, please stop coming to our homes and rattling the door.

1324
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,200
We know everyone's demanding these.

1325
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,880
This this press, these press, like four and a half hours every day, the eventual runtime

1326
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,480
of this somehow.

1327
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,600
And then they still end up looking as crazy as this.

1328
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,720
Daniel Roebuck was also in this other great movie I found on YouTube a couple of years

1329
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,640
ago that is a movie about Mork and Mindy, but the making of Mork and Mindy.

1330
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,200
And in that, I'll show you a photo.

1331
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,960
He plays another real life comedy icon, Gary Marshall.

1332
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,880
Wow.

1333
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,640
Here is fake Leno as fake Gary Marshall.

1334
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,680
Wow.

1335
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,600
If you I don't think it's on YouTube anymore, which is too bad because it has a great part

1336
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,480
where there is a fake Robin Williams.

1337
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,880
They like it must be this must be for happy day because it started as Mork started on

1338
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,760
Happy Days.

1339
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
You're X. Yeah.

1340
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,880
So they're holding auditions for this alien part.

1341
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,000
Nobody's doing.

1342
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,800
Everybody's just coming in and doing I am an alien and none of it's interesting.

1343
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,280
And then fake Robin Williams comes in and oh, oh, daddy, I'll be on all that shit.

1344
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:56,480
And like and it's this and it's the best which happens in this movie a lot to in

1345
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,040
the late shift is like, you know, you're in good territory when your movie is full of

1346
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,640
people laughing when it requires lots of cut to the people.

1347
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,840
Ah, ha ha ha.

1348
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,280
All the best things have it.

1349
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,720
Studio 60 and such.

1350
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
Strip has it.

1351
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,360
Late shift has it.

1352
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,600
This work of mini movie has it.

1353
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,960
So cuts to Daniel Roebuck is Gary Marshall just doubled over.

1354
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,480
Oh, my God.

1355
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,160
I can't hear. He's watching the discovery.

1356
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,280
He's making the discovery of Robin Williams.

1357
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,040
And and then Robin Williams leaves still in a funny way, almost trips on the way out

1358
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,640
the door and is still doing bits.

1359
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,000
And a woman turns to Gary Marshall and says, God, what was that?

1360
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:41,520
And he says, I don't know, but I want it on my show.

1361
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,640
And then it smashes to more filming obscene.

1362
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,080
So if you want to see that kind of thing, yeah.

1363
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,960
And more can there are Robin Williams in that movie played by I'm going to fuck up

1364
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,880
the name Chris D.

1365
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:02,240
D. Amitopoulos, always the voice of Mickey Mouse, the cool, good, new Mickey Mouse.

1366
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,880
You get to see him as a weird fake Robin Williams.

1367
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,560
That is it is a very tough assignment playing somebody who a lot of people think is

1368
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,520
actually funny.

1369
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,800
Can you do the routines?

1370
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,960
That's like one of the weirdest artists.

1371
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,040
It's almost it.

1372
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:22,560
And it's impossible even like when there's like even in a movie where you're supposed

1373
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:28,600
to be like a rock star like Dennis, Larry can't fool me into thinking he's like a

1374
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,760
rock star and like Mark Walbert, a rock star.

1375
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,080
It doesn't work.

1376
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:37,320
And to say like a similar very similar thing with like a comedian brand as Aldous Snow

1377
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,440
forgetting Sir Marshall and get him to the green Tom Cruise is Stacey Jax.

1378
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,480
Yeah, there's something about it that he doesn't count that rocks that does rock.

1379
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,400
And he's swinging around on the poles singing White Snake.

1380
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,680
Yeah, yeah, that makes total sense to your brain.

1381
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,680
Well, he's not I'm sorry.

1382
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,560
He's not White Snake.

1383
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,000
He does Steal Horse.

1384
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,640
I really want to.

1385
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,320
Yeah, we're on a dead or alive.

1386
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,960
It's just yeah, it's very hard to do that.

1387
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I'm sure there's an example of somebody who did it really well.

1388
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,680
I guess Michael Douglas played the barachi really well.

1389
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,240
Yeah, there's a certain version, but it's hard.

1390
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,240
It's very hard assignment.

1391
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,000
Yeah, all this is getting to that.

1392
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,040
I let me see if this translates in the episode.

1393
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,760
But Daniel Robux, he never stopped working still like tons of credits every year, keeps

1394
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,080
at it.

1395
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:31,320
And I saw his reel, his reel has really quick flashes of him in different stills of

1396
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,680
things. And it has like a subliminal flash to the late shift.

1397
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,280
He's not denying the shift, but I think he maybe realizes it's sort of a dead end.

1398
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,400
The nobody's going to want a Jay Leno type in anything.

1399
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,880
He wants to prove that he's other things.

1400
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,640
He's a Brooklyn cop or he's a dad as portrayed in this film.

1401
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,840
And this is like a comedy cut to in this reel.

1402
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,840
The scene starts.

1403
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,240
I'll just start the scene and then a little title reveals the name of the film that he's

1404
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,560
in and the name of the movie is How My Dad Killed Dracula.

1405
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,920
Oh, wow.

1406
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:14,000
Thirty years ago, when I was a little boy, I grew up in this house and I used to trick

1407
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,640
or treat in this neighborhood just like you boys did tonight.

1408
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,520
There was one Halloween in Iowa.

1409
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,680
I'll never forget.

1410
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,040
Yeah, what happened?

1411
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,880
When I had my bag full of candy.

1412
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:25,400
Yeah.

1413
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,640
And all I wanted to do was get home and have a mallet cup.

1414
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,840
Then what, Dad?

1415
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,760
I got to the house, expected to see Grammy and Grandpa, but they weren't here.

1416
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,080
Because.

1417
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:35,760
I guess it was here.

1418
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,000
Dracula?

1419
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,560
Yeah, Jason.

1420
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,320
Dracula was here.

1421
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,520
I met him face to face.

1422
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,800
What a scene.

1423
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,520
Wow.

1424
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,320
One of the scariest things you could have said to me as a kid.

1425
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,080
Yeah, Jason.

1426
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,040
Dracula was here.

1427
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,200
I met him face to face.

1428
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah.

1429
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,600
And the thing about what was the cup?

1430
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,720
What the candy he wanted to eat?

1431
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no cup.

1432
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:02,720
Right.

1433
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,640
That's also too close.

1434
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,280
So because I loved Malik, I was going to say, is that one of yours?

1435
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,240
I was always one of mine.

1436
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:07,480
Yeah.

1437
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,280
Is that one of your guys?

1438
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,400
And now I prefer a Sifir's Valor milk, a little, little less thick.

1439
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,400
The thing from Kansas City, somewhere in the Midwest, very specific.

1440
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,280
That again, Sifir's Valor milk.

1441
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,800
Just got, you know, still has the million year old logo on it.

1442
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:26,120
You used to be able to get it at like, I don't know, did all the rocket fizzes go under or

1443
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,680
just some of the Valley?

1444
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,760
Sifir's Valor milk.

1445
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,680
I'm not a stockholder, so I don't know.

1446
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,800
Sifir's Valor milk is also one of my favorite prequels characters.

1447
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,600
Oh, OK.

1448
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,920
So it's like a little it looks like a peanut butter cup.

1449
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,600
It's like a little more flavorful.

1450
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,680
The cup is thicker, but it's like the filling is thinner.

1451
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,680
Valor milk.

1452
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,400
Valor milk.

1453
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,560
Mine, I'm looking at the website.

1454
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,520
My name is Russell Sifir's.

1455
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,040
We are a small family owned and operated candy company now into our fifth generation.

1456
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,560
That's right.

1457
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,200
What? That's right.

1458
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,680
Can you tell me more about Sifir's?

1459
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,480
Yeah, they made it to the fifth.

1460
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,040
Good for them.

1461
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:02,640
Yeah.

1462
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,200
You know, you're worried there's going to be an end to the lineage, but not with the Sifirs.

1463
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:05,760
Hmm.

1464
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,920
The Sifirs. Wow. OK.

1465
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,960
Yes, Jason.

1466
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,280
Dracula was here and he ate all of the Sifirs Valor milk.

1467
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,320
Son of a bitch.

1468
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,600
Dad, let's kill him again.

1469
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,360
Can you see this? This is the man, I think.

1470
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,800
What a guy.

1471
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,640
Hello.

1472
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,720
I'm Russell Sifir.

1473
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,120
Looks like he's doing a talk show.

1474
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:25,800
He's at his place.

1475
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,760
The Daniel Roebuck will play.

1476
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,600
Better watch out.

1477
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,680
Jail taken.

1478
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,240
Can I say?

1479
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,760
Yeah, I do the Sifir show now.

1480
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,240
Can I?

1481
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,040
Are you? Do you have more about Roebuck?

1482
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,280
I want to know.

1483
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,720
We've reached the peak of his career.

1484
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1485
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,400
And how my dad killed Dracula.

1486
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,560
I want to say something about how also another thing, how he plays Jay.

1487
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,920
Oh, yeah.

1488
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,240
If you were just kind of walking in and out of the room and watching the movie,

1489
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,320
I think you could possibly mistake him for David Schwimmer playing the most

1490
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,080
depressed character he's ever played.

1491
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,680
He seems to. Robert Kardashian.

1492
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,080
Robert Kardashian.

1493
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,320
Juice.

1494
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,840
No, dude.

1495
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
Oh, it is like this.

1496
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,480
Yeah, kind of a mumbly.

1497
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,240
He's like a mopey Jay.

1498
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,960
Oh, no.

1499
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,760
Yeah, that's shell shocked in over his head.

1500
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,240
Yeah.

1501
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,360
And I can't imagine Jay was like that.

1502
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,160
Exactly.

1503
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,760
I get why they're playing it like that,

1504
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,960
because they kind of want to seem like Jay is in the dark with Helen.

1505
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,840
So he kind of has to play low status.

1506
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,640
Yeah. But he's so mopey.

1507
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,600
He's I would call him emo Leno.

1508
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,560
He's emo for sure.

1509
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,760
Yeah.

1510
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,880
Geez.

1511
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,920
Well, he seems, yeah, just so depressed.

1512
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,600
And I don't know, maybe maybe he was.

1513
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,240
I don't know.

1514
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,760
Helen thinks it's a good idea.

1515
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,920
So yeah, I guess it's kind of like like old school.

1516
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,720
Oh, gee.

1517
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,640
Yeah.

1518
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,080
Well, Helen says we should go into the haunted house.

1519
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,400
So I guess we better.

1520
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,600
Yeah, it's interesting because I mean, I always watching it again.

1521
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,120
I was like, yeah, he's so depressed.

1522
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,840
Yeah, especially like where's the scene?

1523
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,800
Like, I mean, I think one of the one of the highlights of the movie is where things

1524
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,480
come to a head just to jump around a little.

1525
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,280
Helen Kushner gets him the job, but then it becomes the producer of the Tonight

1526
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,680
Show over steps or bounds goes way too far.

1527
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,000
It's very rude to all these people.

1528
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,720
Burns British almost loses him the show.

1529
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,960
And there is like an intervention essentially that occurs where the two

1530
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,280
executives and her and Leno meet.

1531
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:26,600
She storms out of the room, thus leaving sad Leno, who's having to deal with the

1532
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,640
you know, stakes of the situation and like that he is just so like lots of weird,

1533
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,360
like eye rolls and kind of like, oh, geez, you're kidding.

1534
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,560
I and then like I think that's one of my favorite things in the whole thing is him

1535
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,760
saying where he was at before Helen.

1536
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,600
Right. That which is what like, you know, like, you know, before I got to the Tonight

1537
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,120
Show, that was why I was doing it.

1538
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,480
They have a strip clubs.

1539
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,880
You know, I was there. There was no TV show for me.

1540
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,520
You know, you know what an agent once told me that I had a state that was scared of

1541
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,160
a small child. I'm the host of the Tonight Show.

1542
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,280
He's going to do a lot of work.

1543
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,840
Well, that's that's really where I think Roebuck does a good job in other.

1544
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,440
But this is so hard to like emotional and possibly like meltdown Jay Leno.

1545
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,280
Like, I still don't buy that.

1546
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,240
Like what you're saying, like, I don't buy it does this in reality.

1547
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,240
That is there is sad Leno.

1548
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,440
I don't I don't think even in this scenario, he ever got one.

1549
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,120
Oh, no. Yeah, I can't.

1550
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,400
I don't see it. I could totally be wrong.

1551
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,560
But yeah, he's I mean, he's playing it how you might play.

1552
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,320
Like if you just heard that story, you go, oh, I can interpret what this would be like.

1553
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,480
This person obviously is low status.

1554
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,080
They're really conflicted because they're friends with Dave and they don't really

1555
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,000
want to do this, but they want this job so bad.

1556
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,200
Yeah. But from what we know and have seen with Leno,

1557
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,080
yeah, give me a show if you want.

1558
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,240
I'll take it if you don't want it.

1559
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:53,800
I'll be over here.

1560
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,000
Meanwhile, he obviously deeply wants to dead, but he's playing it.

1561
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,120
He's the thing with Jay, I think, is he cannot not play it cool.

1562
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,760
He's constantly playing everything cool.

1563
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,120
He's not upset about this.

1564
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,440
Oh, Conan, don't blame Conan.

1565
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,840
Meanwhile, he's like, I guess they're going to give the show back to me.

1566
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,880
I guess, you know, we'll find out.

1567
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,920
This is probably a syndrome of just any biopath, like a walk the line syndrome

1568
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,200
that they, you know, did a very funny job parroting in the walk hard.

1569
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,920
If you if you were to read like the Robert McKee screenwriting book,

1570
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,080
it's like, OK, the moment that Jay breaks out and takes control

1571
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,960
and then like Jay's like, you know, Jay, that there's a scene in the movie

1572
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,200
where Jay's triumphant and he hides, as we said, in the closet.

1573
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,360
And he calls Warren Littlefield and tells him he heard everything in the meeting.

1574
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,080
And Jay has a really good line that I have written down here.

1575
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,440
Like this feels like that that arc.

1576
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,720
They need that arc and the emotional arc.

1577
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,080
And that's what you got to have that in the movie.

1578
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,800
So that feels like take them all the way to the ground.

1579
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,120
It's Jay's or him to the top.

1580
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,280
It's Jay's journey to like see that Helen has been doing.

1581
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,760
It's like Jesse on Breaking Bad now finally sees Walt has been bad for him.

1582
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,480
And they have to have this.

1583
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,760
Meanwhile, in my impression of Jay, it's just like Jay, you got to get rid of it.

1584
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,880
OK. Yeah. OK.

1585
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,480
She did what? Yeah.

1586
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,320
You know, too bad.

1587
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,720
But the line, of course, is

1588
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,240
I may look stupid.

1589
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,880
I may look stupid, but I'm Italian.

1590
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,840
I know how to find information.

1591
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,240
That's right, because he doesn't tip that he was like physically listening.

1592
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,760
Yeah, he doesn't tell them he was in the closet.

1593
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,000
Exactly what was said.

1594
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,400
Yeah, that is is very sinister to hear like a transcript.

1595
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,960
Oh, yeah. Like, how did you get that?

1596
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,440
Because then Bob Balaban immediately makes a call and was like, we have a leak.

1597
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,800
Yeah. We have this enormous proportions. Right.

1598
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,080
I mean, yeah, let's talk about that.

1599
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,760
This is I think I think the movie is made so that you can see

1600
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,840
Helen Krishnik in action.

1601
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,160
I think it's made because of this closet story.

1602
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,880
This was a phenomenon.

1603
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,360
I was a child at the time, but I believe in the industry.

1604
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,040
This is what everyone was talking about after the book came out.

1605
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,200
It's referenced in Larry Sanders.

1606
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,240
Larry Sanders, I think, feeds into this movie getting made.

1607
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,920
Do it's HBO. People like behind the scenes at a talk show.

1608
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,840
This is a big story.

1609
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,440
Looks like Larry Sanders shot similar.

1610
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,600
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1611
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,200
Yeah, for sure.

1612
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:15,280
So things are up in the air.

1613
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,920
There is the possibility that even though Jay has been doing

1614
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,720
the Tonight Show for a year, I'm not sure something in that range.

1615
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,320
They aren't necessarily happy.

1616
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,240
They aren't happy because of Helen, but he fires Helen.

1617
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,760
So does this put me in the clear?

1618
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,640
Well, not necessarily, because they maybe don't want to lose David Letterman.

1619
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,240
And they maybe think Letterman could do a better job or they don't want him to

1620
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,640
go off to another network, which is sort of what happened with Conan

1621
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,800
and why they kept him in place.

1622
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,480
So it's still possible that the rug gets pulled out from under Leno.

1623
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,080
And then they give it to and there's this big meeting with all of the biggest

1624
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,200
executives in Boca Raton, Florida.

1625
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:00,200
But one person who works on the Tonight Show, Rick Ludwin,

1626
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,800
and I say that name because he's apparently a very cool executive

1627
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,240
who passed away. People speak highly of was part of Seinfeld.

1628
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,640
And I'm such a nerd of all this stuff.

1629
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,120
I got to meet him when I worked at Conan.

1630
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,480
There was some scenario where like a bunch of all the people

1631
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,360
went to go see the Pete Holmes show was being taped and he was there for some reason.

1632
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,840
Wow. And I'm sure, oh, this is Rick.

1633
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,560
I'm like, I, I know.

1634
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,640
I've watched the late shift.

1635
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,520
I know exactly who Jay followed you.

1636
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,400
You prompted the closet situation, Rick Ludwin.

1637
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:36,440
So anyways, he hears like, oh, this guy's going to be, oh, he's listening in

1638
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,760
from L.A. to this Boca Raton meeting.

1639
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,880
Oh, I get it.

1640
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,000
And people say sarcastically, oh, guess what?

1641
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,200
They're talking about.

1642
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:47,200
He knows that he's going to if he goes and listens in on this meeting

1643
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,800
or can get some info, this is where maybe the fate is being decided.

1644
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,440
It's down in Boca Raton.

1645
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,280
So he follows.

1646
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,920
He finds wherever this office is.

1647
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:04,360
It follows Rick Ludwin to this conference room and hides in a closet to get information.

1648
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,080
This is one of those eye of the beholder kind of stories.

1649
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,920
It's sort of Trumpian in a way where there's things that Trump did that people like

1650
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,000
that you or I might say, well, he's like sniveling.

1651
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,560
And that's like a pathetic story.

1652
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,760
And other people say, oh, it's the ultimate show of strength.

1653
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,120
Whatever that I'd say, that's everything with Trump.

1654
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,280
It's like you could view it under those two lenses.

1655
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,640
It's sort of similar where I think other comedians and other people

1656
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,400
doing TV shows were like, oh, my God, he went to be like

1657
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:35,520
snuck into a closet to hear what was going on with it.

1658
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,000
That's pretty weird and pathetic.

1659
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,320
I think he viewed it as like, oh, it's kind of cool.

1660
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,560
And I was sneaking around and it was a spy movie.

1661
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,120
And I can sort of see that, too, in a way.

1662
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,840
Yeah, they also present the closet as more like a copy root.

1663
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,160
Like I thought it would be a disgusting chemical broom filled like

1664
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,800
like the closet, the gates of hell is the worst.

1665
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:02,560
Well, like I feel like in in sitcoms or movies or shows set in an office,

1666
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,840
someone ends up in a closet at some point and inevitably the like the door opens up

1667
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,120
and everything like falls out.

1668
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,920
Or so I thought it was going to be one of those kinds of like scenarios.

1669
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,040
Maybe he had to like sneak in through a vent and then he gets covered in soot.

1670
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,000
He's coughing up a storm.

1671
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,120
And then he has to like pretend that he's like, what was that?

1672
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,960
Somebody hears it and he has to make a gurgle like a water cooler.

1673
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,680
So they don't know that it was a guy coughing.

1674
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,200
Glug, glug. OK, just a water cooler.

1675
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,680
And then he like shifts a little too much and a whole open can of paint

1676
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,040
falls on his head.

1677
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,120
Yeah, I was kind of picturing something more like that, as opposed to like,

1678
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,440
well, there's a tiny desk in there and the photocopier's there and the time clock.

1679
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,840
And I guess it is.

1680
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,040
Closet is maybe a misnomer.

1681
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:49,160
It is like a it's like a side utility support room.

1682
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,720
Yeah. I just said it's closet.

1683
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,760
What's it? Everyone just says closet.

1684
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,960
You're not wrong. Yeah.

1685
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,520
It's it's but it's like it's a it's a fancy.

1686
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,600
It's like a closet.

1687
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,760
There would be on Air Force One. Yeah.

1688
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,960
This is no just doesn't a closet in your house is NBC.

1689
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,600
It is a fancy closet. Yeah.

1690
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,920
I think people somebody might have even worked in the closet.

1691
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,840
I think there was even like a computer station there. Right.

1692
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,040
But like an assist, like a page might have worked in the in this so-called.

1693
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:14,760
Right. Yeah.

1694
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,960
It's the closet is interesting because I also think there's a split.

1695
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,800
There's a split, at least publicly in the comedy community.

1696
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,800
There are those who are like Jay should have left.

1697
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,280
He should have said I quit when Conan was gone.

1698
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,520
I you're like Chris Rock.

1699
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,400
I just get hit with a bug.

1700
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,080
You're Chris Roxxon, like you're Jerry Seinfeld.

1701
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,240
They're like there's like five of these jobs.

1702
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,600
You hang on to it.

1703
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,960
You get as you do whatever you can do to keep your job.

1704
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,560
And then there's, of course, like people more like, you know,

1705
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,920
I don't know, I can't even think of people are like Jay's pathetic for this.

1706
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,280
Jay's all of his underhanded tactics.

1707
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,520
Come on. This is ridiculous. Sure. Sure.

1708
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:54,280
So and there's no closet scenario in the 2010 incident.

1709
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,000
I don't believe I don't think so.

1710
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,880
Come out yet.

1711
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,920
It's yeah, there's no there's nothing as juicy as that.

1712
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,640
There's just like Jay, which when Letterman making fun of him is like,

1713
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,400
he's like when they tell you you're leaving, you don't just hang out in the lobby

1714
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,320
and like, OK, I'll be over here if you need me.

1715
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,120
Yeah, yeah.

1716
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,640
That's the closest to it of like instead of Jay just saying like,

1717
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,880
well, I quit if you're going to fire me and put Conan in.

1718
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,760
And like when Conan was making his decision

1719
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,720
and like, do I write this letter and blow up the entire thing?

1720
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,360
I don't think there unless we just haven't heard it yet.

1721
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,600
There were there weren't like suddenly like little sticky sounds

1722
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,200
coming from under the table.

1723
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,840
And he's like grappling in with Mission Impossible gear.

1724
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,120
Jay and the human fly suit

1725
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,760
that on the side of the building.

1726
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,880
Oh, it's nothing.

1727
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,440
It's that human fly.

1728
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,720
It may have been a thing 20 years ago.

1729
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,880
Simpson's joke that I didn't even don't worry about it or Jay.

1730
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,200
It's a guy. It's it's one of those Hollywood Boulevard Spider-Man.

1731
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,040
He's climbing up the he's climbing up the building.

1732
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,840
Probably the fanny pack one.

1733
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,120
Oh, it's you know, the tourists aren't allowed at this part of Universal.

1734
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:01,880
Get out of here.

1735
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:06,080
Jay driving Chitty Chitty Bang Bang by the building flying car.

1736
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,280
That was one of my favorite Jay Leno's garage

1737
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,440
where you revealed that he had the real chichi bang bang and that it does fly.

1738
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,320
Of course. Yeah, yeah.

1739
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,480
Fine. You know, I think that Colin,

1740
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,440
what do you think of that Colin Powell?

1741
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,880
Yeah, yeah, that was a great episode.

1742
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,640
Colin Powell and Jay Leno flew in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on CNBC.

1743
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,080
Yeah, the best episode.

1744
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,680
Chitty's a good car, family car, family car.

1745
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,600
It doesn't get along with her.

1746
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,720
We the love bug, but they human separate the parts of the garage.

1747
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,560
So what?

1748
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:44,040
I yeah, I mean, it's great to see this dramatized.

1749
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:48,040
It's great to see it with, you know, it reminds me a lot of Tommy

1750
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:53,080
of So's The Room, where he had he hatches the plan to record everything,

1751
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,840
which he does. He sets up a he records like an answering machine.

1752
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,000
He has this whole recording scheme that ends up not mattering

1753
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:07,520
because he just confronts his fiance with information he got separately,

1754
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,280
not on the tape.

1755
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:13,880
But there's there's like great stuff with was so just looking like really satisfied.

1756
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,840
Like, yeah, that's right.

1757
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,400
You old dog, you're going to record.

1758
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,720
And you sort of have the same thing with Leno.

1759
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,800
Just like making like, yeah, that's right.

1760
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,880
This is why they gave you this show, because you're smart.

1761
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,280
See, Letterman wouldn't think to go sneaking around like old Jay.

1762
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:36,720
To use like another wrestling reference or something that wrestlers do a lot is like

1763
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,720
they point at their head like when they go like, I just did something good.

1764
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,360
Like it's it's like a signal to the audience.

1765
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,360
Like that like, oh, they did.

1766
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,200
I got the brains. Exactly.

1767
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,800
It's a perfect like it's a good thing for a heel to do.

1768
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,840
And like there's like the guys behind them and they go, I just I.

1769
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,640
And they're like, no, turn around.

1770
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,520
Like that's really it.

1771
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,160
But it is like those moments like cartoon moments,

1772
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,640
cartoon character style moments where you're like, I can I.

1773
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,200
You're really telegraphing what Jay thinks in this moment.

1774
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,520
Well, that would have been that's the only thing that could have improved

1775
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,560
the scene in the film is if he turned to camera for the first time in the movie

1776
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,920
and pointed at his noggin and then maybe said,

1777
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,360
hey, how's this for a headline?

1778
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,120
Talk show host has best plan ever.

1779
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,320
If he had invented headlines in this movie, it could have been better.

1780
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,520
I don't know. We shouldn't get to plus maybe plus it up already.

1781
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:31,440
But if he invented headlines, if he like gets, I don't know.

1782
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,520
Yeah. All the different segments, Jay walking.

1783
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:38,760
Well, that's what you want to see is the like the guy just said, Andy Kaufman.

1784
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:44,080
But like man on the moon, you get to see it's mostly mostly in the 70s.

1785
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,360
Most adult Jim Carrey, Andy Kaufman.

1786
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,040
But you see a little of him like, oh, he put on a little show for his stuffed

1787
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,160
animals. He was always entertaining.

1788
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,400
And I think you that is something I would like to see is young

1789
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:01,720
Leno, like what was the first headline with a misprint he saw

1790
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,960
was the first that he like bumped into somebody on the street,

1791
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:12,280
asked them a question and how you organically think of Jay walking.

1792
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,560
Maybe you saw someone Jay walking.

1793
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,720
You're under arrest for Jay walking.

1794
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,040
Yeah, they were playing.

1795
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,920
That's my name.

1796
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,280
I mean, I floated during the pandemic that Scott Garner should be in charge

1797
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,400
of the late shift TV show.

1798
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,320
Oh, that's right. Oh, yeah.

1799
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,480
That was the whole plan that it's that it's like a multi season. Right.

1800
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,120
But that's it certainly could delve into all of it. Yeah.

1801
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:38,320
With that. And then flash forward, like it started better call Saul flash forward

1802
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,280
to like the Conan situation, but it's mostly in the past for now.

1803
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,880
Yeah. But then, yeah.

1804
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,200
And black and white as with Saul, like black and white, what he's doing now.

1805
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,800
Right. Kind of after the main.

1806
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,080
I guess it could flash forward to you bet your life now. Yeah.

1807
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,880
Actually, well, it'd be a fake out where, you know, you're seeing Saul Goodman

1808
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:00,040
sad working at the mall in his bad little condo.

1809
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:03,400
And you have that with Leno, where he's like, look at himself in the mirror.

1810
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,880
Like, what have I done?

1811
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,000
What have I been? Right.

1812
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,280
Then like kind of splashes water on his face.

1813
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,280
All right. Ready?

1814
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,680
He puts up opens the closet that's entirely denim clothes.

1815
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,080
The Tuesday, please.

1816
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,600
And then he wants to go down and has another great day of meeting classic car

1817
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,680
guys and hosting art shows.

1818
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,080
He walks out of the garage, which just has a stack of money.

1819
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,720
He goes, not touching you today.

1820
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,360
And then he gets in the car and leaves.

1821
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,960
I don't need it.

1822
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,640
Oh, part of the plan. Thanks. But no, thanks.

1823
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,960
That's another Breaking Bad illusion.

1824
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,120
When? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1825
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:38,600
Yeah. When Skylar takes Walter to see the giant stack of cash. Exactly.

1826
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,920
Do you think that ever happened with Mavis that like, I want you to see something?

1827
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,280
I think this this is your tonight show.

1828
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,800
I think how much is enough?

1829
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,040
Can I touch it already?

1830
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:54,040
I like to think it's more like the dark night when Joker is like sliding down

1831
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,280
the money, that giant money pile, I guess he's setting it on fire, though, too,

1832
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,760
which I guess maybe Jay's doing.

1833
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,000
Yeah. Some people just want to watch the world.

1834
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,000
It's not about the money.

1835
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,280
It's about reading headlines.

1836
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,440
Yeah. Either of those work perfectly, though.

1837
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:14,400
Yeah. He does have a warehouse in Burbank full of dollar bills

1838
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,000
and he does something with it.

1839
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,760
And I don't know. It's either.

1840
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,120
Yeah. Slide down it or just show Mavis every few weeks.

1841
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,760
He might burn. Maybe he'll burn it eventually to make a point.

1842
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,440
I'm going to burn the money.

1843
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,640
I use it to power my model T.

1844
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:31,000
Do you want to hear I got these cars?

1845
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Oh, that was real good.

1846
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,680
Wow. Perfect. Rhymes and everything.

1847
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,920
Yeah. No.

1848
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,040
Would have been good without the rhyme, but it was perfect.

1849
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,440
Wow. You know, since I just said it, I just

1850
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,280
I just I just said the name.

1851
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,680
And if we say it several times, maybe she'll appear.

1852
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:53,040
Mavis Mavis Mavis, the queen lady, Macbeth herself,

1853
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,160
the player behind the scenes.

1854
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,960
She didn't show up.

1855
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,960
But we have but now now she's been addressed and we have to talk about it.

1856
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,000
Mavis, Jay Leno's wife.

1857
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,600
When we were warming up, Jay's testing the microphones.

1858
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,080
Jason, you did your warm up was on screen.

1859
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:11,240
Mavis screen Mavis.

1860
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,160
And that is an important detail.

1861
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,280
I'm glad you caught it that this is Jay Leno's wife.

1862
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:20,240
One of the biggest like mystery areas of the entire tale.

1863
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:24,640
It is pretty crazy to see that an actress was hired to play Mavis Leno.

1864
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,840
Not mentioned by name.

1865
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,520
Yeah, not mentioned by name.

1866
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:31,360
Was it was she on IMDB?

1867
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,600
I don't know. I don't think I didn't see the actress listed.

1868
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,320
Not sure. Mavis, very fascinating.

1869
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:41,680
The most prominent Mavis has ever been is in the is it CBS?

1870
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1871
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,160
When they did kind of a make good like like let's tell the J side of the story

1872
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,520
and turn him into not a villain.

1873
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,920
And some CBS news piece where Jay again is like, I'm not mad at anybody, whatever.

1874
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,520
And Mavis is furious.

1875
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,480
Maybe it is like Jay doesn't deserve this.

1876
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:00,680
It's the most you've ever heard from Mavis, because like you would talk about Mavis

1877
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:04,160
for so long, you never saw her and you think she was like a made up character.

1878
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,960
Like that's in my younger brain.

1879
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,280
I was like, well, Mavis must be fake.

1880
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,200
Not on this interview.

1881
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,680
Mavis is on fire in this interview.

1882
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,960
She's trying to defend her man.

1883
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,920
She doesn't feel it's fair what Jay has been painted as.

1884
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,800
He's just doing what NBC wanted.

1885
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,080
Is Mavis a little like Helen?

1886
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,680
Is that the secret? That's interesting.

1887
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,040
He gets the fire from the women in his life.

1888
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:25,680
That's interesting.

1889
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,520
Stand up for him in a way that he doesn't stand up for himself.

1890
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,840
Perhaps it is. I'm not sure.

1891
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,000
This is the only one.

1892
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,480
Yeah, one interview was with Mavis.

1893
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,200
So I don't know.

1894
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,360
I would have loved to watch 10 Mavis interviews, but I don't think they exist.

1895
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,280
She as a kid,

1896
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:47,000
an adolescent, when I when I was coherent enough to know Mavis Leno,

1897
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,960
I also kind of think of her in the same vein as like Stedman, Oprah's partner.

1898
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,560
Oh, yeah, you hear about them.

1899
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,480
You know, Stedman, I think you saw more.

1900
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,360
Yeah, for sure.

1901
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,680
I like I had a very clear I knew what Stedman looked like for many years.

1902
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,600
Mavis, I had no idea.

1903
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,800
Yeah, not a lot of info.

1904
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,640
I'm going to say something else from the Bulls Eye with Jesse Thorne,

1905
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,920
where he had Jalen one and he mentions the story that's apparently from the late

1906
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,240
shift book, not reflected in the film.

1907
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,840
Kudos to him for bringing this up to Leno personally.

1908
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:22,600
He says, oh, you know, I read in the late shift book that not only you don't

1909
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,120
it's not just the you don't touch the tonight show money, you also you don't

1910
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,160
relax, you're working when you're not doing the tonight show, you're out doing

1911
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,440
stand up and that you've never taken a vacation with your wife.

1912
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,280
Yeah, they never

1913
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:39,040
did his wife, who they have been married for four years.

1914
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,880
Yeah, there's no divorce in the picture as far as anyone knows.

1915
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,160
It's all pretty secretive.

1916
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:48,080
But yeah, he would like like he's got a hiatus from the tonight show.

1917
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,680
You'd say like, oh, yeah, go to Hawaii.

1918
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,840
I'm going to go do stand up in Peoria.

1919
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:55,000
He just like would he just couldn't.

1920
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,080
And he happily he doesn't say to Jesse like, how dare you bring that up?

1921
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,400
He's like, yeah, well, you know, you know, I said that Seinfeld.

1922
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:06,000
One time we agreed that if we ever went to a beach,

1923
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,240
maybe the worst thing that could happen, we might get to like it.

1924
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:14,040
Which Seinfeld similarly like just like the odd, crazy character.

1925
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,240
And I like who all both of them kind of make you go like,

1926
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,960
maybe you don't want to be one of the most successful standups ever.

1927
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,680
Yeah, you are guaranteed to be weird and miserable.

1928
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,040
That there's there are comedians in cars getting coffee with Jay is

1929
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,960
is very fascinating, too, because Jay says he won't wear sunglasses

1930
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,920
because he doesn't trust the world if he's wearing sunglasses.

1931
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,920
I'm paraphrasing it, but that is what he says.

1932
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,160
And even Jerry is, you know, the big weirdo is just like, OK, what?

1933
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,000
Well, because it also comes with that he's never had coffee.

1934
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,800
Yeah, right. He doesn't take vacations.

1935
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,480
He's never had coffee and he doesn't wear sunglasses

1936
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,520
because they skew your vision of the world.

1937
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,040
Again, I'm not comparing them because I do think one is evil

1938
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,240
and the other is just interesting, but it is Trumpian in its weird.

1939
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,840
Those just things that are off the table for Trump.

1940
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,200
The weird beliefs and the you only have so much energy in your body.

1941
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,840
And your heart only beats so many beats.

1942
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:09,400
It's a finite number of beat.

1943
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,320
This is Trump philosophy.

1944
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,560
It only beats a finite number of beats.

1945
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,680
So you don't want to waste it exercising.

1946
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,680
That is a belief of Donald Trump.

1947
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,800
Run through them too fast. Right.

1948
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,120
These certain little ticks certainly have me interested.

1949
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:23,880
I mean, I don't I forgot.

1950
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,720
You've told me the sunglasses thing before.

1951
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,840
I mean, Jay is endlessly fascinating as a person.

1952
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,320
Yeah, just endlessly.

1953
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:35,320
Why is just why he's turned into such like a character and looms

1954
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,720
so large in our brains.

1955
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,360
It makes you go like, well, what do you like, man?

1956
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,880
But we know the answer to that.

1957
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,240
He likes a reasonably priced, like fast, casual.

1958
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,680
He likes getting a double cheeseburger.

1959
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,000
He likes cars. He likes.

1960
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,440
Here's what he likes. Cars.

1961
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,640
He likes double cheeseburgers.

1962
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,280
He likes making intern jokes.

1963
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,240
And that's he made it during the warm up when he did not have to make.

1964
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,440
But when we saw him, you know, toward the end of the tonight show,

1965
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,880
he in the warm up made like two Monica Lewinsky jokes.

1966
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,360
Unbelievable. In 2000.

1967
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,320
What was it?

1968
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,400
In Sabbath? No, it was later than that.

1969
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,200
It was 20.

1970
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,080
Did I saw him stand up in 2014?

1971
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,400
He definitely did a Monica Lewinsky.

1972
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,160
Yeah, for sure. He loves her and he loves that.

1973
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,080
Yeah. Yeah.

1974
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,520
So like that stuff he loves.

1975
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,760
But yeah, it is.

1976
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,400
He's fascinating.

1977
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,800
I wonder if he's still never gone on a vacation with Mavis.

1978
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,600
Even post-retirement.

1979
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,960
After all that, did he not think to maybe take a trip?

1980
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,200
It makes sense, though, the read that it's comedy.

1981
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,120
Like it's fact that we you will see him in Burbank because he's that's all he does.

1982
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,400
He drives around here.

1983
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,760
But not her.

1984
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,320
But yeah, I've never seen her in the car.

1985
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,720
They don't live in Burbank.

1986
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,720
Don't they live in? They live close by here.

1987
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,400
Do they? The Beverly Hills, actually.

1988
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,960
I was surprised to find out. Yeah.

1989
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,520
I thought they lived more in Glendale.

1990
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,200
I am fascinated. I feel betrayed by the.

1991
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,400
Yeah, I'm betrayed by that.

1992
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,200
I mean, is the garage.

1993
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,400
It's up in the hills, though, because I've seen him on Mulholland as well.

1994
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,680
Like eight years ago, my friend was visiting and we made a joke.

1995
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,200
We were driving on Mulholland.

1996
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,800
Well, of course, you take your people,

1997
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,360
it's beautiful view of the city.

1998
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,200
And we saw an old timey car coming.

1999
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,360
And we said, ha ha ha, this could be Jay Leno.

2000
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,240
And it was it was Jay.

2001
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:08,280
So he must have because Beverly Hills, I'm assuming he lives probably closer up the hill.

2002
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,480
Because what is that, cold water?

2003
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,800
Yeah, probably. He probably lives off the canyons cut through it.

2004
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,280
Oh, Beverly Glend cuts through.

2005
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,200
I thought he looked more here.

2006
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,640
But the big dog garage is in Burbank.

2007
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,600
Jay's in Beverly Hills.

2008
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,720
Let's cut to the chase. He fucks the cars, right?

2009
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:25,000
Look, look, tell us all this time.

2010
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,640
So he and Jerry, they both have like 500 cars, right?

2011
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:30,920
Each. Mm hmm.

2012
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,040
All right. I didn't even want to bring Jerry into it.

2013
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,320
But yes, absolutely.

2014
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,160
Now I can't elevator in New York.

2015
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,960
He has like there's like a fake brownstone.

2016
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:38,880
And you're right. Right.

2017
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,200
Three story elevator car garage.

2018
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,720
Then he's like this guy when I was playing Grand Theft Auto online

2019
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:48,840
that invited me, Susser, Tim Chang and Anthony Geo

2020
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:54,080
into his car garage in the game to show off a three story car.

2021
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,360
Like he had bought all these cars in game or like it's a similar thing.

2022
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:03,120
But in real life, Jerry has some like elaborate, crazy car thing.

2023
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,040
That's what I've heard. I don't think there's any pictures of it.

2024
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,560
I I think I saw like a diagram.

2025
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,760
I think a show talked about it with like a lifestyle.

2026
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,160
So it's kind of show.

2027
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:12,040
I'll tell you this.

2028
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:15,680
I took the boat tour at Lake Arrowhead once when I was up there

2029
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,240
and they were talking about it was clearly the place

2030
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,040
to buy vacations home in the 90s because they're like that house

2031
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,200
used to be Michael Eisner's.

2032
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,760
That house used to be Eric LaSalle's.

2033
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,120
That used Sammy Hagar is kind of people.

2034
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:31,480
I think Sammy Hagar was the one that people in town were so annoyed by him

2035
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,520
because he bought two massive lakefront homes and then connected

2036
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:39,760
like made a Frankenstein house and I like painted with flames.

2037
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,680
And I they weren't happy about it.

2038
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,040
The one that stuck out in my mind was they're like that house used to be Jay

2039
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:51,480
Leno's and I think the number was the garage can hold 27 cars.

2040
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,320
Whoa. 27 cars up there.

2041
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,560
This is like winding roads.

2042
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,040
A vacation, though.

2043
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,680
That oh, I suppose.

2044
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,880
I don't know if it's a home, though.

2045
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,400
I don't know if I see maybe.

2046
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,320
Yeah, I know. That's not a vacay.

2047
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,840
If you live there, you know, you're right.

2048
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,120
Not a vacation. Yeah, that's true.

2049
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:11,640
Well, I mean, I feel like there's a lot of work getting 27 fucking cars up to

2050
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:15,200
like the the mountain towns outside of L.A.

2051
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,520
Like it's kind of a pain in the ass up there.

2052
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:22,280
Like you go on a vacation to escape up there and it's like there's one grocer.

2053
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,520
There's like treacherous driving.

2054
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,880
He sends Mavis to Hawaii and he puts a wig on the hood of the car.

2055
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,360
Is what Scott's getting at.

2056
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,440
I think so. Yeah, it's this long path where there's not a lot of people

2057
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,000
and it's just secluded and you can just be alone with your thoughts

2058
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,120
or with your cars.

2059
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,040
I'm going to here's what I'm going to do.

2060
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,760
I'm going to bring up this photo I showed you earlier,

2061
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,680
and I'm going to slide my baby son out of it so that he's not part of this filth.

2062
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,320
Look how many pipes are on this thing.

2063
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,640
I mean, take your pick.

2064
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,800
You got one for every day of the week.

2065
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,680
That's just this single car.

2066
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,360
You're getting into my weird obsession territory, and that is one or two channels

2067
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:05,240
down from the bigger Big Dog Garage shadow.

2068
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,880
Yeah, I look, I I shouldn't throw stone.

2069
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,560
You know, I have a very it's especially after the last couple of years.

2070
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,640
I have a very impressive wall of toys.

2071
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,800
Some would say that's excessive.

2072
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:20,800
So somebody might say the same thing about me is he having sex with his Doc Brown toy

2073
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,120
when he sends Lindsey to Hawaii.

2074
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,760
I mean, nobody here was saying that about you.

2075
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,280
No, I'm just saying I've heard people whispering in Burbank,

2076
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,040
and it's not true, first of all, but I'm just saying so at all.

2077
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:37,240
I think you're in the volunteering of it just makes it seem more real.

2078
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,840
Does he kiss a master splinter on the mouth?

2079
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,840
Both his movie version of Mathers

2080
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:48,000
Masters Splinter and his 1987 or 1989 animated series version.

2081
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,680
Master Splinter saw him at the grocery store with the gold member

2082
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,960
McFarland toys again.

2083
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,360
Does he see how many

2084
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,360
Ninja Turtles can line up on certain body parts?

2085
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,520
How many can he family can the answers?

2086
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,880
Their arms around.

2087
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:14,880
Wait, are you picturing like the human sushi kind of table?

2088
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,280
But it's Mike lying in Ninja Turtles across itself.

2089
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:22,040
Well, I was picturing them specifically located in one spot.

2090
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:23,760
Oh, that's better.

2091
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,240
That's that nicer.

2092
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,040
That's a more wholesome one.

2093
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2094
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,120
I yeah.

2095
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:34,160
And has Mike gotten to be a pro to where he can lay them all on himself?

2096
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,200
Or does he need somebody to help?

2097
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,040
And that's not a sexual thing.

2098
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,280
That's just a like that's you're just the helper.

2099
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:43,560
Look, what you're saying is not true, but I have heard people say it.

2100
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,520
So I don't want to be mad.

2101
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:50,040
I don't want to say Jay's doing anything on toll untoward with the cars.

2102
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,480
Look, people go.

2103
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,440
I'm not I'm not trying to shame you for this.

2104
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,600
People go crazy when they're doing these shows.

2105
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,880
Nobody nobody doing a prominent show, whether it be the Tonight Show

2106
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,320
or this theme park podcast that we do.

2107
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,240
If you're if you're in a in a high pressure, high octane

2108
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,040
performance situation, people start to lose their minds a little.

2109
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:14,640
And it's, you know, better, I'd say better than losing it to drugs and alcohol.

2110
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,560
Then I'd say better to lose it to

2111
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,640
draping yourself in action figures.

2112
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,440
Yeah. Well, sending your girlfriend on false trips.

2113
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,280
Yeah. Look, it's it's not true.

2114
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,120
I just want to say it's not true.

2115
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:33,000
But is it true for Jay?

2116
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,920
You be the judge.

2117
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,600
You listener, you be the judge.

2118
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,200
But it's not true for me.

2119
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,960
It's just want to let let that sit there for a while.

2120
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,360
It's just been some whispers about some.

2121
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,520
Yeah.

2122
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,000
I've been in Burbank comics.

2123
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,120
I've been in some picadillo.

2124
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,160
Yeah, I've been to the big Bob's Big Boy and I've heard all the rumors.

2125
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,080
Yeah. In the booth.

2126
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,680
I've been sitting in the booth and I can hear.

2127
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,280
So the sewing circle down there.

2128
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,200
It's like a party line, the gossip down the gossip at the Bob's

2129
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,760
Big Boy in Burbank, please.

2130
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,320
Yeah, it's fast.

2131
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,640
I would love to know the number of cars both of them own.

2132
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,440
Who owns more Jerry or Jay?

2133
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,400
Oh, it's got to be Jay.

2134
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,680
It's got to be Jay.

2135
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,240
Hi, are you sure? Jay Leno.

2136
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:10,960
I'm not sure.

2137
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,160
Jerry is so rich from that show.

2138
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,640
I guess that everything he's Jerry takes vacations.

2139
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,280
That's true. Jerry is.

2140
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:22,120
I guess he involved Jay involved him in this beach scenario.

2141
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:26,720
But I do think that he's relaxed since the show a little more. Right.

2142
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:30,480
I think Leno just like, OK, they took my show away the next weekend.

2143
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,200
I'm in Atlantic City. That's true.

2144
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,280
Yes, that's true for sure.

2145
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,720
That Jerry Jerry's like a Hamptons guy.

2146
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,120
Jerry's hanging out with all Ted Sarandos and all the heavy hitters.

2147
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,240
Yeah. In the hand, I call that a vacation.

2148
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,200
Sure. Yeah. So that's that's more vacation to me.

2149
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:48,760
Speaking of vacations there, I think there's a weird.

2150
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,280
Did you guys catch this?

2151
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,120
There's a pretty solid, subtle.

2152
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:57,360
I think it's meant to be a callback joke in the movie where like Jay

2153
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,680
gets off a plane and Lake Tahoe, he's playing a show in Lake Tahoe.

2154
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,680
And he takes a call there.

2155
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,600
And later in the movie, when someone's like arguing with Letterman,

2156
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,160
they go like, oh, what do you want to be doing with your life, David?

2157
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:15,280
You want to be playing Lake Tahoe or something like they make fun of the thing

2158
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,600
that Jay was doing.

2159
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,120
This is also. Yeah.

2160
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:21,080
This is also kind of a fake thing, too, I feel like,

2161
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:24,160
because Jay was very popular and very successful.

2162
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,240
Like they really try to make it seem like he was like really slumming it before.

2163
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:31,640
But that's not my he was constantly doing Letterman guest appearances.

2164
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,560
And constantly selling out shows.

2165
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,720
He was very well known playing the biggest venue.

2166
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:39,200
Yeah, he was very well known before that.

2167
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,440
Obviously, he wanted to tonight.

2168
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:44,200
Yeah. And he was in the hit film Collision Course.

2169
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,800
Of course. Of course.

2170
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,840
We know that he was a star of the screen as well as the stage.

2171
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,360
But they really try to like sad sack it up, like, man,

2172
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,840
they pulled this guy out of the gutter.

2173
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,200
But like, well, I think in the long run, I think his sob story

2174
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,400
of the clubs, I think.

2175
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,720
I think that is all true.

2176
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:05,120
Yeah, sure. He tells weird stories about like he's doing a, you know,

2177
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:09,200
like he's doing stand up for at a library and there's no microphone.

2178
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,280
For three people. And that's all.

2179
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,160
I just don't think like right.

2180
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,960
Yeah, I think you've been successful for a few years.

2181
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,320
A pretty success, especially when he was doing guest

2182
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,680
because he was guest hosting for a little while there, too.

2183
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:26,880
When there's any disdain in the movie for Leno, it's fun.

2184
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:32,520
I like in the when Dave is making his ultimate decision of do I

2185
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:36,800
take the Tonight Show now that it's maybe back on the table

2186
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,880
or do I start my my own new thing?

2187
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,040
And he says, I don't want to, you know, I don't I just I don't want to lose the

2188
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,960
I can't lose this thing again.

2189
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:49,040
You know, I don't want to lose it first to Jay Leno.

2190
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:52,800
Says it was such to say it's a great performance from Higgett,

2191
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,120
just like chewing on the

2192
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:59,240
which to get back into stuff in the movie or in reality.

2193
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,880
Again, the ping pong match that that happens, they never offer it to Letterman.

2194
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,040
They make a secret deal with Leno.

2195
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,360
Letterman gets angry and starts to look elsewhere.

2196
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,000
He's offered shows by everywhere.

2197
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,160
He ends up getting an offer from CBS.

2198
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:14,640
He wants to take it.

2199
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,880
But he has one last conversation with the big boss of NBC.

2200
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,080
And suddenly he's offered the Tonight Show.

2201
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,720
They do just say, actually, do you want to do it?

2202
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,720
And Leno's been on the air for a while.

2203
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,560
His closet fears were justified.

2204
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,040
They did end up deciding we are going to take it away from Leno and give it to them.

2205
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,360
That is kind of a mind blow that they were just like, yeah, sure.

2206
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,480
Yeah, you know what? All right.

2207
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,200
Let us not screw it.

2208
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,360
We're doing that.

2209
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:45,480
And it is what happened again later, like in the with Leno and Conan,

2210
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,840
that it was just like, yeah, screw it.

2211
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,600
Like, like in both scenarios, NBC has been so flippant.

2212
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,560
We've had this plan. We built this set and everything.

2213
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,400
But like, yeah, you know, I never mind.

2214
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,280
Well, yeah. And then they offer it to him on a timetable, though, which is great.

2215
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:02,560
Crazy, too. Like I think if you were like it, maybe when I first saw this movie,

2216
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:07,040
I went into it thinking like and the big climax is that Jay gets the show.

2217
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,920
But Jay gets the show early.

2218
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,560
Yeah. In the timeline, there's still so much weirdness.

2219
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,600
Act. Yeah. Yeah.

2220
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,200
And it's all just like, and you know the ending, right?

2221
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,560
Because the shows are on.

2222
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,040
We know that Letterman went to CBS.

2223
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,720
There's no Tarantino and Glorious Basterds version

2224
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,600
for Letterman gets the Tonight Show.

2225
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:29,320
Although in your version, I think there should be and like takes a flamethrower to.

2226
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:31,680
Yes. Well, he takes on all his enemies.

2227
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,000
You see executives.

2228
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,920
What he likes to do is.

2229
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,680
Yes. You know,

2230
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,240
I didn't say good night, Jay.

2231
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:42,160
I did not realize that like Letterman beat Leno for.

2232
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:49,280
It seemed like until two years or nearly until they in the movie, they pin it to like,

2233
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,200
well, the Hugh Grant thing really skyrocketed.

2234
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,480
Jay, they didn't even.

2235
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,440
Yes. Yeah.

2236
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:59,320
They didn't even mention the OJ thing was likely just happening when this.

2237
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,480
Oh, that's true. That's the long term.

2238
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,760
Yeah. So Jay was such a baboon for.

2239
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,480
Yeah. Yeah.

2240
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:08,760
This is one of those things that does not make any sense to me now

2241
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,760
that it was all not going so good and Letterman's been in every night.

2242
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:17,320
And then Hugh Grant comes on and Leno says, what the hell are you thinking?

2243
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:19,600
And it's all different from there.

2244
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,480
What are you talking about?

2245
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:24,080
That seems so and we're maybe Jason, you're onto something where

2246
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,680
that's sort of this like folksy version of it.

2247
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
That doesn't make any sense.

2248
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,680
How could that one end like as I described that now,

2249
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:37,080
what sounds interesting enough about that to turn the entire fortunes of a TV show around?

2250
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:40,960
Yeah, that obsessed with Hugh Grant and prostitute.

2251
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,480
That was everyone was.

2252
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,560
I do remember watching that live.

2253
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,240
I have a really distinct memory of watching that live.

2254
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:48,960
Yeah. Well, it was a monoculture.

2255
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,240
I mean, everything was a lot smaller and popular.

2256
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,600
If there's any. Yeah.

2257
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:56,360
I mean, I think the way it's treated now is that that was some sort of magic thing

2258
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:02,040
that unlocked the reality is, is that that slot is for people,

2259
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:08,880
for older people that like a gentler touch and find maybe that fully exposed people

2260
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:12,440
that Jay is a gentler touch than what is my mom would always be like that.

2261
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,560
David Letterman is so sarcastic.

2262
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,480
Yeah, she did. And that's my family stick.

2263
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,880
That's absolutely I think the reason Jay ended up on top is because Jay shaved off

2264
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,960
because Jay was a little edgier if you watch his old like Letterman appearances.

2265
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:27,600
Jay sort of shaved those edges off of his own performance.

2266
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,600
And I think it's slowly.

2267
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,840
I think that's the perfect moment when like more eyes were on him.

2268
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,920
I don't know if I don't know how the ratings broke down.

2269
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,160
I'm sure it's more complicated than just that one.

2270
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,160
And then it was perfect from there.

2271
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:42,360
But it is it is maybe the moment when more moms were like this.

2272
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:45,600
Jay, I like him. He's being a little cheeky with Hugh.

2273
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,360
But like that that story, I do think captured moms' imaginations everywhere

2274
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,120
because they all loved Hugh Grant. My mom loved Hugh Grant.

2275
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:57,600
Uh huh. Moms across the nation loved this man Hugh Grant.

2276
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,720
And then he was with a prostitute, like couldn't wrap their head.

2277
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:04,560
A Hollywood an actor in Hollywood with a prostitute.

2278
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,840
Like it just blew suburban moms minds.

2279
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:12,680
Yeah. And it all converged in a perfect moment with a nicer talk show host

2280
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:17,120
being a little cheeky with him. Letterman would have been really like severe about it.

2281
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,520
But this was a cute little way to say it.

2282
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,560
Yeah. And I think that have fun together.

2283
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,560
I'm sure the numbers break down differently, but I bet that's all.

2284
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,960
It's a big stew.

2285
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,680
And it all adds up to that moment.

2286
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:32,920
That's when you can point to, at least where it's like the Tonight Show needs to be

2287
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:36,400
about like settling differences, everybody being nice.

2288
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:40,600
If there's somebody you disagree with, maybe ruffle their hair playfully.

2289
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:45,200
Zach, that's what the Tonight Show is simpler times before the president

2290
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:49,320
has enough of the United States as a fair with porn pornography actor.

2291
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,960
So when that's just the tip of the iceberg, the awful.

2292
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,040
Yeah, it was outrageous what the British man did with the British man

2293
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,760
from four weddings and a funeral.

2294
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,040
Did your moms like Hugh Grant?

2295
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,320
Do you remember that?

2296
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,720
I do have a distinct. My mom really liked Hugh Grant.

2297
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,240
I my parents stopped following popular culture.

2298
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,080
OK, like we did.

2299
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,360
They only went to the movies if we wanted to see them.

2300
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,800
I'd like to know left at the listener out there.

2301
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,600
Did your mom like Hugh Grant?

2302
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:20,800
My mom, I don't I don't know if she ever spoke on that subject,

2303
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,840
but I do remember a lot of like, oh, you know who I just love is that Mel Gibson.

2304
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,280
OK, what a nice upstanding Christian.

2305
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,160
That is a role model.

2306
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:32,000
That is a good man.

2307
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,360
Interesting. He's a little handsome, too. Sure.

2308
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:37,360
That doesn't hurt. That is the.

2309
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,120
My mom like Tom Cruise a lot.

2310
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:45,160
And then I think the couch stuff, I think she wasn't so into it after that.

2311
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:48,000
Did your mom have an actor, though?

2312
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,520
She even an older interesting question.

2313
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,360
Oh, I'm trying to make crushes.

2314
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,560
Mom crushes. You know what?

2315
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,840
It's funny. I didn't put together.

2316
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,800
I saw his name in the credits and I but I didn't put together.

2317
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,600
That was him in the movie because they look so young.

2318
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:07,000
My mom was vacationing like on a tiny island in New England.

2319
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:11,400
And she's like, they were treat Williams was here filming a movie.

2320
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:14,160
And I think it's called the senator of the Congress.

2321
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,720
It's on like it's one of those movies now that you can find on

2322
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,640
Canopy and Hoopla, Netflix and like Pluto.

2323
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:23,080
And it's it's on all streaming services.

2324
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:26,880
But she was very excited to see Treat Williams.

2325
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,400
OK, Reed Williams, I think was he on Everwood?

2326
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,320
Was he the father on that? Oh, I don't know.

2327
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,600
Show Everwood.

2328
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,920
My mom did have a run her and my brother, I feel like.

2329
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:41,080
It felt like I went off to college and I came back and it's like,

2330
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,400
oh, we watch all this.

2331
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,160
The WB show we watch on the scene.

2332
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,320
Oh, I was like, oh, OK.

2333
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,720
Everyone in the house is really into Gilmer girls now.

2334
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,640
I go I go out of town for three months.

2335
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,080
Everything changes.

2336
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:56,400
Everything changes.

2337
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,440
A lot has changed.

2338
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:01,280
Let's talk about Treat Williams is as Michael Overt's a little bit,

2339
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,600
because the main thing I realized when I was watching this, this is this like

2340
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:12,040
just very like it's just such a slick, well spoken agent portrayal.

2341
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:17,480
The most in control person, the most the nicest dressed, sharp haircut.

2342
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:22,080
And I realized like I've now had two occasions on which to

2343
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,080
pick between several people who is going to be my agent.

2344
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:30,720
And I just realized I think both times I have picked somebody based on

2345
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,880
who most resembles Treat Williams as Michael Overt's.

2346
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,160
If you if I were to show you pictures of both of the people

2347
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,400
who have been my agent, like you go, yeah, totally.

2348
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,360
Scott's got a type that is like Jason's mom.

2349
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,480
Yeah, I got a treat on the brain.

2350
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:49,640
Yeah, the only one who likes treats.

2351
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,760
In the family.

2352
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:59,640
I yeah, I I think the stories about real life,

2353
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,880
Michael Overt's are a little less hinged.

2354
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,840
I would I would say the portrayal is going to be very hinged.

2355
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,880
Like, yeah, yeah, so calm.

2356
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,640
Yeah, so collected.

2357
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:12,560
It makes me personally angry that a star of your stature has been treated.

2358
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,560
This is what I want people to be saying about me.

2359
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:17,640
It makes me personally angry that a star of Scott's stature

2360
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
has been treated this poorly by.

2361
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,280
I assume that's what they're all saying in places.

2362
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:27,440
But yes, then the real life, Michael Overt's goes to Disney,

2363
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,680
essentially replaces Katzenberg.

2364
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,960
Yes. Correct.

2365
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,480
But sort of shits the bed or isn't allowed to really do much of anything.

2366
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,520
They really made no impact.

2367
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,480
Do anything.

2368
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:42,400
I think it's after I think it coincides with Eisner's heart problems.

2369
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:46,440
But Eisner still like is not sharing a lot of responsibility.

2370
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:49,040
Yeah. Yeah. Didn't learn anything.

2371
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:51,480
Yeah. Well, I'll address this in the Eisner film.

2372
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:54,960
I think every I think everyone was still a little sad

2373
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,120
and didn't know what to do with Frank Wells going.

2374
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:01,720
And then like every there's a lot of feelings of betrayal by like Katzenberg.

2375
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,800
Kind of Brianna Maynard.

2376
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:10,880
Like his golden parachute out of there, which was litigated for years.

2377
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:16,200
The money that he was by simple contracts, probably owed those millions of dollars.

2378
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,000
At Katzenberg or Overt's.

2379
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Katzenberg. Well, both of them, I think.

2380
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,520
Yeah. Right.

2381
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:23,040
About Overt's that he got such a massive severance

2382
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,640
and then stockholders tried to stop it.

2383
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,080
Like, why is our money going to that?

2384
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,560
But then it held up that he did keep it.

2385
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:31,880
Yeah. And I think the same thing happened with like,

2386
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:35,960
I think Katzenberg had negotiated like, you know,

2387
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,560
I am entitled to X percentage if these movies are successful.

2388
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:42,240
And those movies were so successful.

2389
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,760
The gold. The second Golden Age of Disney.

2390
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,080
Animation is right. Right.

2391
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,920
And they tried to stiffen on it when he let like when he was getting out of there.

2392
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,160
Yeah. Yeah.

2393
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,680
Deal's a deal. Yeah.

2394
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:56,360
He's entitled to that and he's entitled to his cut of the Roku sale.

2395
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:59,280
That's right. And Roku bought 50 stages of freight,

2396
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:02,000
50 states of freight, whatever it is.

2397
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,760
Yeah. And the check.

2398
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,040
I bought the golden arm. Yeah.

2399
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,160
Give him his $21.

2400
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,800
But so, yeah, Overt's weird run at Disney doesn't work out so well.

2401
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,040
Then he starts some other like agency type thing.

2402
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,600
And then it falls apart and he flames out in this horrible way

2403
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,160
where he says all these insane things, including the phrase that

2404
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,040
that really jumps out where he gave this weird interview.

2405
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:25,960
And he said that his downfall was brought about by the gay mafia.

2406
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:30,080
This horrible phrase that has stuck to him ever since.

2407
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,560
That's such an insane thing.

2408
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:35,400
That's like even in the 90s where you watch like 90s comedies and you're like,

2409
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,200
oh, man, how that joke wouldn't fly nowadays.

2410
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,720
But like, just I'm surprised there wasn't like a Zucker Brothers

2411
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:44,120
ripoff movie called the gay mafia. Oh, yeah.

2412
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,720
She's they're all in the suits, but they're pink.

2413
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:52,080
Oh, my God. I can I can I just the whole movie's been written now in my head.

2414
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,760
I can see all of it.

2415
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:54,440
What a nightmare.

2416
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,760
You know, Dom DeLuis is in there. Oh, yeah.

2417
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,520
He's ammin it up. Sure.

2418
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,680
I love all the like the setting up the thing.

2419
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,840
We can't stop people from talking to us.

2420
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,760
We reverse the process.

2421
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,520
And he's not even thinking about what he's saying.

2422
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,680
He's just like washing his hands or whatever and being fastidious.

2423
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,520
Like Gus and Breaking Bad.

2424
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,880
It's like, I know I'm like re evaluating the way that a TV show can be sold.

2425
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,000
And then you get this great parade of people from all the networks.

2426
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,240
CBS, who ends up

2427
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,760
getting work, they ended up getting Letterman.

2428
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,960
But then you get Eiger, you get your little Eiger portrayal.

2429
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,280
What do we think of this Eiger portrayal?

2430
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,680
It doesn't seem right, does it?

2431
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,520
Well, he wasn't as known then. Yeah.

2432
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,600
Really? They're they're basing it on a photograph.

2433
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:41,080
Yeah, it's like the guy is like to like you like kind of a like surfery guy.

2434
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:46,520
Like, not like a bro, but like he's like really like a hair flowy, handsome.

2435
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,560
Eiger is much more like kind of buttoned down handsome guy.

2436
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:53,000
But he was a mover and shaker at ABC, like that.

2437
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,240
Sure. Yeah. Not owned by Disney at that point,

2438
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:58,000
because if you notice, they mentioned Eisner coming into pitch Disney.

2439
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,680
Eiger is there on the have of ABC.

2440
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:01,760
Still two entities.

2441
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:07,160
I think Cap City was the name of the owners of ABC.

2442
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:13,960
And so like, yeah, Eiger is because Eiger was so like well regarded at ABC.

2443
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:17,920
And I'd like climb the ranks that like when they got bought by Disney,

2444
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:22,240
that like he, you know, got in pretty, pretty quick.

2445
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,720
Yeah. I mean, so this guy's embodying like the kind of like slick Eisner guy,

2446
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:31,320
but maybe is not accurate to like what Eisner's essence is.

2447
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:34,800
Yeah. Yeah. There's no Eisner. There's not a false Eisner.

2448
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,200
There's no Eisner in this work.

2449
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:39,400
And you got to dock a lot of points, not just some a lot of points.

2450
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:43,960
Yeah. I bet I have to give this movie a D because there's no Eisner trail in it.

2451
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:45,200
Yeah, that's a real bummer.

2452
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:48,240
But you got a little Eiger, you get a little fake Eiger.

2453
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,640
You get a you get Mr. Ernst from Hey Dude, somebody.

2454
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:57,440
He's like a syndication guy, but Letterman does not want to be on.

2455
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,400
He hates syndication. Letterman hates and then Jay, of course, now is syndicated.

2456
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,880
That's right. He's happy to do it.

2457
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,880
Again, the difference between the two men.

2458
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,800
You also have a portrayal of

2459
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:11,760
Brandon Tartikoff, an Eisner figure that we've talked about.

2460
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,840
Right. So showed up as himself in things.

2461
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:18,800
And again, I would question the accuracy, unfortunately, because I am so

2462
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,400
we're all so versed in Brandon Tartikoff.

2463
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:25,400
Yeah, of course, because he did so many as we have yet to do.

2464
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,320
Yeah. Talk more about his intro. Right.

2465
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:31,000
Is his sort of Eisner like intros and stuff video like his

2466
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:34,520
he performed a little bit is what we hosted Saturday Night Live.

2467
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,760
Well, yes. Yeah.

2468
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,560
And then he would. Yeah. He'd show up in very special episodes.

2469
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,800
Right. And he was on Alf. He made a solid Alf appearance. Yes.

2470
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:44,120
So that one's not.

2471
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,480
So, you know, I do.

2472
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,960
You got look, you got the executives or I'm sorry,

2473
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:51,680
you got the host, Leno and Letterman close and you did your prosthetics

2474
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:54,280
and your wigs. Let's get closer with these executives.

2475
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,880
We all know them. Yeah.

2476
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,640
We they're icons to us. We know Tartikoff.

2477
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,320
We know Iger. Yeah.

2478
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:03,920
I'm sure it pulled people right out of the movie when they saw these.

2479
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:05,880
They were like, that's not Bob Iger.

2480
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:07,920
No, so many people.

2481
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,600
That's not his. That's not right.

2482
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,400
They turned it right off.

2483
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,320
Facial structure whatsoever.

2484
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,960
But that's all fun.

2485
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:18,560
Then you've got somebody you have somebody playing himself.

2486
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:19,600
I want to give this a shout out.

2487
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,880
Another person I love who I always love a good cameo.

2488
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:23,240
Oh, yeah. It's so weird.

2489
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:25,200
He doesn't get anything to do. Little Richard.

2490
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:29,920
It's just a connective tissue piece that is nothing.

2491
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,560
Helen has been fired. Yeah.

2492
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,560
And then Jay gives a speech to the crew to say, I'm sorry about that.

2493
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,160
All Helen thing.

2494
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,960
And in the middle, it's just like a little slice of life

2495
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:43,200
meant to show that the tonight show is back and better than ever.

2496
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,160
Jay, all those problems are in the past.

2497
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:48,320
And now he's having a good old time with Little Richard.

2498
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,680
And it's so weird.

2499
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:54,920
But all Jay's doing is like, OK, that was a little richer.

2500
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,520
OK, we'll see you tomorrow.

2501
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:01,280
And Little Richard is just going, whoo, yeah, whoo.

2502
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:06,360
And I just like to imagine that that's what a full seven minute segment was.

2503
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:11,120
Just them kind of like teetering around and slapping their knees and yelling,

2504
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:12,800
whoo, there were no stories.

2505
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,120
He just came out and started doing that for maybe for two seconds.

2506
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:18,160
The funnier. Yeah, that's a funnier way to do it.

2507
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,080
Yeah, that's funny to.

2508
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:24,360
Well, it's funny to contrast the scene of Jay with a guest with earlier

2509
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,360
in the movie with David Letterman and Sandra Bernhardt. Oh, yeah.

2510
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,120
Like, don't be a what's your fucking brought?

2511
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,480
Tell it to your therapist.

2512
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:34,160
Cards as I hate myself. Yeah. Yeah.

2513
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:37,160
Yeah. Do you think and I wonder, is there a deleted scene

2514
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:40,360
where Jay talks to Little Richard because it feels like there should be

2515
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:42,880
where you think I should do a little Richard? What do you think?

2516
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,320
Yeah. Oh, yes.

2517
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,960
A little bit like whatever.

2518
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:49,760
Like, I don't know, because it feels like such a I mean,

2519
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:52,080
you got to do what you got to walk up a little bit.

2520
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:54,040
There you go. Yeah, that's better.

2521
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:55,400
Yeah. Thanks so much.

2522
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:58,440
And then they're like, that's the impetus for him getting rid of Helen or something.

2523
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:02,360
It feels like Larry Sanders in this moment, too, where this would always

2524
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,760
look, Larry, it would be the show.

2525
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:07,280
And then they cut like to that close up, like in the Sandra Bernhardt scene

2526
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,240
where there would be a little scene.

2527
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:12,320
But you get Little Richard on, you're not going to do any talking with it.

2528
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,760
It feels like there may be something cut here. I could be wrong.

2529
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,280
Love to dying for that.

2530
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,720
I would watch every. Yeah.

2531
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:21,320
From this. Is there like an old DVD with outtakes?

2532
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,840
I don't believe so. Yeah.

2533
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:27,560
I don't think that was I don't think HBO was keeping an eye on that kind of thing.

2534
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:30,360
There's not a hunger for that.

2535
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:32,720
It hasn't entered the criterion yet.

2536
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,080
I mean, it will post. It's in our personal.

2537
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:38,240
I mean, if we're discussing it in the criterion closet.

2538
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:41,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where's a late shift in here?

2539
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:45,280
Like just like frantically throwing the DVDs, Blu-rays on the floor.

2540
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:49,960
I got I got the real 10 months and you know, late shift, obviously.

2541
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,360
And we don't have that in here.

2542
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,120
Oh, yeah, you do. I have it. I brought it.

2543
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:55,560
I brought it on the shelf. I got it somewhere else.

2544
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,560
You're going to put a bunch of

2545
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:02,120
classic films in a closet and not include the ultimate film

2546
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:03,640
hinging on a closet.

2547
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,720
And you have both. That's a very good point.

2548
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:11,720
Sorry. There's a gap between Lestrade and the Nels.

2549
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:12,760
Do you think.

2550
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:13,560
Long live.

2551
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:17,080
I mean, you have a long goodbye.

2552
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,160
Late. I'm just not seeing it.

2553
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:21,280
Did who is in here was a bill hater in here earlier and he took it.

2554
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,400
Is there anything you didn't have anymore?

2555
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:26,720
Yeah, people. Yeah, people just they do the videos and then they just pocket

2556
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,800
the DVD onto these guys.

2557
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,680
Yeah, yeah, that must be the only reason.

2558
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:34,360
Right. If you on the room and you pick out DVDs, you have to leave with them.

2559
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:35,760
Right. I think so.

2560
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,680
You really you do.

2561
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:40,600
I mean, they are criterion so they can just replace them.

2562
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,160
Yeah, I feel like I'm a way.

2563
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:43,440
I always thought that they got to keep it.

2564
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,760
You know, you don't know what we're talking about.

2565
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:46,360
There's videos, those little videos.

2566
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,800
I think they're paid in the stack of DVD.

2567
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:51,480
There's videos that we don't know on YouTube for the Criterion Collection,

2568
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:54,480
which is like, you know, like they make an whatever

2569
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,000
prestige version of a Blu Ray release or DVD release of an old movie

2570
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,200
that they think is like a classier movie or something or as a merit.

2571
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:05,360
And then they send a celebrity into this closet with all their prestige things

2572
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:06,880
and they pick out things they like.

2573
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,760
But I think they get to keep it.

2574
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:11,160
It's so you think it's like it's a cash grab.

2575
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,080
It's like a money booth.

2576
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:15,360
It's like when the kids at KB Toys would get to put whatever they want

2577
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,400
in their cart because they had a shopping spree.

2578
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,760
It's like a gifting. Yeah.

2579
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:20,640
But it's a much more it's like they pick five.

2580
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:23,000
They don't throw everything into the basket.

2581
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:26,480
Amoeba Records has a like what's in my bag sort of thing, too,

2582
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,600
with musicians and actors and stuff.

2583
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:29,920
I'm not sure they keep that.

2584
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,280
They keep those. That might be it.

2585
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,560
They may have to pay. But they might.

2586
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,600
Yeah, they might just buy them because they want them. Right.

2587
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,080
They just start shopping.

2588
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,080
I don't know.

2589
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:41,640
Do we know anyone who's been on the Criterion Closet series?

2590
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,080
Yeah, I don't know if we do.

2591
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,200
If I get a meeting with Bill Hader, that's the first thing I'll ask.

2592
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,000
Meeting with him to be his assistant.

2593
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,080
I hope not. I hope I have it.

2594
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,120
I mean, nice job. You can get it.

2595
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:59,040
Wala Sean has been in the closet, right?

2596
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:01,320
We don't know him.

2597
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:02,920
And that's true. We don't.

2598
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:05,320
Which I know you beat yourself up every day.

2599
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:08,600
Yeah, I self-flagellate every day.

2600
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:12,440
I take I take shredder and I poke myself with shredder every day

2601
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:14,480
that I'm not good friends with Wala Sean.

2602
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:16,280
But that's not a sex thing.

2603
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:20,920
That is a non-sexual self-flagellation for not being friends

2604
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:23,200
with Da Vinci code. You're doing it for your sin.

2605
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:28,480
Exactly. Six years ago, Andre Gregory and Wala Sean in the Criterion Closet.

2606
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:29,840
Go right to YouTube.

2607
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:32,480
That is the mildest thing anyone's ever slapped their knee about.

2608
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,120
Wow. Andre.

2609
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:38,560
Nobody's ever raised their voice about Andre Gregory before.

2610
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:42,080
The closest has come is when when we saw a play that was directed

2611
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,720
by Andre Gregory, starring and written by Wala Sean and Ryan Perez

2612
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:47,000
went up to Andre Gregory.

2613
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,800
This one's becoming it.

2614
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,680
Have I sold it more than twice?

2615
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:54,280
I was listening to an episode where you told it and I know you've told it before.

2616
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:56,280
That's such a fun. I love the story so much.

2617
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:57,240
You're obsessed with Ryan Perez.

2618
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:59,280
I'm so excited about it.

2619
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,160
With that, have I even told another Ryan Perez story

2620
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:03,200
other than in the Andre Gregory context?

2621
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:05,440
I don't know. But I know you've told that one.

2622
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:07,600
I love it. It was his birthday.

2623
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,320
It was Andre Gregory's birthday.

2624
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:11,600
OK. Oh, the cake. You weren't sure.

2625
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:12,560
You keep telling this.

2626
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,960
I've never seen this movie and I don't know who Andre Gregory is.

2627
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,400
I know about the movie.

2628
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:20,400
But you tell this as if like, guys, Andre Gregory.

2629
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:21,400
It's so fun.

2630
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,680
I'm sure it's good. He seems like so nice.

2631
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,080
Yeah. He was telling people at the party, you have to come up to the lake.

2632
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,400
We've told this story.

2633
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:31,240
We have to talk about it. It's so fun.

2634
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:32,280
Anyway, what?

2635
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:36,320
Just because it's two hours into the late shift episode of our theme park podcast.

2636
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:40,360
I shouldn't might not have time for our already told Andre Gregory material.

2637
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,200
What do we do?

2638
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,960
Oh, OK, here's what I got.

2639
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:48,160
The music in the movie. Oh, yeah.

2640
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:49,440
I have a couple of selects.

2641
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,800
Yes, good. Yes.

2642
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:55,360
The music is like if you ever see Larry Sanders, it's such a night.

2643
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:00,240
The theme to Larry Sanders is such a very like early 90s sort of synthesized.

2644
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,640
What would you call the genre of music?

2645
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:07,680
Yeah, like like I was going to say the phrase uptown funk.

2646
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:08,840
That's not correct. That's a song.

2647
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:13,600
No, you could call any song heard in that show or this movie uptown.

2648
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,360
That's true. Yeah.

2649
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:16,280
Uptown.

2650
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,520
You know, Larry Sanders.

2651
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,440
Yeah.

2652
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:21,960
I don't think I'm going to be able to be with all like that.

2653
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:25,000
See, though, because this is when the hip cats come out.

2654
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,400
Yeah, it's all like Casio groove.

2655
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:32,160
But like very like it sounds cheesy and I don't I like it, but it sounds kind of cheesy.

2656
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,240
This movie is filled with those type of grooves,

2657
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,480
but then also like stuff that's a little sexy.

2658
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:41,960
There's like sort of like, yeah, kind of like a little like film.

2659
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:46,960
It's like there are cues that would play after like the

2660
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:48,800
like the film Fatale.

2661
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,960
Yeah, but it plays when fake Jay Leno is driving a classic car.

2662
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:54,320
Yeah. So here's two.

2663
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:57,120
I have two of them and hopefully you can hear this.

2664
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:59,080
I just really appreciate this.

2665
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,640
It's just awfully nice of you.

2666
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,240
Yeah.

2667
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,960
Thanks. Good luck, Dave.

2668
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:16,160
This is for rich little as Johnny Carson talking to you.

2669
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,560
Your red shoe diaries.

2670
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:19,600
It is.

2671
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:24,320
It sounds like Axel Foley got his badge and gun taken away,

2672
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:27,520
but met with his confidential informant anyway.

2673
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,560
Like, it sounds like a cop movie.

2674
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,240
Yeah, but it is sexy.

2675
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:35,400
Like we just watched Beverly Hills Cop actually a couple of months ago,

2676
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:36,560
but it's just a little sexy.

2677
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:38,280
It's a little sexier.

2678
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:41,000
It's it's like treading the line.

2679
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,200
This one is a little bit more what I was just talking about.

2680
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:45,920
It's like I got a groove to it and it's a little longer of a clip.

2681
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:46,720
OK.

2682
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:54,160
This is like the climax of the movie, too, when they're walking from NBC to CBS.

2683
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,080
But this sounds like a little like Letterman.

2684
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:05,960
Yeah, but also a little like tonight at the Megadome.

2685
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,440
Leigh Hawn's big.

2686
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,680
And welcome to Epcot Center.

2687
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:23,480
Sin horns.

2688
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,920
Yeah, tonight, Bobcat Gold weight.

2689
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,600
Like, yeah, so like that there's it's full.

2690
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,320
The movie is full of stuff like that.

2691
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:34,360
Sexy stuff like that first one or like detective stuff like that.

2692
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:35,720
Whatever you want to call it.

2693
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:37,840
When you're dealing with Johnny Carson,

2694
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,360
an intimate conversation with Johnny Carson and David Letterman.

2695
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:45,760
But yeah, the music in the whole thing, I wish that soundtrack was available.

2696
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:48,920
Well, I have the main theme burrowed into my brain.

2697
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:49,360
Yeah.

2698
02:03:57,120 --> 02:03:58,600
I don't know why it again.

2699
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:59,360
Like, what is that?

2700
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,360
Do we again?

2701
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:01,560
We might be muddying the waters.

2702
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:02,800
Are we making fun of it or not?

2703
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,680
I think it is just this like, yeah, it's this pleasant movie.

2704
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:08,680
You'd never call this like an edgy movie or hard to watch movie.

2705
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:11,720
It's just like you're in all these like peach rooms

2706
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:16,760
looking at guys in brown suits who get kind of mad at each other, but not that much.

2707
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,280
Even Helen doesn't.

2708
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:21,800
She pushes everything off the desk at some point, but like

2709
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,240
nobody's really at risk of getting hurt.

2710
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:26,400
It's such a TV movie.

2711
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:29,240
Yes. And every way the best way.

2712
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:33,040
Yeah. Production wise, it's not something that looks like a major like.

2713
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:36,080
I appreciate that about the movie that they didn't like

2714
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:40,240
try to make it like this stakes are high for this because it's at the end of the day.

2715
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:44,200
It's a bunch of millionaires making decisions about other millionaires.

2716
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:45,600
You gives a shit.

2717
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:49,040
So I'm glad they didn't like try to like frost Nixon it or something

2718
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:51,120
and like make it so feeling so important.

2719
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:52,080
Yeah, yeah.

2720
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:55,440
There was some that was a compliment that my wife, Aaron, paid it

2721
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,880
because I made her watch it all from the back.

2722
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:01,360
Who she is from time to time walked into a room

2723
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:05,000
where I am watching a scene of the late shift and says, you're watching this again.

2724
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,880
Yeah. And I say kind of what Jason said, which is like, no,

2725
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:09,920
sometimes I just go in and watch scenes that I like.

2726
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:12,680
Like, I like when Helen gets fired or I like when Helen

2727
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:15,920
has a fight with Ken Craig and the country.

2728
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,200
Yes. So I just go and I like pick the things that I like.

2729
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,880
And she kind of never understood and was disdainful of the movie.

2730
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:23,480
She watched the movie and enjoyed it.

2731
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:26,880
Some of the things that she said were, I think you could take all of the scenes

2732
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,720
and shuffle them up in a bag and then spit them back out.

2733
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,680
And then we would work the same. That's right.

2734
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:32,880
Because it is confusing.

2735
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:36,720
We're like, Leno has the show and then he keeps having the show.

2736
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,480
And like, which why is why are they having this meeting now?

2737
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:44,480
And I and she also said, yeah, then it's just a nice, pleasant, like low stakes.

2738
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,840
And I said, look, I got to disagree with you there.

2739
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:51,400
I mean, when Letterman realizes that Bob Wright is offering in the show,

2740
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:54,320
but it's only for seven to 12 million with CBS has already said

2741
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:58,520
12 is the base and he's going to have to wait for 18 months, potentially.

2742
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:59,880
You don't call that stakes.

2743
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:01,800
And it's looking down from below him.

2744
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,320
And there's a bunch of pencils on the ceiling and the angles are all crooked.

2745
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:08,920
You're telling me that's not a high stakes diocene.

2746
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:12,640
Pencils on the ceiling was a go to,

2747
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,120
I feel like in movies and TV to go like,

2748
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:20,080
huh, this guy might be a genius, but he's a little nutty.

2749
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:21,960
He's got something on his mind.

2750
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:23,240
You know, yeah, yeah.

2751
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:26,320
Throw in the pencils in the drop tile ceiling.

2752
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:28,560
This is a real bad grab back with Scott said,

2753
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:31,520
I think we talked about this on the show before, is that this is another thing

2754
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,560
where like Lindsay is like, you want to watch the late shift again?

2755
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,720
Where I don't know. There's like, we like this.

2756
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:39,880
I don't. Yeah, there is a weird.

2757
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:42,840
It is. I mean, I hate to like, again, in the show, like paint, like,

2758
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:44,640
oh, the women are upset at the men again.

2759
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:46,160
But it is not correct.

2760
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:47,520
They're not. They're not wrong.

2761
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,600
They're not wrong. And it's not like, boy, you.

2762
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,880
I found your sports illustrated swimsuit edition again, either for some weird reason.

2763
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,560
We have a couple of these.

2764
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:59,240
This very Scott and I, especially with this similar.

2765
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,080
Well, that would never happen with you.

2766
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:02,680
No, my God.

2767
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:06,920
Have I seen the sports illustrated swimsuit edition through the glass

2768
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:10,320
of a 7-Eleven before and said, oh, OK, and then walked by?

2769
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:12,720
Yes. But I would never, never purchase it.

2770
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:15,680
That cover the porn magazines that don't show you the.

2771
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,000
Yeah, you put it behind one.

2772
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,800
Yeah, you choose to like, only take these slips without looking at the.

2773
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,720
I went. I went 7-Eleven to 7-Eleven to put them behind

2774
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:29,120
just to make sure it's just for the decency printed out some decency covers.

2775
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:30,200
This is free of charge.

2776
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,800
Do you mind? It'll just take a minute.

2777
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,480
Yeah. So no, for whatever reason,

2778
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:38,560
in the same way that I will put on

2779
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,880
like just a random attack of the clones scene.

2780
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:43,200
And he goes, what are you doing?

2781
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:44,680
I go, well, I just didn't know what to do.

2782
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,480
I was kind of my phone.

2783
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:48,120
So I just put it like attack of the clones. Yeah. Yeah.

2784
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,400
I don't know.

2785
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:53,120
The scene with C3PO gets his head taken off

2786
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:55,600
and it's put on the belt.

2787
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,840
The Senate meeting with Renny Santoni,

2788
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,240
the name of the guy who plays Poppy. Yeah, no.

2789
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,640
But coincidentally, he's also a senator in attack of the clone.

2790
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:07,800
And what's the name of Swift Swift Swift for Swiffer Mellow?

2791
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,360
What's the first Valomilk?

2792
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:12,080
Sifir's Valomilk.

2793
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,440
I'm sure first of all, I'm from the Imperial Senate.

2794
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,560
Someone call for fan art for that.

2795
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:22,880
Sifir's Valomilk in the Senate next to the ET one.

2796
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,480
Next to Zrek.

2797
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:28,680
But she was there any did she watch it with you?

2798
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,760
Yeah, we watched it many years ago.

2799
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,680
She watched it and I think she was fine with it.

2800
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:35,160
I just don't think she knew why I was fascinated with it.

2801
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:38,920
Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is I kept asking her and like, do you know, like,

2802
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:43,800
like, does what does what's happening in the scene mean?

2803
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:48,880
Because I'm a I'm a freak who knows who all the executives being mentioned.

2804
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:51,120
I know Dick Carousel is right.

2805
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:55,160
If you're like and I've read the book, so I have the Cliff Notes to her,

2806
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:59,480
like the you know, the like the here's the encyclopedia related to the movie.

2807
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:03,800
And she said, no, I don't know what's happening, but it's all nice

2808
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:05,680
shots to look at.

2809
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:07,920
And I like when these music cues come in.

2810
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,800
Yeah, like looking at these weird prosthetics.

2811
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:13,920
It is a pleasure. She found it to be a pleasant watch.

2812
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:17,200
Yeah, I think for, again, men and maybe women of a certain age

2813
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:20,040
who were like watching, because I have such memories,

2814
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,760
especially during the summer when we could stay up a little later.

2815
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:26,600
I just have memories of what just mainlining these shows.

2816
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:29,560
The Leno and Letterman. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

2817
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:32,280
I did that with Conan. Sure. Yeah.

2818
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:35,240
But like, especially when I was little, little, little, little,

2819
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:37,560
because then I didn't really watch Conan until I was a little older

2820
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:39,000
and I got it more.

2821
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,400
And I mean, older like, yeah, 13 or something.

2822
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:44,320
But like, yeah, I remember when when it's you, Grant, 94.

2823
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,600
Is that right? A little later than I.

2824
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:47,960
Is it like 95? Yeah.

2825
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Like, I guess 9, 10, 11.

2826
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,880
And during the summer, we would watch Nick at night.

2827
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:55,760
We would watch old TV because they have the block party.

2828
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,360
So we would watch.

2829
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,880
I know all about the block party.

2830
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,520
Two episodes of Dick Van Dyke, two episodes of whatever.

2831
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:04,120
Dobie Gillis, I don't know.

2832
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:07,400
And then watch go back and forth between Leto and Letterman.

2833
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:10,480
I see. So I guess what they're what they have, what they're doing.

2834
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:14,320
Yeah. So I think that's probably why certain people have.

2835
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,400
Yeah. And I think it's weird for a kid

2836
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,800
to gravitate to these talk show hosts.

2837
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,320
So if you are that type of kid, which I was,

2838
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,880
which I feel like my comedic evolution was like,

2839
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:28,600
I got some of the simple stuff out of the way early.

2840
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,680
Like I watched Leno, which was just like, here's a parody.

2841
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:38,120
He does a song and it's not the words of the song that, you know,

2842
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:41,880
and he has a guy come out who's dressed as the president and it's not the president.

2843
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:43,440
And then you can advance.

2844
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:46,200
Like, OK, so this is just this is like comedy preschool.

2845
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:51,160
Yeah. And you can advance to smarter Conan and the better SNL and that kind of stuff.

2846
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:52,840
Yeah, for sure.

2847
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:58,080
I think with like Letterman, see, like my first memories are like Rupert G.

2848
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:03,440
And I go, oh, when when someone is weird to a stranger, that's funny.

2849
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,240
When somebody says jerky things to a stranger and acts like a maniac.

2850
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:10,400
That I like that a lot.

2851
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:12,800
That is that that's good.

2852
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:16,720
That's some of my earliest like, oh, comedy that got it.

2853
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:19,880
I even remember the summer of like Manny the hippie.

2854
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:22,040
Do you recall this character? No.

2855
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:25,160
There was a guy. It was a summer of Letterman.

2856
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,520
There was a guy named Manny who was just like a guy who like this man.

2857
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:34,680
And they would check in with Manny the hippie like all the time during this summer.

2858
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,480
I don't think it was even that funny.

2859
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:39,320
But at the time, I was like, wow, that's a goofy character.

2860
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:41,080
I like him. That's funny.

2861
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:43,240
Was it just a weirdo or was it just a weirdo?

2862
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:45,640
Oh, just a weirdo. I think you could have fooled me.

2863
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,520
But I think it was just some guy they found out a remote

2864
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:50,400
and they just check in with him. Yeah. During the summer.

2865
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:51,600
I don't know what happened to him.

2866
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:53,960
Well, they were like these shows were like your conduits.

2867
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:55,160
There weren't a zillion things.

2868
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:58,240
These felt like the conduits to to edgy comedy.

2869
02:11:58,240 --> 02:12:02,360
So they were important and the guys represented different philosophies.

2870
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:05,440
And then the idea that they were like in this war together,

2871
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:07,760
these very different guys, but that they were friends.

2872
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,160
That's the Shakespearean.

2873
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:11,560
You know, I wish there were more things where they they talked.

2874
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:13,560
This kind of only that one scene at the Emmys because they don't

2875
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:15,200
only create some fake scene.

2876
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:17,760
And again, they don't frost Nixon with his drunken phone call.

2877
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:20,080
It didn't happen for dramatic effect.

2878
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,080
And that's sort of what you know, you wish there was more,

2879
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:24,840
but they don't falsify. Yeah.

2880
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:28,200
And it's so funny to think about now, there's just a million late night shows

2881
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:31,520
and they're all fighting for like the smallest pieces of the pie.

2882
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:37,120
When back then they were like late night, made us seventy million dollars this year

2883
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:39,600
and figure that out, whatever that is with inflation.

2884
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:44,880
But it's like that was yeah, it was huge when the culture was,

2885
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:46,800
you know, much more narrow.

2886
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:49,760
And with Letterman, you have the creation of that slot.

2887
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,320
There wasn't that now we know, OK, so who will take over the CBS lot?

2888
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:54,520
But that just didn't exist.

2889
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:57,960
And they they made it exist for him and moved heaven and earth.

2890
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:01,720
They bought early on, they bought Leno a motorcycle instead of riding on over.

2891
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:06,600
That's a good part.

2892
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:11,960
I like when they the one of the CBS executives walks into a lobby

2893
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:14,680
and then taps a guy on the on the shoulder.

2894
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:16,600
He thinks is Ed Begley Jr.

2895
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:20,280
And says he's been playing the executive Rod Perth.

2896
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:22,120
And he says, oh, Rod.

2897
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:24,240
And then the guy turns around and it's not at Begley Jr.

2898
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:25,880
And he says, oh, I'm so sorry.

2899
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:28,600
And then at Begley Jr. walks out, oh, OK.

2900
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:30,040
And then they go into the meeting.

2901
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:32,080
Does that moment register with anybody?

2902
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:36,120
I remember I remember that that like I don't.

2903
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:40,040
I don't know what to what end the what is happening

2904
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:45,040
is that he walks in and taps the real Rod Perth.

2905
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:50,320
Guys, the real Rod Perth, the CBS executive is in the movie.

2906
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:52,680
Like I look like a poser now as far as being a fan of this movie.

2907
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:53,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2908
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:56,320
Well, I guess, you know, you're an expert at certain things,

2909
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:58,760
but I guess you're not a big Rod Perth head.

2910
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:01,160
No, that was a part that registered.

2911
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:04,160
Like it was pretty much that with Aaron and she's like, why did that?

2912
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:05,480
She laughed at it.

2913
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:08,400
Like, why is there a mistaken identity for no reason?

2914
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:10,880
And then when I told her what it was, she's like, I don't like it anymore.

2915
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,040
I just thought it was a weird thing that happened.

2916
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:14,480
Yeah, it does.

2917
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:15,680
If you don't know, it does.

2918
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:16,560
It's a weird thing.

2919
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,800
I'll tell you, this hasn't been mentioned yet.

2920
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:21,800
The conference call at the end when they're in Boca.

2921
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:27,560
Yeah. The vacation polos all the executives are wearing are out of this world.

2922
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:31,600
You can just tell it's like, well, these are their vacation polos.

2923
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:33,680
They wouldn't wear these on casual Friday.

2924
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:36,520
You know, if they did casual Friday, this is out.

2925
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:37,880
These are outrageous.

2926
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:39,080
Some great outfits.

2927
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:41,520
It all reminds me of the door.

2928
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:42,320
Yeah. Yeah.

2929
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:46,720
Flashes. Those through the money at these fancy executive vacation clothes.

2930
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,320
It all reminded me of Jurassic Park and like Nedry at the little

2931
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:54,000
at the food stand at the beginning.

2932
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,800
And yeah, it's just all like it's all the same type of guy.

2933
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:01,000
There's like when one of the guys is Bob Wright and then his boss,

2934
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,160
Jack Welch, comes in and they're the same man, essentially.

2935
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:07,800
Oh, well, I just wanted to check is kindly Jack.

2936
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:11,320
The head of G, the nicest man you ever did see.

2937
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:15,800
Oh, I would have to cast my vote for loyalty.

2938
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,720
It is. I mean, it's funny.

2939
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:21,960
I mean, that's kind of like it's hard to tell it was intentional,

2940
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:26,200
but that is a funny cutting joke that it's like, yeah, these networks are all run

2941
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:30,400
by the same sort of shitty dope, like it's the same idiots

2942
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:32,760
in these dumpy polos like these.

2943
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:34,360
It's amazing. Scumbags.

2944
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:36,000
Yeah, yeah, they do all get character.

2945
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,120
It's amazing that you don't like hate these people,

2946
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:41,240
especially when we know that Letterman hated them in reality

2947
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:45,040
and lettermanated the NBC people in the second run when it all happened again

2948
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:48,120
in 2010, you know, like, well, that's the side you want to be on.

2949
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:51,280
Like Letterman's probably right to hate all of these stupid executives.

2950
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:54,680
But the movie, by virtue of casting these kind of nice people,

2951
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:58,680
it's weird that we don't hate Warren Littlefield and John Agolia.

2952
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,000
Yeah, that speaks to the same thing of like not dramatizing it,

2953
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,720
because, yeah, these are just like guys and they're just like,

2954
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:06,640
they just want to make as much money.

2955
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:08,040
They don't care. Yeah.

2956
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:09,160
Which is like bad.

2957
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:11,080
And even like it's so much.

2958
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:13,960
I do almost appreciate the mundane this of that job, because that's

2959
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:17,400
they're literally just like crunching numbers, which they play up a little bit.

2960
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,720
But that's in the IMDb trivia section.

2961
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:23,040
It's like they just like Jay wanted less money because he didn't want on the show.

2962
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:25,080
That's probably that's probably why they went with him.

2963
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:27,160
This is the GE era.

2964
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:29,480
Yeah. So like, yeah, like it's like what they're doing is evil.

2965
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:33,160
But they're just like fucking guys trying to try to go home.

2966
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:37,960
So to act like, yeah, it's this it's legacy and it's all this important.

2967
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:38,920
Yeah, it's fine.

2968
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:42,960
I mean, it's would I like to see the fun version where it's like that,

2969
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,120
where they're like true, like super like Dr.

2970
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:47,360
Doom, like Warren Littlefield is Dr. Doom.

2971
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:49,520
Yes, I would like to see that.

2972
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:51,840
But that's fun. That's for fun funsies.

2973
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:53,160
Yeah, yeah.

2974
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:55,760
I we've been going for it.

2975
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:57,680
You want to just like quick shout out anything else?

2976
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:01,800
Yeah. Baseball, the famous thing, the famous Letterman.

2977
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:05,800
So when there's a scene where Letterman is angry and he's throwing

2978
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,080
the softballs at a giant target.

2979
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:10,960
Yeah. And then back here, he's in Connecticut.

2980
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:14,200
And this is him deciding if he's going to take the not great tonight show deal.

2981
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:15,880
But it would but it would be the show.

2982
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:19,400
I would have the show or if he's going to go do CBS.

2983
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:23,840
So he's yes, his like mentor, Peter Laselli catches him throwing

2984
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,720
baseballs and an archery target, a giant archery target.

2985
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:30,800
He says, well, welcome to my weekend in hell.

2986
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:34,920
And I remember very distinctly when this movie came out,

2987
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:39,560
watching Letterman around this time, because he was driven nuts by the movie.

2988
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:40,960
He hates the movie.

2989
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:44,520
He fucked over John Michael Higgins a couple of times as far as being a guest.

2990
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:46,040
But I'm on and then bumped him.

2991
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:48,600
I'm coming to the studio around.

2992
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:52,160
The I'm not sure I know that the one was the

2993
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:56,200
there was a show with Julia Roberts and that he kept having Julia Roberts

2994
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:59,840
do more segments, which you know that that's going to be in the cards.

2995
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:00,840
Yeah, of course.

2996
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:04,000
But also, come on once Julia Roberts is done right.

2997
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:07,440
Who he like had an on screen romance with essentially.

2998
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:10,600
There's like a highly real them kissing on the mouth,

2999
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:13,840
which I guess they never knew each other off.

3000
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:17,840
She said they never like got to like just casually like went to dinner or anything.

3001
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,720
They just had some bizarre like tension on air.

3002
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:22,480
Only in that spot.

3003
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:26,960
But yeah, so he so I remember Letterman bringing one time.

3004
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,240
It was like he would bring up the movie a lot around this time, too.

3005
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:33,840
So that extra that made it very fascinating because I don't know that Leno

3006
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:37,440
had any preoccupation with it on air, at least.

3007
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:39,520
No, not really. I know a little about what he thought.

3008
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:41,360
Well, I'll tell you. Yeah, but he didn't.

3009
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:47,560
Yeah, Letterman minded for material, including recreating the archery target.

3010
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:50,360
Oh, he did. Yes, there was a I remember very distinctly.

3011
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:53,840
He one episode he brought out the big archery thing because I don't.

3012
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:55,640
He's like that. I didn't never.

3013
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:59,680
I don't. Why didn't they have me throw baseballs at a target?

3014
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:02,720
As Aaron pointed out, who that's not something anyone does.

3015
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,760
Baseballs at an archery target.

3016
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:06,360
I should see if I made up activity.

3017
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:09,560
I should see if I can find the clip because unless I've really like made this up.

3018
02:19:09,560 --> 02:19:12,960
But I remember distinctly finally him bringing out the archery target

3019
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:16,760
and throwing softballs at it on air, which I thought was so funny.

3020
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,000
I have a quote from David Letterman about the film.

3021
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:23,720
I've seen a clip reel and it's just bizarre.

3022
02:19:23,720 --> 02:19:26,400
The guy who's playing me and I'm sure he's a fine actor,

3023
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:30,280
but his interpretation seems to be that I'm well a circus chimp.

3024
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:34,040
He looks like he's insane, like he's a budding psychopath.

3025
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:37,800
And afterward, I thought, well, maybe this is how I strike people as being.

3026
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:43,920
Another review in Entertainment Weekly that didn't like John Michael Higgins

3027
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,600
said this letterman is impersonated by John Michael Higgins

3028
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:51,000
in a one man orgy of squints, scowls and growls.

3029
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:55,760
It's a day who seems to have lice in his eyebrows and doesn't know how to scratch.

3030
02:19:57,640 --> 02:20:00,720
You know what? That's a really, you know, you know what?

3031
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:03,920
I agree with the review and I still like the performance.

3032
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:07,280
I was going to say what he's also kind of playing Letterman

3033
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:10,640
as if Letterman is performing his whole life.

3034
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:12,040
Do you know what I mean?

3035
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:14,640
He's kind of doing an impression of Dave on the air.

3036
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:18,240
Yes. Performing his whole life, not a caricature necessarily.

3037
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:22,680
But it's like the Dave persona then is like everything in his life.

3038
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:26,200
You know what I mean? Like there's no he doesn't have like an a different

3039
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:29,640
not a quiet, muted version of him, which there, especially back then,

3040
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:32,680
from hearing like how like angry he was and stuff.

3041
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:35,920
Yeah. I'm sure there was a really different version of him.

3042
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:36,880
Sure. Sure.

3043
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:41,560
I as for the other side of it,

3044
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:47,120
Daniel Roebuck and Jay Leno, again, the very different characters.

3045
02:20:47,360 --> 02:20:51,280
Letterman was very awful to John Michael Higgins, said these bad things,

3046
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:52,360
bumped him on the show.

3047
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:54,520
Daniel Roebuck and Leno were fast friends.

3048
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:56,840
I love it. I love it.

3049
02:20:56,840 --> 02:20:58,880
It makes all the sense in the world.

3050
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:03,840
And here's here's how it played out that they when filming the movie,

3051
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:09,800
NBC and HBO were mad at each other on this corporate level, like we have to allow it.

3052
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:14,240
But there will be no communication between our actual host and anyone

3053
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:17,440
involved, anyone involved on the real Tonight Show and this movie.

3054
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:20,160
These are this is church and state. They shall not mix.

3055
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:23,800
And so like, yeah, hard wall there.

3056
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:27,760
But as soon as the shoot was over, Daniel Roebuck said,

3057
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:29,560
I should try to get a hold of Jay Leno.

3058
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:32,160
And he called the tonight show.

3059
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:34,360
They were giving him the run around. I'm sorry. Who are you?

3060
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:36,360
I'm Daniel Roebuck. I play him in the film.

3061
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:38,560
Leno overhears it just picks up the phone.

3062
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:40,640
Hey, so how to go?

3063
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:44,240
Just immediately is on again, not morally or anything

3064
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:47,760
similar to Trump, where Trump is always available.

3065
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:49,000
Like, oh, yeah, yeah.

3066
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,560
The thing about him that you could call, you could always any report,

3067
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:53,480
get him on the phone for any reason at any time.

3068
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:55,760
I think we can get him on the show.

3069
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,080
We just have to bury this one.

3070
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:59,920
This is this one's staying by and all our tonight show oriented

3071
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,280
episodes have to stay behind the second gate for career advancing purposes.

3072
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:06,160
This is the rule that tonight show episode is Jay advancing purposes.

3073
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:10,400
Yeah, also, this is this is also the fascinating thing about Jay,

3074
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:14,680
because as much as we're like making jokes about Jay, Jay is still like

3075
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:19,800
it's probably easier to be friends with Jay than Dave.

3076
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,480
Yeah. In a lot of ways.

3077
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:25,160
And then I was listening to Jimmy Kimmel talk and Jimmy Kimmel did a very funny

3078
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:28,480
thing during the whole Conan thing where he went on Jay's show.

3079
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:31,720
Have you seen this? Where Jay was like, had you seen this?

3080
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:34,120
Have you heard about this? Is that what you meant to say?

3081
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:35,760
He asked like, what was the segment called?

3082
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:37,200
Like 10 questions or something?

3083
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,200
And 10, 10. Thank you. 10 to 10.

3084
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:43,280
And Jimmy was on via satellite, even though they were in the same city, I think.

3085
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:48,400
And the studio, he he like basically, Jimmy took over the questions

3086
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:51,480
and just kept making jokes about Jay stole the show back from Conan.

3087
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:52,880
And it's really funny.

3088
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:57,120
Really mean, really mean and edgy, like and Jay is so weird during any.

3089
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:00,040
OK, like he's like doesn't give it back at all.

3090
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:03,920
Never, yeah, never comedic failure and just rolls right through every question.

3091
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:05,240
Yeah, it's coming.

3092
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:07,520
Jimmy turns every question into like a slam.

3093
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:08,840
But then I heard Jimmy last week.

3094
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:11,520
Oh, yeah, when my son was in the hospital, Jay called

3095
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:14,600
and like just to see how he's doing or whatever.

3096
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:17,160
And he's like, and Jimmy's like, I don't know, maybe I'm the asshole.

3097
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:19,640
I don't know.

3098
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:24,000
But that was that the the thing preceding that was him doing an entire show

3099
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,520
dressed as Leno the next morning.

3100
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:29,440
The first thing you got to call Leno on the phone.

3101
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,680
Kimmeling, come on.

3102
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,640
Just it always feels so Trumpy to me.

3103
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:35,200
Just like he's always there.

3104
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:37,080
He's already like work at every angle.

3105
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:42,600
But like, yeah, I mean, maybe because, yeah, they were they became friends.

3106
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:44,320
They're still friends.

3107
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:48,560
Sure. To this day, Daniel Roebuck had a daughter who was born

3108
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:51,240
the day after the shoot finished. Wow.

3109
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:55,000
And Leno was always very sweet to the daughter and like got in on her.

3110
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,480
Yeah, it should be.

3111
02:23:57,240 --> 02:24:01,000
And then here's here's what ends up.

3112
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:06,520
So so Daniel Roebuck, I believe, you know, why ruin this here?

3113
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:08,680
I'm sorry. Let me just go into the quote and you'll pick up

3114
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:10,840
what I'm going to say about Roebuck.

3115
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:13,840
Here's what he said about I do think history played out correctly.

3116
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,080
Do you think the right person got it?

3117
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:16,240
Were you on Leno's side?

3118
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:19,440
And he says, when you look at the history, Letterman had a very successful career.

3119
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:21,800
But Jay Leno was the Tonight Show.

3120
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,520
I feel strongly that there is a godly plan for everybody.

3121
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:29,080
And it was in the plan that Jay be the host of the Tonight Show.

3122
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:32,440
All the behind the scenes machinations aside, that's just where he was going to end up.

3123
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:36,560
Daniel Roebuck, I think, is a religious person in general, has been in some religious films,

3124
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:39,520
and he believes that it was a god's plan. God's will.

3125
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:42,920
And when you look at it through all these extraordinary circumstances,

3126
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:45,640
were some of the greatest comedic talent of all time.

3127
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:49,240
One of the funniest people who have ever lived, have all been felled by Jay Leno

3128
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:51,760
in his pursuit of hosting the Tonight Show.

3129
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:55,280
I think now we know, is it just because he was shrewd?

3130
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:56,800
Is it was it because of Helen?

3131
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:58,600
Was it because he costs less money?

3132
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:00,240
I think Daniel's on to something.

3133
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:03,040
It's because God is on Jay Leno's side.

3134
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:05,080
God put him there.

3135
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:07,000
There's someone even more powerful than Bob Wright.

3136
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:09,440
Executive producer Ivan Reitman,

3137
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,200
the grandpa of our new favorite character podcast.

3138
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,360
That's right. The Grampy.

3139
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:19,120
Podcast from Ghostbusters Afterlife.

3140
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:23,400
Ivan Reitman, of course, directed the first two Ghostbusters movies, right?

3141
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:28,360
And is the father of Jason Reitman, who's directing Ghostbusters Afterlife.

3142
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:30,000
The new Who Thought of Podcasts.

3143
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,680
Who Thought of the Character Podcast.

3144
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,480
Podcast. We're all going to meet podcast.

3145
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:34,480
We're going to meet podcast.

3146
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:36,680
We're going to do a full podcast on podcast.

3147
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:40,880
That's coming. Is that movie coming out next week or in three months?

3148
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:42,520
It keeps changing.

3149
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:44,480
Maybe November. I feel like it's November.

3150
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:47,560
I think, look, you're right, God.

3151
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:49,640
God wants Jay in that spot.

3152
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:52,320
I hope Jay still hosts another version of the Tonight Show, too.

3153
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:54,920
He might take over from Fallon.

3154
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:58,560
Whenever Fallon's cut, couldn't you see that happening again in a Trumpy way?

3155
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:00,240
And not to will it.

3156
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:04,120
Let me knock on lots of things that aren't wood that Trump doesn't come back.

3157
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:05,880
But doesn't it feel like...

3158
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:07,880
Well, yeah, I don't even want to think about the Trump version of that.

3159
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:11,000
But yeah, an 82 year old Jay Leno taking over the Tonight Show.

3160
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,560
Yeah, it's possible.

3161
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:15,280
I don't think any is like, you know, if...

3162
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:16,800
And he just does it the same.

3163
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:18,760
It doesn't reinvent anything.

3164
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:19,760
Just as popular.

3165
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:20,680
Kevin's back. Headlines are back.

3166
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:21,840
The ratings increase.

3167
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,840
They play a little bit of You Bet Your Life.

3168
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,720
That's the only thing they've gathered along the way.

3169
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:27,160
You're right.

3170
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:28,800
Hot out there, right?

3171
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,520
Hot out there.

3172
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,560
That's what happens when the globe warms seven degrees.

3173
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:34,960
Short amount of time. Hot out there.

3174
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:39,360
Hotter than an intern's office in the White House.

3175
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:44,120
It might be my fault. All the exhaust.

3176
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:46,480
Yeah, you've got to do what I've got to do.

3177
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:49,960
Yeah, he is responsible for a significant portion of it.

3178
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:52,160
He and Seinfeld. Yeah.

3179
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:55,600
Oh, yeah. Speaking of intern, if anybody knows Monica Lewinsky,

3180
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:57,520
she loves Dudley Do-Right, Ripsaw Falls.

3181
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:59,240
Get her on this. We want her on the podcast.

3182
02:26:59,240 --> 02:27:00,880
She's so great. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3183
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:01,960
Love Toast.

3184
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:04,160
What a dream episode.

3185
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:06,880
Well, I mean, that to me is a lot of it.

3186
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,800
We've been doing it.

3187
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:09,280
We've been doing this for a long time.

3188
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:12,680
And yet I can't not ask the question.

3189
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:14,440
Well, we've talked about the miniseries.

3190
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:16,200
Yeah. Or just is it late?

3191
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:19,880
I mean, I guess Late Shift 2 just is an extended anthology series.

3192
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:22,280
We love this film. We've talked about this film forever.

3193
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:24,000
Yeah. How do you top it?

3194
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:30,080
How do you do a better version, a better tale of let's just to hone in on

3195
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:31,200
Leno V.

3196
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:35,240
Conan, because like and there's more stories that that can be told.

3197
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:36,480
We will do the flashback.

3198
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:41,320
We will see Leno making all of these neurological leaps as a child.

3199
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:47,040
But in doing that story, how do we get to do something better?

3200
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:52,480
Even if you can imagine a better film than the words prestige television,

3201
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,600
we're going all out.

3202
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:59,320
We've got the color scheme is brown and gray and blue,

3203
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:02,080
like all the TV shows that look like that.

3204
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:04,520
Yeah. Conan Domnol Gleason.

3205
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,160
Jay Roebuck is back. Of course.

3206
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:10,000
We all agree Roebuck is back.

3207
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
I think in all of our versions, I'm sure.

3208
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now, Wisen and Harden from having killed Dracula.

3209
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:21,080
And yeah, well, and I'm sure God told him to kill Dracula.

3210
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:22,560
That's got to be an element of that.

3211
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:24,800
God hates Dracula. God hates Dracula.

3212
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:29,600
I mean, how like, you know, that is a perfect kind of like

3213
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:32,360
like the guy return into the old role.

3214
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:34,880
I mean, really, like of them, I think you would have to get

3215
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,320
they have to be all of them.

3216
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:38,120
This is this is Star Wars.

3217
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,520
You have to get the full group.

3218
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:41,520
Rich Littles back to he's alive.

3219
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,880
Yeah. Yeah. Force ghost.

3220
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:46,160
Well, that's exactly what I was thinking.

3221
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:49,640
And I don't know if it's if this is if the people are appearing to Leno

3222
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:53,960
or if they're like haunting Conan when the decisions are getting difficult.

3223
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:57,480
But I think even the people who have passed away like Johnny

3224
02:28:57,480 --> 02:29:01,320
and like, of course, Helen Kushnick, I mean, Helen Kushnick,

3225
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:05,520
like being the bad like the devil on

3226
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:11,200
Jay's shoulder when all of that is like like like just go back to the show.

3227
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:13,200
Who gives a shit about Conan?

3228
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:14,960
He had his shot.

3229
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:17,880
Well, it's like if the three months is if he didn't get in three months,

3230
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:19,120
she was never going to get it.

3231
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:21,880
That that fucking little dick licker.

3232
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:24,160
I'm like, what would Helen say?

3233
02:29:24,160 --> 02:29:26,760
It's the scene in Last Jedi when Yoda shows up.

3234
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:28,480
That's the Helen scene.

3235
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:31,080
Yes. When Jay sort of at a bottom, like he's like, I don't know.

3236
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:32,160
People don't like me or whatever.

3237
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:34,120
And then like Master Helen.

3238
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:36,120
And then she shows up. She's a force ghost.

3239
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:39,600
And that's on these fucking page turners. OK.

3240
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:45,240
Those old Carson monologues were exactly the same.

3241
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:47,600
Just kept talking about Burbank.

3242
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:51,120
But the ancient Johnny DVDs.

3243
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,840
Fine. My goodwill.

3244
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:55,120
Yeah. Yeah.

3245
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:59,200
I want I think we got to get some more more.

3246
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:01,520
Like I already said, I love Donald.

3247
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:03,040
These are Zucker.

3248
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:04,120
I think he got to go.

3249
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:06,720
Giamatti. Exactly what I was going to say.

3250
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,160
Yes. Perfect.

3251
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,400
Because with Jeff Zucker,

3252
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:15,280
who was the executive in charge of that fiasco,

3253
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:18,520
you have a much deeper, darker villain.

3254
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:22,960
But these guys, Littlefield and Agolia, then like did turn around primetime

3255
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:25,480
and had that all star run right for NBC.

3256
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:27,840
And then they've just done other stuff like that.

3257
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:32,960
Zucker, of course, went on to not be punished for this fiasco in any way.

3258
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:38,480
And then he gave us Donald Trump and the constant CNN coverage of Donald Trump

3259
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:40,640
that superseded anything else they were doing.

3260
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:44,480
Yeah. So he's truly like, is there like a darker figure

3261
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:46,800
on the planet Trump himself?

3262
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:48,520
But like Bernie Mark Burnett?

3263
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:50,040
Oh, yeah. He's got all the tapes.

3264
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:52,400
Well, as I started to say, is there a darker?

3265
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:54,840
I mean, there's darker television producer executive.

3266
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:57,240
Yeah, there probably are. But he's he's pretty bad.

3267
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:59,280
So you got to go. Yeah.

3268
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:01,000
Giamatti's got a.

3269
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,920
And like I

3270
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:08,120
I don't know. You know, Gleason's Gleason's good.

3271
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:12,160
I the only thing that I might say is that you have the height issue

3272
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:13,920
with Conan.

3273
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:17,960
And there's not a lot of very tall, lean actors.

3274
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:23,320
But luckily, one of the best actors is maybe the best actor is a very tall actor.

3275
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:25,920
And that is Daniel Day-Lewis,

3276
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:28,280
who I mentioned earlier, and they showed it long ago.

3277
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:30,520
It's towards the beginning of the. Yeah.

3278
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:31,560
It's good. It's good.

3279
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:33,560
But you see, the thing is they work.

3280
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:38,400
I think they cast Daniel Roebuck and Michael Higgins because they were unknowns.

3281
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:41,440
Mm hmm. So but this is a franchise.

3282
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:44,560
Now, I guess you're right. You're right. You're right.

3283
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:47,040
It's like SNL and the politicians.

3284
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:48,840
You got to come in with the biggest stars.

3285
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:52,600
The show's so big, you need you need De Niro playing Robert Mueller.

3286
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:55,680
And I just think that, you know, Daniel Day-Lewis,

3287
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:59,120
who ends up inventing these bizarre American accents,

3288
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:05,360
I think him playing Conan as like, be cool, my babies.

3289
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:07,760
Oh, so like a Daniel Plainview.

3290
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:09,920
I think he might land.

3291
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:11,800
Or, you know, sometimes he's a little more like

3292
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:14,960
flaking like he sees he's like nice in the

3293
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:18,480
in the Phantom Thread.

3294
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:21,920
So if you go to some bizarre American.

3295
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,560
But I think Conan ends up in here in the.

3296
02:32:25,360 --> 02:32:27,880
Let's see what life is like in the year 3000.

3297
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:30,360
The FedEx Pope.

3298
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:32,840
I can't start my day with conflict, Jeff.

3299
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:38,640
I hate cynicism.

3300
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:41,000
It's my least favorite quality in the world.

3301
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:44,360
If you work hard, good things will happen.

3302
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:48,360
Do something with that, you freak.

3303
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,120
Oh, yes.

3304
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:50,520
He'll be. All right.

3305
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:53,000
And they got to have the behind the scenes, too,

3306
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,240
because he'll stay in character as Conan.

3307
02:32:55,240 --> 02:32:55,680
Oh, yeah.

3308
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:57,360
Which will be fun as fun as well.

3309
02:32:57,360 --> 02:33:00,960
Mm hmm. Constant string dances, constant people,

3310
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:02,880
and this constant muttering is a murderer.

3311
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:06,320
That's right. Murderer.

3312
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:07,240
Yeah, look, I'm sold.

3313
02:33:07,240 --> 02:33:09,800
If you can get him, he says he says he's retired.

3314
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:13,240
Yeah, I know that's the roadblock that he said that he's made his last film

3315
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:14,920
and that he only makes one movie every five years.

3316
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:17,560
But you think he's not coming back for the chance to play Conan O'Brien.

3317
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:19,440
It's good point. I mean, HBO Max

3318
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:25,120
for too many, for many strung out episodes.

3319
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:28,400
I think there would be as much content as the late shift movie,

3320
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:32,640
but just like really watered down to get to that full season.

3321
02:33:32,640 --> 02:33:35,680
It's unclear how much some of these streaming services pay.

3322
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:40,440
Either they pay the pile of Joker money or they pay the Jay Leno five hundred

3323
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:43,480
and twenty five dollars. Yeah, it depends.

3324
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:46,680
Daniel Day Lewis is in like a shack in the woods in the middle of nowhere.

3325
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:51,200
He's cobbling shoes and like a messenger boy gets knuck knucks on the door.

3326
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:53,600
He's like, I told you I'm retired.

3327
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:56,480
And he's like, no, wait, you're going to want to hear this.

3328
02:33:57,320 --> 02:33:59,280
He's like, why? I don't want to hear anything.

3329
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,320
Daniel Robic wants to play Jay Leno again.

3330
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:03,440
He drops the shoe.

3331
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:04,600
They got Robuck.

3332
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:07,800
They've got Robuck again.

3333
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:12,920
And then he like kind of sort of like weeps at his feet when he meets Daniel Robuck.

3334
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:15,440
Yeah, he's there.

3335
02:34:15,440 --> 02:34:16,960
You just want to eat the steaks.

3336
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:19,240
You don't care. The cattle are slaughtered.

3337
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:24,840
I think you got to also go to I know Letterman didn't grow the beard till later,

3338
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:26,600
but I think everybody I think Lennox got a beard.

3339
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:30,360
I think you do the Luke Skywalker just beards on everyone.

3340
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:34,080
Yeah, just to honor that, like the greats have come back

3341
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:35,480
and they're older and wiser.

3342
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:37,280
Yeah, that's true. Everybody's got a beard.

3343
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,200
Johnny's got a beard in the afterlife.

3344
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,560
Yeah. For whatever reason.

3345
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:43,840
I had another idea, too, which is that Kimmel recreates all those things

3346
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,520
that Kimmel did, the Ten and Ten and everything.

3347
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,400
But Kimmel's lost a lot of weight.

3348
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:52,760
And I think Kimmel plays himself with prosthetics to become

3349
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:56,640
10 years ago, larger Kimmel.

3350
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,840
See, that makes it fun.

3351
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:01,280
You can't just have the person play themselves or else you fall into a Jay

3352
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,520
Leno Wolf Blitzer kind of trap.

3353
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:06,840
But yes, if they're wearing prosthetics of themselves 10 years ago.

3354
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:08,080
Now, that's special.

3355
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:13,040
Larry King wearing a wig in the Doge movie to be old, like to be

3356
02:35:13,360 --> 02:35:15,360
the age Larry King.

3357
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:17,920
And then Letterman agreeing to be a man on the moon,

3358
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:20,200
but refusing to look like old Letterman.

3359
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:21,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3360
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:23,360
He'll do it, but he wouldn't look like his old self.

3361
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:25,040
Yeah. So you can't have him.

3362
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:27,200
So you got to have Higgins in a beard.

3363
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:30,560
I think when everybody's appearing as force ghosts and everything

3364
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:34,360
and like guiding, you know, Leno's decision or whatever it is.

3365
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:38,320
Carson just shows up and just does like Carter jokes.

3366
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:41,720
He offers no relevant advice.

3367
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:45,920
So gas shortage.

3368
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:48,720
Put solar panels on the White House.

3369
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,920
Ackroyd is Tom Snyder,

3370
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:54,440
which a character he played on Saturday Night Live. Sure.

3371
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:57,080
Yeah, so you get everyone knows that obviously.

3372
02:35:57,080 --> 02:35:59,960
But he's he's down for for biopics.

3373
02:35:59,960 --> 02:36:01,160
Yeah.

3374
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:04,080
She's smart as Joan Rivers.

3375
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:05,840
She's playing like a Joan Rivers type.

3376
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:08,240
Oh, sure. OK. Yeah.

3377
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:10,880
Who's still a felon is around.

3378
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:13,240
Yeah, felon part of it, because when everything was moved,

3379
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:14,520
it was changing time slots.

3380
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:18,160
It just became like they said, like, now, are you OK with starting at one

3381
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,720
in the morning? Yeah, I'm fine.

3382
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:21,120
Whatever. It's all good.

3383
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,720
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

3384
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:25,760
Yeah. I was thinking with that energy, what about the

3385
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:29,000
cousin Greg from Succession?

3386
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,840
Oh, man, that'd be awesome.

3387
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:32,600
Hey, let's not forget.

3388
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:35,960
Often forgotten about, I think, tangentially, Manch.

3389
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:38,440
I never read the Bill Carter.

3390
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:41,480
Carson Daly, the other Carson.

3391
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:43,680
Yes. Yeah, for sure.

3392
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:45,000
And he's in there.

3393
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
If you're doing a lot of episodes than just one like odd,

3394
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:53,760
miserable, solitary Carson Daly episode is watching him like

3395
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:57,280
I like go about his day filming his show.

3396
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:01,080
And while all the other people are getting manic calls from all these executives,

3397
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:03,320
he just looks at the phone and it never rings.

3398
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:08,440
Earl sent an email like, hey, just did our thousandth show.

3399
02:37:08,600 --> 02:37:11,160
I've been on the air for 25 years.

3400
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:13,480
I've lasted longer than everyone else.

3401
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:14,880
Sad, but no one knows.

3402
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,400
Zucker, you up?

3403
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:19,480
Ladies and gentlemen, lit.

3404
02:37:22,320 --> 02:37:25,360
The big one is Lauren has to be on.

3405
02:37:26,160 --> 02:37:27,840
Yeah, and Lauren has not been portrayed.

3406
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:30,280
Lauren played himself a man on the moon and I think otherwise

3407
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:34,240
has only been portrayed in cinema by Armin Weitzman.

3408
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:37,400
Let's bring him back.

3409
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:39,600
That's an easy cast for us, I think.

3410
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:40,760
I think we could get Armin.

3411
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:41,360
I think so.

3412
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:43,040
Mm hmm. He's Michael Keaton.

3413
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,000
He's always Lauren.

3414
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,440
He's always Lauren.

3415
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:49,000
So that's easy. Yeah, because Lauren Lauren did not produce a Tonight Show.

3416
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:52,520
He did. That was he produced Late Night with Conan and not.

3417
02:37:52,520 --> 02:37:56,800
But now then that was so there was a rumors of he was upset with that.

3418
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:57,720
Maybe. Yeah, yeah.

3419
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:00,160
Yeah. But he is a producer now on Fallon.

3420
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:05,800
Yes. So it's Armin just going like like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3421
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:07,080
And that's all they get to.

3422
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:08,840
Mm hmm. You just see it as sputters.

3423
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:10,720
Yeah, it's one scene. It's less than one scene.

3424
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:15,040
It's going to be there's a lot of characters and it's going to be like

3425
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:17,800
Toy Story 4. There's a lot more characters now.

3426
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:20,480
You know, it's going to be hard to give everyone their due, but

3427
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:22,160
it's worth an undertaking.

3428
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:27,160
And I had one big idea about it, too, is that because you sort of got to like

3429
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:31,360
take choose a side and you'd be tempted to choose

3430
02:38:32,120 --> 02:38:34,200
Conan side because we all love Conan.

3431
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:38,080
But like, I like the idea that the movie would just make the decision

3432
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:42,800
that it's about Leno recapturing what is rightfully his.

3433
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:44,720
Leno is the hero.

3434
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:45,760
Uh huh. Daniel A.

3435
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:50,800
Lewis is great at portraying villain or if it's Dom Mocleese, either one like great for,

3436
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:55,320
you know. So you just like you just make Conan the biggest villain.

3437
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,480
This jerk came and tried to steal my land.

3438
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,800
And it's sort of a Clint Eastwoodie.

3439
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:04,560
Yeah, yeah, it's like a yeah, recapturing.

3440
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:07,600
So like there'll be like a pivotal scene, much like in this one where,

3441
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:10,840
let's say, Jay is in the green car with like Richard Karn.

3442
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:14,120
And he's like, yeah, they say maybe they'll give me tonight show back.

3443
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:16,680
And Richard Karn is like, the tonight show is yours.

3444
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:18,640
They should have never taken it from you.

3445
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:20,040
And Jay's like, yeah, you're right.

3446
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:23,440
And he puts the green car in gear and they speed around.

3447
02:39:23,440 --> 02:39:25,040
They don't do the race. They stay.

3448
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:28,120
They break out. Yes, they bring a lot of security gate.

3449
02:39:28,560 --> 02:39:31,280
Yeah, that song shut up and drive plays.

3450
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:36,400
Jay hits Jay hits the drive through of the wiener schnitzel across the street real

3451
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:38,040
quick. Just like that.

3452
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:42,080
They get like 10 chili dogs still going strong.

3453
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:43,960
Yeah, yeah. Still there. Yeah.

3454
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,600
Good for them. Richard Karn is with him the whole time.

3455
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:49,520
Sounds good. Just along for the ride.

3456
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:53,160
And they drive right to whoever's office or something.

3457
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:57,520
And like you're about to press big buttons.

3458
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:59,520
One says, Jay and one says Conan.

3459
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:01,360
That's how the decision is made.

3460
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:04,040
It's a big like super villain.

3461
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:05,840
Yes. And the car.

3462
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:09,080
Yeah. Jay crashes the car through the roof or through the wall.

3463
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:10,640
It's on the 10th story or something.

3464
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:14,720
But he just like so he like hits a ramp expertly and goes right through

3465
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:18,920
Zucker's window, dangles him out the window in a Shug night fashion.

3466
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:21,160
Who's buying bottled water?

3467
02:40:21,160 --> 02:40:23,760
He's free in the tap.

3468
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:28,000
Uh, I'm slaughtering the cow this time.

3469
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:30,840
I thought of the cow. You hear me?

3470
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,360
I'm an Italian guy.

3471
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:35,560
I've shaken people out of window before.

3472
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:39,000
I turned you into Brazil.

3473
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,960
I think, yeah, then it like he then he does that heartfelt final Conan tonight

3474
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:48,680
show and then and then just on this like he just like

3475
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:54,400
Leno Burson jumps out of the car and beats Conan to death with a bat

3476
02:40:55,800 --> 02:41:00,480
and then looks down and says, I might look stupid, but I'm Italian.

3477
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:03,880
It's the Tarantino ending.

3478
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:08,880
Then Letterman with cigar,

3479
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:12,800
them having become friends during the Super Bowl commercial with Oprah.

3480
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:14,720
Right. And Oprah's in there, too.

3481
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:15,880
They all show up.

3482
02:41:15,880 --> 02:41:17,960
They all show up.

3483
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:20,080
Like Oprah as a lighter,

3484
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:26,520
Letterman lights a cigar and then tosses it, burns the Conan tonight show

3485
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:30,200
studio and and they drive off in the distance and don't look back.

3486
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,040
And Max Weinberg becomes Jay's band leader.

3487
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:39,240
Play by him. Play by Malia.

3488
02:41:39,240 --> 02:41:41,240
Oh, yeah. Demands top credit.

3489
02:41:41,240 --> 02:41:45,880
So this all this entire thing is called Max Weinberg presents the late.

3490
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:50,080
She's got that one day nine sixty two scale.

3491
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:52,720
All right. I get scale.

3492
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:55,640
Yeah. Well, let's get Betty Thomas on the on the line.

3493
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:56,960
Yeah. Yeah.

3494
02:41:56,960 --> 02:41:58,760
This is the job of a lifetime.

3495
02:41:58,760 --> 02:42:00,440
She's up to it.

3496
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:02,920
I this is this is epic.

3497
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:05,960
This is grand, just as this episode was.

3498
02:42:05,960 --> 02:42:10,840
And like we knew it would be you survived podcast, the ride, the late shift edition.

3499
02:42:11,720 --> 02:42:15,680
You know, some episodes are for the audience and some are for the host.

3500
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:19,240
Yeah. An episode all about hosts and what hosts want.

3501
02:42:19,240 --> 02:42:22,080
And these three hosts wanted to do this.

3502
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:28,000
Do you think that we're much stranger now than when you started listening to the

3503
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:33,840
what have your have your opinions of us changed as if this is like a warts and all?

3504
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:37,800
You of us as the film?

3505
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:38,440
It's a question.

3506
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:40,120
I've done this 10 years ago, maybe.

3507
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:45,480
But there's just such a glut of comedy podcast about anything and everything under the sun.

3508
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:46,480
But not the late.

3509
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:47,920
I know I didn't look it up.

3510
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:51,360
There may be podcasts about the late shift, but I would venture to say this film

3511
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:52,680
has never been covered.

3512
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:55,040
Is this the most comprehensive late shift?

3513
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:58,080
Tone. Yeah, tone, whatever you call it.

3514
02:42:58,080 --> 02:42:59,200
Yeah, that's out there.

3515
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:02,040
Besides the late shift, the book. Right.

3516
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:03,120
But that doesn't count.

3517
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:05,520
That's since this is this is a post film.

3518
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:08,000
Yeah. Analytical work.

3519
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:09,280
And we didn't even get it.

3520
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:14,120
Like I could talk about all the YouTube videos for all this stuff that I watch every other month.

3521
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:18,040
Yeah. No, I still I go back to the 2010

3522
02:43:18,440 --> 02:43:21,040
late night wars so frequently.

3523
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:22,200
Yeah. Don't.

3524
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:23,960
And that's so fascinating.

3525
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:28,880
As David Letterman told Conan O'Brien that he refers to that time as the golden age of television.

3526
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:34,960
And Conan said, oh, you mean the time when I was struggling.

3527
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:36,680
That's for you.

3528
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:37,720
That was a golden age.

3529
02:43:37,720 --> 02:43:40,120
Some solace. And at least you were happy.

3530
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:43,000
He's right. It was great.

3531
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,960
I watched every night of it.

3532
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:48,400
And I ate up Conan's goodbye speech.

3533
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:53,320
Conan's goodbye speech had a positive impact on me and what I was trying to do at the time

3534
02:43:53,480 --> 02:43:58,640
that may have had an effect on me ending up in the building with him.

3535
02:43:58,760 --> 02:44:02,680
It was so important to me every bit of that, that it's all that it's everyone's doing

3536
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:06,480
the funniest shit you've ever seen, all culminating in a wonderful heartfelt thing,

3537
02:44:06,640 --> 02:44:10,240
which I've devalued by saying that actually there's an alternate history where he gets

3538
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:12,440
beaten up by one of the baseball bats.

3539
02:44:13,560 --> 02:44:16,680
Yeah, but in one reality, it still is meaningful.

3540
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:20,720
Yeah, if you haven't, I don't know if I'm sure.

3541
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:24,480
I can't imagine if you weren't into it then you'd be into it now.

3542
02:44:24,480 --> 02:44:27,000
But there's so much video of it.

3543
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,560
It's so well done. I mean, look up Don't Blame Conan.

3544
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:31,640
It's a masterful monologue.

3545
02:44:31,640 --> 02:44:35,480
I think Susser and I were talking about how we could do that for like as an audition for something.

3546
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:38,920
This is a Letterman monologue.

3547
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:42,680
Yeah. So basically, he goes, Letterman's like,

3548
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:44,920
basically like, you know, I said I wasn't going to say anything more about this.

3549
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:46,200
He goes, but I can't help myself.

3550
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:50,040
He goes, last night, Jay did an interview and he told everybody that

3551
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:53,120
you shouldn't blame Conan for what's happening.

3552
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:56,600
He's you know, a lot of people think Conan is trying to push himself out of a job.

3553
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,480
It's not the case.

3554
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:00,440
Conan wouldn't do that to himself, folks.

3555
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:02,280
So don't blame Conan.

3556
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:05,080
And he goes, hey, Paul, are you going to blame Conan?

3557
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:08,720
You know, him Conan, you're not going to blame Conan, were you?

3558
02:45:08,760 --> 02:45:12,400
And then he goes and he's like, yeah, and Jay, you know, Jay said Conan was a family guy.

3559
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:15,080
So that's the end of that thought.

3560
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:21,040
Yeah. Well, you know, Conan, it's yeah, it's a masterful monologue.

3561
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:23,600
This is about a film about people who do monologues.

3562
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:26,480
It's what they do. And I think there's a number of things in this.

3563
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:30,520
I think you could do any of the Treat Williams monologues for it.

3564
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:35,120
If you have a if you have a drama class or an audition coming up, you could do it.

3565
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:38,920
The one thing I didn't mention, I think, but maybe my favorite thing in the movie is

3566
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:42,480
that Helen is trying to break the photograph.

3567
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:44,520
She finally snaps. She's turned on Jay.

3568
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:46,240
She's trying to break a photograph.

3569
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:48,040
The two of them. Oh, you want to break this?

3570
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:49,480
You're trying to break this?

3571
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:51,320
You're going to break this?

3572
02:45:51,320 --> 02:45:53,480
There. It's broken.

3573
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:59,720
I mean, that I want to hire a crew and put myself in Jay prosthetics

3574
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:00,880
and recreate this.

3575
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:03,560
At the very least, somebody do a deep fake.

3576
02:46:03,560 --> 02:46:05,240
Put my face. Yeah.

3577
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,240
Oh, wow. Fan camp.

3578
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:13,880
I'll know that we have a great, devoted fan who maybe at that level of devotion,

3579
02:46:13,880 --> 02:46:16,000
I'd be worried was going to kill me. Yeah.

3580
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:20,160
They know what a deep fake you first I would I would think it was nice.

3581
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:22,840
And this is all been great.

3582
02:46:22,840 --> 02:46:25,160
Let me say this really fast.

3583
02:46:25,160 --> 02:46:27,440
And you're talking nice things about Susser.

3584
02:46:27,640 --> 02:46:32,560
That motherfucker comes anywhere close to trying to take my slot on this show.

3585
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:36,440
If he thinks he can march in here, he's always marching into these shows.

3586
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:41,000
If he thinks he's going to push me out of the chair, out of the sort of comfortable

3587
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,640
folding chair that I'm doing this podcast from.

3588
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:46,560
Look, I don't think no, no, it's fine.

3589
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:48,600
Everything's fine. Don't worry about it.

3590
02:46:48,600 --> 02:46:50,120
He's not going to do that.

3591
02:46:50,120 --> 02:46:51,200
He's not gunning for it.

3592
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:54,080
He's not. He's not listening outside the door right here.

3593
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:56,240
I'll be serving up Susser steak.

3594
02:46:56,240 --> 02:46:58,440
I'll tell you. That's what happens.

3595
02:46:58,440 --> 02:47:00,760
If he comes if he comes gunning for the for the Gartner spot.

3596
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:02,640
You may need to get an agent, though.

3597
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:04,640
A handsome agent. That's me.

3598
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:06,400
I already. Hey, you have a handsome agent.

3599
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:10,440
I've only had an armada of of it's a tree with treats,

3600
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:13,200
of treats with my armada of treats.

3601
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,640
So there doesn't stand. Yeah, he's screwed.

3602
02:47:15,640 --> 02:47:19,120
He tried that fossil Susser.

3603
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:21,360
Are you Italian? You're not Italian, right?

3604
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:23,040
I'm not. OK.

3605
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:25,600
That does hurt me in this. Yeah.

3606
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:29,160
OK, so that's that.

3607
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:33,200
And I guess when I thank you for listening

3608
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:36,600
and when we find another TV movie that we want to do,

3609
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:39,640
I hope that you'll come support that, too.

3610
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:41,040
What does he wait then? What does he say?

3611
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,080
I build. I bid you all the fun.
