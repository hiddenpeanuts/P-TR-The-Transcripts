1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello and a friendly wave of the foot to you.

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Welcome to this second gate episode of podcast, the ride.

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Hardly waving my foot is me, Scott Gardner,

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
and I'm sure also that's the case for Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
You know, if you got some hard wood floors, you know,

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,520
it's hard, it's real easy to get that dirty foot.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,520
So very relatable character today.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
I wonder if our feet, yeah, they're probably, they might be dirtier now,

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,520
because we're probably barefoot more often than this current stuck inside state.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,520
Mike Carlson, how's your, how are your feet?

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,520
How dirty are my feet?

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Show, show feet, sweetie. Show feet.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,520
What? What is it?

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,520
I said show feet, sweetie.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Please.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Is that not a reference to anything? Is that just a weird thing you said?

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,520
Yeah, I was just saying that like people say that a lot, like weirdos say that online.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Oh, oh, okay. I don't, I don't know that to be a thing people say online.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
So it just sounded like you're being weird.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
I mean, I definitely was doing that too.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Anyway, go ahead.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
Yeah.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,520
I don't even remember. You threw me off so much. I don't remember what I was going to say.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Yeah. Hey, we're, we're talking about the most famous foot in all of themed entertainment.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,520
The, that of the, the, well, we're dubbing the dirty footed pirate from Pirates of the Caribbean.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,520
And not only that, I mean, this is, I'm excited to talk about this for a full episode, but that means, this means that how many years in, well over two, this is the first attempt at a Pirates of the Caribbean related anything on this show.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Yes. And we have to, you know, and I, I don't, I guess I mean to say this, we are dipping our toe in to the waters of Pirates of the Caribbean very gingerly here.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Obviously such a mammoth topic.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,520
And I think if, if you did dip your bare foot into that water, you'd probably end up looking exactly like the dirty footed pirate.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,520
That's true. Possible. I mean, do you think the water is, I mean, it can't, can't be that dirty.

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,520
No, I just think whatever like disease would form would just like maybe perm a dire foot.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Oh, I see. Yeah, that's possible.

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:48,520
I've never, have you ever put your hand, let me ask you this. Have you ever put your hand in the water at all on pirates?

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
No, not pirates.

36
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Jason?

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,520
I don't think, not purposely.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Yeah. I don't think I have either. I don't want to break any rules.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Yeah.

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,520
But we've obviously gotten the water on us because there's a drop at least in the Disney, at the Disneyland one at least.

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
That's right.

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Yeah.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Yeah.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,520
So we have touched the dirty pirate's water.

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Yeah, touch the dirty water. If you're like laughing on a drop and you're in the right seat, you could splash something in your mouth.

46
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
That's never good. That's never.

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Well, you must on Splash Mountain, you must get the water in your mouth all the time.

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Oh, yeah.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Yeah. It's a little, it's a relatively small amount, but still.

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Especially that one drop that's in the dark where they don't, they don't expect.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,520
I mean, I guess that comes more over the side of the log than a splash, but it's very easy to get.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
That one is crazy.

53
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:52,520
It's very, so easy to get caught off guard and legitimately startled to get that wet in pitch black is a lot.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,520
I don't know. We're getting off on a little tangent here already, but I don't remember if we talked about on Splash Mountain.

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Do you think the amount of water that gets dumped into your log on Splash Mountain on that dark drop?

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Do you think that's an accident? It feels like an accident to me that that happens.

57
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Like if they'd weighed it differently, that wouldn't be the case.

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Exactly. Like there might be like, cause they famously had problems with, you know, how fast the log should go down and how wet people were getting.

59
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:29,520
So they had to adjust. I do wonder if the idea that all of a sudden, you know, you would just get like 10 gallons of water dumped on your lap.

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Like that's not the fun version of getting soaked. Right. I wonder. I'm not sure.

61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,520
That's well, that's what you gotta do. You gotta call that getting souped.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520
You gotta tell you, gotta call it getting souped.

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
That's why this came up before, I think.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Well, that, get a soup. We famously, somebody, I don't remember which of us or Mary Holland, it was on the Grizzly River Rapids episode.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Yes.

66
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
You said getting soup, souping your pants.

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Yeah. And which is also when we determined Jason likes very wet socks and Mike likes to hide his socks.

68
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Everybody has a sock like when it comes to this ride.

69
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm a sock hider. Jason is a sock wetter.

70
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Well, is there a, can we say sock super sock wetter? I don't know.

71
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,520
How about sock? Okay. How about a sock soaker?

72
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Yeah.

73
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Jason Sheridan is a sock soaker.

74
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Jason Sheridan is a real damn sock soaker.

75
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,520
That who socks soaker.

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
You absolute sock soaker.

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
I like that one.

78
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,520
That does sound like something like Archie would call Jokehead if he was mad at him.

79
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Like in the comics, not in Riverdale. He just called him a shit headed Riverdale.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,520
Yeah. You've been watching a lot of Riverdale, I think, right?

81
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
I have. I finished the second season, which just gets insane.

82
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:10,520
I mean, between the serial killer and the rival gangs and the mob and the incest and oh, it's just so much of everything.

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Oh my gosh. I got to catch up.

84
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Yeah.

85
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Anyway, back to, I don't know if the dirty foot pirate, I've seen them referred online as the dirty foot pirate as well.

86
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,520
So I'll go back and forth between calling him dirty footed pirate, dirty foot pirate.

87
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,520
I don't know. I assume he doesn't like to have wet socks because he doesn't wear socks because he has his bare feet.

88
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Right. Well, we were trying to figure out because he also noticeably has hairy legs.

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,520
And we were trying to find a video, one of those vacation planning videos.

90
00:06:48,520 --> 00:07:00,520
My girlfriend swears there is a vacation planning video probably from the early 2000s where Disney, when they're doing the roundups, like the cheeky host is like, and watch out for the hairy leg.

91
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Like they are prioritizing the hairy leg over the dirty foot.

92
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
But I remember.

93
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:17,520
I today, almost every bit of literate, strangely, the first little stretch of research I did, things called the dirty foot pirate and almost everything I saw today called it the hairy leg pirate.

94
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,520
These are two schools of thought. It's interesting.

95
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,520
I mean, he is has noticeably hairy leg.

96
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,520
But I mean, I think the biggest development not to get too ahead of ourselves is those feet aren't as dirty as they used to be.

97
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Right. Am I crazy? Well, so here's an interesting thing, because I think when we first I think I brought the dirty foot pirate up a long time ago on the show.

98
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,520
I don't know that Scott, I think was Scott, you were saying you didn't have such a vivid memory sort of of the foot being dirty.

99
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
It did not registered with me. No.

100
00:07:49,520 --> 00:08:02,520
And when we're talking, by the way, about a pirate that's dangling over a bridge kind of in the mid to end of Pirates of the Caribbean, I'd say it's like 60 to 70 percent into the ride.

101
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,520
It's right before the prison where the guys are trying to get the dog to help.

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,520
And then and then off to the side is the guy, you know, chilling out with the pigs.

103
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,520
So that's the word is a bit is all about one animatronic in parts of the Caribbean.

104
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Yeah. And so he's present in Anaheim, Orlando, Paris and Tokyo.

105
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,520
There are very little variations and stuff. Paris, especially you drop right after you see him.

106
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Yeah, it's a really that it really points to the massive restructuring of pirates that yes, he's now the prey.

107
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Instead of the the skull, instead of the talking skull, he's the precursor to doom.

108
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,520
You see the foot and then you drop. Yeah, yeah.

109
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:55,520
It it it distracts you or it's like, yeah, you're you're trying to dive away from the from a smell from an aroma or something.

110
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Right. So from what I can tell, the foot, at least when I was younger and in some of these pictures in Florida,

111
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,520
the leg and the foot were dirtier and possibly hairier in Florida like that.

112
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,520
And in foot was black in some of those pictures like gangrene black.

113
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,520
There's some. Yeah, I'm looking right now at a picture of the Florida dirty foot pirate.

114
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,520
I don't know what year this is from, but it's covered in mud.

115
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Scott, have you found these pictures as well?

116
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,520
I've seen, you know, I don't know which one I'm looking at in any of them.

117
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I just know that it's a it's a big variety in every Google result.

118
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Right. I've sent a picture right now that I'm looking at it.

119
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:45,520
It is caked in mud. So that is, I think, where this because obviously I went to, as we all know, I only went to Disney World as a child.

120
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,520
So this is where this foot got burned into my brain.

121
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:59,520
This is why it made such an impression is because I think I was seeing this mud caked foot and hairy, very hairy leg.

122
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,520
And that's what made this impression that still lasts to this day on me.

123
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Yeah, this leg noticeably hairy. His pants also filthy, too.

124
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,520
This guy's like a real messy boy. He's he's a messy boy.

125
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,520
He's a pig pen type. Yeah.

126
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,520
For sure. And I think that I don't know what it was.

127
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,520
I don't know why it seems like he's been cleaned up over the years.

128
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:34,520
I think it's possible. I think what you seem to be proposing is that it left less of an impression on me as being a big dirty foot,

129
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,520
because maybe it was never that dirty on the regular at Disneyland.

130
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Right. And now it's certainly right now because this pirate was just refurbed at Disneyland relatively short time ago.

131
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Yes. And there's we follow. I'm assuming seen this video from January 28th, 2020.

132
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Of course. Which which, of course, the 128 we all talked about it. Yes. Yeah, of course.

133
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:13,520
This is the one twenty eight Disneyland News Today Twitter account says our favorite dirty foot pirate is back on Pirates of the Caribbean and all his grimy glory after being absent for a few weeks.

134
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Now, this video shows barely any dirt on the actual foot.

135
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,520
And you can't see too much of his leg. And it doesn't appear to be very hairy. Right.

136
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:32,520
So if this was what you were this is sort of what you were seeing, Scott, as a child, you're just going to say, oh, normal foot, not dirty at all.

137
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,520
What am I what am I going to remember about this? What is so memorable about this foot? Yeah, I don't.

138
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Maybe I was it maybe it was never that dirty.

139
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:51,520
This makes me want to hear maybe while we're talking, I'll try to find a Disneyland video from, you know, ninety four or something and see what the dirt level was then.

140
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Yeah, it's noticeable enough. I just sent you guys there is a vinyl nation of the dirty foot pirate with a very noticeably muddy foot.

141
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Yes, a dirty ass foot. Yes.

142
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:20,520
And it's obviously like there's other people that seem to have like on message boards that I'm looking that seem to have this memory from childhood of like, oh, I always just remember that foot being so dirty.

143
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:27,520
So it's obvious that it made an impression and it seems like the people at least I saw on the message boards were Disney World goers.

144
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:38,520
I hear a quiet version somewhere. Sorry. Yeah, that was me. Jason. Yeah, I was trying to I was watching the Twitter clip.

145
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Yeah, I don't know. He's got all the versions I'm looking at are too low res to tell from the nineties.

146
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Now, and I'm sure we've talked about this a little bit before. I am not and I don't want to be too vulgar here. I'm not any sort of foot guy. I'm not a foot guy.

147
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:04,520
I just want to put that out there. So if you're saying, well, it seems odd that he's talking so much about his foot. I don't think it has anything to do with any like sexual preoccupation.

148
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I don't think that is anything. I'm just saying you're saying it a lot. I can see the chorus of people accusing me of being a foot fetishist.

149
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:23,520
And again, no shame if you are. I'm just trying to say that this is just purely based on a childhood memory of a dirty pirate foot.

150
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Didn't you all as a chorus just say he's a dirty boy? What did you what was the phrase?

151
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Jason originated from Jason. So he'd have to remind me. What did you say? He was a dirt ice. I repeated with Jason.

152
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:50,520
I think I think I say is dirty boy, a messy boy, messy, messy boy. If we're concerned about coming off like a fetishist or a pervert, that's the that's the grossest phrase I've heard in a long time.

153
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Well, now, wait a minute. I'm just making an observation. I mean, I'm not like Mike. Mike has an established record on this sort of thing. Everyone's talking about it.

154
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:12,520
And we know you get to foot business and Splash Mountain. So you have even the mere notion that you wouldn't get to do your foot business on that ride was you shut down.

155
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,520
And when we talked about it, I would say, though, that Jason might also be considered a messy boy.

156
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:27,520
I pride myself on my cleanliness. I but it's not necessarily on a true like it's not it's more of a figurative messy boy.

157
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:40,520
What is the what is the universal use of boy? Why is everyone agreed on boy? That's my problem. If you all said he's a messy man or Jason is a messy man, I'd be like, I don't see anything strange about it.

158
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:52,520
But the repetition of boy makes me want to report you all to the authorities or just say to the people listening in on this zoom, if it is spyware, please go to Mike and Jason's places.

159
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:02,520
OK, I just looked up messy boy on Google. And the first result is and again, don't this I'm just reading this. I'm reading this. I am not responsible for this.

160
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Messy boy is is an adult male dressing up as a little boy and eats messy to please rich old Japanese women.

161
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,520
I don't know anything about that. Yes, it's a weird thing. It's a very weird.

162
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Is what I'm saying. Now, Jason, now Jason is for sure a messy boy.

163
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,520
I don't know. Messy man. Something about the alliteration sounds a little deviant, Scott. I'm sorry.

164
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,520
The idea, though, what are you talking about? The back to back. The double M. Yeah, messy man.

165
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,520
No, no, no. Alliteration is a nerving. It's something about it.

166
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Hit in the ear a bad way. When you Google messy man, the first result is not some weird area like messy boy.

167
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,520
It's. Hmm. It's messy to please.

168
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Did you hear Brad turned into a messy boy? That's the sample sentence on Urban Dictionary.

169
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Did you hear that Jason's been a messy boy for the last 10 years? That would be a way I would use it in a sentence.

170
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
This is I don't know.

171
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:22,520
This episode is banned. This is this is on only fans only PTR only fans upon the ahead of the PTR only fans.

172
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,520
We're all. Hey, look, we're all camp boys now. We're all camp boys in quarantine.

173
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,520
That's a good point. The whole world is camp boys. All the late night host.

174
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,520
That's true. Anyway. OK, so back to this dirty, messy pirate.

175
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Messy boy pirate. Oh, this is the easiest episode for me to leave.

176
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I could just bail right now.

177
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Well, do whatever you need to do for your own mental health.

178
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Your mental health is most important. It's right to get out of here.

179
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
And it's tough. So the more the more times a certain phrase is used.

180
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Well, let's get a little more into Scott's wheelhouse.

181
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Let's talk about the the pirate's big jug.

182
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
You know, you've got a big jug of something.

183
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:20,520
That's right. This might be one of the most like one of the heaviest drinkers in any attraction.

184
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Probably one of the drunkest characters.

185
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,520
I mean, you know, a lot of the pirates are probably drunk to some regard.

186
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
But yeah, that's a that's a huge jug he's got.

187
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,520
It took me a second to think like, oh, that's probably rum, because I was I was looking up

188
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
what are big jugs of wine called?

189
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,520
And they're usually just like in America that it's just called jug wine.

190
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,520
But giant bottles of wine is what it's called.

191
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Well, yeah. But you know, like magnums and stuff like the giant bottle bottles of wine.

192
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Did you know that when they start to get real big, they're named after biblical kings?

193
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,520
What's like super big bottles of wine that hold multiple bottles?

194
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Like when you start to get to a certain size, they have names like Nebuchadnezzar, both Balthazar and Solomon.

195
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
I don't know what I don't know what's going on here.

196
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
What you'll have to say.

197
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Can you link me to something?

198
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Yeah, yeah, there's articles.

199
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,520
I see. Whoa, whoa.

200
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Yeah, you're right.

201
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,520
It goes magnum double magnum, Jeroboam, Rehoboam, Imperial Salmanazar, Balthazar, Nebuchadnezzar and Solomon.

202
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Whoa. An 18 liter bottle of wine is a Solomon.

203
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I had no idea.

204
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Yeah, that's wild.

205
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Wow. I only found this out because I just like Googled the phrase like name for big jug of and whatever reason I can't remember.

206
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:55,520
I only found this out because I just like Googled the phrase like name for big jug of and whatever reason I said I went to wine first instead of rum.

207
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
And then I got all those articles about it.

208
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Wow. So Scott, so Scott, you'll tell Aaron you're going out to the store to get a double magnum of something of rosé or something.

209
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just going to go pick up a quick Balthazar.

210
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,520
That's 12 liter bottle of wine is called the same thing as Nicolas Cage's famous character in The Sorcerer's Apprentice.

211
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Oh yeah. Balthazar.

212
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
He probably knows the names.

213
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
He might have suggested it.

214
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Yeah.

215
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,520
I'd love to know who named these things.

216
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,520
This is really, I've never heard this fact in my life. This is very strange.

217
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,520
I don't know. Standard for me.

218
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Why, if I were to try to, you know, pour a massive bottle full of Nebuchadnezzar into a glass myself, I might end up being a real messy boy.

219
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Yeah, here we go.

220
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Now that brings me to my connection with the bottle.

221
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Do him go and go and nuts on that big jug.

222
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Do we think he's naturally messy?

223
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,520
Or do we think, I mean, they're all kind of a little gross, like you're on, you're at sea that long.

224
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,520
But the addition of him consuming all of that jug rum, does that make him more of a messy boy?

225
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,520
I'm going to assume it makes him a little clumsy and maybe that's how he got messy in the first place.

226
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
I don't know. I think he's almost, he's as messy as the others.

227
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,520
I don't know that he's like, obviously there's a number one messy boy pirate.

228
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
We know who that is.

229
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
The pig one, right?

230
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Yes, it's the pirate that's literally in the slop with the pig.

231
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
And they're having a great time.

232
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,520
I mean, both of them are having a great time, the pig and the pirate.

233
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Yes, but I think this one, I don't know, he obviously, depending on which version it is, has a dirty foot.

234
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,520
But his clothes don't look any more dirty than the average dirty boy pirate.

235
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,520
I was thinking about what is the precursor to him getting up there.

236
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Maybe he was hanging out with the pig pirate.

237
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Maybe the pig pirate called him over like, hey, check this out.

238
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Look, I'm hanging out with this bunch of pigs.

239
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
And he was like, cool, but maybe I'll come down later.

240
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,520
I got to go. I'm going to go clear this rum first.

241
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,520
And he walked. He took a step through the mud.

242
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,520
I guess. Do we think that that mud is from the pig area?

243
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,520
So you're saying does he have shit on his foot?

244
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
I know I didn't say shit.

245
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,520
I said mud. You brought shit into it.

246
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
There's no shit.

247
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Could also be slop.

248
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Let's not rule out slop.

249
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Do pigs go to the bathroom in the slop they roll in?

250
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
They probably do, but we don't know how long they've been there.

251
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:54,520
We don't know if that's pig slop or if we don't know if that's like where the pigs live or the pigs taking a special trip to that side of the bridge.

252
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,520
And was that just like natural mud?

253
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Right. We don't know that.

254
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,520
You're right. Do you think you pass by that part and go, that's just pure shit over there?

255
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Well, I think that I think that, you know, there's got to be some fecal matter in there.

256
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,520
I'd say some. I don't think it's primary, but no, you brought up shit for the first time.

257
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
I wasn't thinking about shit at all.

258
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Again, since it's Mike, he's got a predisposition to this line of this kind of stuff.

259
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Everyone's talking about it.

260
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
To shit talk?

261
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
To feet, to shit.

262
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,520
I mean, there's no, no, don't try to draw a comparison between foot and fecal play or something bizarre thing.

263
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm just saying if, you know, if a guy in his bare foot stomped around some of the some of the shit, then he'd end up being a real messy boy.

264
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
That's all I'm saying.

265
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
People have been saying.

266
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I'm not a messy boy.

267
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I don't like foot stuff.

268
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I don't dislike foot stuff, but I don't like I'm not in the super enough.

269
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
And I don't like any weird fecal stuff.

270
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
I'm not into that either.

271
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,520
You just love to remove your socks when you're in the log.

272
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
That's just purely for comfort.

273
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,520
That's purely for comfort after the ride.

274
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
That's purely for comfort.

275
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,520
I'm not getting any psycho sexual satisfaction from removing socks.

276
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
I hope everyone's turned their levels down.

277
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
It's a bit.

278
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
We're all spiking.

279
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Hook me to a lie detector.

280
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
I'll take a lie detector right now.

281
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Well, it's going to have to be an app because we're in different places.

282
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
So, yeah, let's we can find one.

283
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
But I just said the levels are spiking.

284
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I think that's a lie detector in and of itself.

285
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,520
No, I'm not on trial here.

286
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
It's nice.

287
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Someone is for someone else is for once.

288
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Finally, someone besides Jason is cornered.

289
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
This rocks.

290
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
This rocks.

291
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
I see why you do this.

292
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Jason's favorite episode ever.

293
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,520
A man with power now.

294
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,520
The messy boy turns the tide.

295
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,520
The messy boy, the messy king.

296
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Oh, Jesus.

297
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Sheridan is the messy king.

298
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Let me look up messy king and see if that's something.

299
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,520
This all makes me wish we were doing the fucking seat final four.

300
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,520
That'd be a less perverted episode.

301
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,520
That would be more wholesome than this.

302
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,520
This will have to. Yeah, this will be only will make this much like the Steven Spielberg Quibi show.

303
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
This is only allowed.

304
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,520
You're not allowed to listen to this after nine p.m.

305
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Well, maybe much like the Steven Spielberg Quibi show, this shouldn't come out either.

306
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
That's a good point.

307
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
My theory is that there is no Spielberg Quibi show.

308
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,520
But anyway, that's neither here nor there.

309
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:58,520
I think every are we going to look back at a time there'll be this weird run of time where every single episode talked about the coronavirus and every single episode talked about Quibi.

310
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,520
The two main things on everyone's mind.

311
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
I think that's probably right.

312
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
Five years from now, you're like, oh, yeah, remember that?

313
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Wow.

314
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,520
This is the most dated podcast I've ever heard.

315
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,520
These will be unlistenable because of the references.

316
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:29,520
To get back on track, I think I'll credit Aaron, my wife for this observation that he's drinking a big jug of rum and he has a lot of scarves.

317
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Everything's very loose and flowy that he's wearing and he's extremely near a bunch of fire.

318
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,520
So this guy is one of the most flammable characters you can imagine.

319
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:53,520
He's asking for trouble and especially the drunker he gets if he leans backwards and already there's like the wrong puddle of something that could, I don't know, where there's fire, there's gas.

320
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,520
I think we're watching a character who is dead of self-immolation like 10 seconds later.

321
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Well, that's interesting you say that because do you think in the narrative of the ride, I mean, there's already a big fire going on, but like he does something that continues the fire on into the jail cell, which is what's happening.

322
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,520
Like everything's on fire still in there when you're seeing the dog and the people in the prison because they want to get out.

323
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Do you think maybe in the narrative that's part of it that he like keeps the fire going that's already burning in the town?

324
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
Oh, like he makes it worse.

325
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,520
He like stumbles around and spreads it.

326
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Right. That's what I'm saying.

327
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
I think maybe. That's an interesting call.

328
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Yeah. So when you keep going through it and the fire gets worse, yeah, he might have caused it.

329
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah, that's what I, yeah, maybe.

330
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,520
I also here I will send this to you guys.

331
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,520
I was happy to discover that this exists.

332
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:58,520
I discovered the Mark Davis concept art for this character.

333
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
And then this is great.

334
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Yeah, this exists for all of the characters and fairly, you know, a lot of the primary pirates.

335
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
So that's cool to look at no matter what.

336
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:21,520
But if you look at the concept art, which really has the full character and he and the leg is very hairy and the foot is a little dirty, but just, you know, it's like red a little.

337
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,520
It definitely is not just soaked in mud or shit or whatever you want to call it.

338
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
But, you know, the characters are very much there.

339
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:37,520
But things that are not happening on the ride in this, his like big wine shop, you know, is a little bit of a mess.

340
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,520
The big wine chalice and his jug are on fire.

341
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Right.

342
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,520
I think maybe that was the idea for the gag here.

343
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,520
But maybe that wasn't possible to have fire going all day that close to an animatronic.

344
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,520
This raises more questions than it answers, I feel like, because he has one shoe on noticeably in this.

345
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Does the animatronic have one shoe on the other foot?

346
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Might just be.

347
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I think it's just a sock.

348
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
I believe it is just I think that's how the vinyl mation portrays him.

349
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Right. Oh, yeah. Yes.

350
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:20,520
So this little freak has one one thing on and then one one foot off the concept art.

351
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Yeah, I would definitely refer to this more as a red foot than a dirty foot.

352
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Yeah. The foot is not.

353
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Yeah, it certainly is not soaked in mud the way that we have some versions of character are in the toy are.

354
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,520
It's also a different sock pattern than he ended up with.

355
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Ultimately, it's a little more green.

356
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,520
And what the what the pirate wears is kind of a it's kind of a bumblebee pattern.

357
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
It's very yellow and black.

358
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:53,520
The promo or the art, the Mark Davis art kind of looks like his foot is like the Wicked Witch of the East's foot.

359
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Oh, yes.

360
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Crushed by the house.

361
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
I could see the Wizard of Oz.

362
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

363
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Interesting. Yeah.

364
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,520
I mean, that's a good gag if if that's how played it.

365
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
Also, we're noticing.

366
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Oh, wait. OK, so he does have like a chalice.

367
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
It's this is way more of a wine glass.

368
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,520
What he has here in the wine glass is on fire.

369
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Oh, no, I'm wrong. That is like that is a big mug.

370
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,520
OK, so that's kind of. Yeah.

371
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,520
So, yeah, I mean, that's a pretty fun gag.

372
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:41,520
It makes me wonder if this was ever the case in the way it was this like a gag that got cut the way we talk about that thing in the Indiana Jones ride that there was they tried to simulate rock falling on you by releasing ice and then they couldn't keep that going for very long.

373
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
What if that was the situation here in this pirate?

374
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Was he ever on fire?

375
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,520
That's interesting. I've never heard.

376
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
I mean, we've all watched a lot of this stuff.

377
00:29:51,520 --> 00:30:01,520
You would think we would have heard about that, but it's always possible because a lot of this stuff maybe wasn't so meticulously archived or documented.

378
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
No, no, I wonder.

379
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I mean, perhaps it was just yeah, I wonder how far it even got if they even like if it was on ever on ride, I would probably not.

380
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,520
But maybe they tried it out in, you know, imagineering.

381
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Yeah, maybe there could have been a test of it.

382
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I mean, it's a cool idea and that he's so drunk he doesn't notice that his own his possessions are on fire.

383
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
That's pretty cool.

384
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:38,520
It makes. Yeah, it makes it makes sense, too, because this section is when the town is at its most like on fireness like a town is fully ablaze.

385
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:46,520
And it would make sense at this point to have something on fire with this like central character that you're seeing pass over.

386
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I mean, not the I guess the foot being on fire would be too gruesome.

387
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Yes, that's pretty good.

388
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:58,520
The alcohol being on fire makes would make a lot of sense in the concept art.

389
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
There's also a bird laughing.

390
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,520
I can't tell if it's at him or with him because he's laughing, too.

391
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Also drunk, the bird probably drunk as well.

392
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Yeah, the bird's got a mug.

393
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
The bird's got an equally big mug.

394
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Oh, that's right. You know what?

395
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
If you're that's how it is in the ride, too.

396
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I didn't realize till looking at a photo now that yeah, his parrot pal is perched on a mug.

397
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,520
Right. So they're implicating the parrot in all of this pirate bad pirate behavior.

398
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,520
The pirates are also corrupt.

399
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
The parrots are corrupt. That's what I'm saying.

400
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,520
No, I did. I say pirate or parrot. Yeah, yeah.

401
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
You said I meant parrot.

402
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,520
Parrot. OK. Is that why pirates and parrots are paired?

403
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Because the word is similar.

404
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Parrot, pirate. Yeah, you're I mean, it's P and R.

405
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
I'd be onto something.

406
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Apparently, I was trying to figure out if this guy talks or has dialogue beyond just singing the song.

407
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:02,520
And I saw it said somewhere that if you listen close to the parrot sings a parrot's life for me.

408
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Oh, really?

409
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Apparently, possibly. But the videos are hard.

410
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,520
I don't think this guy really has specific dialogue.

411
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Do you do you have counter info to that?

412
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
I didn't see anything about that.

413
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,520
And I've never heard anything. Yeah.

414
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,520
But I mean, it makes sense because he's kind of far away from you, too.

415
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,520
I mean, he's not that far, but like he's up and you can't really see his mouth very well.

416
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,520
It's all about the foot. Yes.

417
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Because I don't even know that like before we started doing this very strange podcast that we do,

418
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,520
if I would have even like maybe casually registered that he was holding alcohol.

419
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Right. Like all I would have known is, oh, yeah, the foot.

420
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,520
I mean, it's always all about the foot with you, Michael.

421
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,520
So, you know, it's a litmus test how different we are.

422
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,520
I'm drawn to the alcohol and you're drawn to the foot.

423
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Like three years ago, before we were doing the podcast, would you have identified what he was holding just casually?

424
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,520
I just hadn't thought about this specific guy that much until right now.

425
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,520
Right. So you wouldn't have necessarily known what he was holding.

426
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,520
If you're not if you're looking at it from a certain angle, it kind of looks like a barrel more than a jug.

427
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,520
I mean, you don't see jugs of this size very often anymore.

428
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Right. No, it's a real balthazar.

429
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,520
It's a balthazar. Yeah.

430
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,520
What size it is, actually.

431
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I don't think it's because 16, that's pretty, that's pretty huge.

432
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
16 liter bottle.

433
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,520
If it's taking up like your torso, how big is that?

434
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
This is too hard.

435
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,520
It's all I'll end up just looking at images of bottles for a long time and that'll be boring.

436
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,520
I might as well as maybe I don't think it's any more than a Jeroboam.

437
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Yeah, we wouldn't we wouldn't want to bore the listeners on this podcast.

438
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Never.

439
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
We wouldn't do that to everyone out there.

440
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
We never have and we never will.

441
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Never.

442
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Mike, you say he's far away, but apparently they there have been problems before with his scarves and pants being drapey enough that people could,

443
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,520
you know, at least in the Disneyland one, reach up and try to pull his pants down.

444
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,520
Wow. Really? I didn't see that.

445
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,520
I think now they have to be more careful with not letting that scarf go.

446
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Interesting. I mean, I think I've said this a couple of times on the show before.

447
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,520
The scariest version of that is I saw someone grab the rope on Indiana Jones at the end in the last, the boulder scene.

448
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Wow.

449
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,520
And I was like, oh my God, that should not be happening.

450
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
The whole animatronics going to come down.

451
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,520
If you think about it, this is kind of a precursor to that.

452
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:07,520
Like a character be confidently having an animatronic in a position besides, you know, a few feet away from you in a museum glass kind of way.

453
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,520
I can't even. Well, I guess that, you know, the Tiki birds are all hung above you and they get pretty close.

454
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:23,520
But yeah, it's a unique way to display an animatronic and being able to go right under that foot definitely is interesting.

455
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,520
And it shows you like the, you know, the dimensionality and the realism of the ride.

456
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,520
They're willing to let you get that close to a fake body part.

457
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:42,520
I don't think even with Indiana Jones, I don't even think on the episode we did years ago at this point, we even like gave it as much credit because that is so crazy that it's just dangling.

458
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And this and this foot.

459
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Yeah, this foot, you said realism, which is what I was thinking.

460
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I was thinking like, why is this so memorable for people?

461
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,520
And I do think it's because it looks so real.

462
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,520
I think there's something that like sticks out because it like, especially when you're a kid, the whole thing, you know, is fake.

463
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,520
But when you're a child, you're a little bit more willing to like buy into the scariness and the reality of it.

464
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,520
And I think the foot seems so real to you.

465
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:19,520
It's this moment that like truly confuses your brain where you're like, I know that's a robot, but that foot looks very real.

466
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Well, I saw a lot of people, a few people saying like on message boards or whatever that they were always afraid the mud would drip on them.

467
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Yeah, sure. You don't want mud on your face.

468
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Yeah, especially foot mud.

469
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Foot mud? No, thank you.

470
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Well, most people would say no, thank you.

471
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,520
I do not like foot mud being dripped on my face.

472
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
That is not a thing I'm into.

473
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,520
All right. I swear.

474
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Not your face. Got it.

475
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
OK.

476
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Look me to a lie detector. I'll go through the whole body.

477
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,520
I'll go through all the body parts that I don't like foot mud dripped on.

478
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
Don't like it on my little butt.

479
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,520
I do not like foot mud dripped on my little butt.

480
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,520
You can you can print that on a t-shirt and attribute the quote to me, even though you came up with it.

481
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Because there's some auditory.

482
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Does anyone have a lie detector at home and they could just run this episode through it?

483
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Yeah, that's how it works. I think that should work fine. Yeah.

484
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Well, to continue the whiplash of, you know,

485
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,520
very pervy talk over to real

486
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
imaginary info.

487
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,520
I think maybe some of the reasons, the realism of the foot,

488
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,520
I think could be credited to a step of the imaginary process called figure finishing,

489
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,520
which is in the case of, you know, the tiki room.

490
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:11,520
It's the application of the feathers with an animatronic that, you know, that doesn't have dirt or hair.

491
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,520
It might just be the shading and, you know, making sure it's a consistent skin tone.

492
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,520
And in this case, it is applying each and every piece of hair specifically.

493
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,520
And I figured out who did it. I figured out who put all the hair on. Oh, oh, great.

494
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:35,520
That is Harriet Burns, who is the first female imagineer, the first female hired by that department.

495
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Her name is hair. Her name is hair. Yes.

496
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Wow. Wow. I'd put that together. Very good.

497
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Harriet Burns was she worked on the tiki room.

498
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,520
She worked on after that, the little singing birds in Mary Poppins.

499
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,520
And then on this and the tennis, I think, you know, I think a lot of haunted mansion as well.

500
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,520
And there's there's a couple of pieces of media that mentioned this pirate specifically

501
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,520
and that she had to apply each and every weight.

502
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,520
I even found this might be terrible quality through the the Skype or whatever.

503
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,520
But here's her talking about doing this.

504
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:27,520
I had to put the hairs in one by one. We had everything we did. We did accurately and well.

505
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,520
That's her. That's Harriet Burns.

506
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,520
She's a little bit like the old specials that I was talking about a couple years ago talking about

507
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,520
in a special feature on the Pirates of the Caribbean DVD or something.

508
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,520
She's such a if you look up, look her up, she's such a familiar face when you if you watched any of those old specials

509
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,520
where Walt was walking around like the Imagineering building, looking at like robots and stuff.

510
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,520
And not only that, you bring that up.

511
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:08,520
We we've probably all seen that special where Walt is taking a one of those tour guides around the writing crop kind of tour guides

512
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,520
and and showing her the model of pirates, which is a few years out from being built.

513
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,520
Harriet Burns built that model. The entire thing was her.

514
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Wow, that's cool. Yeah. Yeah. So a major figure in this ride.

515
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,520
And the crazy piece of trivia, and this is vetted from Harriet Burns's granddaughter,

516
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:35,520
that this character, the dirty footed pirate, is based on Harriet Burns's milkman.

517
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,520
Wow. Yeah. How about that?

518
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,520
There is a real world inspiration for this character.

519
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,520
And it's a milkman. The milkman. Yeah.

520
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,520
So the dirt. Yeah. The dirty messy boy is based on the milkman.

521
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,520
You always think of a milkman being like in an immaculate like white outfits.

522
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Well, yeah. But if they got short sleeves on that shirt and they got hairy arms, you know.

523
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,520
Well, do what a milkman wear short pants.

524
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I suppose in the summer, maybe it would probably depend on the company policies of the milk distribution company, I would guess.

525
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,520
Right. But in a very hot climate, you think it would be like torture to not allow a milkman to not wear some short white pants.

526
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:31,520
That's true. Yeah. Postal workers and like UPS delivery workers, they wear shorts in the hot days of summer.

527
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Well, I'm going to Google little tiny milkman shorts.

528
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,520
And that's not because I'm into milkman and little tiny shorts. OK, I'm just doing it. It's just research for this episode.

529
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,520
OK, all right. You know what? I believe you.

530
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:55,520
I believe you, too, Scott. It's not like you're like have an appropriate name like Harriet Burns, the hair supplier or Michael the foot man Carlson.

531
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Thank you for releasing the foot man. Yeah, that's better.

532
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,520
Although paired with foot foot man or foot boy and foot boys creepier foot boys.

533
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Yeah, it's foot boy is creepier.

534
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,520
But I'm the foot man. Yes.

535
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,520
Which is very normal. Yep.

536
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,520
But you did just admit to being the foot man.

537
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,520
You got him, Jason. I know.

538
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,520
No, no, no. You did it. When you're caught, you're caught.

539
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,520
I'm a big no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm a big fan of the foot clan.

540
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,520
The shredders gang of ninja and ninja robots from the Ninja Turtles.

541
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
That's what I'm not.

542
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,520
We use it, but independent, we can somebody can just pull that audio.

543
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,520
You did say I am the foot man.

544
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,520
All the audio all you want. Put it on a T-shirt for all I care.

545
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,520
All right. Well, then let's set up the email. Mike is foot man at Gmail.com.

546
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,520
And now the shoe is off the other foot.

547
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
We're going to get so many free weeks of quibby.

548
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,520
The WWE now all these emails.

549
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Oh, that's right. You can sign up for everything. Yeah.

550
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,520
Yeah. Three trials.

551
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,520
Well, so yeah, this lucky.

552
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,520
Does that imply that it probably it's just a physical resemblance, this milkman thing.

553
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:32,520
But I'd like to think that one day Harriet Burns opened her door and found her her milkman lying on her stoop.

554
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:43,520
Well, missing missing one shoe and missing one shoe and sock and him just nursing a you know, a real balthazar of milk.

555
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,520
He passed out on her front yard one day.

556
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:57,520
With a parrot with a parrot like milk man, his milk parrot, his milk parrot.

557
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,520
And she had to get him back somehow.

558
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:10,520
And then maybe like maybe like she didn't report him to his boss, but then his boss went on the ride and went, wait a minute.

559
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,520
That's Steve got off the ride, called him Steve. You're fired.

560
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Do you think that maybe after the milkman found out that he was the pirate, it was like a Kenny Kramer Seinfeld situation where famously Larry David lived next to a guy named Kenny Kramer and based Kramer from Seinfeld on him.

561
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:39,520
And then after that happened, Kenny Kramer was trying to like do the Seinfeld New York tour and like trying to capitalize on the popularity of the show.

562
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,520
So do you think like he was like, I'm the dirty pirate milkman.

563
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:49,520
Yeah, and he yeah, he's you could like go get lectures from him.

564
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:58,520
He'd tell you stories of being being a dirty milkman and he'd drink a whole jug in front of you.

565
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
It was a real fun show.

566
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,520
I mean, I would have paid. I would pay for that.

567
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,520
I assume he's passed away at this point.

568
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
That was a long time ago.

569
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,520
It's likely also funny you bring up Kramer because Kramer is the ass man and крупhans

570
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Yeah.

571
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Well, what else about this guy?

572
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,520
I mean, I was pretty it blew my mind to know that now to know who did that all play a role in the show.

573
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Well, what else about this guy?

574
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:41,520
I mean, I was pretty it blew my mind to know that now to know who did that all passed by that foot and not just, you know, admire the foot, not just see the level of dirt or mud versus not.

575
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,520
But now I know who did it and who they based it on.

576
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,520
We know so much now.

577
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,520
Yeah, I mean, it really fleshes out the character of the dirty foot pirate.

578
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Yeah, I, he's not my favorite pirate.

579
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,520
Don't get that.

580
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Maybe I said this already.

581
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
I don't want we don't we'll get to it.

582
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,520
We'll do an episode about each specific pirate at a certain point.

583
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,520
Yeah.

584
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,520
I mean, we now we have to figure out the battle plan.

585
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:21,520
And it's good that we talked about this for so long as this takes it off the, you know, the big the massive content that we have to do about pirates because, you know, so this is a good one.

586
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,520
You know, so this is like a good, you know, whatever 45 minutes we've taken care of already.

587
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,520
So that only leaves, you know, like 23 and a half hours.

588
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Yeah, roughly.

589
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,520
At least I've done like one Disneyland version.

590
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Oh, sure. Yes.

591
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
Okay.

592
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,520
Changes in clothing between the two coasts.

593
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,520
Mm hmm.

594
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:54,520
Yeah, the different speeds by which the boat goes and the different rides across like Tokio's goes faster than Disneyland's.

595
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
The boat goes faster.

596
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
Right.

597
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,520
That's going to be a whole episode is boat.

598
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,520
It's just going to be Pirates of the Caribbean slash boat speeds episode.

599
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,520
We'll measure them.

600
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,520
We'll take a speedometer on all of them.

601
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:22,520
I mean, we added a chapter got added alone for that optical illusion added to Disneyland a few years ago where like the skeleton you float by the skeleton and it becomes a pirate when you hit a certain point.

602
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,520
Oh my gosh, I could.

603
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,520
Yeah, we do 45 on that easy.

604
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Yeah.

605
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
We got a lot of work to do.

606
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:38,520
I was thinking, you know how we we have been covering the Haunted Mansion every Halloween.

607
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:45,520
Maybe the move is to start covering Pirates of the Caribbean every talk like a pirate day.

608
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
Oh, yeah.

609
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
Maybe.

610
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,520
I mean, wouldn't that be a pretty epic sauce idea to do?

611
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Wouldn't that be like awesome balls dipped in sauteed and epic sauce?

612
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
You said it perfectly.

613
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,520
Yeah, I can't even prove upon that.

614
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,520
That'd be like the bacon of podcast series.

615
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,520
Yeah.

616
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Wow.

617
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,520
I think you're I think you're right.

618
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,520
Yeah.

619
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
Um, be pretty random.

620
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,520
We totes rando and maybe that's that we got to start doing it.

621
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,520
So, um, uh, yeah, there's there's a reason they call you Scott the wordsmith.

622
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,520
I mean, I'll I'll take that one again.

623
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,520
If your biggest problem is me being alliterative, then I think I escaped this episode.

624
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,520
How about the how about Scott, that dirty word boy?

625
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,520
Oh, little dirty word boy.

626
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Yeah.

627
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,520
Someone given the dirty little word boy a run for the run for their money with that

628
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,520
sort of, uh, it's a little dirty word boy.

629
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,520
Oh, no.

630
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,520
Run for their money with that sort of, uh, evocative that rose.

631
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,520
Yeah.

632
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
Print that on a T-shirt to boy.

633
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
Dear God, you survived podcast.

634
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
The right I'm getting out of here.

635
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520
We're pulling this.

636
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,520
We're pulling this thing back up the waterfall ASAP.

637
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,520
This is going to come out with a lot of edits.

638
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:14,520
So on behalf of the dirty little word boy, the messy boy and the foot man, uh, it's been

639
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
another classic podcast.

640
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
The ride, the second gate.

641
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,520
I want to tell everybody that we just recorded for two and a half hours actually, but you're

642
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
going to see a 50 minute runtime.

643
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
That's how much we cut out.

644
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,520
You only you only heard you heard the stuff that was just kind of weird.

645
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,520
That's right.

646
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,520
Yeah.

647
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Yikes.

648
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,520
All right.

649
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,520
Um, and, uh, and you know, actually we just went on another tangent that little, that

650
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,520
hiccup you just heard that was another hour and a half.

651
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,520
So, uh, oh my God, you guys, we've been doing this all day.

652
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Let's get out of here.

653
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,520
Uh, all right.

654
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,520
Stopping recording now.

655
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,520
Thanks for listening everybody.
