1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Warning, the following podcast contains annoying seafood, bankruptcy, and animatronics that are very divorced.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In order to listen, you must redeem 150,000 tickets.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Jamie Loftus returns for Chuck E. Cheese 2 on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks that won't let in any listeners who don't pass our patented weird adult check.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm Scott Entertainment Gardener, joined by Mike Entertainment Carlson.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am here, I'd like to say hello and thank you to all of the little Cliffords listening out there.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The new name for our listeners, Cliffords.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'd just like to say thank you for listening and your support.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Seems like everybody was fine with it.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As fine as I was hearing it.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The idea that our fans are now named after the Martin Short movie about the creepy man child Clifford.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's fine, it's all fine.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hey, and of course we're also joined by Jason P. Pieplate.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello Jason.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's right.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now everyone will please make sure you have the identical hand stamp, the matching hand stamps.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We can continue with the recording.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We discovered Jason playing drums on pie plates in a kitchen.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's how we started this whole podcast, is we heard him rhythmically drumming.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And that's why.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So that's why we didn't know he was a perfect fit for this.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can distinctly remember Mike like holding his hand up to his ear going like, hey, do that again.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What was that? I said.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think he really got something there.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah. So that's the origin story.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Marvin Berry kind of moment.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Look, this is very exciting.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We're returning to the world of Chuck E. Cheese, one of our favorite topics.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's been two years since we talked about it and now it's Chuck E. Cheese 2.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's been an interesting two years, you would say, for Chuck E. Cheese.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You might say horrible.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You might say disastrous.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's probably a lot of things you could say.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And we're so excited to be joined once again by our guest from the previous episode, I guess, resident Chuck E.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Cheese expert and also great comedian, writer, podcaster from the LIDA podcast, Jamie Loftus.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Jamie, wait, Jamie E. Loftus.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I think that legally I need to end Henny because there can only be one.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There can never be one.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Jamie Henny.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Jamie Henny.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What an ugly name.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's so I mean, not that I guess I guess Helen Henny is no better thought out than any of the other character names.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Except Pasquale, which I Pasquale P. Pie plate is pretty brilliant.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Helen Henny. It just feels so half-assed.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, well, like we were talking the last time you were here, we talked about the other female characters that they just threw away.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But they had more fun names like Sally Sachet.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, they had good ones.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Actually thought out ones. Yeah.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I learned a little more than I had previously about Dolly Dimples.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Dimples is a lot of fun.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She's like kind of a I guess sort of a Mae West type hippo in kind of a sort of a clown wig is what the hair is like.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That sounds safe.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I feel like they've introduced a new female character in the last year named Bella.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What is Bella? I don't know about Bella.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Bella is new. I can't tell.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So what there's a lot to unpack, but like I can't tell how like where you go to find out what is currently canon because no matter where you go, it seems like you're operating on a kind of a different level of canon.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Bella is a bunny.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She speaks Spanish.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She's friends with Helen Henney, but she exists solely on the YouTube channel.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She's just only there.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She's nowhere else.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right. We've talked a little bit about this.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They produce still to this day so much content and they put it on YouTube and there are just like long running parodies they've done on YouTube.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They put full albums on YouTube.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They put new dances on YouTube.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I also came.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't know.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There were new characters I was finding when I went through and I was like, is this a one off?

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is this something that's are they part of the magical whatever five that we know now?

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
They interviewed Michael Pena like last week.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, I want to talk about that.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I would love to talk about the Michael Pena interview because it came out.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I checked.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I checked. It came out the same week as the Meghan Harry Oprah interview.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And I feel like it really got, you know, kind of swept under the rug because there was just another big ticket interview and no one was talking about Chuckie and Michael Pena promoting Tom and Jerry from his house.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, because we're like in the this year's promotion is named the four C the celebration of the four seasons of fun.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Which for spring, the spring celebration is a tie in with the Tom and Jerry movie.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And he does interview Michael Pena.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And now it is can and seemingly that Michael Pena is Chuck E.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Cheese's favorite actor.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, he says he says in the top of the interview, you're my favorite actor.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And that at the end, I love your work.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I love World Trade Center.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know how well, uh, command.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What is the what is the Seth Rogen mall movie?

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Observe and report.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know that it's age well, but I bet your performance is evergreen in it.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You really commit it well to the character.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I loved how in because you could tell.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, I guess I would assume and maybe I can't tell if I'm being like truly like out of my mind here, but I'm like, I'm guessing that it wasn't actually Chuckie on the other end.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It was just some guy being like, and then Chuckie will say this and then Chuckie will say this because I feel like if were I Michael Pena, unless he's just a really like smooth operator, I would have had bigger reactions to what was going on on the other end.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Like if Chuckie cheese told me you are my favorite actor, I love your work.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I would be crying like he was just like, oh, okay, thanks.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Like he didn't seem very into it.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It was really stiff.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It felt extremely space ghosty in its level of disconnect.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So like, did they properly explain what was going on?

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Did they repurpose like a just an affiliate feed from a Kansas City news station and make it Chuckie later?

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's I'm glad we all caught this.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This was a very strange event.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay, Michael, Michael, stand by the bowling for soup guy is coming on the line.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And now he's not the bowling for soup guy.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When he talks to you, he's Chuckie cheese, but you probably know him as the bowling for soup guy.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is Michael Pena more likely to know Chuckie?

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know how old he is, so I don't know if Chuckie cheese would have been a big thing for him.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I wonder if he's more familiar with Chuckie cheese or bowling for soup just personally.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think that says a lot about who you are.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes. How would you if he if he were to rank them in terms of how much he liked it?

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, yeah. If now if you if you before the voice change, we're already a massive Chuckie cheese fan and a massive bowling for soup fan, then there was a certain day 10 years or so ago that was like better than a thousand birthdays.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This would have been it.

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I guess we should say I mean, I would suggest the listener go back and listen to our first episode probably before doing this, because this is we're really throwing you in the deep end here.

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Chuckie cheese, of course, in the last 10 ish years has been voiced by the lead singer of the rock and roll band bowling for soup.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I just want to do some filling in in case you're starting here.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're starting on the Empire Strikes Back of Chuckie cheese podcast, the right episodes.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We are throwing you right in.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We'll try to Cliff notes things here and there.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's important info.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The thriving YouTube channel is important info, which was news to me the last time we did an episode.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There's also something from that YouTube channel.

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This came up on our Patreon, but not on the main feed.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I well, Jamie, it seems like you like catch the YouTube channel pretty frequently.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
OK, then you probably know this was this is back in September.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So you you you've very well probably saw this, but we discovered around the holidays that Munch is now a DJ with sort of a dead mouse marshmallow vibe.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And we were pretty into this.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Really? This is our favorite move in a while.

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I forgot about this.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes. And I also liked that the comments are turned off for that video for some reason.

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, very deflective of any criticism that who would be mad.

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I DJ Munch rules.

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I love it.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Super cool.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The the comments were also turned off on a video I watched right before we started, which I ended up on the forums, the forums that are really devoted to all this, which is called the forums are now called Retro Pizza Zone.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I saw a thread that was about what is the worst Chuck E.

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Cheese show video, I guess, like, OK, the videos that played behind them and songs, the combos or whatever.

141
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
People were trying to say was the one they like.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They disliked the most.

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And there was somebody really adamant about January 96 is the worst of all time or January 96.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Number two, I'm still mad about it.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And I watched it.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It was just kind of a confusing piece about Helen trying to be a cheerleader and auditioning to be a cheerleader against like 11 year old girls, like much younger.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It was just baffling more than anything.

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But somebody really hated it.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And the comments were turned off.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And it made me wonder, did the retro pizza zone crew all come and attack the comments and the user at, you know, nip all that in the bud?

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There's a lot of rage, apparently.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm questioning if we should even be doing this again.

153
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't I don't want to incite anyone's anger, but I that that sounds like more of a them problem.

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That sounds like a perfectly fun tape.

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Watching it, watching a gigantic costumed hen in direct competition with a real human child.

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have no problem with it.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Sounds great.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I mean, go to the school like worried.

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Does she even qualify for this?

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Does she is?

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How do they know each other?

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
School.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I thought she works and is in a band.

164
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So if she's 12, then that's weird.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was unclear how old they are.

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How does any of they all dress like they're 12?

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like original Rat Chucky is probably older than little boy skateboard rock and roll mouse.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, it seems like he seems like he's 56.

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, he's an older man.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He's like he's in the Friars Club and he's an older man.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And then, yeah, the mouse version seems like he could be 15.

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Mm hmm.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, it's unclear.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And they're all kind of like children now, like the puppet versions actually all feel like they could be like nine.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, I like the puppet versions, by the way, in general.

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I like it a lot.

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They satisfy like that they aren't creepy.

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can see why a brand would want to be not creepy these days.

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I think like, I don't know, I could see kids liking these little puppet and maybe like never even going to the restaurant.

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Maybe Chuck E. Cheese is all digital now.

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, especially, yeah, if they're doing school at home, they have a run of videos called like Daily Afternoon Break.

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They only update them like every three weeks, so they're not quite daily.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It was a good reminder, though, of a very strange YouTube feature.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Like a big thing I use for the show a lot is the save button on YouTube that adds it to a watch later playlist.

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And for some reason, that is disabled for videos for, quote unquote, for kids.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But sometimes people will just tag stuff that's been ripped to YouTube for kids, I guess, so it doesn't get copyright strikes.

189
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So there's just some you can't.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I don't understand why that would protect children is turning off the watch later option.

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah, there are a lot of feature.

192
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't know.

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is how interesting this is, but there's a lot of restrictions on the Chuck E.

194
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Cheese videos.

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was watching on my phone yesterday and you can't minimize the video and search for another video while you're watching.

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It'll turn the video off for some reason.

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There's some feature.

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah, I don't know.

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Like I wanted to minimize the video on the YouTube app and then search for another Chuck E.

200
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Video while I'm watching the one in the little tiny window.

201
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No, they will not let you do that.

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's off limits, too, on the Chuck E.

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Cheese YouTube.

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They're very specific, particular about what they're allowing for some reason.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's yeah.

207
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was like, what are they hiding?

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What's their end game there?

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So you can't stop watching their their stuff.

210
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Also not. I mean, no offense to our boy, but not many people are watching it.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You know, it's like they average less than 10 K a video.

212
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I mean, is it are they trying to crush dissent?

213
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are they trying to stop negative discourse surrounding as a is it a freedom of speech thing?

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean, possibly.

215
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know.

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm just are they trying to hide?

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are they trying to hide five children missing from Chuck E.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Cheese? Did everyone come across that hoax from last year?

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't remember this hoax from last year.

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There's a lot of stuff we teased at the top.

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We'll talk about this as far as the recent years.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We should probably start with that.

223
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What's been going on?

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What's been up?

226
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I guess a lot has has been up.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We can start with some some of the more famous things.

228
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And we know we've talked about this a little and this really got out there.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But very early in in Pandemic 1.0 in the first generation of this never ending thing,

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
there was this strange story about people getting on Uber Eats or Postmates or whatever

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and seeing a pizza place in their neighborhood they've never heard of before

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that is called Pasquale's Pizza and Wings.

233
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And then once it gets there, maybe doing the math and putting together that this came from Chuck E.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Cheese for people who didn't know all this bullshit.

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They didn't realize maybe they know people did not recognize the name Pasquale offhand.

236
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But we, of course, saw what we would have known as soon as we saw.

237
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, regular people, it seems like, don't know that he's Pasquale.

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So that was a big that was a big early spike in the recent past with of Chuck E.

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Cheese oddity.

240
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes.

241
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, and it had the big story that kind of broke it was in west of Philadelphia where there is an unrelated

242
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Pasquale's Pizza.

243
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But now in later Pandemic, they are full on advertising on the Chuck E.

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Cheese.

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And then they are like, Pasquale's Pizza and Wings available on delivery.

246
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I love this pivot.

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think it's genius.

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I love it.

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I agree.

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They've leaned in so far.

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It is based on I almost last night I almost like took the challenge and was like, oh,

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll order one pizza from Chuck E.

253
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Cheese and one from Pasquale's and see what happens.

254
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But then it was like, I will almost definitely have two inedible pizzas.

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've done this before and people have done it before.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I looked it up on YouTube and my boyfriend and I found a channel called Big John TV.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's a family channel.

258
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They've done it.

259
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's definitely the same pizza.

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's made at the same location.

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They said that Pasquale's Pizza might have more sauce, but that could also just be at where they are.

262
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But it's the same pizza.

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I think it's so fun.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And they say like on the website as featured in the New Yorker and Newsday.

265
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And so I was like, what did the New Yorker say about Pasquale's Pizza?

266
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And what they just said is that it exists.

267
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They said this new brand is the latest example of Chuck E.

268
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Cheese Entertainment creatively adjusting to meet the needs of consumers in a unique way, allowing for more variety and convenient options available for delivery.

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And that's just quoting a spokesperson from Chuck E.

270
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Cheese.

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They also said that Pasquale's uses different ingredients from the standard Chuck E.

272
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Cheese pie to produce a more premium pizza experience.

273
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's all the New Yorker said.

274
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They didn't say it was good.

275
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
They didn't say that they'd tried it, but it was technically featured in the New Yorker.

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So, yeah, they weren't lying.

277
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It feels the whole thing feels to me like like an afterthought.

278
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Like, Jason, you're saying suddenly they're embracing it.

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Suddenly it's on the site.

280
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But when this all happened, it was just a weird Reddit discovery.

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then all of a sudden once reached for comment, they had all this stuff to say about it.

282
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But then why didn't they say it first?

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Why was there no press release about this?

284
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It seems like they got caught and then had pulled together corporate claptrap and pretend like this is always the plan.

285
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Right.

286
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It was a trick.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It was started out as a trick.

288
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This is like some old Chuck stuff.

289
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And there were other like there are other restaurants doing it.

290
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't I didn't check if any other restaurant has just really made a spin off company to instead of admitting they made a mistake.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But I don't know, because it was like I think Chili's had done it.

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This whole this whole I went down the the Big John TV rabbit hole because this was a series this family was doing of ordering like one from the actual restaurant and one from like the fake name the restaurant made up.

293
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But it was like Chili's had done it.

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Applebee's had done it.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Smokey Bones had done it.

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But Chuck E. Cheese were the only ones that got really brutally called out for it.

297
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There is a big price difference.

298
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I think Shakey's pizza.

299
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh really?

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah.

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Shakey's didn't?

302
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Huh.

303
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But these things don't have IP.

304
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They can't like like what is it?

305
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What's the fake Applebee's called or what's the fake Shakey's called?

306
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Do we know?

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well, Shakey's was selling like Shakey's chicken sandwiches and Mojo potatoes.

308
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I keep getting Instagram ads of these disgusting looking chicken sandwiches with just like a inch of mayo on top and bottom of the chicken.

309
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And I'm like Shakey's what the hell man this sucks.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Applebee's was called Neighborhood Wings.

311
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, yeah.

312
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I think it's like the knockoff Halloween costumes we talked about a little while back.

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Like what word soup can we do that reminds you of our name?

314
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But why are they avoiding their own copyright and yet trying to evoke their own themes and characters?

315
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What is this entire operation?

316
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think they're trying to hit like multiple markets because obviously there's people that love chain bad chain restaurants.

317
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And then there's people that are like I'd rather order like locally with stuff that I feel like is better.

318
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's not just mass produced chain restaurant crap.

319
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So they're trying to trick.

320
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's all an elaborate trick of having multiple.

321
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think there was one.

322
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I forget which restaurant that was doing.

323
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
They like four different names on an app.

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So they were trying to appeal to like four different types of people.

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Like your person that might like a chain restaurant and the person that wants like just like a mom and pop pizza place.

326
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Like so I think they're just trying to it's a trick.

327
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's an elaborate trick to just market to different types of consumers.

328
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's what I think.

329
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah.

330
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Early in the pandemic, too, I didn't really know what a ghost kitchen was.

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And now I feel like I know everything about them.

332
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Like I think I've ordered from like three different ones that most notorious, the flavor town kitchen being run out of the city walk.

333
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Wait, really?

334
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, yes.

335
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah.

336
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Because Robert Earl and Guy Fieri have an existing relationship with their chicken guy endeavor.

337
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And so, yeah, if you if you look up flavor town, you can order from the city walk location or the Encino location.

338
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And he shared kitchens out of the book.

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I still find it baffling that you say just book.

340
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I feel does anyone else on earth only say book?

341
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I cannot.

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, I feel like I'm family when I'm there, you know, and I also cannot remember which one I'm supposed to say.

343
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, it's so you don't have to say the right.

344
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I don't have to say Beppo or Peppo.

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I cannot remember in this moment, as usual, which is the actual one.

346
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If you had to guess which one it was, though, which one is it?

347
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I think I think it's Beppo.

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's the one that's the alliterative one.

349
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes, it is Beppo.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're correct.

351
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Where did Peppo come from?

352
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's just I don't know.

353
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Just said Peppo and we roasted him pretty hard the first time.

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

355
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Now it's in his head and we've ruined his.

356
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There's a lot of things we've we've ruined in his brain.

357
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's just ruined.

358
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And someone ran the literal translation.

359
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
One of the incorrect one, I believe, translates to Beephole.

360
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, yeah.

361
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
All I just think about is Beephole.

362
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We're trying to reach for this word, this name.

363
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This was the first Christmas Eve in like five years that I didn't go to Bucatabeppo

364
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
for my Christmas Eve dinner.

365
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Oh, that's right.

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Geez.

367
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, then you're on a first name.

368
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You should just do Bucca.

369
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, we're pretty close.

370
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I like to pass the picture of Buzz Aldrin eating the gigantic meatball.

371
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Give it a high five as I pass.

372
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Is that a back at home thing or are you going to the City Walk or the Encino or something?

373
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I would go to the which the one at the is it the Grove that has one?

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think it was the Grove.

375
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

376
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Oh, yeah.

377
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
OK. Yeah.

378
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I just I never went home for like my first five years living here.

379
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I didn't go home.

380
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And so my my other friends who didn't go home would meet at Bucatabeppo.

381
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We would get we would buy the pictures and everything.

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It would be it was a blast.

383
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Is there a there's like a is it a pope?

384
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's a pope room at City Walk.

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Is there a pope room in each Bucatabeppo?

386
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I've only ever gotten sat on the balcony, which I don't know if that is like a compliment or an insult.

387
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But they they I've only been.

388
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, I've been sat at the same place over and over and over, which maybe is just where they sit when no one's there because it's Christmas Eve.

389
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And that's the only time I've ever been.

390
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But they sit you next to this gorgeous statue of a naked lady.

391
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And she's in the picture.

392
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And and it's and it's a blast.

393
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
All right.

394
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We have five years worth of these photos.

395
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That's great.

396
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That is great.

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We have to get to all the locations at a certain point when we do a big book Bucatabeppo like Saga, I think.

398
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah.

399
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Like figure out.

400
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah.

401
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Which one's the best nationwide?

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
All of them.

403
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Did you guys do the the pope room at the time?

404
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We toured the I toured the pope.

405
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I didn't sit and eat there.

406
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It seemed like this was a range like we had to know a guy.

407
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah.

408
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
When I say tour, we walked around the table and took pictures and giggled.

409
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That's basically what we did.

410
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We have photos from the pope room.

411
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That was the only I've only actually eaten there once.

412
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It was that time we did a couple of years ago.

413
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah.

414
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:21,000
When we're all vaccinated, we'll have to reserve the Capri room at the Encino one, which is the one that a real housewife of Beverly Hill designed.

415
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And it looks like she just bought every piece of all the branches and fake lemons from a Michael's Crafts and just filled a room with it.

416
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So good.

417
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That's high on the list.

418
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah, it genuinely is, really.

419
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.

420
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:48,000
OK, so the other if we're talking about big things that have happened that have been Internet prominent, I bet, Jamie, you're probably like us and got tagged in this 100 times with this story.

421
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This bizarre thing where I think this was also a Reddit find this frightening post apocalyptic photo of the dumpster animatronic.

422
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Like rotting away in a landfill, looking like it had been shot in the face and several other places.

424
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And this is the drama of it being in the desert.

425
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It felt like very, very Mad Max or very Breaking Bad.

426
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
End of Casino.

427
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

428
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Is there any clarity on where that was?

429
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Because I feel like this picture has had a few different rounds of life.

430
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I've been tagged in this picture a million times, like two or three different times.

431
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I can't tell how old the picture is.

432
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I can never tell where the dumpster is, like where the landfill is.

433
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
There's no I can't trace a history.

434
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Well, yeah, I don't know the place, but I know that it's safe now.

435
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
That I know.

436
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
If you look a little further, like somebody bought it so that it isn't they didn't just die or get.

437
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh, wow.

438
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Burn up.

439
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It didn't get Toy Story three.

440
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It does.

441
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So Chuckie lives.

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I don't know if it's restored or anything yet, but it's basically.

443
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh, that's what I found.

444
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I didn't know that.

445
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah, apparently.

446
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

447
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I only get tagged in the dumpster picture five million times.

448
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
There you go.

449
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, wow.

450
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
This is from a dumpster.

451
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh, this is from a Newsweek story said that, yeah, someone bought it.

452
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Someone restored it.

453
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And this is supposedly the Instagram account of the person who got it and restored it.

454
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And as you can see, the description is account is closed.

455
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Please stop requesting.

456
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Follow requests will be blocked.

457
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
More weird.

458
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He has one phone.

459
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He only allowed one.

460
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Well, one person.

461
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And that is in error.

462
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Instagram shows one in error.

463
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Are you talking about maybe should have said, I think we all guess because there's a side by side.

464
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
There's the one rotting away in such a sorry state.

465
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And then there's just a fully restored the kind of like Latter Day version with a big C on his shirt.

466
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I mean, it looks brand new.

467
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It looks right out of the factory.

468
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I demand a process video.

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I want to know how it was done.

470
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Right, right, right.

471
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Otherwise, like, are we sure?

472
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What if that's a fake?

473
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That could be any check.

474
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I saw a check like that last night.

475
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So you did go in, but you picked up.

476
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You didn't deliver.

477
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I picked up the first of all, because the prices triple when you get delivery.

478
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's like ridiculous.

479
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And the pickup, they desperately want you to pick up for some reason.

480
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's weird because it's like the restaurant is not open.

481
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You can't sit there.

482
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
There's obviously no outdoor dining.

483
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You can't touch the games are covered in germs.

484
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Like, I don't know why there's but the carry out deals are pretty like they're like so good that it's kind of like suspicious.

485
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
They had like a four.

486
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You could get like four large pizzas for twenty dollars if you wanted to.

487
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh, like, which I don't want.

488
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So I just wanted to to go to the pickup counter for a few reasons.

489
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
First, because I was excited to record this today.

490
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Second, because I found out about a new menu item called the unicorn churros that are a part of the springtastic celebration that I wanted to try.

491
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And third, because I was hoping that I would be able to buy a Chuck E. Cheese toy truck that I've had my eyes on without paying for shipping.

492
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And I was able to accomplish all three.

493
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It was a great, productive trip.

494
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Geez. It was great.

495
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So do you have the truck?

496
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Can I do use a truck nearby?

497
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Let me.

498
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
My I was trying to figure out where to display it.

499
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I don't know where my boyfriend ended up deciding.

500
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I was like looking around for it.

501
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I have a picture of it that I'll send in the chat.

502
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's a good it's a great truck.

503
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The unicorn.

504
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I wish I could say the same of the unicorn churros.

505
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
They're not very good.

506
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
They taste like Froot Loops in a bad way.

507
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
They're very, very, very sweet.

508
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The truck was there.

509
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It was only three dollars.

510
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I had to I felt bad because there's like two people working at Chuck E. Cheese right now.

511
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There's a cook and a manager and there's really no need for anyone else.

512
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And so we were standing there for the longest time.

513
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm thrilled to announce they have not gotten rid of their single animatronic yet because some places have during the pandemic.

514
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So I was I was just taking it all in.

515
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And then like the manager came out from like desanitizing the games for nobody.

516
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And she was like, oh, you you must have ordered the unicorn churros, meaning that no one else has ordered anything recently.

517
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
She's like, oh, unicorn churros.

518
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
OK, I'll go get them.

519
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And I I was not I was being a coward.

520
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I made my boyfriend ask if we could buy the truck.

521
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I was just like standing there humiliated.

522
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And she we it just took a while for us to communicate to her that like she just kind of couldn't believe that we wanted it.

523
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
He was like, hey, could we actually could we buy something for behind the counter?

524
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I'd really love that truck.

525
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And she's like, there's no truck.

526
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And we had to be like, oh, no, it's like on the far left, the truck.

527
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And she's like, the truck with Chuck E. Cheese on it.

528
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And we were eventually able to get the truck.

529
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I was at the Eagle Rock Mall.

530
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They seem like they really have one person ordering a day.

531
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't understand why it's open, really.

532
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah, that's a good question.

533
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I wonder if there's any sort of income being made.

534
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Is there any like maybe there's some sort of organization they send like pizzas to in the morning or like there's some like is there anything maybe like because obviously what you're saying has got to be true where there's probably not a lot of people ordering take out a Chuck E.

535
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Cheese at the moment.

536
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So who?

537
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Good question.

538
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And no one's buying because what you're saying is you bought the truck from the normal ticket redemption area.

539
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah, yeah, which you can't access because there's like tape.

540
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You cannot get there.

541
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You just have to ask if if those things are on sale currently and they're like, yeah, no one's bought any of this in 18 months and they're happy to sell it to you.

542
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But you really have to ask because they will not believe you when you say that you want it.

543
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I have a feeling that procedure too is probably like location by location.

544
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Like maybe some won't sell it to you.

545
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I have had recently where I like if I'm going by a drug store, I go in and go to the pharmacy and go like, so what are you folks doing with extra vaccines at the end of the day?

546
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because a medical professional told me to do this.

547
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Like, hey, you know, there's a the best way to get a vaccine right now to start going around and asking what they're doing with their cancellations.

548
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You're you're saying the extra vaccines are very similar to getting to just buy with cash a toy from the Chuck E. Cheese Prize redemption counter.

549
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Well, getting to buy like, yeah, getting to buy.

550
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, like some places might sell you that outright for cash, the truck or some might go like, oh, we give them if there's people 65 and older in the store, they get it.

551
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If our employees do not want it.

552
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, they get the truck.

553
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So it's possible if you ask for the truck, they would say, well, LA County isn't allowing you to buy the truck right now.

554
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But you look at this list of 50 different things you could possibly have in addition to also maybe just having a doctor's note that says you should get the truck.

555
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Then, yes, we will sell you the truck.

556
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So it all could be exactly like that.

557
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I get that sort of case by case.

558
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So if I had taken that same energy into a vaccination site, I could have done something far more useful with my night last night.

559
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

560
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Hey, could I get sorry to bother?

561
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Could I get that that vial right over there?

562
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Well, that vial.

563
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
No one wants this.

564
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
This is the this is the AstraZeneca vaccine.

565
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No one wants this.

566
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh, well, you know, I like the attitude, Jason.

567
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You're coming in with feels like like Chuck E to me a little bit.

568
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm just pairing this because that's the topic.

569
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But so what are you doing with those extra vaccines at the end of the day?

570
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Well, I feel like a maniac asking, but literally like someone's like, oh, just start asking about the extras.

571
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And of course, it's been working, it seems like it's worth.

572
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, I know someone who got it from doing that trick at a Ralph's.

573
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So then I called a Ralph's with a pharmacy and they were like, oh, employees get it first and then 65 and older at the end of the day.

574
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And I'm like, OK, so that's a totally different policy from this other Ralph's pharmacy.

575
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Got it. Thank you.

576
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I said Dodger Stadium shut down early yesterday because not enough people like were getting the vaccines.

577
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's like they're I'm so confused by a lot of like narratives to going around.

578
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

579
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Where it's like somebody says something and then like an hour later you go, oh, that's actually not a story.

580
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's a game of telephone.

581
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So it's just so much going on with that.

582
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And it's same thing at Chuck E. Cheese, I'm sure, you know, you're getting.

583
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Well, that's the true relevant question is should Chuck E.

584
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Cheese get the vaccine on camera and what it I think it would help.

585
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I think yeah, I think he's a hero, at least to the rest of the band.

586
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I think it might help convince like Jasper's probably a denier Jasper's not sold on the vaccine.

587
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I also have the other because Chuck, I mean, everywhere has their like cursed pandemic merch, but Chuck E.

588
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
has sold some masks.

589
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I know because I have I got one for my birthday this year from my from my boyfriend's mother.

590
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Because she lives in Wisconsin and I, you know, she believes in the vaccine,

591
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
but she's not afraid of walking into a Chuck E.

592
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Cheese in the middle of a pandemic.

593
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So she contains multitudes.

594
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But she wanted to get a mask.

595
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
She marched in there to get me a Chuck E.

596
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Cheese mask and a birthday balloon.

597
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And, you know, I'm eternally grateful.

598
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I was worried for her, but apparently no one I mean, no one was there.

599
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
The updates I got, it was like the updates I got about the Chuck E.

600
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Cheese in Racine, Wisconsin, because she she like gave this stuff to me.

601
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And then I just had a million questions for her about what the interior of the Chuck E.

602
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Cheese is like since I was last there.

603
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And she was like, I don't know, it's still a Chuck E.

604
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Cheese. It sounds like it's changed quite a lot, though.

605
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So she would have been there in August of last year.

606
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The last time I went, they still had the full, full, full of the stuff.

607
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
They still had the full TV parody stuff, the movie parody stuff.

608
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
They had Chuck Feld.

609
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
They had like a Saturday night pizza slice.

610
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I forget.

611
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But now it's all gone.

612
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
All of the old decorations are gone.

613
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:44,000
They seem like they've followed through with this like big refurbishment they were talking about a couple of years ago of getting rid of all of the animatronics, not even a Chuck E.

614
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And it's just a wide dance floor for nobody because it's because no one can go.

615
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And and there is still a costumed character who she said came out to dance for just her when she was purchasing this mask.

616
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Pandemic. They still sent out a.

617
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They still had a costume.

618
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Essentially.

619
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Wow. It's I guess it's the safest role in the restaurant.

620
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You got a mask on at all times.

621
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Right.

622
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I wonder how state to state it is because I would imagine that like Chuck E.

623
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Cheese's in Wisconsin might be might have been a little more open than Chuck E.

624
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Cheese's in Southern California.

625
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't I don't know.

626
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't think in Southern California, I'm pretty sure they were just totally like you could do pick up.

627
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And that's it.

628
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
There was no there was no cost of character.

629
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Right.

630
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I think so.

631
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah. It's yet another one of those like COVID confusing case by case is the whole chain shut down.

632
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Seemingly not.

633
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
There are enough open that there's like as we've read about there.

634
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah. Here's the spring event and here's the Halloween event and here's how we can do it.

635
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
COVID safe.

636
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But then some places you can't go whatsoever.

637
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Boy, it must be confusing to to work there or to manage it or to be the to be the CEO, to be new CEO.

638
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
David McKillips must be a pretty tough job.

639
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
We we have not mentioned the like what a newspaper would consider newsworthy about Chuck E.

640
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Cheese, which is that during the pandemic, they did declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy and I believe closed a number of locations or are going to close a number of the locations.

641
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I have a story about that.

642
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I've had a big Chuck E.

643
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Year in spite of never leaving my home.

644
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah.

645
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So they did they close as they closed the location and it was like I forget they closed the location an hour or so from here.

646
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm trying to remember the name of it.

647
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But a tipster DM me an auction website because they were auctioning off a bunch of Chuck E.

648
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Cheese stuff.

649
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And like I was kind of nervous about it because I was like, well, I don't you know, who knows how safe they're being who but they were like, no, you just meet them outside and they give you your wares.

650
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So they were selling off stuff for fucking dirt cheap.

651
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It was like it was seaside.

652
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I forget if we were I had to like ask a friend with a pickup truck to to to take me.

653
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It was a whole project.

654
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But but the result is that I now have a ticket muncher in my home and I also in my in my shed because it turns out there's no room for this in my apartment.

655
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But I have one of those kid check like podiums.

656
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Wow.

657
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, I can so visualize the podium.

658
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Wow.

659
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That's a great item to get for $18.

660
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
There was no one wanted it.

661
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,000
No, I got I got the ticket muncher cost me $33 and the podium cost me $18.

662
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
No one wanted this shit.

663
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
They're like, if you've got a pickup truck and $50 will give you whatever you want.

664
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It was incredible.

665
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You could have bought like the whole showroom for $300.

666
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yes.

667
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Wow.

668
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah.

669
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It was good.

670
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's good.

671
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
We didn't hear about this or that pickup would have been a lot more like a rat race mad mad mad world.

672
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
We would have been like driving you off the road, Jamie.

673
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
We were trying to like trying to get there.

674
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Cannonball.

675
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I was kind of ashamed of it at the time.

676
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It was like I was I was pretty ashamed because I was like, I think this was like July, like late July, early August.

677
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And I was like, this is just not this is not how I should be using my time, money, energy.

678
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So I kind of like secretly bidding on it and then went to collect it in in shame.

679
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But I don't regret it because every morning I wake up and I look directly into my ticket muncher didn't work was one of the issues.

680
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But fortunately, there's no need for it to and it's now a bookshelf.

681
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Wow.

682
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Cool.

683
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah, we we've spent there was an episode recently where we spent like 20 minutes just fantasizing about owning McDonald and Play Play stuff.

684
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Oh, which is all expensive on eBay.

685
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It's like I mean, it's not expensive if you're rich, but still it's like maybe 10 grand.

686
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'll send you the auction site because I'd never it was like a very HTML.

687
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't know how the person who sent it to me like knew it existed, but everything there was just like I think it was places that were closing abruptly that were selling off large items.

688
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Like it was just a very they would have made a killing on eBay.

689
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But fortunately, I don't think that they had the time or ability to to care because I've paid so much like I've paid more for Chuck E.

690
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I've paid more for Chuck E.

691
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Cheese items than than that.

692
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Like it's ridiculous.

693
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That's crazy.

694
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah, I wonder.

695
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I wonder what's left.

696
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I mean, obviously, like the big ticket stuff for us would be like bowler hat Chuck.

697
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I mean, is munch is much on the ticket muncher that you have.

698
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah.

699
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
OK.

700
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And it's like newer munch.

701
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I assume it's the new.

702
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah, it's the new.

703
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I guess these would be the machines from the past 10 years or so with like the cartoon T shirt wearing munch.

704
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I was hoping it would be an old one, but it was all I wonder the one thing that they weren't selling off.

705
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And I asked the lady when I when I got there, I was like, so what happens to the animatronics?

706
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And they're like, we were told that that's like not none of our but they were like, we were told that that's a whole other thing.

707
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Like they they they weren't even brought into the discussion.

708
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
They were just selling off the skee ball machines and the and the random shit.

709
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I was in a bidding war with someone over the bathroom signs, but it was it didn't work out in my favor.

710
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The black helicopters and the black vans are coming from the animatronics.

711
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
They're going to whisk them away to the warehouse from the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

712
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm so curious where they're all going, because that was that was I was waiting for confirmation from somewhere that they were like not being sold off to other places.

713
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,000
They're being brought somewhere or they're being like brought to they're being repurposed in some way, but it's not it's not a people facing issue.

714
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
They said, don't fucking worry about it.

715
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Well, they're going to be examined by top men.

716
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
What happens top men are on the case.

717
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I did see one of the locations I was closing pictures were going around of like all of the rides and arcade games like were in the like trash yard next to they had like cleared out the building.

718
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And we're just kind of like dilapidated carousel like next to, you know, which again, like it makes like, of course, you'd want to get it.

719
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You think that you'd want to get it, but it is that it is the physical moving.

720
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's the shit and like real remembering.

721
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Oh, right. I don't have an eight bedroom house.

722
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It does not make any sense to have this gigantic ski ball machine or whatever it is.

723
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, it's convincing the person you live with that this will be a positive addition to our lives to look at every day.

724
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Not just like hit you in the knees when you're trying to get out of bed.

725
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, I was like, oh, we're going to put the we're going to put the Internet router in it.

726
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So it's kind of more think of it as a shelf and functional.

727
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You know, speaking of that, I was thinking about looking this up in preparation for the episode and I didn't.

728
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But now I just went to eBay and I found a pretty good item.

729
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Do you guys would you guys be interested in doing a quick, sudden souvenir smackdown?

730
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Of course, with something that you talk about stuff that you want stuff that you're you're driving to a Chuck E. Cheese that is closed.

731
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The big ticket stuff. I'm going to show you a big one.

732
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You you, Jamie, already name checked essentially this thing.

733
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
This is one of the old CD covers from the wall.

734
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Wow. Saturday Night Retriever in its frame with a Chuck E.

735
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
CD at the bottom and kind of a glass bricky pattern.

736
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's it's it's by the artist, the Bee Cheese.

737
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's it includes more than a wolfhound and straying alive.

738
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Do we do we want to go?

739
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Let's let's get some some guesses on what this is going for on eBay.

740
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Can I ask, is it a buy it now or is it an auction in the starting price or are there bids on it already?

741
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This is a place bid currently.

742
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
And starting somewhere. OK. Yeah, it's been up for you.

743
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
You got six days left on this.

744
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
OK, size, I don't know offhand.

745
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'll see if I can get it. But I mean, we know you it's all right.

746
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Six, six feet by three feet. So it's big. Yeah.

747
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'll guess two hundred and forty nine ninety nine.

748
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Jason, I'm going to go five hundred. Jamie.

749
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'll go I'll go three fifty. I'll split the difference.

750
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The winner of that is going to be Jason at four forty nine.

751
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Wait, is that right? Wait, five hundred.

752
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah, it depends if we're doing prices. Right.

753
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah, right. Jamie wins.

754
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I went over. I went over.

755
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It's not closest. It's over.

756
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You don't want to do. OK, got it.

757
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Well, now when we do this again, I know the rules.

758
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm glad this is a good reiteration for me.

759
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
All right. So that's so much money.

760
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

761
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I don't care that much. I don't know.

762
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So the size really is a problem there, too.

763
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That's such that's going to take up a whole wall in your home.

764
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Which, again, like how much wall space do people really have?

765
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Do you like this enough for it to be like such a facet of your personality?

766
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And not just Chuck E.

767
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Specifically, do you want this Bee Gees parody?

768
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Do you like Saturday Night Retriever enough to have it be the main art in your house?

769
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Can I bring up real quick? I have to search on eBay just out of curiosity.

770
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Let me just show you something that you can purchase.

771
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And here you go.

772
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Oh, this is a inside the head, like the mechanism inside of, I guess, a Chuck E. head you can buy for sixty dollars.

773
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh, the eyes. And it is horrifying.

774
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's like a big like just kind of black bracket mechanism and then a weird like red.

775
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It's weird knowing what's in the head now. A big red plastic piece.

776
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's probably some mouth piece of some kind.

777
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And then just unpainted eyes with like listless eyebrows halfway down or eyelids rather.

778
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:55,000
They have six of these, apparently, and it says animatronic head kit, showbiz pizza, Chuck E. cheese's, Colorado animatronics.

779
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:06,000
So I guess you could just buy your own like material felt or something and construct your own Chuck E. head around this exoskeleton or not exoskeleton, the skeleton, I should say.

780
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yeah. Is this aftermarket though?

781
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Is this like when your mechanic is like, well, do you want the part made by the manufacturer?

782
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Do you want the aftermarket like made by third party?

783
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's like a third of the price, but it is less of a warranty.

784
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It looks like it might be a knockoff. Yeah. A knockoff. Yeah, I agree.

785
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It doesn't seem like it might be authentic, but that's maybe just an option for us.

786
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
If we're looking for something cheaper, we make our own Chuck E. head.

787
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Well, that's a way more efficient way for us to start manufacturing our own animatronic at home.

788
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's always been the end game, right? Yes.

789
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I mean, yeah, that's probably where this has been going.

790
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, for sure. Talk to him, get advice from him.

791
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Give him a hug at the end of the day and say thanks for being there for me, Chuck.

792
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah. Aaron Fector, the the like creator of all this stuff, who there's also a bunch of like stuff that's happened with him in the past year that I don't even want to get into because it's really fucked up.

793
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
You don't say that guy. Oh, he.

794
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Everything about him is so fucked.

795
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I was like going through my old emails with him and I was like, this guy's just really fucked up.

796
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But he used to be selling like a make your own animatronic kit on his website for like $10,000 or something.

797
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Absolutely scam artist ridiculous.

798
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I don't know. But but also, like, what is a reasonable price for an animatronic?

799
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I have no idea. Right.

800
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It could be. Yeah, that could be anything.

801
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, it could be like $100 with the way the world currently values animatronics, which is not very much.

802
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Aaron Fector, there's a little Cliff notesy thing.

803
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yeah. So he yeah, he kind of kicked off the entire trend and he specifically is the creator of not the not the Chuck E.

804
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Cheese characters, but of the Rock of Fire explosion, the other set of characters that got sort of bought out and replaced.

805
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
But this guy is still going as this documentary that's largely about him.

806
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
He once employed 200 people at his factory in Orlando, and now it's just him.

807
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And there seems like there was some kind of chemical blast at this facility.

808
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So now, which was decrepit when they filmed the documentary and now it's just full of chemicals everywhere.

809
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And he's been maybe this is one of the things you're referring to is that he's been there's there's a very populated YouTube channel that just is him.

810
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, he's putting out a lot of content.

811
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
There's been a lot of quarantine content from Aaron Fector so much.

812
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah, I have not been keeping up with it because I I mean, he was my perception with he was he was always like kind of bizarre on YouTube.

813
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And I didn't really I couldn't really watch too much of his content without being like, I don't like it here.

814
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I'm leaving. But it seems to have really taken a turn, which made me go back to I was trying to interview him at one point.

815
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And I didn't mention this on the first episode we did, maybe because I still thought there was a chance I would interview him at this point.

816
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I wash my hands of it. But I like almost three years ago, I reached out to him to interview him.

817
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And he kept bailing on the interview at the last minute because of like an emergency.

818
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And it would always in the last I read the last like true cancellation he made because I tried again a year later and never heard from him.

819
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But this was in from December twenty eighteen.

820
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And it's a long email that I barely read at the time because I just read the first sentence and was like, well, he's clearly not going to do this interview.

821
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
He keeps canceling for these like confusing reasons.

822
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:54,000
But I read through the whole email and it's like it sounds like he has he said that two of his dogs died very close together.

823
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And it sounds like he was like doing holistic medicine on his dogs against the advice of his vet.

824
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And it was a long email about that.

825
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And so I just don't like him.

826
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I don't trust him and I don't know.

827
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Fuck with him anymore.

828
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's really like raising my blood pressure to even look at it because it's been like it's like a weird font.

829
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And it's just a lot.

830
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I can I can imagine what the font looks like.

831
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And it's like what four points too big for a normal email.

832
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah, it's like Ariel size 22.

833
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I tell that unmotivated.

834
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You could have said just the font and I would have gone, oh, yeah, OK, I hear what you're saying.

835
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Shiver.

836
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I get it.

837
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I get what you're saying.

838
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
If you're let's be careful.

839
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:51,000
All of us with our blood pressure, because I have I do have more air infector material that I've this is not all recent.

840
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:59,000
This is like from the last 20 years, some of which I came off of showbiz pizza dot com, which thanks to them for archiving so much stuff.

841
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
One step of the air infector saga I didn't know.

842
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So his his characters, the rocket fire explosion, who were mainly associated with showbiz pizza, they all kind of went away.

843
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And the whole story is he held on to the IP, which became essentially worthless or not worthless, but just not enough to mine a whole empire out of.

844
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
What I didn't know is that he tried to start new restaurants with the rocket fire explosion.

845
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Like he yeah, he attempted to like put them into other places, which some of which only had a couple of locations.

846
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
One of the rocket fire characters is named Looney Bird.

847
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So he started a restaurant in deep Orlando called Looney Birds.

848
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
He just named it after one of them in a Pasquale fashion.

849
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I found some literature about Looney Birds.

850
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That's all very much like your email.

851
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
It's very like come to Looney Birds.

852
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We got pizza.

853
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We got fun and games and we have the rocket fire explosion who are famous all over the world and they are world renowned and they are they are characters who are valued by many, many people.

854
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's like this.

855
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We did not vaccinate them.

856
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Are you going to know?

857
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I also found a Looney Birds newsletter where he talks about the success of the first taping of Live at Looney's, a local Time Warner show that he was making from the restaurant.

858
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,000
The hook of Looney Birds is that the famous rocket fire explosion, which is the word famous, is thrown at you so many times.

859
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You yourself can be the lead singer of the band.

860
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You can sing karaoke and they are your backing band.

861
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So he made it.

862
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It's a karaoke situation and he made a TV show out of the karaoke and the newsletter says the taping was a big success.

863
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And based on the feedback of the people in attendance, we will be installing air conditioning before the next taping.

864
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
In Orlando.

865
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
In Orlando.

866
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah.

867
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Now, look, it's fine during the day for the regular restaurant.

868
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But when you bring in the TV lights, that's what we didn't know.

869
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The TV lights really just heat up everything.

870
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And so now we know.

871
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So the next time.

872
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
But otherwise, it was great.

873
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Everybody had a great time.

874
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So don't say they didn't.

875
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The other factor thing that I discovered, and I'm sorry to do this to everyone.

876
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I know what a bummer I'm about to click on.

877
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Do we know the fact about him that he was, according to his story, at least, the inventor of the Whack-a-Mole and that it got sort of taken from him?

878
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Or he's just not credited such.

879
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Well, there's no question if it's in question whether he invented the Whack-a-Mole.

880
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:50,000
He we absolutely know that he invented a cousin of the Whack-a-Mole called the Bin Laden basher.

881
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Oh, no.

882
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I see.

883
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah.

884
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
OK.

885
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
God.

886
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Seen this for any reason?

887
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
No.

888
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I've never seen this.

889
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I came with like five new reasons to hate Aaron Fecter and this was not even one of them.

890
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Wow.

891
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah, this is something.

892
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Strike a blow for freedom, it says.

893
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Bizarre.

894
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
A bizarre photo of, you know, it's like it.

895
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah, it's a Whack-a-Mole, but it's Bin Laden.

896
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And there's a guy with an American flag patterned mallet and he is in jean shorts and shirtless.

897
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Why?

898
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
That might be Aaron Fecter.

899
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Like that.

900
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah.

901
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah.

902
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah.

903
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah.

904
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I had that question.

905
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I was wondering.

906
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'm also Florida.

907
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah, extremely.

908
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Can I read?

909
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,480
You know, I said to my wife, like, where are you going to end up where you are shirtless

910
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,960
with a Whack-a-Mole?

911
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,960
And she said Florida.

912
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,960
The answer is Florida.

913
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,000
Wildwood, New Jersey.

914
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Yeah.

915
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,560
Seaside Heights.

916
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,080
You have to rip to get to start it.

917
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,480
You have to rip the shirt off, though.

918
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,680
You can't just take it off.

919
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,560
You have to pull your shirt off and destroy it before you play this game.

920
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,560
Yeah.

921
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,560
And let out a yell.

922
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,880
The machine's activated by the yell.

923
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,920
So you use the Mallet of Freedom and you find Bin Laden.

924
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,300
Smash his ugly face, it says.

925
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,120
And then special bonus, Hitler's also down there.

926
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,120
Hitler's in it too.

927
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Oh my God.

928
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,120
Why?

929
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,120
What?

930
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,600
Hitler's hiding with Bin Laden?

931
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:25,560
Hiding with dirtbag Osama Bin Laden is none other than history's most evil scumbag.

932
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,040
Let them both have it.

933
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,040
Wow.

934
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,560
This is wild.

935
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,480
These are all correct villains.

936
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,800
Look, they're all bad, but it is funny to me.

937
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
Absolutely bad.

938
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,840
Osama Bin Laden, that guy's a dirtbag.

939
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,520
And Hitler, I'll tell you what, he's a scumbag.

940
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,960
It's kind of like what you say about some guy on the street you don't like.

941
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,280
Not like these awful.

942
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,280
Saddam.

943
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,360
Saddam is also there by special request of the president.

944
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,720
What?

945
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,720
The president of what?

946
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,720
The president of Dick's Last Resort?

947
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:04,680
Did President Bush get in touch with Aaron Factor?

948
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,880
Aaron, you gotta help.

949
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,680
How do we get the message across to the fine?

950
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,960
Aaron Factor was in the cabinet.

951
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,960
Doesn't everyone remember?

952
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,780
I don't even know.

953
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,760
My brain has stopped.

954
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,760
What?

955
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,760
Yeah, yeah.

956
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,600
I know, there needs to be a come down from this.

957
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,840
Yeah, Aaron Factor was hired for the actual military.

958
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,440
The plan was him going around Afghanistan shirtless with a mallet of freedom.

959
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,440
In jorts, yeah.

960
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:44,680
As this marketing material says, perfect for military rec rooms.

961
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,080
That's big business, baby.

962
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,320
Those military rec rooms, you know?

963
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,320
Yeah, those.

964
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,360
In size 22 aerial font, kind of his thing.

965
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,360
Yeah, wow.

966
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:03,080
He got, there was, I didn't even dig too deep into it because I'm like, Jesus Christ.

967
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:12,320
But there was another, it seems like a peak in Aaron Factor YouTube commentary content

968
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:21,800
in early 2020, like pre pandemic 2020, of like a lot of racist stuff that he was putting

969
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,280
on his YouTube channel.

970
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,800
And that I guess it just, I can't even speak to it because I barely engaged with it.

971
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:37,120
But it just, since we last spoke about Aaron Factor, there's just been a spike in how many

972
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,880
fucked up things that he's done.

973
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,920
He does seem sort of primed for the current, like the kinds of people who've been prominent

974
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,720
in the last year.

975
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,240
Yeah, yeah, he's well qualified.

976
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,480
I would be, it's probably a good thing that he doesn't have like nationwide restaurants

977
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,520
and a robot show because God knows what he would be programming those robots to say and

978
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,840
play at this point.

979
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:09,480
I would, maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like they would have some speeches to give to the kids.

980
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,280
Chuck changes his initial from E to Q.

981
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:19,880
Chuck Q cheese.

982
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,320
You can look at the basement of our restaurants.

983
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,880
You can inspect the basement and see there's no sicko stuff.

984
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,400
Pizza places.

985
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:35,040
I guess there's a whole like toxic Facebook group surrounding the rocket fire explosion

986
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,560
that Aaron Factor is in charge of that.

987
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,400
Like some people have done the deep dive on it.

988
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,600
I don't care to even know.

989
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:52,040
I'm glad that Chuck E. Cheese has washed his little mouse, now canonically mouse hands.

990
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,040
You did Mesa.

991
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,040
You don't have to do this too.

992
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:00,000
That's too many things to infiltrate.

993
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,200
Maybe do we go, we obviously still have to deliver a showbiz pizza episode to the listeners

994
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
one day.

995
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,280
Yeah.

996
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,760
So maybe we have to get in the mud at a certain point.

997
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,760
But now we don't.

998
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,520
Now we don't have to go on the Facebook page.

999
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,000
I have something lighter.

1000
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I have some good news.

1001
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Oh good.

1002
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Dear God, please.

1003
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I know.

1004
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,320
It's so dark.

1005
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:27,120
This is a Little Shavers update.

1006
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:32,600
If everyone will recall, the Little Shavers are a barbershop quartet that was featured

1007
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,960
in the short-lived restaurant, the Ice Cream Emporium that existed two locations in Florida,

1008
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,960
one in Texas.

1009
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:51,720
A set, a full Little Shavers show has been restored and is on display at the Volo Auto

1010
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,720
Museum in Volo, Illinois.

1011
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,800
Mike, can you pull up that video I sent you?

1012
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,800
Yes, I can.

1013
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,800
Here it is.

1014
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,240
And if you want to play that.

1015
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,240
Whoa.

1016
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:10,240
No, the barbershop.

1017
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,040
These guys are adorable.

1018
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:22,800
Very muppety.

1019
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,800
Very noisy.

1020
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,440
OK, that's good.

1021
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,800
Man, the clacking of the robots.

1022
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Pretty loud.

1023
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Very loud.

1024
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
Pretty loud.

1025
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
But that's good.

1026
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,800
I'm glad they're back.

1027
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,000
Yeah, so they're back.

1028
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,280
Supposedly the only Little Shavers preserved in the world, but this place, the Volo Auto

1029
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,480
Museum has its own pirate show.

1030
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,020
They have exhibits dedicated to pizza theater restaurants.

1031
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,080
They have one of two operating the Beagles.

1032
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,080
The Beagles.

1033
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,720
The Chuck E. Cheese Beetles who are dogs.

1034
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,640
And the King.

1035
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,640
They've got the King.

1036
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,640
And King Cat.

1037
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,640
The Michael Jackson King.

1038
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,640
How did they do that?

1039
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,640
And you eat in a little pizza cafe in the museum.

1040
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,640
Man, that's great.

1041
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
Where's Volo?

1042
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,520
Volo is about 40 minutes north of the Woodfield Mall.

1043
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,520
So Mike.

1044
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,520
What?

1045
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,520
Yes.

1046
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,520
It's just north of Chicago.

1047
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,520
This is right by where my parents live, where I grew up.

1048
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,520
Wow.

1049
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
That's wild.

1050
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,760
Well, Mike, I know you haven't gotten back there in a while.

1051
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,000
So when you get back in town, I want you to go straight to the Volo Auto Museum and then

1052
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,080
anything else or anyone you want to see in the Schomburg area, it's up to you.

1053
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,240
But yeah, I'll go straight there.

1054
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,240
Yeah, first.

1055
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,240
Yeah.

1056
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,440
Don't invite anybody with you.

1057
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,440
Yeah, no, no.

1058
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,440
Yeah.

1059
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:54,840
Well, what do we have any more current stuff or awful air infected news?

1060
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,960
Do we want to go some retro?

1061
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,640
Let me just say I'm not going to say it, but we do.

1062
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:07,080
There was we got too dark already that I don't want to even say the other things that I learned.

1063
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,800
So so yeah, I honestly we're cutting on the fly.

1064
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,800
OK, all right.

1065
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,800
So Mike, feel free to take whatever you want.

1066
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,800
I just want to break.

1067
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,800
I mean, there's all these clips are fun except for one one dark spot.

1068
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:24,960
I really quickly I want to highlight one of like Chuckie's signature songs that we didn't

1069
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
talk about.

1070
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
He's been singing this song forever and I assume we've all heard it.

1071
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
But I really like I saw an old video of it and I just want to shout it out.

1072
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
This is something I like.

1073
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
This is just I don't want to make fun of it.

1074
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I just want to say I like this song and you probably know what I'm talking about.

1075
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And it's an old this is this is the old version.

1076
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
They do do a new updated version with Bowling for Suit Man, but that's not what

1077
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
exciting new musical review with your merry making master of ceremonies.

1078
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Chuckie Cheese.

1079
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,040
That's me, Chuckie Cheese.

1080
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,040
Your host with a most.

1081
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:04,040
But even with this star behind me, I'm not the star of the show.

1082
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,040
You are.

1083
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,040
You are.

1084
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,040
Magic only happens when we all get together.

1085
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,040
We can feel the magic now that you're here.

1086
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,040
Together we'll make the good times right here.

1087
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,040
And when it comes to keeping up room.

1088
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,080
Keeping up room.

1089
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:26,080
We might just make believe that we're going to make a move.

1090
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,080
We've got it together.

1091
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
We've got it.

1092
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,080
We've got it together with you.

1093
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,080
We've got it together forever.

1094
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,080
The fun has just begun.

1095
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,080
This band is number one.

1096
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,080
Together we've got it.

1097
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,080
We might just make believe.

1098
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:47,080
And then he sort of he shouts out all the members of the band.

1099
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,080
I can keep playing, but that's the gist of it.

1100
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,120
Together we got it.

1101
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,120
And they still do this number, apparently.

1102
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,120
And I remember it now when I found the video and I was like, this is just good.

1103
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,120
I like this song.

1104
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,120
Helen Henney was a belter back in the day.

1105
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,120
Yes.

1106
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,120
Yeah.

1107
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,120
They all get their little moment to shine.

1108
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,120
I like that about this song.

1109
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,120
It's a nice introduction to the band.

1110
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:15,120
And yeah, this is the old version, but there are new Bowling for Soupified versions of it as well.

1111
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,120
Geez, I'm so glad it's around.

1112
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,160
I love it.

1113
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,160
That's so nice.

1114
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:25,160
Because especially recently, I was trying to figure out if this was like something that happened post

1115
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:30,160
Pasquale's pizza fiasco or if it had been happening for a while anyways.

1116
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:36,160
But it seems like they're getting like they're slowly edging Pasquale out of the main crew on Merch.

1117
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Like that truck I got yesterday, not a Pasquale in sight, but the other four are there.

1118
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,160
Really?

1119
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,160
It's strange.

1120
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,160
Yeah.

1121
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,200
It's just it's Chuckie, Munch, Jasper and Helen.

1122
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,200
No Pasquale.

1123
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
And I don't know if they were.

1124
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I just wonder what's I feel like Pasquale is the most beloved in a way.

1125
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Yeah.

1126
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,200
In some circles.

1127
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,200
Do they think is he not cute?

1128
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Maybe like it's hard.

1129
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,200
It's harder to cue.

1130
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
I think the puppet.

1131
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,200
Is it that he's a man?

1132
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,200
It's unclear.

1133
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,200
Maybe it's human.

1134
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
Maybe it's human.

1135
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,200
A human thing.

1136
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:25,240
I think he's in the there is a puppet one you were saying because like he's in there's a game show sketch they shot recently where they sing a song trying to figure out what Chuckie's middle name is.

1137
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,240
And they're just naming off different names.

1138
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,240
And at one point they say, is it evolution?

1139
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,240
And they show what he used to look like.

1140
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,240
Here's new Chuckie, but in the bowler hat.

1141
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,240
Oh, cool.

1142
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,280
And I think Pasquale is in there.

1143
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,280
But yeah, I know what you mean that it feels like they're edging out Pasquale.

1144
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:51,280
He's still like YouTube canon, but I don't he's not on a lot of the he's like not on the website.

1145
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,280
Really?

1146
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,280
It's confusing.

1147
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,280
I don't know.

1148
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:59,280
Is that do they want him to maybe is the voice to cartoonish in the twenty twenty one?

1149
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:06,280
Maybe is there maybe are they trying to transition like maybe a young Pasquale in that's more authentic.

1150
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:13,320
Maybe he's impossible to because they do seem to have like kind of like child of find the other the other characters.

1151
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:20,320
And maybe just because Pasquale has a full goatee, they can't they can't get him there.

1152
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,320
I don't know.

1153
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:26,320
Yeah, maybe it's odd to have like an adult pizza chef hanging out with these children.

1154
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,320
Right. Yeah, it seems a little.

1155
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,320
I'm a kid check and it's fine.

1156
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:33,320
Let me let me bring up another character.

1157
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,360
I don't I didn't catch that.

1158
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,360
We talked about him last time.

1159
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,360
Maybe we did.

1160
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,360
And you forgive me if we did.

1161
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,360
We did not talk about Munch Jr. last time.

1162
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Right.

1163
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,360
I don't think so.

1164
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,360
No, no.

1165
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:50,360
And Munch Jr. was and this is a clip I found on YouTube.

1166
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,360
Munch Jr. was sort of hidden on certain stages.

1167
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:02,360
And the reason he was only in certain stages is because he was a reskinned version of a rock of fire character named Chu Chu.

1168
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:11,400
So they had to already have like a little robot on the stage kind of hiding in a garbage can before for the necessity to re-theme that character.

1169
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,400
Oh, a little critter who pops up.

1170
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Yeah, there was a lot more of that kind of thing with with rock of fire.

1171
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,400
Right. So like you see this clip, the clips on the top left here, Munch Jr. would pop his head up.

1172
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:28,400
And I found a clip made by a child called Rest In Peace Munch Jr.

1173
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,440
Wow.

1174
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:36,440
And I just want to play a quick clip of it here.

1175
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,440
In this video we will be finding out what happened to Munch Jr.

1176
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,440
So Munch Jr. is a very old prop from Chuck E Cheese in front of Helen.

1177
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,440
We're in between Helen and Munch.

1178
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,440
So this is Munch little brother or little cousin.

1179
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,440
People say, mostly people say that it's Munch's little cousin when it's really his brother.

1180
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,480
So it's his brother.

1181
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,480
So yeah, he would pop out in an air vent.

1182
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,480
Here's like a video right here.

1183
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,480
He would go up and down out of an air vent.

1184
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,480
He would go up and then down an air vent.

1185
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:21,480
So yeah, and he would usually pop out during like the songs to beat with the music like Chu Chu.

1186
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:29,520
But here we finding out what would happen, what happened to him because he was being vandalized by kids.

1187
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:36,520
I don't know if that means like he was not working properly or he was not working at all.

1188
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,520
Because kids kept messing with him and breaking him.

1189
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,520
That's the reason why.

1190
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,520
And so yeah, that's what basically happened.

1191
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,520
That's what basically happened.

1192
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,520
And there's a little more to that video.

1193
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,560
I want to shout out Ian.

1194
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,560
The YouTube channel is Ian Cool Guy and the video itself is Rest In Peace Munch Jr.

1195
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,560
So everyone go over here and support this video.

1196
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,560
There's a little more information about what happened to Munch Jr.

1197
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,560
But apparently children were vandalizing Munch Jr.

1198
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,560
And they had to remove him.

1199
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,560
I'm going to take this kid as the information.

1200
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,560
I'm not looking into it.

1201
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,560
I'm taking Ian at his word.

1202
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,560
Exactly.

1203
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,600
Yeah, we're all going to be working for Ian Cool Guy in a few years.

1204
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,600
So this the like the passion about Munch Jr.

1205
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,600
The knowledge and the quiver in the voice when thinking about vandal kids.

1206
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,600
This, folks, is a good boy.

1207
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,600
This is a very good boy.

1208
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,600
I appreciate his passion.

1209
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,600
But I love Munch Jr. immediately.

1210
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,600
I wish Munch Jr. would come back.

1211
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,640
I haven't seen Munch Jr. appear on the new Chucky things, but why not?

1212
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,640
He seems like he'd be ripe for the YouTube channel.

1213
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,640
Such a simple puppet.

1214
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,640
Very simple puppet.

1215
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,640
You probably also could just like like Martin Short and Clifford,

1216
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,640
shoot him like smaller down below the same puppet,

1217
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,640
but like smaller and do tricks to make it look like it's a different puppet,

1218
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,640
but it's the same.

1219
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,640
And there's just making it look like he's a different size.

1220
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,640
There's some great pictures of like this picture here of Munch Jr.

1221
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,680
Squat one tooth in a little beanie.

1222
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,680
Oh, this is it.

1223
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,680
This is new Munch Jr.

1224
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,680
I think.

1225
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,680
Oh, he is.

1226
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,680
Whoa, wait.

1227
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,680
Wait, click on that wiki.

1228
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,680
Maybe it'll say.

1229
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,680
Okay, all right.

1230
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,680
Hold on.

1231
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,680
Oh, I'm getting ads for wrestling figures.

1232
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,680
On Fandom.com.

1233
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,680
Okay, Munch Jr. in the mid 90s.

1234
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,680
I don't know.

1235
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,680
It doesn't say that he's been in it recently.

1236
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,720
Munch Jr. puppet.

1237
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,720
Remember, they were doing puppets though still in the 90s.

1238
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,720
Puppets aren't new on the YouTube.

1239
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:53,720
Wait, he was still in Wilmington, North Carolina until they closed in November 2020.

1240
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,720
Oh, Munch Jr.

1241
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,720
Still a Munch Jr.

1242
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,720
I apologize to the audience for getting their hopes up that Munch Jr.

1243
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,720
is still around.

1244
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,720
So far, Munch Jr. has not returned.

1245
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,720
There is a private collector who shows his Munch Jr. at Chuck E. Conn,

1246
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,720
according to this fan.

1247
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,720
That doesn't sound good.

1248
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,720
It doesn't sound good.

1249
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,760
I think Jamie should get in contact with him.

1250
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,760
Maybe.

1251
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,760
I've emailed Chuck E. Cheese people for the last time.

1252
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,760
It's been probably nothing but pain.

1253
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,760
That is.

1254
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,760
Meet your, well, I don't want to say heroes.

1255
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,760
Never meet anyone, I guess.

1256
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,760
It's the long and short of it.

1257
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,760
Yeah, don't meet new people.

1258
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,760
You'll be just fine.

1259
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,760
Yeah.

1260
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
That's fine.

1261
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,760
We're done with that this year.

1262
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,760
No one's met anyone new.

1263
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,800
In a year.

1264
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,800
So it's worked out great.

1265
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,800
Right.

1266
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,800
Do you, does anyone else have, I mean, I have more things to share.

1267
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,800
I can keep going if anybody else has something they'd like to talk about.

1268
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,800
I have something, you know, this might, your clip might dovetail nicely into mine

1269
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:59,800
because it also features a young boy with a charmingly like unprofessional voice,

1270
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,800
a very little kid voice.

1271
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,800
I'm really excited about it.

1272
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,840
I feel like this might, when I saw this, this rang a bell to me and it might for you guys too.

1273
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:16,840
I'm curious if it does because this was a television commercial that might have been late 80s,

1274
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,840
late 90s, might have been early 2000s.

1275
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:26,840
I feel like I remember it being on TV and you think that once you're in like skate Chuck era

1276
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,840
that the fun is done.

1277
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,840
But then I saw this, which is a very, very good clip.

1278
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,880
I feel like I remember it being on TV and you think that once you're in like skate Chuck era

1279
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,880
that the fun is done.

1280
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,880
But then I saw this, which is like, honestly, one of my favorite pieces of Chuck content I've ever seen.

1281
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:46,880
And this is a commercial that's at least on, by this YouTube user is dubbed,

1282
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
They've Got Crabs.

1283
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,880
And here now they've got crabs.

1284
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,880
They've got music.

1285
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,880
They've got...

1286
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,880
Crabs!

1287
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,880
Chuckie's got music.

1288
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,880
They've got...

1289
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,880
Crabs!

1290
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,880
So let's start midway through check in.

1291
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:19,880
Yeah, this kid has ended up at a crab restaurant instead of at Chuckie Cheese where he wants to be.

1292
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,880
There's fun being had at Chuckie Cheese.

1293
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,880
They built a giant mouth that a slice goes into.

1294
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,880
Then he's at a lame plate with a big crab.

1295
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,920
Then Chuckie Cheese gets even more fun.

1296
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,920
And then a lemon gets squeezed and it shoots into the kid's eye and he says,

1297
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,920
Crabs!

1298
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,920
And then the crab is like alive on the plate and mocks him.

1299
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,920
Like he did it on purpose.

1300
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:53,920
And then worst of all, then Chuckie Cheese gets as fun as like a Vegas montage from a 60s movie.

1301
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:58,960
And then the kid's worst nightmare because he yells,

1302
01:16:58,960 --> 01:16:59,960
Crabs!

1303
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:06,960
And then he's in the darkened kitchen and a gigantic crab bursts into the kitchen after him.

1304
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,960
This is a surrealist...

1305
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,960
This is like Kafka.

1306
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,960
Is this just like a Red Lobster call out commercial?

1307
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,960
Like who are they calling out?

1308
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,960
Seafood in general?

1309
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,960
Yeah, I don't know.

1310
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
These are prob...

1311
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I never thought of seafood places or crab places as being like stuffy or specifically not for kids.

1312
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
But apparently they're a child's worst nightmare.

1313
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Or directly competitive to Chuckie Cheese in any way.

1314
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

1315
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Who would ever be considering one or the other?

1316
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Do they have crabs at Chuckie Cheese?

1317
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Well, you know, back east like fish houses, like, you know,

1318
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:55,040
soup, salad, fish entree, dessert, like all included.

1319
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,040
Still very popular.

1320
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:02,040
But usually there's an ample kids menu for like, here's fried shrimp or chicken tenders.

1321
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:06,040
And here's like, you know, worms and dirt for dessert.

1322
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,040
But yeah, I mean, I guess could be a little stuffy.

1323
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:15,040
Maybe back in the day when everyone is still like smoking their way through a meal,

1324
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,040
it was a little more dour.

1325
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,080
Yeah.

1326
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:26,080
And maybe back in the day, a giant crab would come to life and hunt you into the kitchen like the Jurassic Park raptors.

1327
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,080
That's true.

1328
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,080
This is...

1329
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:35,080
Now, let me keep going with this, because if you were worried about the Quabs kid, it does work out for him.

1330
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,080
Oh, good.

1331
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:41,120
So for the listener, he's backed into a corner.

1332
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,120
What's he going to do?

1333
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,120
Well, a hero swoops in last minute and Chuckie Cheese with a net.

1334
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:52,120
Suddenly, he's at the crab restaurant, unannounced.

1335
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,120
Hi!

1336
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,120
Oh, my goodness.

1337
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,120
Oh, my goodness.

1338
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,120
So, yeah, I mean, I think that's a good thing.

1339
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,120
You know, I'm not a big fan of...

1340
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,160
Suddenly, he's at the crab restaurant, unannounced.

1341
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,160
Ha!

1342
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,160
Look at that open mouth.

1343
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,160
That's a great frame.

1344
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,160
Ha!

1345
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,160
Be gone with ye!

1346
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Throws a net over some of the crab, which fells him immediately, high fives the kid.

1347
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,160
Very little Scott kid.

1348
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:27,160
And then a graphic where Chuckie is flying in a spaceship.

1349
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,160
A little one-mouse-sized spaceship.

1350
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,200
This is a work of art.

1351
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200
This is a great short film.

1352
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:38,200
Wow, Chuckie came to the restaurant to save the kid.

1353
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,200
He caught wind of the child.

1354
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
Beginning, middle, and end.

1355
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,200
That is incredible.

1356
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,200
Right.

1357
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,200
And Chuckie, like, beats...

1358
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,200
I guess he beats up a crab.

1359
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,200
I mean, he doesn't beat the crab up, but I assume that's what happens off screen.

1360
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:54,200
If a crab gets a net on it, it's like a turtle ending up on its back.

1361
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,200
Like, eventually, he will suffocate.

1362
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,240
He'll go to the ground and he'll die in a few days.

1363
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,240
So the crab is dead.

1364
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,240
See you in hell, crab.

1365
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,240
Tell the devil, Chuckie says hi.

1366
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,240
That's incredible.

1367
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,240
Chuckie, it was a nightmare.

1368
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,240
There were quabs.

1369
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,240
Please, tell me that your restaurant has no quabs.

1370
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,240
Good news, kid.

1371
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,240
Good news, kid.

1372
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,240
I'm going to talk to your mom and dad outside, too.

1373
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,240
Let them know what for.

1374
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:31,280
You take this kid to another restaurant, you'll never go to another restaurant again in your

1375
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,280
life.

1376
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:38,280
Jasper and Munch hold up the parents while Chuck punches them in the gut.

1377
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,280
Helen, get the other net.

1378
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,280
Mom and dad are getting netted.

1379
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,280
You don't think I got another net, you got another thing coming.

1380
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:53,280
You know old Chuckie was like a mobster connected guy.

1381
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,280
Yeah, like Casino.

1382
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,320
Yeah, he was.

1383
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,320
That's his whole persona.

1384
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:03,320
And it's a deliberate media narrative to frame the crab a very particular way and make you,

1385
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,320
you know, to start you against the crab.

1386
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,320
You're not, you're never given the crab's perspective.

1387
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,320
Where's the crab coming from?

1388
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,320
The crab's about to die, you know?

1389
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,320
It's like no wonder the crab is upset.

1390
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,320
The crab's about to be consumed.

1391
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,320
But Chuckie is just unequivocally our hero.

1392
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,320
He wants the crab to disappear.

1393
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,320
Guess what?

1394
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,360
He has the ability to make that happen.

1395
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:29,360
Chuck is never in a position where it's he himself, Chuckie Cheese, that's going to be

1396
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,360
eaten.

1397
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,360
A rat is not desired to eat, but a crab is.

1398
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,360
They're coming from different places.

1399
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:41,360
I like this because it's like, you know, it's that scene in Breaking Bad when Gus kills

1400
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,360
Victor himself.

1401
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:47,360
He's been letting other minions do things for years and he actually finally like does

1402
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,360
the really awful thing himself.

1403
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,400
You know, we actually get to see how scary Chuckie could be because until now he's just

1404
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,400
friendly.

1405
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,400
It establishes him as a definitive predator.

1406
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,400
Exactly, yes.

1407
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,400
He's not the prey.

1408
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,400
Right.

1409
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,400
And this is probably part of why they had to rebrand maybe because of the aggressiveness

1410
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,400
of this old Chuck.

1411
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,400
Yeah.

1412
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,400
Be the crab to the ticket muncher.

1413
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,400
No one will find your bones.

1414
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,400
Yeah, it is funny because I was thinking about the old Chuckie.

1415
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:23,440
Definitely like if this person ran a business, you would go, oh, we should.

1416
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,440
He's stealing money, skimming money off the top.

1417
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,440
He's not paying the workers very well.

1418
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,440
I'm getting ripped off somehow.

1419
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:35,440
Like, you wouldn't trust that type of personality to own a business and let your kids loosen

1420
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,440
his house or his restaurant.

1421
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,440
He's really pivoted.

1422
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,440
He's quite the empath these days, our Chuck.

1423
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,440
Yes.

1424
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,440
Yeah.

1425
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,440
The crab one is very lovable.

1426
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,480
The crab one is very lovable.

1427
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
It is weird that it came from.

1428
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,480
He's sweet.

1429
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,480
Yeah, yeah.

1430
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,480
I genuinely, yeah, you know what?

1431
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:58,480
I do think current Chuck is cute and you can make fun of that bowling for soup voice and

1432
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,480
that they did that.

1433
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,480
It is very silly, but I think that guy does a good job.

1434
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,480
Sure does.

1435
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,480
Yeah, I agree.

1436
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:10,480
As opposed maybe to just while we're on the topic, I've also, I saw footage I'd never

1437
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,480
seen of original Chuck.

1438
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,520
This is from 1977.

1439
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:20,520
And just to get a little hint of the earliest Chuck and in general, the puppets are amazing

1440
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,520
to watch.

1441
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:22,560
Um,

1442
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,560
Honey, won't you be our birthday one?

1443
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,560
τε say yes, don't say no.

1444
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,560
And we'll tell the world.

1445
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,560
By now, it's probably no surprise to anybody.

1446
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,560
We got a birthday number coming up here.

1447
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,560
What's the surprise to me?

1448
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,560
We got a birthday coming up.

1449
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,560
He's fucked up.

1450
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,560
He's fucked.

1451
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,560
Yeah, he's drunk.

1452
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,560
He's really drunk.

1453
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,560
Please.

1454
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,560
He's got a cigar.

1455
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,560
He's got a stoke.

1456
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,560
Oh my God.

1457
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,600
He's got his right hand is a human hand for some reason.

1458
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,600
The eyes blink at different levels.

1459
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,600
He's got one human hand.

1460
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,600
He's got a giant cigar.

1461
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,600
A skew bow tie.

1462
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,600
A skew hat.

1463
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,600
The hat's tipping off his head slowly.

1464
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,600
Oh my God.

1465
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
Yeah.

1466
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:15,600
It is truly beautiful evolution from like a middle aged alcoholic uncle to a to a teenage

1467
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,600
boy who couldn't be nicer.

1468
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:23,640
To a teenage boy that like there was a recent video called Spring Break Break Dance and

1469
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:28,640
it's just Chucky like dancing and there's kids dancing and of course they all have masks

1470
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,640
on but they're not really like they're just having a good time.

1471
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:36,640
They're making the best of a tough situation and that's very different from like this Chuck

1472
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:42,640
who's like, yeah, I grew up downstream from the Silent Spring from the DDT water and my

1473
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,640
eyes aren't so good but what are you gonna do?

1474
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,640
I've been blind for years.

1475
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,640
Scott, I'm assuming you pulled up this freeze frame of this video because you've noticed

1476
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:59,640
like I just have that the employees would wear bowler hats.

1477
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,640
Yeah, they all wore the hat like Chuck apparently.

1478
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,640
Wow, I didn't realize that actually.

1479
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,640
Yeah.

1480
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,640
No, I didn't either.

1481
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,640
That's pretty cool.

1482
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,640
I was just trying to find one more Chuck line.

1483
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:11,640
I think there might be another.

1484
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,640
Let me see.

1485
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,640
We slowly are.

1486
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,640
We slowly are.

1487
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,640
So come on ladies, hit it.

1488
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:19,680
Birthday one, honey bun, won't you be our birthday one?

1489
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,680
Birthday one, honey bun.

1490
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:25,680
So far there are six with three more under construction and another three on the drawing

1491
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,680
boards.

1492
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:31,680
The idea has already spread to Japan and it's only a matter of time before Chuck E. Cheese

1493
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,680
makes his debut in Australia.

1494
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,680
His debut.

1495
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,680
I've never heard that in an accent.

1496
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,680
I don't know.

1497
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,680
I think it's Australian, not British but is that?

1498
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,680
I don't know.

1499
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,680
I feel like this guy's putting on a show.

1500
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,680
I don't think that's right.

1501
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,720
I don't think it always says date boo.

1502
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,720
But there's one more odd thing.

1503
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,720
Then you meet the real Chuck E.

1504
01:25:53,720 --> 01:26:00,720
This guy's the president or the CEO or something and he's like a 70s vested, you know, like

1505
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,720
Keen and Wynn character with big sideburns.

1506
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,720
He's pretty scary.

1507
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:09,720
But he talks about the audience they're trying to hit.

1508
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:17,760
Imagine that this company now is like for, they have like a skateboarder as their mascot

1509
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,760
and it used to be like this old, this like, there will be blood man running it.

1510
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:27,760
But there's this crazy bit of narration.

1511
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,760
Let me see if I can find, they justify like who the audience might be for Chuck E. Cheese

1512
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,760
and this is very grim.

1513
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:38,760
I guess this was the, this is the world of the 70s apparently.

1514
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:44,800
Chuck E. Cheese researchers say the idea is very popular with workaholic dads who are

1515
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,800
suffering from what they call Y.E.G., Young Executive Guilt.

1516
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,800
Drive dad into taking the kids out.

1517
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,800
Guess who decides where they'll go.

1518
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,800
In this country is Y.E.G.

1519
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:06,800
This is an Australian like news show like with an anthropologist going like, this is

1520
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,840
how Americans live.

1521
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,840
Y.E.G.

1522
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,840
Wow.

1523
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,840
Young Executive Guilt.

1524
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,840
Young Executive Guilt.

1525
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:22,840
So if you're on the road all the time, you're always on like you go in hotels and doing

1526
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:28,840
deals and then you come home and you feel like, ah God, I guess I have to see my kid.

1527
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:33,840
Well, where can I take my kid where I don't really have to talk to him and answer questions

1528
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
and show that I don't know anything about them?

1529
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:36,880
I know.

1530
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,880
I'll plop them in front of a robot show and some video games.

1531
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:40,880
That'll be that.

1532
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,880
Then I won't prove that I don't know if they're in second grade or eighth.

1533
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:45,880
That'll fix everything.

1534
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:46,880
It's worked for generations.

1535
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,880
It's worked for generations.

1536
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,880
I'm so damn tired.

1537
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,880
It's 1974.

1538
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,880
It's viewed as feminine to drink water.

1539
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,880
I just have to drink coffee all day long.

1540
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,880
I haven't slept in a decade.

1541
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:07,920
And this was back when you could they really wouldn't like cut you off if you were if you

1542
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,920
were if you were a drinking dad suffering of Y.E.G. at the Chuck E. Cheese, you could

1543
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,920
be like tossing them back all night.

1544
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,920
No, it's a paradox.

1545
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:17,920
They would just keep serving you.

1546
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,920
But there weren't fights until like the 90s and 2000s where like they'll cut you off.

1547
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,920
But then there's fights because everyone's angry.

1548
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:25,920
They cut you off.

1549
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,920
It's true.

1550
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,960
It's true.

1551
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,960
Is Y.E.G. a suitable reason for getting the vaccine?

1552
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:34,960
Is that a preexisting condition?

1553
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,960
How is that considered?

1554
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,960
You need a note from your CEO.

1555
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,960
And if you have that, then you can get the vaccine.

1556
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,960
Adam Curtis of the BBC wrote me a note saying I have Y.E.G.

1557
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,960
and that something has happened.

1558
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,960
I'm working too hard at Halliburton all day.

1559
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Is young podcaster guilt a thing we could get from our various networks, our presidents

1560
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
of our podcast networks?

1561
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
They could write us a note.

1562
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
That's right.

1563
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Yeah.

1564
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Hey, Brett, Brett, write us a note and says we have Y.E.G.

1565
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Brett, write us a note, Brett.

1566
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
We need it.

1567
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Wow.

1568
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And then we in the last episode we talked about, there was like on some other with mom

1569
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
and dad rooms.

1570
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,040
Specifically, right?

1571
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,040
Yeah, yeah.

1572
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:27,040
So proper rooms and sports rooms to separate everybody.

1573
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,040
Yeah.

1574
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,040
And I think I'll repeat the joke I said last time.

1575
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:33,040
And there'll be like stag films playing in the dad room.

1576
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:39,040
Well, you know, you're not that far off because later in this Australian news report,

1577
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:43,040
we get a little glimpse at Dolly Dimples, who I talked about earlier.

1578
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,040
Yeah.

1579
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,040
Oh, wow.

1580
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,040
This is his dad.

1581
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,080
I forgot what she looks like.

1582
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:54,080
Yeah, she's she's something big, big, doily as a collar, big clown wig.

1583
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,080
Clashing aesthetics.

1584
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,080
Yeah.

1585
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,080
She also you like sit at a bar to see her.

1586
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,080
That's something I didn't really pull up a seat.

1587
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,080
Drinking.

1588
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,080
Close up.

1589
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1590
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:08,080
It's like the close up room at the Magic Castle.

1591
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,080
It's very, very interesting.

1592
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,080
Yeah.

1593
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,080
And then you get to see the other kids.

1594
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,120
Close up room at the Magic Castle.

1595
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,120
It's very, very intimate.

1596
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:21,120
And it's a room that says cabaret on the outside.

1597
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,120
This is that weird?

1598
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:28,120
Like most of the pizza time theater is at a separate cabaret room.

1599
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:31,120
And then the narrator says this.

1600
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,120
Dimples, the singing hippopotamus, is powered by a computer system

1601
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,120
capable of handling 450 instructions per second.

1602
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,120
Dolly has a repertoire of more than 20 medleys

1603
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,160
and a bosom that rises and falls with compressed air.

1604
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,160
Oh, wow.

1605
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,160
Oh, that one goes out to her second husband, Eugene.

1606
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,160
She talks about her second husband.

1607
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,160
Yeah.

1608
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:55,160
Wait a minute.

1609
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,160
We need to hear about the second husband.

1610
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,160
Yeah.

1611
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,160
Wow.

1612
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:02,160
My second husband, Eugene, who used to ride with the Texas Rangers.

1613
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,160
He's a long tall Texan.

1614
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,160
He wears a tan jacket.

1615
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,160
Sounds like Eugene as young executive guilt too.

1616
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,200
Yeah.

1617
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,200
What a divorce hippopotamus that they put in this separate room

1618
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,200
with a heaving bosom.

1619
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,200
And you're like a foot away from her face.

1620
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:24,200
You're so close to this animatronic while you're eating.

1621
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,200
And it's only room for like four people at that bar.

1622
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,200
This is a great idea.

1623
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,200
The robot goes haywire and knocks your drink over.

1624
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,200
Yeah.

1625
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:35,200
Come see Dolly Dimples sing I'm Still Here from Folly.

1626
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:39,240
Come see the song that Elaine Stritch made famous.

1627
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,240
I just like that.

1628
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:45,240
I mean, this was I would have to imagine unless the world was extremely

1629
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,240
like even more different than I understood it to be.

1630
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:51,240
This was just like before they were like testing anything of like,

1631
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,240
does anybody want this?

1632
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,240
They're just like, people probably want this.

1633
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:58,240
It's good.

1634
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:03,240
I can't imagine Dolly Dimples testing well, but I'm glad she existed.

1635
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,280
Yeah, it's a dark room.

1636
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:10,280
We're going to compressed air bosom, hear about failed marriages.

1637
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,280
It's all.

1638
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,280
Yeah, it's before you.

1639
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,280
Yeah.

1640
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,280
It's before like money.

1641
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,280
People would come in and be like, we only are getting four people in here

1642
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,280
to view this show up close.

1643
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:25,280
Maybe with this is a waste of money and maybe this woman's story is a little

1644
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,280
depressing for a child.

1645
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:32,280
I would imagine that that like that suit guy would think Dolly Dimples

1646
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:36,320
I bet she would crack him up because she would remind him of his wife.

1647
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,320
That's true.

1648
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,320
And that would just be enough.

1649
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,320
And then you just put 500 of them in production.

1650
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:48,320
We we sent a mystery shopper to the Dolly Dimples cabaret and it seemed like

1651
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:52,320
the only other person in there was a young executive doing key bumps while his

1652
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,320
kids played space invaders.

1653
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:59,320
Dolly, you're the only one who understands me.

1654
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,360
I think that Chuck E.

1655
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:05,360
Cheese executive did, I think, put it in to like be mean to an ex-wife.

1656
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:10,360
Like she's probably like a fine, like, like completely nice, attractive woman

1657
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:15,360
who is like, let's put her in like a big, doily dress and give her a clown wig

1658
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,360
because she she looked crazy.

1659
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:24,360
Like it's all like it like probably the name was one off of Dolly and like

1660
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,360
how can we character assess it?

1661
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:31,400
And like how can we character assassinate my ex-wife with a robot?

1662
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,400
Something out somewhere.

1663
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,400
It could have been his mom.

1664
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,400
Who knows?

1665
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,400
Something was going on.

1666
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:43,400
I will say I do appreciate that they were like thinking of this place for all ages.

1667
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:47,400
We talked to God in the last episode a lot about how we wished they were

1668
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:53,400
catering more to us adults who want to find it acceptable to enjoy a robot show

1669
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,400
while working.

1670
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,440
So I do appreciate it.

1671
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:00,440
I feel like we could have easily strolled into a place like this and worked in the

1672
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:07,440
dad's room or something and gotten a little robot show, drank 10 beers each

1673
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,440
and then we would have had a great time.

1674
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,440
Like it seems like that would have maybe been appropriate back then, but not now.

1675
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:18,440
Yeah, I feel like you would maybe you would maybe saunter into to Dolly's

1676
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:23,440
Dolly's cabaret after a couple of Blue Moons and sure.

1677
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,480
And just strike up a conversation and kind of hear her story.

1678
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,480
I can see that being very rewarding.

1679
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,480
Yeah, yeah.

1680
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:38,480
We rewatched some of the training videos the other day and I caught on the like

1681
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:42,480
menu board, like the ordering set that was just like under like, you know,

1682
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,480
soda salad bar.

1683
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,480
And then it just there was one line that just said Bartles and James.

1684
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:54,520
So you go in, you get Bartles and James, the cheapest wine coolers, I believe

1685
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:55,520
imaginable.

1686
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,520
And yeah, you just Dolly, you just tell Dolly your troubles.

1687
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:04,520
Yeah, she seems she seems like a really nice lady.

1688
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,520
Yeah, yeah, you could like, you know, you could leave that room feeling like you

1689
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:14,520
have no problems compared to what's like at least compared to what she's been

1690
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,520
through.

1691
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,520
It sounds like she's been through quite a bit and she's got such a great ad.

1692
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,560
Right.

1693
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,560
Yes, she can smile through it.

1694
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,560
Why can't I?

1695
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,560
I think there is a robot bar in Nashville that like opened right at the start of

1696
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,560
2020.

1697
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:34,560
Like there is some sort of thing, but I don't I don't know how they're

1698
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,560
currently doing.

1699
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:39,560
Yeah, I went to an arcade that had some old school animatronics in it in

1700
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,560
Chicago like two years ago and surprised and I met a listener of the podcast

1701
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,560
there.

1702
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:49,600
I was standing watching an animatronic show in an arcade and somebody's like,

1703
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,600
excuse me, are you?

1704
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:54,600
And I was like, well, that's of course, of course, you're here.

1705
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,600
Statistically, yes.

1706
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,600
Yeah, here and I am here.

1707
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:58,600
Wow.

1708
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,600
I didn't think I'd see a Clifford here.

1709
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,600
Yeah, fellow Clifford was next to me.

1710
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,600
You know, on the top, I'm sorry, I'm kind of hogging it, but there's like

1711
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,600
there's these they're all flowing into each other nicely.

1712
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,560
I think the there is something there was something at the top of the

1713
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,600
there was something at the time that is sort of it feels like an entire place

1714
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,600
that was like Dolly Dimples.

1715
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,600
Have you guys has anyone ever come across a place called Gadgets?

1716
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,600
No, Gadgets seems to be an early 80s thing.

1717
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:33,600
And for the second time in the episode, I'll reference Brett from Forever Dog

1718
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,600
and the producer of Double Threat with Tom Sharpling and Julie Klausner that

1719
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,600
talked about Gadgets recently.

1720
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,600
This was new to me.

1721
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,600
So thank you, Double Threat.

1722
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:45,640
This is an amazing news report about what?

1723
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:48,640
Yeah, it completely seems like an adult

1724
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,640
sort of TGI Friday, his type Xperia Fern bar.

1725
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,640
This odd term I learned.

1726
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,640
But with with robots, just this is the whole thing.

1727
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:02,640
Oh, wow.

1728
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:08,640
Nothing else around Gadgets, Gadgets, the only girl in town.

1729
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,640
He's Sammy Sands and he's a robot.

1730
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,680
Really grotesque animatronic piano player here.

1731
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:18,680
Oh, my God.

1732
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,680
Long Island.

1733
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:25,720
There's just about everything from airplane propellers to washboards

1734
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,720
and everywhere you look, the moving objects get your attention.

1735
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,720
It's a combination of antique amusement park and high technology

1736
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,720
all rolled into one.

1737
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,720
And Candice Adams with Warner Leisure Company,

1738
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,720
which is responsible for Gadgets, says she expects.

1739
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,720
Let me also skip Candice Adams, but you just got to see more of the

1740
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:48,720
because it's not just original IP like this, the piano player guy,

1741
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,760
but the the the well, you'll see it.

1742
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,760
There's also a very special action for the kids and the kid in all of us.

1743
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,760
It's a robot cast of Looney Tunes characters and the Looney Tunes

1744
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:05,760
will take you back to the mean an animal.

1745
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,760
Wow. A Long Island restaurant with the Looney Tunes.

1746
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,760
Three.

1747
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:15,760
The folks up north will see me more when I get to that small store.

1748
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:22,760
And then there's the food and the executive chef Mike Huffler

1749
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,760
likes to think that his dishes make a gadget of a difference.

1750
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,760
This is what we call our giant nacho platter.

1751
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,760
And it's in a giant basket made of a flour tortilla

1752
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,760
with taco chips and chili con queso sauce.

1753
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,760
I don't know how to describe this listener, but I mean,

1754
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,760
congealed.

1755
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,760
Yeah, this looks like like the innards of some.

1756
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,760
This looks like like maggots or something like this is what ends up

1757
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,800
in a body after a death.

1758
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:53,800
Mike, honey salad looks like we've got notes.

1759
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,800
I mean, everyone was smoking 24 hours a day because this is what food

1760
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,800
was at the time.

1761
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,800
Macaroni salad mixed with the broja salad.

1762
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,800
Enjoy.

1763
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,800
That is really fine.

1764
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,800
I think a kid would be afraid of.

1765
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,800
Yes.

1766
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,800
Oh, God, that shrimp salad came to life.

1767
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,840
Oh, that cheesecake looks that tableau looks depressing.

1768
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,840
The color quality of the film isn't helping.

1769
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,840
Yeah, that's true.

1770
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:26,840
It all looks a little gray, but yeah, but still, when are these wet

1771
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:30,840
leaves on an orange going to be what you want next to your like spotty

1772
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:31,840
cheesecake?

1773
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:32,840
Wow.

1774
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:33,840
Oh, that's cheesecake.

1775
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,840
OK, I know I couldn't really tell you.

1776
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,840
I think I was wondering.

1777
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,840
And a chocolate dipped strawberry.

1778
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,840
Yeah, I thought it was just a piece of cheese that wouldn't be

1779
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:43,880
make sense.

1780
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:44,880
Right.

1781
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
That could be a cheese, a piece of cheese from a cheese block or

1782
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:47,880
something.

1783
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,880
Could you go back in?

1784
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,880
Donald Duck is dressed like Angus Young from ACDC, right?

1785
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,880
Daffy Duck?

1786
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:54,880
Daffy.

1787
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:55,880
Wait, you're right.

1788
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:56,880
Oh, my God.

1789
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:57,880
Oh, the.

1790
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:58,880
Whoa.

1791
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,880
Yes, he's dressed like a Daffy Duck is dressed like Angus Young,

1792
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,880
who wears like a schoolboy outfit and ACDC little shorts.

1793
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:08,880
He doesn't have a hat on, but that is the reference here.

1794
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,880
Playing a guitar.

1795
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,920
Even though wait, yeah, even though they're doing a medley of like

1796
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,920
old timey Hollywood, he's dressed like ACDC.

1797
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:23,920
I guess that's something for the dads in the audience to enjoy.

1798
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,920
For everyone.

1799
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:28,920
I mean, Gadgets is what I mean, the food looks horrible, but Gadgets

1800
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,920
seems like if Gadgets was just suddenly up and open, I'd go.

1801
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,920
Absolutely.

1802
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,920
Especially because you get to the maybe I'd eat before, but then you

1803
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:38,920
get to the bar.

1804
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,960
And look, this is like this is like Oga's Cantina in Star Wars land.

1805
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,960
Like it's a bunch of beakers and like, you know, weird like weird tubes.

1806
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,960
And yeah, I would love to go here.

1807
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,960
The way the way this reporter wraps up the story is pretty great, too.

1808
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,960
That one of the specialties of the bar is something called a Sammy's

1809
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:00,960
whammy named after that guy over there behind the piano.

1810
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:06,960
And believe me, after you've had one or two of these, it doesn't matter

1811
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
whether he's human or humanoid.

1812
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I'm Lynn Brown, Independent Network News.

1813
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Oh, the consummate professional.

1814
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Wow.

1815
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Is she saying she would go home with the robot?

1816
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
What is this like?

1817
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Is that what she's saying?

1818
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
It doesn't matter if he's a human or not.

1819
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Close enough.

1820
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Hey, I've had enough Sammy's whammies.

1821
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Wow.

1822
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It doesn't matter.

1823
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:39,040
I carry you the one ton man I just met up the stairs to my apartment.

1824
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:42,040
Removal your tubing.

1825
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,040
Look, pal, it's a long, dark winter.

1826
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,040
I just want someone to light my cigarette with.

1827
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,040
I don't care if there's metal or bone inside of you.

1828
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:57,040
I brought eight pieces of orange with wet leaves to go.

1829
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,040
The ultimate aphrodisiac.

1830
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,040
Wow.

1831
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:03,080
Then there was only one location of that place?

1832
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:05,080
There might maybe one more.

1833
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,080
It didn't go far.

1834
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,080
It didn't go far past Long Island.

1835
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,080
Yeah, I was only open for two years, too.

1836
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,080
That's it after all that?

1837
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,080
Yeah, 82 to 84.

1838
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,080
Oh my God.

1839
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,080
Work out your The Warner Brothers licensing.

1840
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,080
Oh yeah, that would have been right.

1841
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,080
What year was it again?

1842
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,080
82 to 84.

1843
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,080
Wow, that's crazy.

1844
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,120
A wonderful time.

1845
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,120
You know it's aesthetically fantastic.

1846
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,120
Lots of brass.

1847
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,120
You know this is not for children.

1848
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,120
I don't think you see one kid.

1849
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,120
Is this for dates?

1850
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:40,120
I think so.

1851
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,120
Well, let's see.

1852
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:44,120
Our food costs are 30%.

1853
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,120
Our operating costs are 10%.

1854
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:53,120
And then the other 60% is just Looney Tunes licensing fees.

1855
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:56,120
We don't know how to balance this.

1856
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,160
Wow, that's wild.

1857
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,160
That's gadgets.

1858
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:04,160
I don't know how I missed that one before and all the extra-factor restaurants.

1859
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:09,160
I don't think we're even part way through all the animatronic restaurants that exist.

1860
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:14,160
But I guess let's stay on Chuck E. Cheese and if somebody feels free to take the baton.

1861
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:17,160
Well, go ahead, Jamie.

1862
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:22,200
Oh, I just had one more current last year thing,

1863
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:27,200
which was that Chuck E. Cheese had a brief tenure on Twitch.

1864
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,200
He got into esports for...

1865
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:35,200
It looks like he did a couple broadcasts.

1866
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,200
I always meant to...

1867
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,200
Because he would tweet about it,

1868
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:42,200
assuming that Chuck E. Cheese sends his own tweets.

1869
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,200
I don't know if he as a representative do it.

1870
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,240
He was...

1871
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,240
The puppet was going live as a Twitch streamer several times.

1872
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,240
My guess, I don't have proof,

1873
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:57,240
but just because I've seen screenshots is that they decided maybe it wasn't worth it

1874
01:43:57,240 --> 01:44:01,240
for the amount of really fucked up comments that the streams were getting.

1875
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:06,240
But he streamed Animal Crossing in, I think, April or May.

1876
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,240
And then he later streamed Fall Guys.

1877
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,240
And he was blocking people in the chat.

1878
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:18,280
He was replying, he was talking to people.

1879
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,280
And as of last night,

1880
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:25,280
because I was like, oh, I wonder if he's still in the game,

1881
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,280
is he still streaming?

1882
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,280
He hasn't streamed in four months.

1883
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:31,280
I think that they figured it was maybe not worth it.

1884
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,280
But there were a few stories about...

1885
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,280
I don't know.

1886
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:40,280
I mean, this past year has just been like attempt after attempt to keep Chuck E. relevant,

1887
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:45,320
keep him on the cutting edge and keep him generating a profit.

1888
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:48,320
I think the Twitch thing was maybe a bust in the end,

1889
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,320
but I admire that he tried.

1890
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:56,320
I can't name another mascot that was streaming on Twitch in the last calendar year.

1891
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,320
Yeah, that's a lot of work.

1892
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,320
We did a few Twitch streams and I did too.

1893
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:03,320
And I was like, this is a lot of work.

1894
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,320
You got to stick at it.

1895
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:06,320
It's too much.

1896
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,320
Yeah.

1897
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:08,320
I am interested.

1898
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:13,360
There's Lisa Frank, the property Lisa Frank with the folders and notebooks

1899
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:18,360
with all the colorful, you know what I'm talking about, bears, whatever.

1900
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:19,360
They have recently...

1901
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:22,360
We were reading an article, Lindsay and I,

1902
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:30,360
and they're popular on TikTok now because Lisa Frank's son has put the brand a little bit more on TikTok.

1903
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:36,360
So you'll see like Lisa Frank character Hollywood bear dancing on TikTok now.

1904
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,400
That's great news.

1905
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:46,400
The Lisa Frank story is so wild too that I'm just glad she's doing okay.

1906
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,400
I don't know any of this.

1907
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,400
Oh, we got to do a whole Lisa Frank episode.

1908
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:56,400
There's a whole factory, like dream factory she had that was only around for a few years

1909
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,400
and then closed and it's now abandoned basically.

1910
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,400
And in Arizona, it's like gigantic.

1911
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:08,440
There's a whole story about her coked up husband slowly taking over the company and destroying it.

1912
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:12,440
And then she broke up with him and then he started a Christian t-shirt company.

1913
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,440
It's just like...

1914
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,440
There's just so...

1915
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,440
Yeah, the Lisa Frank hole is deep and rewarding.

1916
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,440
Yes.

1917
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:30,440
But go on TikTok and follow Lisa Frank to see Hollywood bear dance with Instagram and TikTok dogs, like real dogs.

1918
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,480
They like do a branding thing.

1919
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,480
Yeah, anyway.

1920
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,480
I have to get on TikTok now?

1921
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:36,480
That sounds awesome.

1922
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,480
Yeah, you do.

1923
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,480
You have to.

1924
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,480
Let me...

1925
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,480
Here, let me just...

1926
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:43,480
I have a couple more things.

1927
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:47,480
I mean, God, there's so much and there is still so much left.

1928
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,480
This is not the end of our Chuck E. Cheese episodes.

1929
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:55,480
Well, we'll let more disasters happen in the world and then talk about how Chuck E. Cheese dealt with them.

1930
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:57,480
We'll be back.

1931
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,480
We'll be back.

1932
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,520
Let me find...

1933
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,520
This is a best of show.

1934
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,520
I think it's from around 2012.

1935
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:09,520
So it was not in my prime going to Chuck E. Cheese time.

1936
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,520
But I really like it.

1937
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:18,520
This is another thing where I'm just showing you something I like to show you what they were up to at the time.

1938
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:22,520
This is a parody starring, I think, my favorite character Munch.

1939
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,520
And you'll see what it is pretty quickly.

1940
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,520
So Munch is singing into a spatula.

1941
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,520
Green lasers behind him.

1942
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,520
Yeah.

1943
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:41,520
And he's got like a silver shirt on.

1944
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,520
And he's got like...

1945
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:45,520
He looks extra sleepy.

1946
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,520
Yeah, his lids are all like...

1947
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,520
He looks kind of tired.

1948
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:55,560
He got drugs from Conrad Murray before this to get him up for the performance.

1949
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,560
Oh, wait.

1950
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,560
I just figured out what was happening.

1951
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,560
Not a restaurant I associate with grilling.

1952
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,560
Yeah, and he's like barbecuing.

1953
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:12,560
It's got like a sparkly grill.

1954
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,560
And he's got a little bit of a...

1955
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,600
How can you not like that though?

1956
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,600
So that was his little homage to Michael Jackson?

1957
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,600
That's a Rock With You parody in the year 2012.

1958
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,600
Wow.

1959
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,600
Yeah, this is like a whole...

1960
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,600
I found like a whole hour loop of whatever show they were playing in there at the time.

1961
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,600
Oh, yeah.

1962
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,600
And he's like, I'm going to go with the show.

1963
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,600
I'm going to go with the show.

1964
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:45,640
And a whole hour loop of whatever show they were playing in there at the time.

1965
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:48,640
The disco ball grill was fantastic.

1966
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:49,640
Yeah, the grill was good.

1967
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,640
The shirt was good.

1968
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:54,640
Again, I'll say this is not a restaurant I associate with grilling.

1969
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:59,640
I literally went through my notes from the last episode and I have the sentence or the

1970
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,640
phrase, hot dogs cooked in the pizza oven.

1971
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,640
So...

1972
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,640
Right.

1973
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,640
Yeah.

1974
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,640
Yeah.

1975
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:07,640
That's bizarre.

1976
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,640
Wonderful little gifts I left myself in that.

1977
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,680
Like, make the garlic sauce using liquid margarine.

1978
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:15,680
Pasquale filmed at White Settlement, Texas.

1979
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,680
I think it's just the name of a town in Texas.

1980
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,680
I don't know if it's still called that.

1981
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,680
It might be.

1982
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,680
Oh, that's a perfect segue for something I have.

1983
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:25,680
Oh, cool.

1984
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,680
Oh, wonderful.

1985
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:27,680
I can only admit.

1986
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,680
You'll never know.

1987
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,680
I mean, it's going to come out of a strain.

1988
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,680
You won't know where it's coming from.

1989
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,680
Here, let me quickly do this.

1990
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:36,680
OK, so this is a loop from 1991.

1991
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:39,720
And it says Canada only, but I recall this type of thing playing.

1992
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:42,720
This is Prime when we were going or when I was going, at least.

1993
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:43,720
Yeah, yeah.

1994
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:47,720
So this is a loop that they would play inside in between like robot shows.

1995
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,720
And this is just a great logo.

1996
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,720
You'll see it.

1997
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,720
We'll post some clips of this.

1998
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:54,720
Cyber star.

1999
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,720
I like how he catches the spark.

2000
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,720
I love that.

2001
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:58,720
Yeah.

2002
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,720
Yeah.

2003
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:02,720
So very quickly, this is...

2004
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:08,760
We talked about how on these videos, and this is still a thing they do to this day, it goes

2005
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:15,760
back and forth between the robots and suited characters in the same piece of media, which

2006
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,760
was jarring as a kid and I think is still a little jarring.

2007
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:23,760
So this will set up with the premise of this whole 15 minutes is, and I swear I will not

2008
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,760
make you all suffer through this 15 minutes.

2009
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,760
Loving this.

2010
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:36,800
We're supposed to sing a medley of disco hits by John Philip Sousa, but Larry...

2011
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,800
Our technician.

2012
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,800
He isn't playing our music.

2013
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:43,800
Chuck E. look in the control room.

2014
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,800
That's not Larry.

2015
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,800
Chuck E. Cheese and his friends are about to take a musical detour into a past dimension.

2016
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,800
A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of commercials.

2017
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,800
A journey into a wondrous land whose boundaries are that of fringe reception.

2018
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,840
That's the signpost up ahead.

2019
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,840
Your next stop, the TV Zone.

2020
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,840
Okay, so the TV Zone.

2021
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,840
It's okay.

2022
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,840
This is 1991, first of all.

2023
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:11,840
Think about this.

2024
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,840
Okay, so they're going to go into the TV Zone.

2025
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,840
What would you think they're going to do?

2026
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:20,840
Parody, cheers or something, right?

2027
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:21,840
They have to be doing that.

2028
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:22,840
Sure.

2029
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,840
I would...

2030
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,840
Yeah, I don't know.

2031
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:27,880
I would probably...

2032
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:30,880
My first guess would be like a swarthy Rod Serling puppet.

2033
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,880
Well, that was the Rod Serling puppet is what I'm saying.

2034
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:35,880
Yeah, yeah.

2035
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,880
Yeah, that's what I probably would have done.

2036
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,880
I probably would have done that.

2037
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:44,880
Yeah, really like, yeah, a tired, drug-looking Rod Serling puppet.

2038
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,880
Yeah, yeah.

2039
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:46,880
Okay, so what...

2040
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,880
Yeah, based on the Michael Jackson homage in 2012, it's safe to assume they're operating

2041
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,880
at least 20 to 25 years behind at any given time.

2042
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,920
Now, yes, that's...

2043
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,920
You're onto something here, because would you believe that the second parody,

2044
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:06,920
I've skipped over the first one, but the second parody is of Car 54, Where Are You?

2045
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,920
There's a highway in the Bronx, Brooklyn's broken out in vice.

2046
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:11,920
There's a traffic jam right next to it.

2047
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:12,920
What's that?

2048
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:13,920
It's backed up to Jackson Heights.

2049
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:17,920
There's a scout troop short of child, who's just still at Idlewild.

2050
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,920
Car 54, Where Are You?

2051
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:26,920
Oh, Francis.

2052
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:27,920
Yes, Munter?

2053
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,920
I think I cracked something.

2054
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,920
Your brain?

2055
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,920
No, I cracked a case.

2056
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:33,920
I had my head on...

2057
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,920
Your brain.

2058
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:40,920
Okay, so I assume most people don't even know what Car 54, Where Are You?

2059
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:41,920
is or was.

2060
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,920
It was an old cop show.

2061
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:48,920
It starred two of the Munsters, Al Lewis and Fred Gwin.

2062
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,920
And it's a show I never really watched.

2063
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,920
I think it was on Nick at Night a little bit, which is maybe why it's in this parody.

2064
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:55,960
This whole reel.

2065
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,960
So I think this whole thing was done.

2066
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:03,960
This was totally done for the parents because this is 15 minutes of Nick at Night parodies

2067
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,960
in 1991.

2068
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,960
This is not for kids.

2069
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:08,960
So bizarre.

2070
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,960
And they go everywhere.

2071
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,960
They do Adam's Family.

2072
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,960
They do the Patty Duke Show, which is when Helen gets to shine.

2073
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:36,960
And now it's suited Helen, not the robot Helen from the start of the video.

2074
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:43,960
It's suited Helen dancing around to like a badly drawn backdrop that says hot dog stand.

2075
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,960
And she's like just kind of shaking, like doing a lazy twist.

2076
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:47,960
Let's not brush past the lyric.

2077
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,960
A hot dog makes her lose control.

2078
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:51,960
And that is a real line from...

2079
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:52,960
Who Among Us.

2080
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Who Among Us.

2081
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:00,000
That is a real line from the opening of the Patty Duke Show and a real line that Jason

2082
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
thinks about every day.

2083
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Yeah.

2084
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
You get Gilligan's Island here.

2085
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:12,000
You get, let's see, you get the Chuck Van Dyke Show.

2086
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Chuck Van Dyke.

2087
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Now that sounds good.

2088
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:33,040
Let's specifically parody the moments when Dick Van Dyke is at his job.

2089
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:35,040
Don't have Chuck fall over something.

2090
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,040
We want to see him at the office.

2091
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:41,040
They're all playing like Buddy Sorrell and the character side characters.

2092
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:44,080
Mel, Alan Brady's assistant Mel.

2093
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:47,080
Robots can't trip over Ottomans.

2094
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,080
So that's what they had.

2095
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,080
Yeah.

2096
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,080
So this they do all in the family here.

2097
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,080
They do the Jefferson's.

2098
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:58,080
Some of these are so ubiquitous.

2099
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:01,080
How do these characters do the Jefferson's?

2100
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:14,080
To the East Side.

2101
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,080
A tea-loved puppet in the sky.

2102
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:20,080
Wait, they just sing the song?

2103
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,080
I guess they just sing the song.

2104
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,080
Yeah, I guess that's why I didn't flag or something.

2105
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:28,080
All right, so they do little inserts or Alfred Hitchcock parody.

2106
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,080
Alfred Hitchcock presents.

2107
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,080
I like that.

2108
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,080
F-Troop.

2109
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:36,080
Then they hit Leave It to Beaver and they introduce puppet characters.

2110
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,080
To Beaver.

2111
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,080
Gee Wally.

2112
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:41,120
I think I'm really going to get yelled at.

2113
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:45,120
So now they have like different characters playing Wally and the Beaver

2114
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:47,120
from classic television.

2115
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:49,120
So they throw this in at the very end.

2116
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,120
And many loves of Dobie Gillis.

2117
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:57,120
I'm sure anyone younger than us has turned off the podcast at this point.

2118
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:59,120
Okay, so they do I Love Lucy, of course.

2119
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:02,120
Lucy, honey, I'm home.

2120
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:07,120
And they just have puppets of Lucy and Ricky.

2121
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,160
Yes, and there's puppets.

2122
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,160
They're not the characters playing anymore.

2123
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:14,160
Your new guest star has been leaping into your arms all week.

2124
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:17,160
And she pats and drools whenever she sees you.

2125
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,160
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2126
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:20,160
That's right.

2127
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,160
And I brought her home to meet you.

2128
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,160
You did?

2129
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,160
Sure.

2130
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:26,160
My new guest star is Lassie.

2131
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:29,160
Okay, so that's Q Lassie.

2132
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:30,160
That's what the joke is here.

2133
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:32,160
Now here is when I almost fell out of my chair.

2134
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,160
And there's a reason this happens.

2135
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:36,160
But here I'll just play without interruption.

2136
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:39,200
Away, away, away.

2137
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:42,200
No, the Confederate flag has appeared on the screen.

2138
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:44,200
Oh no.

2139
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:48,200
Johnny Huma was a rebel.

2140
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:49,200
Okay.

2141
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,200
Oh my God.

2142
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:53,200
Oh man.

2143
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:58,200
Here is Munch singing the theme to an old show that I've never seen before.

2144
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,200
And I'm so excited to be here.

2145
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,200
I'm so excited to be here.

2146
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:06,240
Here is Munch singing the theme to an old show that I've never seen.

2147
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:07,240
What is this?

2148
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:09,240
The Rebel Johnny Huma.

2149
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,240
What is this?

2150
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:12,240
I've never, I barely know some of these.

2151
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:14,240
That one just zero idea.

2152
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:15,240
Why are we doing this?

2153
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:16,240
That was so jarring.

2154
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,240
So jarring.

2155
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,240
Holy shit.

2156
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:22,240
Filling the whole screen, forming one star at a time.

2157
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:25,240
We had scarcely a moment to prep.

2158
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:31,240
Yeah, I mean some of these shows were so ubiquitous with syndication and everything.

2159
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,280
But I don't think Doe B.

2160
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:39,280
Gillis and like Patty Duke show were necessarily quite as re-aired as like Twilight Zone and

2161
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,280
Beaver were.

2162
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,280
What even is this show?

2163
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,280
The Rebel Johnny Huma.

2164
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:49,280
I had to go back and look this up because I don't, was this even on Nick at Night?

2165
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,280
F Troop was on Nick at Night.

2166
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:52,280
A lot of these, Doe B.

2167
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,280
Gillis, that was all on Nick at Night at the time.

2168
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:56,280
I saw a little bit of that as a kid.

2169
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:59,280
But not even Dukes of Hazzard.

2170
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:02,320
Like the big one, the more obvious choice.

2171
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:05,320
The more obvious Confederate flag show.

2172
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:06,320
Yeah.

2173
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:12,320
So anyway, so they do Green Acres and they close it out and that's the big loop.

2174
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,320
Well that I like.

2175
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,320
Sure, of course.

2176
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:17,320
Guess what I have a chunk about.

2177
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:21,320
Ooh, the Rebel Johnny Huma?

2178
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:27,320
Well, Libby, I will keep this quick because there is no, we do not want to spend much

2179
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:29,360
of our day dwelling on this.

2180
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,360
Oh, I know exactly what this is.

2181
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,360
1979, this is footage from 1979.

2182
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:38,360
Here's the gang opening their frames they used to live in and then you pan across some

2183
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:41,360
flags waving robotically and what do we have?

2184
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:43,360
A Confederate flag.

2185
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,360
This is why, this is why.

2186
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,360
Is that like Jasper Jowell's cannon?

2187
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:52,360
That's why Jasper's going away is because we're uncovering these clips of Jasper and

2188
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:55,360
the Confederate flag flying next to him in the old clips.

2189
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,360
It's been canceled.

2190
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:57,400
We're canceling Jasper.

2191
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:02,400
You've also got, this is from an annual report from the early 80s.

2192
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:07,400
Here's Chuck in a white suit like Boss Hogg waving a Confederate flag.

2193
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:08,400
In Florida.

2194
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:09,400
For Florida?

2195
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:13,400
Yeah, Florida's not the most like Confederate.

2196
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:19,400
And a thing that I self-censored earlier because it was too dark for the room we were in.

2197
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:23,400
Aaron Fector once made an entire animatronic show for a theme park in Tennessee and the

2198
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,400
show was called the Confederate Critter Show.

2199
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,440
Oh my god.

2200
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:27,440
Oh my god.

2201
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:32,440
They're deep Confederate, they're deep Confederate ties to the Chuck E. Cheese.

2202
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:35,440
What a dark episode.

2203
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:36,440
What a bummer.

2204
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:42,440
I'm so, I'm sorry to say all that but there's, look we can dovetail that.

2205
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:47,440
It's just bizarre that, Mike I wonder if you were thinking this must be the only instance

2206
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:52,440
of the Confederate flag in Chuck E. Cheese lore.

2207
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:54,440
Scott I wasn't thinking that.

2208
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,480
I wasn't.

2209
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:57,480
I wasn't a thought I had.

2210
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:00,480
You started smelling a rat as it were.

2211
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:06,480
So the, I can get us to a lighter place though.

2212
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:12,480
Are we sort of winding down or, because this might be a fun place to sort of stop.

2213
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:17,480
I have, there's one last thing that I will say for next time because it's a 20 minute

2214
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:21,480
clip of a game you could play where Chuck E. Cheese you would call him.

2215
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:26,520
You would pay to call Chuck E. Cheese and he would like ramble at you for about a minute

2216
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
and then always go, well call me back.

2217
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:29,520
So call me back.

2218
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:33,520
And like it was like, it felt really needy but it's too much to do.

2219
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,520
We'll do it next time.

2220
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:35,520
I'll save it.

2221
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,520
Okay.

2222
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:42,520
I will, this has motivated me to like, cause it's been, it sounds like something that I

2223
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:48,520
should have done in, well the pandemic was really going but I do have like a vague mission

2224
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:52,560
to at some point watch all the available show tapes.

2225
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:53,560
Oh yeah.

2226
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,560
Without pee breaks if possible.

2227
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:03,560
We should have contacted you when this all began because it would have taken like a year

2228
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,560
to get through it all.

2229
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:05,560
So you have a year to prepare.

2230
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:11,560
And hopefully we don't have another year in which you, hopefully you are now watching

2231
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:14,560
show tapes instead of reuniting with friends and family.

2232
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:15,600
Yeah.

2233
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:18,600
I hope to use it as an excuse to never see my family again.

2234
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,600
It's just this project.

2235
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:23,600
Oh, sorry.

2236
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:26,600
I have to go talk to these three guys about this.

2237
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:30,600
Well, it's called Chuck E. in the galaxy 5,000 and oh boy, don't get me started.

2238
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:32,600
Does an email to my parents.

2239
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:33,600
It's Hollywood stuff.

2240
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:34,600
It's Hollywood stuff.

2241
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,600
It's Hollywood stuff.

2242
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,600
It's a meeting.

2243
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:37,600
It's a meeting.

2244
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:38,600
General.

2245
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:39,600
General.

2246
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,600
Generally about Chuck E. Cheese.

2247
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:44,640
I'm amazed I didn't brave the full galaxy 5,000 perhaps for the next one.

2248
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:49,640
I watched it yesterday and just I watched yesterday.

2249
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:50,640
The whole thing.

2250
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:51,640
Yeah.

2251
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:55,640
And I was like, I, I, we probably won't get to this, but I'll have the notes for the future

2252
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,640
and I need to watch it again.

2253
02:01:58,640 --> 02:01:59,640
Do you?

2254
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:00,640
Unfortunately.

2255
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,640
Yeah.

2256
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,640
That is I say that.

2257
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:03,640
Yeah.

2258
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:04,640
Sorry, Scott.

2259
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:05,640
You're 100%.

2260
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,640
But coming soon.

2261
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:07,640
Maybe in the future.

2262
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:08,680
Yeah.

2263
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:09,680
Yeah.

2264
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,680
Well, plenty more meat on the bone.

2265
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:14,680
Obviously this, this might be a fun, just, you know, a light one, one that you can't,

2266
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:16,680
you can't hate on.

2267
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:20,680
This is again, so much more nineties than I thought I would find.

2268
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:22,680
And this is from 1998.

2269
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:28,680
It actually is, I think, current relevant topical, but still as fun to this day.

2270
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:30,680
Here's this.

2271
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:31,720
Oh, man.

2272
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:33,720
Wow.

2273
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:37,720
Glasses and a blue suit with some ruffles.

2274
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:47,720
Chuck E. Cheese, international mouse of mystery.

2275
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:48,720
Wow.

2276
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:50,720
And this is just some good fun for everyone.

2277
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:54,720
They do the full opening credits of the first meat on the bone.

2278
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,720
And I'm like, I'm going to go with this one.

2279
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:57,720
I'm going to go with this one.

2280
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:00,760
They do the full opening credits of the first movie.

2281
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:01,760
Wow.

2282
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,760
Like a Bobby comes up, glares, but then they all danced together.

2283
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,760
It's all just all the jokes and beats.

2284
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:09,760
What would I choose?

2285
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:13,760
I, yeah, you know, the, the models that I'm trying to think any other moments.

2286
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,760
I mean, it's just every, this, it's the full thing.

2287
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:17,760
Wow.

2288
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,760
And in the bit, like they do the full dance.

2289
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,760
He gets a little off sync.

2290
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:22,760
Oh yeah.

2291
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:23,760
Because he's a mascot.

2292
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,760
Hey, let's, God, let's see this.

2293
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,760
He's an amazing dancer.

2294
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:32,760
They're doing pretty good.

2295
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:36,760
Yeah.

2296
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:38,760
And what a start.

2297
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:41,760
I mean, imagine the show that must have followed that.

2298
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:45,760
Um, it must have been one of the great show tapes.

2299
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:46,760
Wow.

2300
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,760
Just a delight.

2301
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:50,760
Imagine having that on your directing reel.

2302
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:53,760
Just being like, look, I can do a lot.

2303
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:54,760
Yeah.

2304
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,760
Man, I would love.

2305
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,800
I would love to handle this Marvel.

2306
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,800
Well, let me flip this answer the question.

2307
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,800
And save the best for last.

2308
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,800
So good.

2309
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:11,800
Well, you know, we, we uncovered some skeletons in the closet, but, um, you know, this, this

2310
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,800
reinvigorated the brand for me.

2311
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,800
I feel great about it.

2312
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:17,800
Um, I feel great about the future.

2313
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,800
They've kept the content coming.

2314
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,800
The YouTube channel has been great.

2315
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,800
Um, I don't know.

2316
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,800
Do we think they're going to turn it around?

2317
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:26,840
Will there be a Chuck E.

2318
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:29,840
Cheese for us to do an episode about, uh, again?

2319
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,840
That's a good question.

2320
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:37,840
I don't, there is still the one right over here in Burbank, um, that is still operating

2321
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:40,840
with takeout and stuff, but I, I don't know.

2322
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:41,840
I feel like they're going to make it.

2323
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:47,840
I feel like, you know, they're like, well, much like rats can survive anywhere.

2324
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,840
They can, they can, you know, they're vermin.

2325
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:53,840
They can last, you know, humans can be wiped out and rats are still on the planet.

2326
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:54,880
I feel like maybe Chuck E.

2327
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:55,880
Will find a way.

2328
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:58,880
Is it going to be a way we love and would want to go?

2329
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:01,880
Maybe not, but it'll exist.

2330
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:02,880
I think it's going to make it.

2331
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:05,880
I think it's going to make it into its next metamorphosis.

2332
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,880
Yeah.

2333
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:12,880
I, it's not going to be my dream of the doors being flown, flung open, him in the blue suit

2334
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,880
going, do I make you cheesy, baby?

2335
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,880
But, uh, you know, I think they'll be bad.

2336
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,880
I think they'll, I think they'll, they'll manage.

2337
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:22,880
Yeah.

2338
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:23,920
Hopefully.

2339
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:24,920
I agree.

2340
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:25,920
Yeah.

2341
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:30,920
I mean, it's like they, they have made it very clear that they are willing to exhaust

2342
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,920
every possible option before calling it quits.

2343
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,920
They're not above tricks.

2344
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:36,920
They're not above scams.

2345
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:38,920
They're not above e-sports.

2346
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:40,920
They're not above anything.

2347
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:45,920
And they will continue to try until, until it's literally no longer possible.

2348
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,920
I mean, what they should have done during the pandemic is restore a show of animatronics

2349
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:58,960
and program it to top like hit songs or like parodies of hit songs, upload those videos

2350
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:01,960
and go after like, you know, the youth.

2351
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:05,960
They should have a drive-in show with a full band that you could pay to go see.

2352
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,960
I don't, I can't even imagine that.

2353
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:08,960
Yeah.

2354
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,960
But probably what they are doing is figuring out if they could rent out half the restaurant

2355
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:14,960
to like a local electronics store.

2356
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:17,960
Like that's probably really what's going on.

2357
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:19,960
Well, can we make it smaller?

2358
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Drone repair, iPhone screen repair, vape juice.

2359
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Oh yeah.

2360
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Vape.

2361
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
It's a Chuck E. Cheese slash vape store.

2362
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Slash everything, everything repair store.

2363
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Yeah.

2364
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Yeah.

2365
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
That's probably what's happening.

2366
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
So anyway.

2367
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Yeah.

2368
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Yeah.

2369
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Well, I hope they keep plugging away.

2370
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
I hope there's a great, a bright, beautiful future for them.

2371
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Jamie Loftus, You Survive podcast, The Ride, Chuck E. Cheese 2.

2372
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Thanks for joining us once again.

2373
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
What a blast.

2374
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,040
Thanks for having me.

2375
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:54,040
It, it always feels good to talk about Chuck E. Cheese for two hours.

2376
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:56,040
Sure.

2377
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,040
Of course.

2378
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,040
Yeah.

2379
02:06:58,040 --> 02:06:59,040
Thank you.

2380
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,040
I'm glad that's the case.

2381
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:04,040
I feel like some people might not be able to make that statement, but I'm glad you're,

2382
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,040
I'm glad you would.

2383
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:08,040
Like say the accountants of Chuck E. Cheese.

2384
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:13,040
Indeed.

2385
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:18,040
Let's exit through the gift shop where you can purchase items that are normally won through

2386
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:19,080
games.

2387
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:21,080
Is there anything that you would like to plug?

2388
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:28,080
There, if you want to listen to something really dark, you can listen to my new podcast

2389
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,080
called Lolita podcast.

2390
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:35,080
It's about, it's a complete taxonomy of the history of Lolita.

2391
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:41,080
Or if you don't want to be upset, you can listen to the Bechtel cast on I Hurt Radio.

2392
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:45,080
It's a feminist movie podcast that comes out every week and is only occasionally sad.

2393
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:50,120
Like this episode with its confederate context, but otherwise pretty delightful.

2394
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:53,120
Yeah, that's fantastic.

2395
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:55,120
Love my ear in Mensa too.

2396
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:56,120
