1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,440
Timber, welcome to podcast the Ride the Second Gate.

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,920
My name is Mike Carlson joining me as always,

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,280
Lumberjack, Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,280
You were so excited when we said, who wants to start it?

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
And you're like, yeah, I can see why.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,080
I didn't have this.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,880
This came to me in the moment.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,960
This was not a planned thing.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,080
Also joining us Lumberjack, Scott Gardner.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Yeah, hey, am I the singer of Fallout Boy?

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,040
Because today's topic has got me feeling like Mr. Stump.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
Wow.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,880
We're having a lot of fun already.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,880
We're having a lot of fun.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Yeah, well of course, because we're talking about a tree stump.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Today's episode's about a stump.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
It's about a stump.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Yeah, can't stop the stump.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Stump.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,880
There was a character in the Ninja Turtles Archie comics

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
named Stump and he was a wrestling promoter,

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
but he was a tree man.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
And he's one of my favorite characters

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
and they've never used him.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
In fiction.

27
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,880
In fiction, yeah.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,920
He's a tree man who was a tree man

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,760
who was a sneaky Don King style promoter on a planet,

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,720
on a wrestling loving planet.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
So anyway.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,560
Some of my least favorite characters in fiction are trees.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
Yeah, we'll talk about it.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,680
Most alive trees are horrible.

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
I hate it in the Snow White Ride.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,560
I hate it in Wizard of Oz.

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,560
I'm creeped out by talking trees in FAO shorts.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Grandma Willow from Pocahontas.

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
Don't much care for Grandma Willow.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,080
Lord of the Rings trees.

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,320
What's, Lindsay, what's the-

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,760
I don't know though.

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,600
Lindsay, what's the tree from, is it the last,

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
what's the tree that is a bustier woman?

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
What's the busty tree from?

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
What's the busty tree from?

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
It's last unicorn.

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
It's, what's the character's name?

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,880
Who gets tied to the tree?

50
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
Yeah.

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,560
Shmendrick.

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Shmendrick gets tied to this busty woman tree.

53
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,680
And it's like very disturbing, right?

54
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
He gets tied to a tree,

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
and then Shmendrick, to try to get away from it,

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,480
turns the tree into a living tree.

57
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,320
Oh.

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
She becomes a busty woman.

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,600
Does anyone have time code for this horrifying sequence?

60
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,640
I think you could probably just Google

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,840
last unicorn busty tree.

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,680
Got it.

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,120
Yeah, so that is a scary sequence.

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,200
Well, then it's good that we're talking about a tree

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,200
that died a long time ago, because good riddance.

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,800
So many scary trees.

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,640
So many scary trees.

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,480
I want them gone.

69
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,160
Cut every tree down.

70
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,960
Is there a good, is there a good talking tree?

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,560
Anyway, I guess stump is my, I like him.

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
But other than that, it is tough to find a good talk.

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,240
Groot.

74
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
Groot?

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
Yeah.

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
Groot is good.

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,080
Yeah, Groot is a good talking tree, yeah.

78
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,040
Does the giving tree talk?

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,440
Does the, oh shoot.

80
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
I don't think so.

81
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,120
Yeah.

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,600
I think it just gets used for parts.

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
Right.

84
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,160
The first thing I ever worked on for Funny or Die

85
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,160
was I edited a video starring Tim Allen,

86
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,520
where he was a, he was in a liar, liar type scenario.

87
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,320
He like, his son made a wish and then he becomes a tree

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,360
and it was called Arbor Days, like D-A-Z-E.

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,200
And that was the first I ever did anything for them.

90
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,120
And I got to go through Tim Allen Daly's,

91
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,920
while he was painted to look,

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
his face was superimposed onto a tree.

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
So they painted his face,

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,240
basically he was like in blackface in the raw footage.

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,560
Because they painted a brown oval around his face

96
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,000
to be comped, but I'm looking at all the raw footage

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,640
and just like, this is weird.

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,160
He just has like a raisin print on his face.

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
It was very disturbing.

100
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah.

101
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm glad the audience didn't have to see what I had to see.

102
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,480
That does sound disturbing.

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,960
The video was disturbing, I think too.

104
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Already, yes.

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
Yeah, so you would.

106
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,440
Hey, I'm a tree.

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,640
He mainly, and in the raw, they're saying like,

108
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,200
improvise and just have fun with it.

109
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,240
And he's like, okay, yeah.

110
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,720
Hey, I'm a tree.

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,680
Look at me, I'm a tree.

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,760
I was like about what he could think of to do.

113
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,920
He was doing his best.

114
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,480
Maybe he hasn't been through all the levels of UCB.

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,880
No, he also in the raw footage complained

116
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,680
about the sound quality because he,

117
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,520
there were planes going by, so they had to hold.

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,040
And he's like, I thought that's why we live

119
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
in this damn city.

120
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,920
So we could work in sound stages where it's soundproofed.

121
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,920
But the one in the damn world.

122
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,240
So he did easily improvise about being mad

123
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
about that they weren't filming in a soundproof environment.

124
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
Yeah.

125
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,960
Was that in character as a tree though?

126
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,040
That was just as Tim.

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Well, it was in that like, when he's a tree,

128
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,640
he's like, hey, I'm a tree.

129
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,920
And when he's Tim, he's like, hey, I'm Tim.

130
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,080
He's got a lot of, he's got some range.

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
There was a range in what I just did.

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,840
Yeah, you'd have to rewind it

134
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,720
and to really analyze it to tell.

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
Well, back to this tree.

136
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,160
It's not a tree anymore.

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,760
It's a petrified tree.

138
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,480
We should, this is early enough that we should say

139
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,160
what the hell this is in case you don't know.

140
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
And you might be looking at a photo of it

141
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
that we tweeted out.

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,680
But, and you might really not be familiar

143
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,800
if you haven't been to Disneyland

144
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
or spent a lot of time at Disneyland.

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
Because this has not been reproduced in the other parks.

146
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
No.

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
This is only at Disneyland.

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,360
And this is some real old Walt Disney stuff.

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,680
In Frontierland, you get to the river

150
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,560
and you get to, you know, like,

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,160
just past the Golden Horseshoe.

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,920
You start approaching, you know, where Fantasmic happens.

153
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,720
And there's this tree that's been up since 1956.

154
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,920
And it is framed as a gift from Walt Disney

155
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,800
to his wife, Lillian.

156
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,280
And there is a plaque that explains what this is.

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
Now we're talking about it.

158
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,680
Yes.

159
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,400
It is believed to have been part of a forest

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,360
55 to 70 million years ago.

161
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,200
Yes.

162
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,640
But due to mineralization, it has become rock.

163
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,880
So I feel safe in including that, yes,

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,880
the petrified spires of Batuu are fake rocks.

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,160
Cause I read up a little more on petrified wood.

166
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
And I'm like-

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
Oh, this judgment of do those count as rocks?

168
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
I see.

169
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,000
Petrified wood is kind of like fossils.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
The fossils we think of are like imprints,

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,560
but this is actual wood that is like transformed into

172
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,360
minerals.

173
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,000
But you wouldn't call this petrified tree a rock.

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is rock.

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,040
It is now rock.

176
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,840
But the plaque doesn't say here's a rock.

177
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,680
No, but for all intents and purposes,

178
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,960
it is mineral now as opposed to vegetation.

179
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,800
That's true.

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,840
But I think there's even this question.

181
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,480
I just wanted it out of the fake rock.

182
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640
There was so much to get through.

183
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,760
That seemed like an easy technicality.

184
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,600
Yeah.

185
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,520
That was as close as we could come to saying

186
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,760
one of the competitors took performance enhancing drugs.

187
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Yeah.

188
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
So they're out of the competition.

189
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,200
Well, this tree gambled.

190
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,040
This tree gambled on itself.

191
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,080
So it's got a knock.

192
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,160
It is fake rock, but it took a circuitous route to get there.

193
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,560
Sure.

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,080
Yes.

195
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,560
Yeah.

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
This is real rock.

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,680
This is actual rock.

198
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,440
Yes.

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
This is, yeah.

200
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,760
Do you guys remember noticing this for the first time?

201
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,640
This feels like the kind of thing that maybe

202
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,000
does it maybe take a lot of Disneyland visits

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
to notice this detail?

204
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
I mentioned it to Erin, my wife, who

205
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,160
had no idea what I was talking about.

206
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
She's never noticed this thing.

207
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
I've never noticed it either.

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,520
Really?

209
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,200
Didn't know.

210
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Whoa.

211
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,680
You suggested it.

212
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,880
I looked it up and went.

213
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,520
I suggested it and you looked it up and went, oh.

214
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,000
OK.

215
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,120
So you've never looked at that plaque before.

216
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
I guess not.

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,800
Whoa.

218
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,560
Yeah, I guess not.

219
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Well, it's good.

220
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
This is really why we might be explaining this

221
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,640
to a lot of audience members for the first time.

222
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,440
And it's really important that you know,

223
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,840
because when you hear all of the exciting stories that

224
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
are to come.

225
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,880
I read up.

226
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,400
It's, boy.

227
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,840
Yeah, hey, we're going to go to Colorado.

228
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,680
We're going to talk to a boy who gives an old man a tour.

229
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,200
Butterflies are involved.

230
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
A bug man, not a bug man.

231
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,960
Not a bug man.

232
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,720
Ha ha ha.

233
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,440
Unfortunately, we could call him.

234
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
We could get him here.

235
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,320
We wanted to spice this episode up.

236
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,360
Now that you know about it, what do you think?

237
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,120
How do you feel?

238
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,360
Well, I feel deceived by the plaque

239
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,720
because I don't believe I would have, from what I understand,

240
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,800
is not completely accurate.

241
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,160
Well, it's a little family joke.

242
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,280
The facts are yes, but the story of it is a bit embellished.

243
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,000
Little Jebediah Springfield-y.

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,720
Yeah.

245
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,120
OK, so this is framed on the plaque.

246
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,800
This is something that Walt gave to Lily and his wife.

247
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,720
And the story that they played up for people

248
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,760
is that this was an anniversary present.

249
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,040
And that she looked at it in sort of a Simpsons big old head,

250
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,160
a gift from Mr. Burns way, and was like,

251
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
this is not going in my home.

252
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,640
We've got to put this somewhere.

253
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,440
This is going to Disneyland.

254
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,760
And which would make this really like the ultimate regift.

255
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,160
Disneyland has a permanent regift.

256
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,920
It's had it since 56.

257
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,960
But it is disputed whether or not that is accurate.

258
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,040
Because it seems that via the Disney daughters,

259
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,120
this was never in their house.

260
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,400
Right.

261
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,080
There was not a stretch of time where they tried to have the tree around.

262
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,000
And there's a letter that you can find where Walt said,

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
deliver this to Disneyland.

264
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
Yes.

265
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,680
There is literally a purchase order for like,

266
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,640
I have paid you just over $1,600.

267
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,160
Please deliver it to Disneyland.

268
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,200
The letter E is available online.

269
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,120
Also, it says, please deliver during business hours.

270
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,920
Please deliver this five tons.

271
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,000
Please don't deliver before or after business hours.

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,200
Please deliver during business hours.

273
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,320
I'm sure they had a lot less staff back then.

274
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,160
But also, please drop off this massive thing,

275
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,000
this massive five ton thing, while this amusement park is running.

276
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,960
So did they?

277
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,320
Did like a truck drive in and like,

278
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,040
and, you know, like knock over kids on the way into the park?

279
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Just right down Main Street.

280
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
Yeah, with a petrified tree on the back of it.

281
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
These brazen tree deliverers.

282
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,680
Be more careful.

283
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,160
Yeah.

284
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,280
The happiest place on earth.

285
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,640
Well, at least he has to use the warehouse entrance on West Street,

286
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,520
which I don't believe is that a street anymore in Anaheim?

287
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,000
West Street?

288
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's changed so much.

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,440
I think it is, maybe.

290
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,040
Is it?

291
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm not sure.

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,560
Does it have a series of restaurants and hotels we could review?

293
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,040
Oh.

294
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,960
Let's hope to God not.

295
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,520
No, this is a service road.

296
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,560
We don't have to review the service roads.

297
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,320
Not yet.

298
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Maybe in year eight.

299
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,320
We're edging ever closer with this topic, with this like, you know,

300
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,960
very functional topic.

301
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
West Street, Anaheim.

302
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,440
I'm looking at it.

303
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,800
Hey, we're talking trees.

304
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,440
We're doing tree episodes.

305
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,680
I want to take the lead on a Halloween tree episode.

306
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,280
What's up with the Halloween tree?

307
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,880
Well, we'll have to get into it.

308
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,160
The Halloween tree is in Frontierland as well.

309
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,960
Every Halloween, a tree is turned into Ray Bradbury's Halloween tree.

310
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,480
The spirit of Halloween.

311
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,600
Really?

312
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,240
I don't know.

313
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't know that either.

314
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,800
It's very simple in execution, but it's got a fun.

315
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a fun little thing they do to nod a guy who was very influential

316
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,040
throughout the Disney parks history.

317
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,480
Where's the Halloween tree?

318
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,880
It's right by the shops in

319
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,000
Frontierland.

320
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,520
Yeah, it's covered in lights and lanterns.

321
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,120
Yeah. So you got a couple of famous trees right across from each other.

322
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
Huh? Oh, well, I guess I want to do a tree now, too.

323
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,400
But I don't know which.

324
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,560
I learned about some other Disney trees.

325
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,160
I don't want to get off topic, but I in Googling this petrified tree,

326
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,200
I found a listicle of like other important Disneyland trees.

327
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,440
Do you know about the Dominguez family palm tree?

328
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,720
Mm hmm.

329
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,280
There is a palm tree that was part of the farm, the original farm

330
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,560
that is that was the farmland that was purchased for Disneyland.

331
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
And part of the deal was there was this one tree that was very important to them.

332
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,640
And they said, don't demolish this tree.

333
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,760
And they did not.

334
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,640
And it's still up in the Jungle Cruise.

335
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,800
You're looking at the Jungle Cruise marquee.

336
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,960
It's probably like 20 feet to the right.

337
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,680
Interesting. A palm tree that is that predates Disneyland.

338
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,880
Wow. They never move. Sure.

339
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,840
There is another one that I'd never, ever heard of before.

340
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,760
Do you know about the little man of Disneyland? Yes.

341
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Yes. I've never heard of this.

342
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,000
Really? No, never got this.

343
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,720
Well, let's make that one, too.

344
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,520
Let's put that aside.

345
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,360
That has to be a separate episode.

346
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,520
The little man. Well, you can read the storybook live on air.

347
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,080
I think the little man is at least a patron.

348
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Because there's a whole story about him.

350
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
OK, so there's some off the little man here.

351
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,480
There's some Lasseter little man stuff, too.

352
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,560
When they reintroduced the little man a couple of years ago, D23,

353
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,080
it's a video to steal your impression.

354
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,240
There's a little man of Disneyland.

355
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,960
This was the thing that made a park special in me.

356
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,160
Yes. So much less arm flailing with him out.

357
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,240
You don't have any more presentations.

358
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,880
We have Eiger who doesn't do anything with his body.

359
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,440
No, no, he's too scared to.

360
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,760
He can't move at any.

361
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,000
He doesn't want to offend anyone with any sort of gesture.

362
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,280
So he just is perfectly still.

363
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,640
Any little motion I could make could be some gesture that would offend the Chinese.

364
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,160
Yes. I don't want to risk that.

365
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,560
Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,320
Let me purchase another company, please.

367
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
But I cannot.

368
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,280
All right. So these but these are other trees.

369
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,840
This is this is counter to you know, it's also

370
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,240
it this is probably the oldest plant life in the park,

371
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,080
not bested by the Sequoia slice in the Redwood Trail.

372
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,880
Oh, right. Yes. Yes. That I was like, when is that from?

373
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,200
That's called the Millennium Tree, apparently.

374
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,120
And that is that's maybe from eight one eight A.D.

375
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,520
It's a distracting year.

376
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,280
That's a lot of our area codes of our phone numbers. Yes.

377
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,720
This tree is from the eight one eight.

378
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,880
So this is much older, as you said, 55 to 70 million years old. Yeah.

379
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,120
Isn't there a tree Tony Baxter took from Disneyland, put in his backyard?

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,680
I believe so.

381
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,040
When it fell over or struck by lightning or something like that.

382
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,640
Oh, he also took something and had it transported to his backyard.

383
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,480
And you pointed out to us the the Matterhorn tree,

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
I believe, when we were there.

385
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,240
That's shaped like the Matterhorn. Yeah.

386
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,960
I think somebody else actually does someone else from Dennis McNicholas.

387
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,160
Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,360
I'd never noticed that before, that there's this tree.

389
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,640
If you're in Frontierland, there's a tree that is cut in the shape

390
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,640
of the Matterhorn to block the Matterhorn so you can't see it from Frontierland

391
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
because it would be it would take you out of it.

392
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,880
Why would there be this Swiss mountain in the frontier town?

393
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
It is eerie when you look at it now, like you can't unsee it.

394
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,880
You look at it from the other way and it's clear even without the Matterhorn

395
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
there, it's clearly the shape of the Matterhorn. Sure.

396
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,560
That is very strange.

397
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,600
Listeners, what's your favorite Disneyland tree?

398
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,040
Yeah. Let us know.

399
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Shout it out now, or if you want to write it down and send it to us

400
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,360
and we will peruse it and go, hmm.

401
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,200
And that'll be the end of that exchange. Yeah.

402
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,760
I was going to say I like all these trees, but I you know, they're not fake.

403
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,760
I think we would like them a little more if they were fake. Sure. Sure.

404
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,160
We have a favorite fake tree.

405
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,520
Well, I mean, is the tree of life count?

406
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,080
I guess I guess that's probably it.

407
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,680
So probably too obvious.

408
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
It is too obvious.

409
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Well, look, it is also if it is the best fake tree than it is.

410
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,520
Yeah. And or the treehouse.

411
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,240
Do we think the tree of life is better than the than Swiss family or

412
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,280
Terzins treehouse?

413
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,200
Are there actual real trees involved in that?

414
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,360
Or is it all fake trees?

415
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,080
I think it's mostly fiberglass, isn't it?

416
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,120
I would assume that.

417
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,960
But could there be one that it's in question shows you how it is all fake?

418
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
It's very well done. Yeah.

419
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,040
OK, I like that, too. Yeah.

420
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,440
What else has fake trees?

421
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,200
There's a lot of fake trees in the trouble is it's a lot of forests.

422
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,120
Yeah, it's a lot of like, you know,

423
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,360
it's hard to point out an individual one in the adventure in Hagrid's. Right.

424
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
It's it's the bulk of the trees.

425
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,160
Although, wait, no, those are real trees, fake trees in ET.

426
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,080
And they're all very good.

427
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,640
Yes. And real trees on Hagrid's. Yes.

428
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,480
There's a lot of disguised like electrical poles or boxes

429
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,320
throughout, if you like, wooded areas of parks.

430
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,000
Well, and with the in outside of the parks,

431
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,120
there's a lot of like antennas and things disguised as trees,

432
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,200
like along the freeway and what have you.

433
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,920
Let's give some respect to those.

434
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,480
Yes. That really is themed entertainment outside of theme parks.

435
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,640
Yeah. Yeah. Good job with those fake trees.

436
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,400
I'll see people when it comes to trees and decorative elements for trees as well.

437
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,280
They were doing we miss this with downtown Disney ordeal right around the holidays.

438
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,200
They put these like neon circle things.

439
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,040
Remember this around the trees and which I believe they're gone.

440
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,880
Last time I was there, they're gone, which is a bummer.

441
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,000
But maybe they'll be back for the holiday.

442
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
So I like that. That's half that's that's fake and a fake element on a real tree,

443
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,920
which very much makes it seem like they're like future trees. Yeah.

444
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,320
That was like the the like good guy component to like the weird

445
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,000
like Melania Trump, like White House trees, like the last few years,

446
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,080
the like, let's take a tour of my White House trees.

447
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,560
And they're just like so sinister looking.

448
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,160
You're gothic and terrifying and like York video elements.

449
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,920
Simplistic like like modernist and simplistic, but like horrifying.

450
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,280
Like, I don't know, the neon trees of downtown Disney were like.

451
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,040
Mm hmm. Good.

452
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,520
But when you just create, you said the phrase fake elements on real trees.

453
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,080
I mean, that's like so that you're describing Christmas trees.

454
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
I was also. Yes. As I said, almost everything.

455
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,680
Yes. A lot of any light on a tree counts as that.

456
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,560
Yes, that's true.

457
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,200
Well, I guess the Christmas tree that they put up in

458
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,360
around Christmas time in Disneyland.

459
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,480
Mm hmm. That's real. Real tree. Yeah.

460
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,160
OK. Yep. Yes.

461
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,840
No, they don't just like pack that away

462
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,280
and in a Disneyland closet and put it back together.

463
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,160
And it's a new tree every year, right?

464
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,120
I don't put it back in the ground.

465
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,280
I don't believe so.

466
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,160
I don't think they go in and out of the ground plant and replant.

467
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,400
All right. I think that's not how it works.

468
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,760
But if you can move a tree, how often can you move a tree and it still survives?

469
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,720
Hmm. It depends on if you're moving, if you're just soil to soil, I think,

470
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,360
or like soil to like could you tree planter?

471
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,600
Could you move a tree every month and still have it survive?

472
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,200
I don't know that. I don't know.

473
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,840
It's like a question for a way on.

474
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,880
Well, that's like then you're like the military brat of trees.

475
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,560
Yes. It's maybe technically you survive, but it was.

476
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,240
Yes. Yes. Who knows the psychological effects?

477
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,720
I mean, you would just be the tree

479
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,240
is to make new friends at a new school.

480
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,320
That's so hard. It is very hard.

481
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,840
Might not integrate.

482
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,520
And especially, you know, if you are a palm and then you're planted amongst pines.

483
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,400
Yeah. You might not fit in.

484
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,120
So you should be accepting stupid snooty pines.

485
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,960
You're talking to try getting along with a tree that's not your kind.

486
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,200
Hmm. Hmm. That's a whole different show.

487
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,200
I still it bums me out to think that they just throw that tree away after Christmas.

488
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,920
But lots of places do that.

489
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,040
Many, many of places we did it.

490
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,760
Yes. Yeah. Well, all of us individually, but like massive places

491
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,600
throw that, yeah, get massive trees.

492
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,760
And then that's the end of that.

493
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,600
Yeah. They hopefully use it for something good and important.

494
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I don't know. It becomes part of the land.

495
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
It's the circle of life.

496
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,160
Mm hmm. That's it.

497
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,080
When we die, what does Mufasa say?

498
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,640
We die, our bodies become the grass and the antelope eat the grass.

499
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,040
That's the circle of life.

500
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,480
I think that is what Mufasa says.

501
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
It is exactly what he says, right?

502
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,840
Like hauntingly what he said.

503
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
You just said it with no inflection.

504
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
All right. Here's the deal.

505
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,080
When we die, we become the grass and then the antelope eat the grass.

506
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,160
All right. That's the circle of life. Got it?

507
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,000
All right. Let's eat dinner.

508
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,360
I don't know why they got James Earl Jones again

509
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,840
when you offer a much different, perhaps more modern take.

510
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,800
Well, I need an agent so I can get these hot voiceover auditions

511
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,680
so I can redo classic Disney lines in the most dry, monotone way possible.

512
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,120
Hey, it's no, I'm not going to say that one.

513
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,560
Oh, I'm not sure what you were going to say.

514
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,320
Hey, it's Mike. I'm Siamese.

515
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,640
You can still reference the Siamese cats.

516
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
Yeah, they thought of it.

517
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,840
You're making fun of how inappropriate it is.

518
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,880
Whatever.

519
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,080
They're making fun of the inappropriateness, not the actual.

520
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,200
That's probably the better way to do it also than some voice

521
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
that's going to bother people. It's Mike.

522
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,680
We are Siamese, if you please.

523
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,720
We're Siamese.

524
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,360
I got to tell you, we're Siamese if you don't please.

525
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Yeah. Yeah.

526
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,000
What are you going to do? Mm hmm.

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,040
I like this take. Yeah.

528
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,440
All right. Move along.

529
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,480
All right. Let's go dinner.

530
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,800
Get this spaghetti.

531
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,000
You just want to see the spaghetti.

532
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,320
You want to see the CGI spaghetti?

533
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,720
I did not. We did. We watched.

534
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,360
We scrolled through it and.

535
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,000
When Walliners here right after the we watched

536
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,040
because we were watching Boogity during the episode.

537
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah, it seemed we were surprised that F.

538
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,480
Murray Abraham sings the Bella note. Right. Yeah.

539
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,920
I don't think I don't think I have any observations about it.

540
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,520
No, that's these movies are designed to be observation free.

541
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,280
They like like Bob Iger's body language are designed to be

542
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,080
as inoffensive as possible, is not distracting as possible.

543
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,880
Give anyone any handle.

544
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,800
Don't like create an opening to have an opinion, good or bad.

545
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
Right. Disney is aiming for perfect seas.

546
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,760
Yes. Like like a perfect circle, like a scientifically perfect sea

547
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,520
is what all these movies are trying to be.

548
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,440
There is an assembly line designed to make the movie too good.

549
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,040
Can make it too interesting.

550
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,560
Can make it much different.

551
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,440
We just want people to go, huh, OK.

552
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,840
And then we'll forget about it.

553
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,600
So then in two months when this similar thing happens, they go,

554
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,000
you want to go see that other movie, the movie that we it's a remake

555
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,560
of the other movie we like.

556
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,200
And they go, yeah, OK. And then they go, huh, OK.

557
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,680
That was fine. Then they forget about it and happens two months later.

558
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Yeah, it's insidious.

559
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,600
It's a brilliant insidious plan.

560
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,040
I don't think Disney has the monopoly on that, though,

561
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,800
of like churning out movies.

562
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,760
No, not at all.

563
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,800
But they are like so the fact that Disney does it in this

564
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,320
like shot for shot way. Yeah.

565
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,360
I think they they're there.

566
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,360
They're more than other franchises reinvent in a in a boring or eye rolling way.

567
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,360
They truly just can we just kind of like use the old one as a demo

568
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,640
and not really change anything. Yeah, for sure.

569
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,360
Is it possible?

570
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,960
Do you guys think at this juncture that Mulan is better than the other ones

571
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,920
have been or the or that like in maybe interesting in a way?

572
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,160
Because like, I don't think anyone needs

573
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,960
Mulan animated Mulan to be remade shot for shot.

574
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,200
So maybe they're going to be a little it just might be like a cooler looking movie.

575
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,640
I think they're a little cooler. Yeah.

576
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,720
I think they're they're they chose a different direction.

577
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,040
Like I did. There's no songs.

578
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,120
Mm hmm. That's fine. Who cares about this Mooshu in the movie?

579
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,480
But I think they cut Mooshu really.

580
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,600
I think it's more of like the second or more like Teddy Murphy. Right.

581
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,680
Oh, yeah. The animated.

582
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,680
Yeah, they're more the PJs.

583
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,240
Who's rank those?

584
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,120
I think I think in terms of public love, it would be Donkey Mooshu.

585
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,520
PJs or PJ. Mm hmm.

586
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,840
I think I think.

587
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,600
Well, it's a lightning strike.

588
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,520
And the listener hear that? I don't know.

589
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,960
I don't know. The creator of the PJs is angry.

590
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,040
I would put PJs at number two.

591
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm not just saying that it's a threat of some sort of weather phenomenon.

592
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,040
Fine, fine. You're moving up, Mr. PJ.

593
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,240
I like the PJs.

594
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,880
Uh, I don't remember.

595
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,400
I don't think maybe I just don't care for Mooshu, though, too much.

596
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,840
Like Mooshu fine. I just haven't seen the movie in a long time. Yeah.

597
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,120
Mm hmm. But I think it is more of a straightforward martial arts period movie.

598
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,720
Maybe that's a good self is better than what it was before.

599
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Would you know with Harvey Fierstein and

600
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
I don't remember a lot of it.

601
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,680
I don't know. I'm like that one's like 70 minutes, I feel like.

602
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,320
Is it that short? Yeah.

603
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,680
Huh. Yeah, it is an interesting story.

604
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,320
It's got like you could do.

605
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,800
So, yeah, potentially they've they've made something interesting.

606
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,080
We'll see. Mm hmm.

607
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,880
This is a shot.

608
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,440
It's the first one where I haven't rolled my eyes at every

609
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
snippet of it I've seen. Yeah.

610
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,600
So we shall see. We will.

611
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,400
But they impress me in my ability to be very dull at every turn.

612
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,280
Very interested that through some like cross

613
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
studio cooperation, Harley Quinn is in it.

614
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,400
That kind of breaks the seriousness.

615
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,240
Harley Quinn is now in Mulan.

616
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,720
Harley Quinn is now in Mulan.

617
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,880
I didn't know that. I guess they've been hiding on the trailer.

618
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,360
Huh?

619
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Come on, M.

620
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,600
We got a bunch of conquering armies.

621
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,640
We got to take.

622
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,080
What's this episode about the tree?

623
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,080
The tree. Let's let's should we should we.

624
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,560
Explain war.

625
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,840
The actual truth.

626
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,040
Is it possible listeners also let us know if you can hear those lightnings

627
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,000
because they seem very loud to us, but I don't know the power of microphones.

628
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,240
Thunder. Yeah, it's too big.

629
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,960
Thunder strike thunder.

630
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,280
I mean, I assume there's lightning somewhere.

631
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,240
Usually that's what happens.

632
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,240
But if you live in a city so it could be soundproof,

633
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,120
goddamn lightning strikes, I'm a tree. Wow.

634
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,960
How fitting.

635
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,400
So so the real story, the real story of the petrified tree,

636
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,360
as we said, always intended for Disneyland, became a family joke that like,

637
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,560
yeah, Walt Baldi has an anniversary gift because he did buy it two days before

638
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,640
him, his and Lillian's 31st wedding anniversary.

639
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,040
They were vacationing in Colorado Springs. Yes.

640
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,320
At the time, they were working on a project

641
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,720
to add a mineral museum to Frontierland called Mineral Hall.

642
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah. Where you could go and buy, look at mineral samples

643
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,160
and buy souvenir minerals.

644
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,560
And this was there. This this did happen.

645
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,280
It did happen. Yes.

646
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,640
It didn't stick around. Sure.

647
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,560
But yeah, it was there for a little while.

648
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,320
It was sponsored by the the Blacklight Corporation of America.

649
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,280
And they sold black lights so that you could, you know, view your minerals

650
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,560
where under cool looking black light.

651
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,840
So, yeah, while it was in bed with the blacklight people

652
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,960
and needed something to put in these stores.

653
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,520
Still very novel at the time.

654
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,240
Blacklight. Yeah.

655
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,440
And not in the parks like crazy. Yes. Yes. Right.

656
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,800
So so they did build it.

657
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,040
Yeah, there was a mineral hall.

658
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,640
And that's why.

659
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,680
Well, I'll save that part maybe just if we're going through this story in order.

660
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,240
But yeah, there was a store called the Mineral Hall.

661
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,960
And if you go and it is where now the restaurant Rancho del Zocalo is.

662
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,680
And there is if you look on a building there,

663
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,480
it says Mineral Hall on the second floor

664
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,760
as a nod to what used to be there at one point in time.

665
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,560
That's cool. Something over.

666
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,360
I was so excited, flailing my arms around.

667
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,160
This is why Iger avoids doing this kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah.

668
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,440
You should be more like Bob.

669
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,040
You were saying that to Jason.

670
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,760
Oh, yeah. So so they were vacationing in Colorado.

671
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,200
What did not end up in Disneyland

672
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,200
was a collection of rare butterflies and insects from a man named John May.

673
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,760
Walt wanted to buy this collection

674
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,200
and John May wanted to rent it to him

675
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,280
with a promotion for his main museum audits in Colorado.

676
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,240
Colorado be an ad for a Colorado museum.

677
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,040
Yes. You have to look at in Disneyland.

678
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,240
Yes. Hmm.

679
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,160
But Walt wanted his name on it.

680
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,480
Well, one in his name, I like everything for the most part.

681
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,800
Well, just wanted to buy a bunch of dead books.

682
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,680
Yes. But he let me just take these to Disneyland.

683
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,680
But he wanted to call like Walt Disney's Dead Bugs.

684
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,120
Probably. Yeah. That's what I read that he didn't have any.

685
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,080
He didn't want the connection to Colorado.

686
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,880
He wanted to act like he found these dead butterflies.

687
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,240
Yeah. He picked them all.

688
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah. Personally, unless he was getting a ton of money from a company like Monsanto,

689
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,720
he didn't want to have another name above another person's name.

690
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,880
Yeah, that was his thing.

691
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,960
OK, unless it was a ton of money involved, which the butterfly man

692
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,000
did not have a lot of money. No.

693
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,560
Like Monsanto did.

694
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,640
He let though Aunt Jemima into the parks.

695
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,920
Yes. That's not really a person unless was there a real Aunt Jemima?

696
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,880
Well, there was an actor would play.

697
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,520
Well, there was as far as the history of the syrup company.

698
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
I don't know.

699
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,880
But there was a there was a woman who played Aunt Jemima at the pancake

700
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,200
house in Disneyland for many years.

701
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,040
You go meet Aunt Jemima. Yes.

702
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,280
Yeah. I guess that's more of a hype.

703
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,080
I don't. Hmm. Was there a real Aunt Jemima? Not sure.

704
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,320
I don't know. We have to look that up.

705
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,080
But that's but that's still more of a spokesperson, I guess.

706
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,640
Yeah. And they were getting probably money from the syrup company.

707
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,880
For that, I assume.

708
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,440
Oh, yeah. John May.

709
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,800
Yes. Why am I going to put an ad for John May in my park?

710
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,520
Right. There's not a John May walk around character, the butterfly man.

711
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,280
I don't think unless he was proposing that, but I didn't come upon

712
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,120
come upon that in the research.

713
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,720
I don't think so.

714
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,600
So he yeah.

715
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,120
So he said no.

716
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,520
He said no to that.

717
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,600
But while they were in Colorado Springs, Walt said, let's stop by

718
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,000
this place called Pike's Petrified Forest.

719
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,240
According to an article at the Disney Family Museum website,

720
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,320
this was one of only two petrified forests in the country

721
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,680
that had been taken over by the park service.

722
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,040
This was a private establishment.

723
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,280
Again, petrified rocks and fossil, all of that.

724
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,480
Now, mostly you can still see plenty of it in the country.

725
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,720
I've been to the petrified

726
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,520
Forest National Park, I think, in Arizona. Very beautiful.

727
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,080
So but Walt stopped by this private one end of the day,

728
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,920
pretty late in the day.

729
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,840
They were about to close.

730
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,600
My favorite detail of this story is Walt said he would be real quick.

731
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,560
And Lillian said, I'll wait in the car.

732
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Didn't even get out.

733
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,400
She didn't get out. Wow.

734
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,000
So the day of butterfly, dead butterfly and rock viewings

735
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
didn't wasn't thrilling. Lillian.

736
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,080
Well, I don't know if it was the exact same day, but definitely same trip.

737
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,040
Mm hmm.

738
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,480
This is honestly like

739
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,200
Lillian is like some of the podcasts that write significant others

740
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,080
in the sense of like, what are we doing? OK, do I have to?

741
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,240
What are you? You're making me listen to what Jim Hill and Lentesta podcast.

742
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,400
OK, I'm all right. I'm good.

743
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,840
That was kind of how mine felt when I said we were doing an episode about this.

744
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,400
OK, sure. What is it about that tree?

745
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,800
You know, the tree ever seen the tree in front of your land?

746
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,760
No. Why were you talking about the tree? OK.

747
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,960
All right, have fun.

748
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,240
I'll be in the car.

749
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,080
She's in the car.

750
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,280
She's in the car outside.

751
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,160
This is a quick. It's raining.

752
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,120
It's it's healing.

753
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,800
It's hailing. It was hailing.

754
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,680
And now what are those rocks?

755
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,200
Do we consider Hales rocks? Oh, no.

756
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,920
Hale is ice. It's ice.

757
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
But ice is rock.

758
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,360
I disagree. It's rocks from the sky.

759
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
OK, OK.

760
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,080
I'll allow it.

761
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,400
I'm just going to be contrarian about every item.

762
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,440
Hale does rock.

763
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,960
But that's a whole nother conversation.

764
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
But well, there's no disagreement about that.

765
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,080
Yeah. Hale rocks.

766
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,840
So I also I think we can all agree Spider-Man rocks.

767
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,160
Spider-Man does rock for sure.

768
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,320
So Walt took the tour.

769
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,840
Thirty five cents.

770
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,680
He was apparently gone a while.

771
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,800
This article says his brother Roy later recalled

772
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,920
he was gone quite a long time.

773
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,920
And when he came back, he knew she would be provoked with him.

774
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,160
It was near their anniversary.

775
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,240
So he said, honey, I bought you an anniversary present.

776
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,600
This in reference to the giant petrified tree.

777
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,040
Apparently, other accounts said that, like, you know,

778
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,280
Walt took this tour for thirty five cents.

779
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,240
They gave him like a real quick tour and Walt's like, I'd like to buy something.

780
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,840
And he said, well, the gift shop's over there.

781
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,320
It's like, no, I want something bigger.

782
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,080
I want that. Point it to this giant tree.

783
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,480
This is like a real living with Michael Jackson scenario.

784
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm sure we've referenced it before on the show where Michael was walking

785
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,600
through that store and just buying expensive things.

786
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,920
And Walt had a similar.

787
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,480
I have that. I have that.

788
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,120
Yeah, I want that. I have those.

789
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,960
I have that tree. I have that one.

790
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,800
I have one. Give me one of these.

791
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,680
And he bought this boy who gave him the tour.

792
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,120
I'd like to buy this boy. He owned that boy. Yeah.

793
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,600
So is his own.

794
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,320
I assume. Yeah, it's a similar thing of like a rich guy

795
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,560
getting off on buying something that's insane.

796
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,200
So he was just pointing to. Yeah. Yeah.

797
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,480
The boy who sold him the tree he bought.

798
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,680
And then when he passed, he was petrified and is used as Pinocchio in the ride.

799
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,920
I was going to say little man of Disneyland.

800
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,240
The small boy of Disneyland.

801
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,000
My boy can't just be a plastic little man.

802
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,200
Yeah, it's got to be real.

803
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,320
He he paid sixteen hundred and fifty dollars for this.

804
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,640
I just ran the inflation calculator in twenty nineteen dollars.

805
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680
That's fifteen thousand seven hundred and forty dollars and eight cents.

806
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,800
Still kind of a bargain for a million year old five ton rock.

807
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,600
Multi-million year old.

808
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,960
Well, and so I guess you said earlier, this is a private

809
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,560
park, not a national, but you probably couldn't buy a big tree from the national parks.

810
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,440
That's what enabled us to be here.

811
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,600
Trump is trying very hard, I think, to get legislation passed.

812
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,120
So you can just buy trees from national parks as pointed trees.

813
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,960
And they're your tree.

814
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,240
Is any of the am I wrong?

815
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,320
Is he not the click to declassifying national parks for you?

816
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,080
Because then if it's not to drill, you can drill.

817
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,560
And that sort of thing.

818
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,320
I read an article that they're like there's like a beautification for buildings

819
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,760
project now to which federal contract buildings

820
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,880
that are government buildings that are new and being built.

821
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,600
They're trying to push it more towards, you know, beautiful stuff.

822
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,520
Columns, big Roman columns, which is real, which is very flashy.

823
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,400
They're Trump.

824
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,320
Yeah, they're trying to beautify in that sense and get away from modernism, which is like

825
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,160
the first step in once you start controlling how buildings look like.

826
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,320
That's so all the national parks are going to look like the outside of the King Kong ride.

827
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,400
Yeah. Like Penn Station.

828
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,760
Yeah, it'll be more marble columns with that, like knock over very easily.

829
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,720
Yeah. If one tips, they all domino.

830
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,800
Yeah. Yeah. Just like the wall, that part of the wall.

831
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,400
Oh, that fell over on this cave.

832
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,640
Yeah, it was just plywood.

833
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,240
But soon we'll be all be able to like bid on petrified trees

834
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,680
that are millions of years old.

835
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,480
Me. Yeah.

836
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,800
I mean, so we'll just all be able to get it for sixteen hundred dollars in 2019 money.

837
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,400
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

838
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,040
And then that obviously like that'll appreciate in value.

839
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,640
So maybe it's a good investment for all of us to go out to that when the national parks

840
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,800
are privatized to go out and purchase them before they become oil refineries.

841
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,760
Somebody will show Kevin Garnett a big petrified tree and he'll become

842
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,520
convinced that it has luck and he needs it to win the championship.

843
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,200
Judd Hirsch when he comes out of retirement, the auction.

844
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,720
Yeah. Part of this tree apparently did mineralize into opal.

845
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Oh, wow.

846
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,480
The black opal, the black opal, black opal wall.

847
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,720
That's real black.

848
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,680
Hey, man, I'm building the Avengers E ticket.

849
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,800
I need this.

850
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,680
You got to let me take this.

851
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,920
Let me take the part of this tree.

852
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,520
Just let me take part of it over to the other gate.

853
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,880
Like just for a few years, man.

854
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,960
Is that Joe Rody? Yeah.

855
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,760
Joe Rody to JPEG.

856
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

857
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,640
And then he has to go to he has to take the little man tree over to like a tree

858
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,080
bank to like to get the I forget how that system worked.

859
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,200
Yeah. Or he took the ring.

860
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,160
Never mind. I don't remember.

861
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
He took it to like a.

862
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,840
That's what I'm doing. Yeah.

863
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,000
I don't know how I just hold it.

864
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,880
You can the way pawn shots work.

865
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,560
You can pawn something and they won't sell it for like

866
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,400
10 to 12 days or so.

867
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,280
And so you can come back and rebuy it back.

868
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,960
So it's essentially a loan.

869
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,000
The collateral being that object.

870
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,480
Well, yeah. And does he get you get the same amount of money?

871
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,000
What's that?

872
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,760
Like if you were to put it, give them the item, do they give you

873
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,240
the exact same amount of money back?

874
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
You probably have to pay some interest.

875
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,560
Right. That's like that's what I'm for them to do.

876
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,600
Yeah. So what can we could I pawn?

877
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,680
Like Oswald, Oswald statue.

878
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,560
An Oswald statue in this room.

879
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,440
Yeah. Adam West, Batman hot toy.

880
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,720
I'm assuming most valuable thing that's worth a couple hundred.

881
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,040
You know. Yeah.

882
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,920
So I could take that to a pawn shop and get 200 bucks right now.

883
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,080
And then I could come back and get it in a week if I needed it.

884
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,880
You could try putting it for like a hundred and come back.

885
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,560
Oh, I see. And fifty.

886
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,840
Right. It was new when I bought it.

887
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,520
So do we need to change the episode title from Walt's Petrified Trees

888
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
slash how pawn shops work? Yeah.

889
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,920
Slash an informational.

890
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
It's a very helpful.

891
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,600
By some cursed guitars.

892
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,960
So I don't know.

893
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,520
He bought this. Yeah, he bought this thing and he bought a bunch of he bought

894
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,960
one ton of little petrified stones.

895
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,960
And that's what he sold in the mineral hall until the mineral hall was no more.

896
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,440
So Walt really cashed in.

897
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,080
This is a real there will be blood.

898
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,440
I want that.

899
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,280
Why don't I own that?

900
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,080
And then he just and then he sold all these rocks that he got just in

901
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,880
like kind of a bulk deal from I.

902
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,760
According to some stories, it's like a 12 year old kid named Toby,

903
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,280
who he pointed to. I want to buy that.

904
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,720
OK, gave him the tour.

905
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,400
OK, maybe he didn't do the arrangement ultimately.

906
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,840
But Frederick of or Pike,

907
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,800
Pike's Petrified Forest, Mr.

908
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,480
Pike, I believe, made the final decision to sell.

909
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,040
OK, the rock.

910
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,920
And this has been I believe this property has been folded into the park service.

911
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And I believe Walt then ultimately found

912
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,040
brought Pike out to his house with the private bowling alley

913
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,000
and threw bowling balls at him until he bled out.

914
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,880
Well, he threw petrified wood at him.

915
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,360
I'll kill you with your own wood.

916
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,600
He had a bowling alley with pins made of petrified wood.

917
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,960
Yeah. And that's how you really got to get that ball.

918
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,320
Oh, and you really got to get some spin on that thing. Right.

919
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,360
I eat your gemstone.

920
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,720
I eat them up.

921
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,440
So, yeah, so Walt murdered this guy.

922
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Walt murdered Pike is what you should take out of this episode.

923
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,800
And now it's in the it's in the park.

924
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,720
It's in the park.

925
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,520
I believe, you know, there's a website called Disney History Institute.

926
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,120
And they were really like, you know, in the early days and to some extent now,

927
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,920
Walt really did see the park as part museum because you think about

928
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,520
Main Street has all the old Penny arcade games and the replicas of the old

929
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,160
vehicles and the train and stuff.

930
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,360
And yeah, there was a lot of minerals and recreations of stuff in Frontierland.

931
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,720
This feels very it feels very Knott's Berry Farm.

932
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,840
The way Knott's Berry Farm has like here's a real old locomotive or,

933
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,040
you know, this schoolhouse, this cabin we just we bought from somewhere.

934
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,840
And it's a real historic thing that's in the park.

935
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,240
I like it in that regard that it's like a tie to the early days,

936
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,400
you know, when it when it was there was this Americana feel to Disneyland.

937
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,040
Yes. And the person the Disney family touch and her being referenced on the plaque.

938
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,320
It reminds you of this era where this this was theirs.

939
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,960
You're like visiting this family's weird.

940
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,760
Yeah. They did.

941
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,400
With a lot of family inside.

942
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,120
What was the other inside joke?

943
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,280
Like, oh, it was too big for the mantle.

944
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,480
Oh, very wholesome humor.

945
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,800
Very wholesome humor.

946
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,560
Yeah, it was because it wasn't the original Penny arcade had some

947
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,040
like museum type elements to like there.

948
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,880
There was an element of the idea, as you're saying Disneyland, where it was like,

949
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,920
we want to preserve things and like people can learn.

950
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,440
And it's obviously not the case anymore.

951
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,400
They're not going to build anything that you'll learn anything from anymore.

952
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,920
But we're going to learn about the journey of water.

953
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,440
So that's true. You're right. You're right.

954
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,560
We'll learn about water.

955
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:45,320
We'll learn about rocket in a new adventure on a roller coaster.

956
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,760
We'll learn about classic rock.

957
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,440
We'll learn about classic rock.

958
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,000
Learned about rocks in the parks.

959
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,360
And the guardians will teach us about classic rock.

960
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
It's a good point.

961
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,000
The parks will be keeping rock and roll alive.

962
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,920
The only place potentially.

963
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,760
Uh huh. Pat Benatar.

964
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,160
Who was this?

965
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,760
So wait, I take that back.

966
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,880
It's we're still doing museum and learning.

967
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,840
Yeah, it's all educational.

968
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,640
Yeah, absolutely.

969
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,080
Uh, here's a little educational fact.

970
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,640
Also, I was thinking about we haven't talked much about Lily and Disney.

971
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,280
That's really in Disney was I didn't realize that she was a Waltz employee

972
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,800
when they met. She was an anchor at the studio.

973
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,480
I learned that from that to Funkland video.

974
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,480
Oh, the one that we're in, the one that we're in.

975
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah.

976
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,640
I gotcha.

977
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:42,280
Yeah, she made fifteen dollars a week and then met him and married him.

978
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,920
I don't know. But she like she worked on playing crazy.

979
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,200
The first Mickey.

980
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,880
Yeah, she like had her hands literally on that very historic piece of animation.

981
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,560
And then the big fact about her, this always says that Walt came to her

982
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,360
with a cartoon mouse and said, this is this is Mortimer Mouse.

983
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:02,880
Right.

984
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,520
And he said and she said, I don't know, that's not so friendly sounding.

985
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,080
Maybe that should be Mickey.

986
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,400
So she she named Mickey is the big. Right. Yeah.

987
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,560
People don't lie. Shut up.

988
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,280
You're wrong. You're wrong.

989
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,360
Just sobbing, just sobbing because he knows she's right.

990
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
And he took her idea and never thanked her for it.

991
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,880
He ever mentioned it.

992
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,000
He begged some of his male friends to like, you just like come up with a name.

993
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,720
And one of them happened to throw out Mickey to and then, OK, there.

994
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,320
All right. Now that he really nudged him toward Mickey.

995
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,120
Yeah. Yeah.

996
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,200
Maybe like we kind of end with a Y because it's like what about Nick?

997
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,360
And he's like, no, no, no. What about if it was an M?

998
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,120
And what do you mean? Like Mick? No. But with a Y on it, Mickey.

999
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,240
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Bob, for coming up with the name.

1000
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,360
Monkey Mouse. No, no, no, no.

1001
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,400
By the way, monkey mouse is funny.

1002
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,200
You should make a character called Monkey Mouse.

1003
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,520
I like that a lot. That would be the worst.

1004
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,360
There'd be a real fail of a wheel of fortune.

1005
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,840
Oh, you have the M and the Y

1006
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,280
and the K, you have the M, the K and the Y and all of mouse.

1007
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,960
Moxie Mouse.

1008
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,160
Monkey Mouse.

1009
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,680
Monkey Mouse. It's Monkey Mouse.

1010
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,680
I honestly I think you should you should start developing your

1011
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,560
cartoon monkey mouse right now.

1012
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,520
Is he more monkey or more mouse?

1013
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,120
Very equal parts. I think he's half and half.

1014
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,160
Yeah. Half and half.

1015
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,880
Horrifying.

1016
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,720
I think he was just in my mind, he was just a mouse with a funny name.

1017
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
Oh, that's one approach.

1018
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,880
Or he could be a gorilla,

1019
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,040
a gorilla sized being who is mouse like features

1020
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,240
or a mouse sized creature is gorilla like features.

1021
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,560
Either a gorilla raised by a by a mouse or a mouse raised by a gorilla.

1022
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,800
That's cleaner and less irreverent.

1023
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,560
It's kind of like a jungle book, really. Yeah. Right.

1024
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,440
So like you think that it's a little mouse that thinks he's big and strine

1025
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,680
can like, you know, scream.

1026
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,280
That's good. We've talked a lot about trying to, you know, buy IP

1027
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,560
like Marvel McFay to start our own theme park.

1028
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,680
But maybe it's time we just keep we start coming up with characters.

1029
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,040
Maybe Monkey Mouse is the anchor for the new park.

1030
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,280
Yeah. Monkey Mouse seems like a winner.

1031
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,520
The new PTR park.

1032
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,440
It sounds instantly familiar.

1033
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,800
It's partially because it has a lot of the same letters as Mickey Mouse. Right.

1034
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,040
It's very similar.

1035
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,520
And there are two words we know.

1036
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,120
It sounds like something where like a child mispronounces Mickey Mouse

1037
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,080
and says monkey mouse and then the family that that's the family joke for forever.

1038
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,960
They never stop. They never stop talking.

1039
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,320
Yes. I know if I had said monkey mouse, yeah.

1040
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,840
My mom would never never hit the end of it. Yeah.

1041
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,880
The parents end up getting like four stories in 18 years of child rearing.

1042
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,880
And then you just cycle around over and over.

1043
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,760
They have a set list like a rock band.

1044
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,280
You got to play the hits.

1045
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,760
And especially if they're around like your wife or girlfriend,

1046
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,640
you know, they do the same stories over and over again.

1047
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,040
Family Christmas is the same story.

1048
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,440
I understand. But telling other people the same story,

1049
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,520
do you not get embarrassed by that?

1050
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,480
No, when you meet new people, they then get to hear the hits.

1051
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,600
Yeah. Well, that's yeah.

1052
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,920
You need to have like a set that because for a lot of people, it is the first time.

1053
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,560
Yeah. Even though if you're like the tour manager, you're always with them

1054
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,200
as we are as our parents, children.

1055
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,760
Can we each go around and do one of the greatest hits that our moms tell?

1056
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,400
I'll do I would do mine first.

1057
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,920
Yeah. When my mother was pregnant with my sister,

1058
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,840
she said that, you know, you're going to have like a little baby sister or brother.

1059
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,160
And I said, I don't want that.

1060
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,720
I want an older brother who paints.

1061
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haές

1062
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,320
Yeah, I wanted a painter.

1063
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,760
You have features.

1064
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,600
You had you had a design and you had features.

1065
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,520
You wanted like you were buying a car. Yeah, that's true.

1066
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,000
Older brother who paints.

1067
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,480
That is what she tells.

1068
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,280
All right. This kid idea. Sure. Got it.

1069
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,280
But I have some requests.

1070
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,320
I think I said like, no, no.

1071
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,280
Like I refuse the idea of a younger sibling.

1072
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
Do you still want an older brother who paints?

1073
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
It'd be awesome.

1074
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,320
He was like a cool painter.

1075
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,960
Like I think I was also imagining like a traditional like a beret wearing

1076
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,360
Renaissance painter.

1077
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,000
This guy might be dead, though.

1078
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,320
He might be like, what is the guy gets?

1079
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,840
They who do that?

1080
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,160
What kills the characters in Moulin Rouge?

1081
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,960
It may be dead of some mostly defunct disease.

1082
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,520
Consumption. Yeah. Yeah.

1083
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,720
Michael, I am dying of consumption.

1084
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,200
I want you to have my son accused CDs and my box of condoms

1085
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,920
because I'm a cool older brother.

1086
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,640
My little brother, the only joy in my life.

1087
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,520
I like the idea that he's also like 40 years older than me.

1088
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,880
He's not even like 10.

1089
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,080
He's like 10 years older.

1090
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,040
He looks like Picasso. Yes.

1091
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,240
Yeah. The year is gone.

1092
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,160
The year is gone. Yeah.

1093
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,320
He's a heroin addict.

1094
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,400
I like this brother.

1095
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,480
Yeah, I want an older brother with a drug addiction who can paint.

1096
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,680
It's got you need to.

1097
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,360
Mike, Mike, you need to.

1098
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,120
You're confused.

1099
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,000
Older brother.

1100
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,280
You need to get me the absence.

1101
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,800
You need to get me the sugar cube and the little spoon.

1102
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,960
Six. I don't get my bottle.

1103
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
I'm very young.

1104
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,760
Light the flame, please.

1105
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,680
My hands, they don't work from all the painting to see the green fairy.

1106
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,680
One last time.

1107
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,360
Scott, I don't think I can top that.

1108
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:49,080
The one that I jumped to was when I was really I was a real pain about doing chores.

1109
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,000
And there was just one.

1110
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I was always mad because my dad always wanted to do yard work when the Nicktoons were on

1111
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,600
the like holy block of Rugrats, Doug and Ren and Stimpy.

1112
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,160
Right. And there was a lot of leaves that need to be cleaned.

1113
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,000
And I think I snapped one day and said, I'm not your slave.

1114
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,160
Oh, my God. Classic.

1115
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,200
That's a classic.

1116
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,000
I hear that, like, you know, once every couple of months, then when that one comes back,

1117
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,720
a lot. Right.

1118
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,000
But maybe rightfully so.

1119
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,240
That's pretty that's pretty good.

1120
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,640
Jason. Well, they're really short one.

1121
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,920
My I was short when I have a more complicated one.

1122
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,800
But the short one is that my bro when they brought my baby brother home

1123
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,720
after a little bit of time, like family was visiting or something.

1124
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,520
They're like, how do you like having a baby brother?

1125
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,520
And I responded, he's such a fussy baby.

1126
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,960
Clearly just repeating something I had heard in the house.

1127
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,760
Like one of my parents said that and I was just echoing.

1128
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,880
Now, the real story that gets told a lot

1129
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,360
is my mom and dad went out of town for like a weekend trip.

1130
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,000
And my grandmother was watching us and she was making breakfast for us

1131
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,240
one Sunday morning and she was frying eggs.

1132
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,000
And she leaned over the burner

1133
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,920
and lit her bathrobe on fire.

1134
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,040
Just like a small patch, like right,

1135
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,960
you know, on her like stomach chest kind of area

1136
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,200
about the size of like an apple, I would say.

1137
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,080
Like and she turns around and she's screaming,

1138
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,080
I mean, my brother is screaming and she gets a towel and gets it out real quick.

1139
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,480
And we're just like, whoa, whoa.

1140
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,960
Like we're all just so freaked out.

1141
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,360
And her immediate response is to come over to us and go like,

1142
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,760
don't ever tell your mother about us.

1143
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,800
Don't ever tell your mother about this.

1144
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,480
Don't ever tell your mother about this.

1145
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,320
She'll never let me see you again if that happens.

1146
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,800
To two horrifying things a week or two later,

1147
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,360
where my whole my mom and dad and my brother and me are sitting around

1148
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:01,880
watching TV and somehow it comes up, you know, that my you know,

1149
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,440
you know, no, no, no, no, no.

1150
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,480
Here's how it came out.

1151
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,080
One of my parents said, like, oh, yeah, that was nice of your mom

1152
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,120
to watch the kids last weekend.

1153
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,640
Like, yeah, we were worried she was going to burn the house down.

1154
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,240
And my brother and I just look at each other and just start wailing,

1155
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,840
just start sobbing and just go like,

1156
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,480
my mom lit a robe on fire.

1157
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,760
And she said not to tell you because then you would let us see her again.

1158
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,040
And my parents were just like, God, damn it.

1159
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,280
What the hell?

1160
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,120
What? Oh, it's fine.

1161
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,400
It's OK.

1162
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,000
Like they were just like so annoyed.

1163
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's like, why would she tell you the like?

1164
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,840
They were like, OK, thank you for telling us.

1165
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,440
Yeah, please tell us.

1166
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,640
Tell your parents these things. Whoa.

1167
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,920
Wow. Long story short, you never saw it.

1168
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,600
Thanks for telling us.

1169
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,920
Now we know to excise grandma from your life.

1170
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,440
Wow.

1171
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,960
Wow. Wow.

1172
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,880
And she made it so much worse with that.

1173
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,120
She made it so much worse.

1174
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,040
But also, like, I do have to admire her self-preservation

1175
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,600
because like the the robe was still warm and like it left a hole.

1176
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,640
Like it left a hole.

1177
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,000
It's probably just polyester.

1178
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,680
It's probably like went right up.

1179
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,280
What happened to Mrs. Doubtfire?

1180
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,800
Yeah, basically very similar doubt fire and put out as quickly.

1181
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,080
But like we were real young, like I might have been first grade

1182
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,240
at my brother's a couple.

1183
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,560
He might have been in preschool or something.

1184
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:40,960
So like you don't you don't try to make an arrangement with kids that young.

1185
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,240
And I don't think you should ever say like to children,

1186
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,360
like, don't ever tell anyone about like that's how many horrific books

1187
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,880
and movies start with.

1188
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,120
And then an adult told the child, don't tell anyone about this.

1189
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,600
Well, this is I sincerely hope your grandma was sent to jail.

1190
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,240
Well, she used to be when we were very young, she was kind of like

1191
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,360
I we always thought of our grandfather's happy go lucky.

1192
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,120
And like she was kind of the strict one.

1193
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,640
But then she really mellowed out with with age and she was a lot more

1194
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,760
like goofy grandma.

1195
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,880
But that was still during like her strict period.

1196
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,200
But I don't know why we were pretty easygoing children.

1197
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,200
She transformed.

1198
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:30,440
She sort of changed her essence much like a tree petrifying.

1199
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,640
It's like a tree petrifying,

1200
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,040
petrifying, calming, sturdy rock.

1201
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,200
That was a good.

1202
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,840
Yeah, that was seamless.

1203
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,400
Say all that.

1204
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,520
Yes, I think it was a seamless process, much like a tree being petrified,

1205
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,640
being mineralized, mineralized, mineralized, becoming the minerals,

1206
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,840
not just imprinting on minerals.

1207
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah. Well, do we do it?

1208
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Is that the answer by walls petrified trees?

1209
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,080
I think that's how we all thought it would go.

1210
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,000
So, yeah, yeah.

1211
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,080
So go next time you're at Disneyland, go check it out.

1212
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,520
And I have to check it out.

1213
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,440
Yeah, you might do it for the first time.

1214
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,440
I sincerely think you will do you will do a very hearty

1215
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,000
and listeners go check it out and think about Jason's grandma

1216
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,200
lighting herself on fire and it's got you.

1217
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,000
Don't tell anyone.

1218
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,600
But don't you don't tell those people about never

1219
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,440
be allowed to listen to the podcast again.

1220
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,960
If you tell the main feed people, don't don't tell.

1221
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,440
This is for only the lucky few who are paying for this content.

1222
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,640
Pay to keep Jason's family secrets.

1223
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,120
We promised to reveal one shared and family secret each.

1224
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,840
Don't promise that.

1225
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:49,720
As we do one of them, that's part of the part of the gifts you get with this.

1226
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,840
Don't tweet about it.

1227
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,240
Don't leave the secret in an iTunes review from OK.

1228
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Here's what you're going to do. Tweet it, Jason.

1229
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,280
Your secret is safe with me.

1230
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,960
Oh, good. Oh, good.

That's good. Intriguing advertisement for the second gate.

1233
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,040
Yes, you're right.

1234
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,320
There's secrets being told.

1235
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,800
Now I can get. There we go.

1236
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
I never missed a chance to.

1237
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,160
What's the best way to make it intriguing?

1238
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,720
Is it like see like per the Patreon?

1239

You are advertising for us.

1245
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,040
Be do you want to be a podcast, the right influencer?

1246
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,560
We don't have the money of the Michael Bloomberg campaign.

1247
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,280
Well, by the time this comes out, he may have won this.

1248
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,320
He may be the nominee.

1249
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,960
Rightfully so.

1250
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,400
I mean, that's the way it should go.

1251
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,920
That's what America chose.

1252
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,120
And you can't argue with that.

1253
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,200
Well, I guess you survived the podcast, the ride to the second gate stump edition.

1254
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,600
Yeah. Remind Jason, your secret is safe with you.

1255
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,400
And yes, more secrets to come behind the second gate.

1256
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,800
That'll be a permanent fixture from now on.

1257
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,560
Yep. Yeah.

1258
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,000
Well, we'll do another one soon because we have to.

1259
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,480
Yep. Bye bye.
