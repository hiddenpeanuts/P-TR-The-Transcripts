Warning, the following podcast may include heated advocacy for Disney workers and country bears,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,760
a cacophony of loud scissors, plus my fascination with a dirty animatronic foot.

It's Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln on Podcast the Ride.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast where we're confident we could do a tidy five-hour episode

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,480
about the outlet mall on the way to Disneyland, the Citadel. I'm Scott Gardner joined by fellow

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,280
Citadel heads, I assume, Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,880
Hi, yeah, I haven't really explored many of California's great outlet malls. I guess I hate

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,280
one coming back from Palm Springs. Oh, that one. Yeah, yeah. Well, I find outlet malls to be sort

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
of generally unpleasant, though I'm like a mall connoisseur in general. I feel like the outlet

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,360
malls are, you know, but as the name implies, less decorated, less of a fun, casual experience and

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,440
more just a, you know, a cattle call for bargains. Sure. They're fortresses. Yes. I find often.

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,520
I, by the way, am like Carlson. And I'm like Carlson. Fortresses, the one that you're talking

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,760
about, the one on the way to Palm Springs and the one at the Citadel, it's like they're impenetrable.

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,600
It's hard. You got to drive like for 15 minutes into the parking lot. It takes forever to park.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,240
It's like a madhouse in there. And then once you actually get to the like mall part, you have to

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,120
like wind this labyrinth. Like it's crazy. Like it's more unpleasant than a normal mall. I feel

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,560
though. Palm Springs one when I was there was also being redone. So it looked like kind of an open

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,000
air prison. There was like a chain link fence everywhere, but like in confusing spots. Yes,

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,960
they are prisons. I think I went to the, I went to the Citadel once. So this is really going to be

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,240
fascinating to people that don't live in Los Angeles. Oh wait. So the Citadel, if you're

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,920
driving down the five from the Los Angeles area where we all live, you will on the right before

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,560
you get in Orange County, you'll pass by this big castle type thing called the Citadel. And it's,

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,280
to me, it looks like a, it looks like a Mario castle from the outside. That's what I always

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,560
cool. Yeah. Yes. But only the outside because then you go in there and that is a facade. There is no

26
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,200
continued cool castle theming. There's no medieval times type arena show. The food court doesn't have

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,280
medieval pun names. It's just, it's very dull. And especially at Christmas time, the exterior,

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,080
there's a giant present. And let me ask you this question. Does that present make you uncomfortable

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,360
because it's such a large present? Oh, and I've since, I've recently revealed my, my issue with

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,000
giant things, especially giant versions of miniature things. No, I think, I think seeing a big bow on

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,360
the, the big Citadel box is a lot of fun. It gets me in the holiday spirit and it's outside.

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah. Right. Right. No one's forcing me to be in a enclosed space with it. So, but thanks for your concern.

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,600
Okay. Just wondering. Yeah. Cause there's, it is, it is like that, especially on Christmas time,

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,840
it's so bright, it's distracting. There's a giant present. There's these screens that are like,

35
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
it should be illegal to have a screen that bright next to a freeway. Cause like people would be

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,640
distracted the whole time. Yeah. I'll advertising like local DJs and like, uh, you know, like, uh,

37
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,720
Pasadena presentations of Aladdin or whatever. I feel like I saw ads for that on the Citadel.

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,320
Off-brand e-cigarettes. I went to that Pasadena Aladdin show. Yeah. Yeah. You're talking about,

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,000
uh, uh, um, starring a Bruce Velaunch, uh, Richard Karn and Ben Verene.

40
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Uh, all three legit, uh, royalty. That's not, that ain't bad. And they put all these,

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
like, it was not a Disney show, but they put in all these like Disney references just cause they

42
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,000
knew people like the only idiots now know the Aladdin version of Disney from Disney. So they

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
added like a bunch of Disney jokes into it. And they had Ben Verene say like some lion king joke

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,520
and he called Mufasa Mufafa. That's one of my favorite memories from the show. Cause all this,

45
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,160
like there was, they were talking about that's not like missing the, the, the name,

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,400
saying it incorrectly. Maybe. I don't know. Okay. I'm not exactly sure. Uh, it's because look,

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,640
these, uh, shows they do in Pasadena at this playhouse, uh, lightly rehearsed, I would say,

48
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,120
these aren't like, these aren't Broadway style. Sure. Seeing Ben Verene on Broadway 20 years ago,

49
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,160
he was like on top of it. This is like, he kind of glanced at the script before he went out there

50
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
and he just kind of dances around and he's so talented. He can make it work. He knows it'll

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,200
get a cheer just by, by going out there. Yes. Um, you wait your Citadel story though. Let's, let's

52
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,480
keep track of our, sorry, sorry, sorry. People very upset when we tangent, um, our tangents about

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,520
local Los Angeles things, which by the way, that bothers, I feel like a large contingent of our

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,960
audiences in Los Angeles, or at least fascinated by it. But if you're, if you're bothered, but we

55
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,880
don't ever give enough context, please let us know. Hashtag no more LA. I mean, if you're

56
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,360
listening to any comedy podcasts and you're like too much, too much tangent, too much LA talk,

57
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,000
I would encourage you to look at, uh, any comedy podcast and you will see the same.

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
Yeah. Well, and we're going to balance it out with an equal amount of Orlando

59
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,360
local mundanity. We'll always make sure. And, uh, uh, and France Martin, Levaly and, uh,

60
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
Schomburg, Illinois and the wonderful Woodfield mall and all the different things I grew up with.

61
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm really looking forward to the eventual Schomburg mall episode. I have it. I it's,

62
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,400
it's amazing how many odd things we found that were there and I'm excited,

63
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,800
but, but here let's close out the Citadel first. Yeah. The Citadel, I mean, the Citadel, look,

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,440
uh, an unspectacular story. I went to the Citadel. I think it was, uh, like Christmas Eve

65
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,840
for after like the day after Christmas. I can't remember. Uh, I was driving back up and I went,

66
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,240
you know what? I'm going to stop at the Citadel. It's Christmas time outside. It's so lovely.

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,320
There's a big present. Uh, and I know there's a Disney store there and a Disney outlet store.

68
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,200
So I stopped. It took me what I said, 15 minutes to park 20, like just crazy, like people stalking

69
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,000
spots. There's not enough spots. Well, after Christmas sales, you know, but I think, yeah,

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
I guess you're right. I guess it's my fault for going there. Um, and then you go in the Disney

71
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,200
outlet store, which is not dissimilar to just a Disney store and everything is like $2 off.

72
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,440
And it's, there's nothing, cause I was like, wow, there's going to be deals. There's going to be

73
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,280
everything I want. There's going to be theme park merchandise. Cause we're so close to Anaheim.

74
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,360
Right. It is not the case. It is just a, a mater shirt for a little child. It is a, you know, how

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,640
dare they Rapunzel doll. It's all the stuff, the normal stuff you would get in a Disney store.

76
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,320
Well, cause in Anna, uh, cause in Orlando there are Disney outlets specifically for park merchandise,

77
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,360
which I think there used to be out here and then it moved and then it closed. And,

78
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,400
and so I never made it. So I stupidly thought that there must be some merchandise here cause

79
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,400
we're so close to Anaheim and no, of course not. There's no America sings shirt. There's no

80
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,760
old America sings animatronic in here. This is just a Disney store. That's slightly discounted.

81
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,680
Yeah. I'm an idiot. The sizes are slightly misprinted. Right. When we went up to

82
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,000
WrestleMania, WrestleMania 31 in San Jose, we were, we pulled into a shopping mall

83
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
or a strip mall and there was a Disney outlet there too. And we got very excited and it was

84
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,760
the same deal. It was not, it was nothing, nothing special as well. I'm saying.

85
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,320
spectacular. Hey, stick, stick to J crew factory. That's what I like at outlet malls.

86
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,640
I've had a lot of good luck at J crew factory. I think the shorts I'm wearing right now are from

87
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,400
there. Let me take a photo though so we can post on Twitter of your J crew shorts.

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,320
This is one of the first warm days we've had. It's going to hit 85 here in Southern California

89
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,440
today. This shot of Jason's bare legs is going to tear up the Twitter. Like the pirate, uh,

90
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,960
on pirates of the Caribbean dangling his leg over the bridge. This is going to be just as iconic.

91
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,360
That is weird that you're just under, under bare feet.

92
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,000
That's one of the most memorable things I feel like about that ride is that foot.

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,280
We'll, we'll get into this. I don't think I've really thought about the foot. What's a lot of

94
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,240
people have shared that with me privately that they remember the foot on pirates of the Caribbean.

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,200
Does that foot have a wiki feet page? Is that, I don't know. What is that website? I don't know.

96
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
I know what you're talking about, but I haven't explored it. And I assume you have explored a

97
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
little more of the foot fetishes on the internet. It's not really, uh, just intellectually, but it's

98
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,480
not really my, uh, bag. But you're interested in all the fetishes. You're a little more curious

99
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,080
than Scott and I. I'm curious about how people engage with that sort of thing. You know what I

100
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:24,240
know about wiki feet is that the, uh, whereas like, you know, there's not a lot of like nude

101
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,800
scenes out there to choose from for your Mr. Skin kind of websites, but wiki feet, if there's an

102
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,680
actress who has a TV credit, anyone we know, probably anyone who's been on the show, they are

103
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,280
on wiki feet. If you've ever been on television or in a movie wiki feed is, they're just more,

104
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,160
what's the word? They're more, they're in depth. They like, they, they catalog everything, right?

105
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,200
But you, we all might be, you will be as soon as that picture goes live. Is it equal male and female

106
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
feet? Do we know? What do you think? Yeah. Well, no, of course it wouldn't be, but as Scott said,

107
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
we could be on there. So I thought maybe it is an equal opportunity because Mr. Skin has a different,

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,040
I've heard, I've heard is that there's a male version of it now too. Oh, really? That, that

109
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,280
does like, you know, the, for hunks, the fame, yeah. Harvey Keitel scene, the Kevin Bacon scene,

110
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,080
you know, all the famous dick scenes. Uh-huh. Burt Reynolds, but he's naked in like a centerfold

111
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,120
type setting, not a, not in a film, though he might be in a film as well. But the foot, yeah,

112
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,080
the foot thing, the foot fetish, I feel like this is another tangent real quick, is so prevalent

113
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,840
that we must have friends that have it, but I don't have it. I don't get it at all. Yeah,

114
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,960
that's probably true. And I'm not covering it all for my deep, dark secret. I swear.

115
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,960
Somebody's got, because you may have it. I don't want to out you guys unless you want to say it,

116
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,400
but anyway. Um, I do not, and about it though, I am on WikiFeet currently and I've just looked

117
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:59,040
up the word pirate and uh, there are no results. Oh boy. Jason, do you, do you also, isn't that foot

118
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,760
memorable? Am I really? I think so. Well, like, cause they made it, they painted it to look very

119
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,200
dirty, right? It's a dirty foot. It's a dirty foot. And that dirty foot is one of the most memorable

120
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,400
things to me about Pirates of the Rhine and Disney. My mom brings it up too. You're speaking in code

121
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,680
though. Now you, this, you're, this sounds like a foot fetish. It's not. It's just memorable. It's

122
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,040
distinct. This is actually Illuminati. He speaks, the code is Illuminati. Oh, okay. It's not a sex

123
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,880
thing. It's not a sex thing. It's a deep, cause if you're, if you get into the Illuminati, it's a

124
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,560
secret foot shake. Yes. Yeah. A dirty foot shake. You have to have the right amount of foot stain.

125
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,800
My mom would always talk about the foot. She would be like, Oh, isn't it cool? The foot is over. Like

126
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,120
what's there to say about the foot when people have discussed the foot with you privately?

127
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,080
What's the, what's the discussion? People always say, we'll just, I mean, it's a quick discussion.

128
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,000
We don't get into it too much of like, what would it be like to touch the foot or what it'd be like

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
there, but everyone's talking about, you know, like it's, it's cool having that foot hanging there

130
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,840
and their memory of it is very specific. Cause sometimes you miss stuff on the ride, but it seems

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,120
like almost everybody knows that and fixates on it a little bit. And it's a very like, I don't know.

132
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,080
I guess it looks real. I guess it looks real. And some of the other stuff, like, you know,

133
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,880
the chasing around doesn't look so real cause it's on a track. And maybe, yeah, yeah, sure. And like,

134
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,960
you know, the Lincoln who we're talking about today, we don't know what his feet look like.

135
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,560
I was an early animatronic and it didn't get too much into the details. So it got a couple of years

136
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,640
down the line and they are confident enough in their animatronic making abilities to have a

137
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,240
realistic dirty foot. Right. Right. Yeah. I do think we do know, I mean, historically in that

138
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,920
Doris Kearns Goodwin book, she does refer to Lincoln as one sick fuck. So like he may have been

139
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:52,160
in two feet. Yeah. I don't know if that affected the Imagineers when they were building the robot

140
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,080
statistically speaking, several of the presidents have to have been in defeat. Oh yeah. And we don't

141
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,080
know who necessarily, but we can all guess. I think. Did anyone show their cards in any way?

142
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:14,080
There, you know, I, this is pretty tangential, but the, who was it? There was a guy who worked

143
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,400
for Reagan, who banned the beach boys, America's band from performing their fourth of July

144
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,840
concerts in the Washington mall appropriate for a fourth of July episode. And he said something

145
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,560
about how they, they, they bring the wrong elements. The eighties beach boys bring that,

146
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,440
that seedy rock and roll elements to the Washington mall that we don't want. And they replaced him

147
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,120
with Wayne Newton instead. And this was so unpopular. I forget the guy's name that the beach

148
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,840
boys came to Washington on Reagan's invite and the guy had to, was given a, the secretary of the

149
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,640
interior, whatever was given a giant foot because he put his foot in his mouth. He was given like a

150
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,840
foot in your mouth award, perhaps by Reagan himself. So if that foot in the mouth given to James,

151
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:10,080
whatever Reagan's underling, maybe he just had a lot of cast iron feet hanging around the white

152
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,600
house. So that's, that was a long winded way of saying, I think Reagan was a foot in me. Yeah.

153
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,920
I think we're, I think we can declare officially here. Reagan was a foot guy. We have all the

154
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,160
proof we need. Anybody else we think was a secret foot fetishist? I'm still processing someone going

155
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,840
like beach boys, no, Wayne Newton. Yes. Cause this many years later, it's just like, I'm sure if you

156
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,880
told people that they would just go like that's both old music. Yeah. That's both stuff. My parents

157
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:48,320
like it's a lateral move. But, you know, the beach boys have guitars and there's girls in bikini tops

158
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,760
who come to dance to the surf music. Whereas Wayne Newton is just kind of swinging and quiet. And it's,

159
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,680
it's a more composed horniness. I guess you get with Wayne Newton. It's a subtext. Also had no

160
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,320
involvement with the Manson family, Wayne Newton. Not as far as I know, but you have to imagine some,

161
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,080
some mob ties to be that much of a fixture. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. For sure. I found a completely

162
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,720
unsourced Yahoo answers, answer to how many people have a foot fetish. They claim it's from a,

163
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,320
the Kinsey study done in the seventies. 15% of Americans have a foot or related fetish. Pretty

164
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:38,960
high. So if you then forgive me while I pull up my calculator, 45 presidents times 0.15 and that

165
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,920
gives us 6.75. So somewhere between six and seven. Reagan we know with certainty, but there have to

166
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,400
have been six other presidents who were foot fetishists. Grant. I say Grant. Sure. I don't

167
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:58,080
know why. I just have a feeling. That's a good one. He probably saw some feet get lost during

168
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,880
the civil war. Yes. He probably saw a lot of stray feet lying around. I bet he did.

169
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,200
Was he disturbed by it and the, but the fetish was a way to process it.

170
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Anyway, we just want to wish everyone a happy 4th of July.

171
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,720
To sit with your loved ones and tell tales of severed feet. And let us know who you think

172
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,760
of the presidents was a foot man. Was a foot man. I feel like we would. Against my better judgment,

173
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm going to say tweet at us. What's president you think had a fondness for the feats. We got so many

174
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,320
more tweets today than any other day. We have blocked everyone who tweeted at us.

175
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,880
Somebody will have like read a biography and it had to be in there. Like this probably for a few

176
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,800
of them is documented. So yeah, we'll hear. We'll find out. I feel like an obvious answer might be

177
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,320
Clinton because he was an old perv, but I think we'd know the foot thing because we're pretty

178
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,440
aware of his fetishes or specific interests. I think the foot fetish is too innocent for

179
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,760
Bill Clinton. Well, what do we think about Abraham Lincoln? Let's cover that first of all. I don't

180
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,520
know. He seems like a very staid. I don't see a lot of sexuality in Abraham Lincoln. There's been so

181
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,720
many like books or like was Lincoln gay was there like, but I don't know that anyone. Oh, right.

182
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,240
Yeah, anyone has some definitive like a thing and to just just say it for the record, we're talking

183
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,120
about great moments with Mr. Lincoln today. Yes. There's nothing about his sex sexuality on that

184
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,720
ride. No, but like the pirates ride, probably the only one of the few rides with a dirty foot in it.

185
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,040
This as I was watching a couple of different versions, I was like, is this the only Disney

186
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,640
ride that openly mentions suicide because they quote that Lyceum speech of Lincoln's where he

187
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,840
says like die by suicide. Like that's the only way America would go down by suicide. Yeah, by suicide

188
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,520
voice rattling in my head last few days. Sounds like a boss. Nass

189
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,240
he's shaking his head around while he talks this prequel. There should be great character

190
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,160
boss Nass. Great moments with boss Nass in Star Wars land where he talks about like the now, but

191
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,680
the are yeah. Yeah. The I was going to say now V or Naboo, the Gungan war.

192
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, it's such a tizzy. If Disney can get an animatronic to shake their gels

193
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,640
accurately, let's get that boss Nass attraction. I think you just like use the kind of the Ursula

194
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,040
like body and then you just change your head and make some water effects where

195
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,840
he shoots water at the people. Well, they can mimic someone tweeted at us that we did not talk

196
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,400
about on the Little Mermaid episode. We didn't mention earlier this year when Ursula's head fell

197
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,920
off. Yes. The one park. Yeah. But that looks that kind of swung around a lot. If they could

198
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,800
program an animatronic to have the motions of that dangling head, I think you'd get something

199
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,160
closer to like a boss Nass. Well, we'll start working on it, guys, guys and girls.

200
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,680
People demand the gel shake the immortalized. You know, you mentioned suicide being mentioned

201
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,080
in this attraction. And I found on a similar note, I read an interview with the Imagineer Mark Davis,

202
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,880
who was one of the primary imagineers who worked on all these early attractions and the World's

203
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,200
Fair stuff. And he, you know, the great moments with Mr. Lincoln was made for the 1964 World's

204
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,280
Fair, as was the carousel of progress as was It's a Small World and as was the primeval world and

205
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,120
Magic Skyway, which is now the dinosaur tunnel at Disneyland. So they're doing four attractions for

206
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,360
the World's Fair. This is a magazine, the E ticket asked Mark Davis was of the four attractions for

207
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,200
the World's Fair was great moments of Mr. Lincoln, the most complex. Mark Davis said, well, it was

208
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,680
the one where we quote, sweated blood. You know, Walt, Walt was about ready to cut his own throat

209
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,680
and we were ready to jump off the bridge with him. Wow. So suicide was heavy in everyone's minds,

210
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:22,240
creating this attraction. I read was that they had Walt Disney famously loved Abraham Lincoln

211
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,880
and they had Robert Moses, like a longtime New York political fixture. I was reading about the

212
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,160
parks commissioner, the parks commissioner, but he also like held like simultaneously helped like a

213
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,840
dozen different titles, but was always appointed, never elected, but was insanely powerful. Anyway,

214
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,120
he was given like Disney gave him a tour of the stuff they were working on because Moses wanted

215
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,440
him to, you know, was interested in getting Disney involved in the World's Fair. And the very last

216
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,400
thing they showed him was like a prototype of early prototype of the Abraham Lincoln animatronic.

217
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,240
He's like, yes, that's great. There's an Ellen. It'll be in the Illinois Pavilion and, uh, uh,

218
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,160
that was nowhere near ready. And the, but he promised like, well have it done. So like,

219
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm sure the pressure of that and also the pressure of trying to recreate, uh, what of

220
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,200
America's most beloved political figures was probably like, yeah, I could see you sweating

221
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:27,040
some blood. He was like, I mean, that's, I feel like that is a thing that most maniac innovators

222
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,920
are like where it's like, do this now. I don't care if it's not ready. You figure it out and

223
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,760
we'll all be the most stressed up until somebody figures out. Oh yeah. Jobs was famous for that

224
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,040
sort of shit. I read the nicer Steve jobs biography and he still comes out looking like a lunatic.

225
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,720
Yeah. But we are same with Walt where he would just demand something and then like

226
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,840
keep checking in on it and they'd be like, it's impossible. And you'd be like, it's not impossible.

227
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,800
And then they wouldn't be like, that's the thing also with maniacs is they are often proven right

228
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,800
because then it's not impossible. They got it. They fixed it. They did it. It had to be pushed

229
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,520
harder and it's where you do it. You have a lot of respect for like what you're seeing in the

230
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,880
presidency right now is this syndrome, but all of the people carrying it out are not good.

231
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,000
What they're doing incompetent, but it's the syndrome that typically works with, well,

232
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,280
thank God the guy's surrounded by geniuses. In the case of Walt Disney, yeah, he, these people,

233
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,560
it's, it does defy logic the way people who were like, uh, pay animators on paper or like, uh,

234
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,680
we're suddenly able to switch mediums and pull off something that had never been done before

235
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:41,280
within a year on a crazy timeline or like a Bob Gurr frequently, uh, uh, touted imagineer who's

236
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,560
you mainly associate with really technical attractions like the Autopia. He mainly worked

237
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,640
in vehicles and big blunt, uh, instruments and stuff. He ended up coming aboard the Lincoln

238
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,360
thing, even though he had not done character animation before, but he did, he did understand

239
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,720
complex machinery, which is what, uh, Lincoln ended up being.

240
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,560
Yeah. I read there's a story about Orson Welles when they made Citizen Kane, like he was a theater

241
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,760
guy, uh, uh, for, for his early life, he did so much in the theater and on the radio.

242
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,320
He really didn't know that much about making films. So like when it came time to like, all right,

243
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,480
this is where the scene's going to fade out and we'll fade up on another scene. He just had them

244
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,840
slowly dim the lights, their practical fades. And that's why they don't look some of them like,

245
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,240
Oh, that looks so different than any other film. And it's because, well, he didn't know you did

246
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,760
that in post. He just did it on set. Wow. Wow. Um, yeah. So, I mean, this is a, this is a big

247
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,640
victory for, uh, you know, taking, taking big swings. And the other cool thing is that Walt

248
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,200
got to do it on other people's dime, like all of these attractions ended up coming to Disneyland

249
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,360
en masse, but he did not have to pay for them the usual way. Everything was financed by the,

250
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,680
in this case, the state of Illinois or GE sponsoring the carousel of progress. Um,

251
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,080
and also just to put things on the contextual animatronic timeline, the biggest animatronic

252
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,280
thing, was it the first, I guess, the Enchant Tiki Room? Um, it must've been to some extent.

253
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,400
I guess that depends on if you classify the, uh, fake animals in the jungle cruise.

254
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,320
Those were pretty rudimentary, but yeah, I guess they move a little,

255
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,880
they move a little. Um, but yeah, Tiki Room was, I think the first big. First ones where they

256
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:41,440
speak and it's like, yeah, so the Enchant Tiki Room is it happened, but those are all fairly more

257
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,200
simple creatures. It's eyes blinking and mouths moving and wings flapping. And this is such a

258
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,240
giant leap up that it's a per, not only a person, but a person that everybody knows and has very

259
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,040
fun feelings about. This one, I, I didn't realize until reading about this, that, uh, you know, so

260
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,400
there were two seasons that the World's Fair ran. There was like six months in 1964, six months in

261
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:11,760
1965. And while the 65 one was going, they put in, uh, great moments with Mr. Lincoln simultaneously

262
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,640
into Disneyland. So they were running at the same time and they did it to celebrate the anniversary

263
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:26,000
of the park. And, uh, uh, and then there was also, you know, pictures of Walt everywhere because the,

264
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,880
the mythology of Walt Disney is kind of like, uh, attached to this attraction throughout its history,

265
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,040
I feel like. Um, but yeah, I always thought they just moved the animatronic like they moved all

266
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,120
the other crap out here, but the original Lincoln animatronic was like, they thought lost to the

267
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,080
ages until they found it in a crate not too long ago here, like buried in a warehouse in California.

268
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah. I think it's been a D 23. Have you, I've seen a new Lincoln animatronic, but I've not seen

269
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,160
the original. They had a couple, like three or four years ago, they had this crazy, like expressive

270
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,400
Lincoln that is quite frankly, frighteningly real. And I don't think they've put that into

271
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,560
any of the parks, but they were showing just like the new technology of how much they can make a

272
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,120
face, a robot face move. And it is frightening. I'll try to find a video of it. It's gotta be

273
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,400
online somewhere. I think I've seen a real close up that seemed recent of showing what, uh, like

274
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,520
it's trained really close. And he's like, he's a little more cartoonish than normal too, which

275
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,920
makes it even more like frighteningly real or like, just like perverse maybe. Oh, I've got it. The

276
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,760
original one is now at the one man stream attraction in, uh, Hollywood studios in Florida. Oh,

277
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,800
interesting. So, um, you can see that there. Well, I didn't know that. I didn't know that they were

278
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,840
running at the same time. This is before there was a Disneyland and a Disney world. So that makes it

279
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,800
the first multiple locations. First clone attraction. Wow. Sure. There were people

280
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,760
sending handwritten newsletters back then of like another clone, another clone attraction, nothing

281
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,240
new. The fan boys are furious. Message boards. I was, I was impressed to learn that it's a re it's

282
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,440
a real face that it's all they had a life mask. Yeah. Yeah. If it's in the video, there's a video

283
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,920
where he's introducing the ride. Not a death mask. Not a death mask. A life mask. So in what regard

284
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,640
this was done? Like his, his face was immortalized like for statues and they said this was before the

285
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,960
presidency that they took this life mask. That's what he says in the video at least that they did

286
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,040
it before the presidency. So yeah, I don't know if it was, I should look more into it. If it was

287
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:43,040
during the, when he was running for president or I'm not sure. Or was that just a thing that everyone

288
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,960
got when they were in the olden days? Where like, honey, you get your life mask and I think it was

289
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,440
an option, especially when photography was so new. Right. Um, but, or maybe they knew that one day

290
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,680
they'll, there will be robots and that we should have this great man and, uh, have his face be very

291
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:08,480
accurate. I want to be flopping around on a stage. I think an interesting, uh, about this, this ride

292
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,520
and a lot of portrayals of Lincoln and popular culture is everyone hones in on writings about his

293
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,640
weird voice because like, I mean, this attraction, uh, uh, what is the, the main guys, what is the

294
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,640
name of the guy who does in the attraction, in the attraction, Royal Dano, Royal Dano, um, who, who

295
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:36,000
later there's, uh, he was an old character actor, uh, and is survived by a, his grandson named

296
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,280
Hutch Dano. Great. Wow. Perfect. Best names. Wait, is he related to Paul Dano? I don't know that one.

297
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,640
Let me look that up. Yeah. Look that up. Uh, but yeah, so a very distinct voice on this traction,

298
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,040
uh, uh, and a very distinct voice in, uh, Daniel Day-Lewis doing in the movie Lincoln from a few

299
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:04,480
years ago. No, no, no. We're on the world stage now. No, no. I was with a group of friends who

300
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,360
were really fixated on the Lincoln now. No, no, no. We are, uh, what's the other thing? Oh, I'm the

301
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:19,760
president of the United States, clothed in immense power. He gets a little less, that's not nasally.

302
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,240
It's the now, now, now is really odd. I don't even know how to describe that. It's a little,

303
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:33,760
it's like kind of whiny. It's a little emo. No, no, no. It reminds me of, of around the same time

304
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,720
as Lincoln came out. Uh, I never saw the movie, but war horse. You remember the movie war horse?

305
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,200
I never saw it. In the trailer, uh, there is an audio clip and I saw this trailer so much. I feel

306
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,320
like they played it before everything for a while of, um, uh, Benedict Cumberbatch yelling, be brave,

307
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,640
like screaming at a battlefield of soldiers. And it's just, it's never like, again, I've never seen

308
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,680
the movie. I know it's about a man and his horse, uh, but that be brave just comes into my head every

309
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,840
now and then old time, like historical bizarre lines in historical films. You just unlocked

310
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,400
another one. There's some movie, maybe you guys can tell me the title. I want to say Natalie

311
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:25,200
Portman is in it. It is a historical film, not America, but like Renaissance. And I just remember

312
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,160
a trailer with a lot of like, but you are my sister. She is my sister. Um, and I don't, who is it?

313
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,560
Who's the other one? I don't know. There's, I have the title in my head, the other Berlin girl.

314
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:43,200
Oh, what is that song? What is that movie called? Uh, the other, but you are my sister.

315
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:53,600
And as such, we must maintain Boylan. Okay. The other Boylan girl, Boylan B O L E. Yeah. And Bolin

316
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,400
or I've just always heard wrong. Uh, yeah. Anyway, why do, why do things, why do odd

317
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:08,000
phrase ologies jump out so much? I mean, in the intro to this, when, when, uh, uh,

318
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,400
Dano is reading like the, the biography, the Lincoln was asked to describe himself. Uh,

319
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:20,160
it always stuck out to me when he goes like, I was large for my age. It's like, oh man,

320
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,960
Lincoln was a big boy. He was a large son. Uh, real big, big one. As a large son, do they have

321
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,960
to be, can they just be tall? Cause he's very lanky guy. Yeah. He's very lanky. He's not a husky boy.

322
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,080
He wasn't husky, but he was, he was certainly large. I mean, he called himself large. He's six,

323
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,320
four. Yeah. You ever play Lincoln in anything, Mike? You're probably, you're of the question.

324
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,760
I don't think I have. No, no video or sketch or a play. Maybe an improv show. An insultingly low

325
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,760
amount of money to play Lincoln for 12 hours. No, I don't think so. Maybe president's day related

326
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,960
sketch. I think it's in an improv show. I'm sure I've done so many improv scenes. Sure. But no,

327
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,680
you weren't specifically hired because like a lot of, I feel like every heavy set actor we know has

328
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,600
had to be Santa. Yes. Perhaps five times minimum. You just, it's just what ends up happening, but I'm,

329
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,520
I'm kind of amazed you haven't been employed as a Lincoln. I don't think there's as much demand for

330
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,320
Lincoln and Santa. I think maybe there's just so I think yes. Lincoln only comes around once in a

331
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,080
while, but no, nobody sales when like, you know, presidents day car sales. I like, I'll put it out

332
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,000
there. I'm happy to play Lincoln. I will play him like boss NAS, but I'm tall and you can put the

333
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,960
beard on me and it'll look right. And I'm fairly lanky. So yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm open for it.

334
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:46,080
Lincoln too reloaded. Sure. I'll do the direct to DVD sequel, but we've already show the Lincoln.

335
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,440
He's already been used for, you know, schlocky entertainment with the vampire hunter. Oh yeah.

336
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,800
Out of the realm of possibility. We, Lincoln has been put in the category of like ninjas and

337
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,720
pirates and like, yeah, like random stuff. If you want to convey that your thing is random,

338
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,960
get a Lincoln in there. There's no better way to let people know you have a twisted

339
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,480
sense of humor. Whoa, what are they doing with Lincoln? I thought that was sacred.

340
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,080
Wow. They don't care about anything. Their sensibility is so twisted. Yeah. Wow. They're

341
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:28,480
implying he's a foot finishes. They go there. The, well, to keep talking about the minutia

342
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,880
of Lincoln's voice and other articles, I think at various times, Lincoln historians have been unhappy

343
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,240
with this attraction because while that, the Royal Dano performance does seem like that,

344
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,800
that seems like what Lincoln might've talked like to me, but apparently it was a little higher.

345
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,280
It was a little more nasally. And I guess the criticism is that he should speak like an Indiana

346
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,120
guy or a Kentucky guy. And what does that mean exactly? I found one article that explained it,

347
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,560
that if you said, you should not say, thank you, Mr. Chairman, you should say, thank you, Mr.

348
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:11,680
Chairman. So you fucked up Disney and have him say cheer instead of chair. Wow. Who cares? Who's

349
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,880
analyzing this? And I guess if you're a, well, first of all, if you're a Lincoln expert and a historian,

350
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,960
you are smarter than me and contribute more than I do. So I have no right to be taking you down,

351
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,680
but I don't understand caring about not getting the dialect right in this robot ride.

352
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,080
I, it has to be much like us who have done a lot of, a lot of things, comedy wise, improv, sketch,

353
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,160
TV shows, and now we can't watch any comedy because it bothers us. It's the same for historians. They

354
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,040
can't watch any movie. They can't enjoy anything. I was talking to somebody the other day who knew

355
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,800
somebody who was an expert on pirates. And they said that this person, this pirate expert hates

356
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,520
the pirates of the Caribbean movies, hates the ride, hates all of it. So this is not what pirates

357
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,960
were like, and it bothers them. So like, I get it that if you're like so immersed in the topic,

358
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,240
you can't enjoy just a frivolous, fun adventure that, that fictionalizes pirates or something.

359
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,640
Like there's too many inaccuracies is what I'm saying. I mean, I, I find it personally very

360
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,960
tiresome in pop culture when it's like, Oh, we got to go to bingo world when like theme parks are

361
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,040
like, there's some very like a lame theme park stuff. There's a, there's lazy portrayals of

362
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,120
theme parks in films. Yes. I mean, then, then there's like most Simpsons stuff is on point.

363
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,600
Most Simpsons stuff is pretty good. So great about their theme park episodes. They're very

364
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:41,600
specific, very specific. All the California adventure jokes from like 2001. Did they make

365
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,360
California adventure joke multiple times? Just roasting that real. Oh yeah. What, but this is

366
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:54,960
like season 19, right? I haven't seen that would have been like 10 or 11. Really? I think real

367
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,440
later. I was watching 10 or 11. Did I just, did these go over my head? You were so offended. You

368
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,200
blocked them out. I guess the one that sticks out in my mind is like, we need to go where

369
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,160
no one would ever find you. Uh, or we need to go somewhere totally empty. Disney's California

370
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,240
adventure. Wow. They really even just spell it out. Let me look for this. Oh, also Royal Dano,

371
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,960
not related to Paul Dano as far as I can tell. Perfect. There are a lot of, uh, legacies. There

372
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,040
are a lot of legacy families in Hollywood. So, so Royal and Hutch different Dano than Paul.

373
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,800
Hutch, that's the greatest name. I also just real quick on the, on the Paul Dano, not the Paul Dano

374
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:43,280
point, the, uh, which, which one? Royal Dano. So he, he had played Lincoln in other stuff and he

375
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,840
looked sort of Lincoln-y, uh, in general and he, and I was looking up, well, can I see him play

376
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,280
Lincoln? And he did it in a film or two, but he also did it in a very strange episode of a show

377
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,000
called the Rifleman. Oh yeah. West, uh, black and white show. And, uh, I don't know the rest of what

378
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
happens on the Rifleman, but there's a really strange scene where the Rifleman's son is like

379
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:16,240
wrestling with a, with a guy and rough neck and, uh, you know, like, uh, tumbling all around the,

380
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,800
uh, the stable. And then when he flips over like, Hey, all right, you guys come in for dinner.

381
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,920
All right, I'll be there in a minute. And it's Lincoln and you're left for like seven minutes

382
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,000
going like, why am I watching Lincoln in this old West, uh, like having dinner with these farm

383
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,440
people? And then you re then it's spelled out to you that he is a crazy man who thinks he's Lincoln.

384
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,600
And in order to keep him at bay, everybody has to like act like he really is Lincoln. And at some

385
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,840
point, a little girl innocently says, I know everything about you. I know that you were born

386
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:55,600
on such a state and you were assassin. Uh, I mean, you wrote the emancipation very good. That's

387
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,560
right. I don't know what that other word was. You were starting. Well, this is the Simpson plot,

388
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,360
the Michael Jackson Simpson's plot. Oh, you're right. There's an imp, a guy who thinks he's

389
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Oh yeah. Yeah. For once. Wow. The Simpsons did something after. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,360
Speaking of little children, this is a good segue back into the world's fair, uh, uh,

391
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:26,320
version of this ride. Um, so I, I had some of the, I was listening to some of the audio files,

392
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,000
from this, the box set about the world's fair that Disney put out a number of years ago. Um,

393
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,680
you sent us this file and there's a, this is a box set. You can hear audio of, yeah. So, uh,

394
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,120
there's this box set. Uh, I think it's called like Walt Disney and the world's fair. It's great. And

395
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,320
there's a disc dedicated to every attraction. I mean, what you really want, the main thing on

396
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:57,280
each disc is the source audio from each ride. So it's source audio from Carousel, the full Lincoln

397
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,400
show, um, uh, uh, all of these different ones. And I got this from my dad a few years ago,

398
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,280
cause he had been at the world. He went to the world's fair multiple times when he was kid.

399
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:15,520
Um, and, uh, but the, the intro to this attraction when it was in the Illinois pavilion

400
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:22,800
was a thing called the Illinois story and it involved children reciting facts about Illinois.

401
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,720
Oh boy. And it's very odd. And it's just like, you know, uh, uh, agriculture,

402
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,800
commerce, like all of this stuff. And it's, it's already creepy cause it's little kids

403
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,400
just reading like it's like founded in, in 1645, like just saying this. And then halfway through

404
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,760
this, they start talking in unison. So it's just a group going like home to science and innovation,

405
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,440
the land of Lincoln, but it's very odd.

406
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,880
Oh, why are children made to recite historical facts? That was my, when I graduated from

407
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:06,240
elementary school are the, what we, for some reason we all had to like get on like risers and

408
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,920
tell the story of America. And there were a lot of in unison parts like that, where we all said

409
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,840
the declaration of independence together. That was our tree for graduating six year, your longest

410
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:24,240
school, six years. And we all had to read the tale of Paul Revere. Why are these things

411
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:32,000
tied together? Why are kids made to, yeah, it's very strange. Uh, the audio, actually I did

412
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,200
Paul Revere and I nailed it. That was like a solo I had and whatever this American history

413
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:49,280
piece was. And I was, I was real proud. Attend the tale of the, um, Scott, the audio file that you

414
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,240
refer to that I sent you guys, uh, is, uh, outtakes of the recording of the Lincoln, uh, attraction.

415
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:04,000
And it's, it's Dano reading the lines, like, you know, and it's just like, or die by suicide.

416
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,680
And then you hear the classic, okay, hey, that was great. Um, let's take it back in this time,

417
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,480
really believe in the words you're saying. Like it's so odd to hear the words of Abraham Lincoln

418
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,800
get noted from a sound booth. Like it's very funny. You know, you know what it made me aware of is

419
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,600
that the, the directions are given so precisely, make sure that it's clear that you have no lack

420
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,280
of confidence in the Republic heading towards the future. All right, great. Every note is given by

421
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,720
some old, you know, some like war horse guy behind a desk. And I do, I direct things and I do VO

422
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,520
directions specifically. And I'm sure if you heard audio of me doing that, it'd be like, oh, that

423
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,480
was pretty cool. Uh, just maybe, I don't know if, would it be interesting possibly if you could

424
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,360
maybe, uh, also like I was shamed by how succinct this Lincoln director was and I'll strive to be

425
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,600
like him in the future from now on. You'll be like, uh, say that like you love our flag, please.

426
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,480
Those are the only, I'm only given patriotic notes from now on. Imagine a soaring eagle while you do

427
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,280
this one, please. It's a good note actually. Yeah. I will give that. Uh, I, the side note that

428
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,000
there's others, there's other versions of, um, or other versions, there's other, uh, audio,

429
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,400
like outtakes, like the Haunted Mansion, you can find the outtakes of the narration, the Paul

430
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,040
Frese narration, who also was the narrator on this, right? Yeah. Um, and there, it's wonderful to

431
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,080
hear like, like stuff that, you know, it just doesn't feel like it exists. There's a, there's,

432
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,200
there shouldn't be other takes of it. It felt like it feels so like, I don't know, like it was born.

433
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,160
It was just there. It was always there. It's so adhering, like somebody fuck up or trying a

434
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,040
different take or a different voice is very fun and weird. But also everyone's a lot more composed,

435
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,960
like you were saying, Scott. So these outtakes usually aren't like, you know, anyone doing the

436
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,240
voice of Lincoln and then going, fuck, I thought I had it. God damn it. Yeah. The freeze one on the

437
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,360
Haunted Mansion is a little more loose like that. Oh, is it? It's a little more, I don't know if he

438
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:15,760
says that, but I hope he does. God damn it. Yeah. Me. You can hear that with Paul Thomas Anderson's

439
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,720
dad, who was the voice of ABC, the wonder years. And you can hear him. Fuck me. He started it one

440
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,280
more. Yes. All right. God damn it. Give me another. He was the great Goulardi. Uh huh. Yes. He was one

441
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,080
of the early horror. He was a local horror show host. Where? Uh, was it Pennsylvania? Somewhere in

442
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,640
Pennsylvania or something? I was somewhere on the East coast for sure. Okay. Um, but he was, he knew

443
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,360
Tim Conway. The look up is he was Ernie Anderson. I believe if you look up Ernie Anderson outtakes

444
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,000
and you want to hear a great dulcet voice, say, fuck me. Um, the, in general, it being Paul freeze

445
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,240
is fun because like, I think I'd forgotten that and I don't go to this attraction very often. And

446
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,280
this preceded the Haunted Mansion, but, uh, so this was done before his eventual role as the ghost

447
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,840
host. But you so associate him with like ghoulishness and malice that went to hear him. It makes the

448
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:12,000
entire attraction today seem sarcastic. Like it won't, it won't. He says like, it was in new Salem,

449
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,800
that yet the young Lincoln worked as a clerk and postmaster. What are you, what are you getting at?

450
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,720
Do you, is that a lie? Did he not do it? Was he a bad clerk? What are you implying? Yeah, like just

451
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,560
here. And I don't even know if he says this, but in my mind, it's like great moments with Mr. Lincoln

452
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,400
and you're like, ah, it's scary. It's a scary ride. It's just scary now, like Leslie Nielsen.

453
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,960
It's hard to back up and see Leslie Nielsen being a serious part. Unless he's doing a crazy, like he

454
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,360
does the Ludwig von Drake voice, which is the scientist, the duck, and he does one of the, uh,

455
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,880
which, uh, Tiki bird. So like if he's doing a voice like that, I think you can get away with not

456
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:55,440
sounding sinister. But yeah, when he's doing his normal voice, it really just like, you really, Mr.

457
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:04,960
Lincoln. He was assassinated in 1865. Are you glad? Is that good to you? It would have been better

458
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,640
if Thurl Ravenscroft did the narration. Oh boy. That's what I was, yeah, the, the Holy Trinity and

459
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,320
maybe I might be forgetting a big one, but I was thinking about this. Paul Frese, who's the ghost

460
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,640
host, Thurl Ravenscroft, who's the, the deep, uh, with area is grim, gritty and good. And Hans Conn

461
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,600
Reed, who I forget what he is in the parks, but he's captain hook and he's on a lot of things with

462
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:31,200
all those guys. And these, uh, these old character actor weirdos, I love them. I love when they come

463
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,560
up on these episodes because they're in everything. These guys are such workhorses. Uh, another, uh,

464
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,960
Royal Dano thing from that Lincoln, uh, uh, him reading Lincoln's like self autobiography portion.

465
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,800
He talks about in it, uh, a thing that at the time was probably very common people being self-taught,

466
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:02,000
but now takes on a different meaning when he goes like, I decided to borrow some law books and, uh,

467
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,240
taught myself the law. And it's like nowadays if someone describes themselves as a self-taught

468
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:15,600
lawyer, you're like, Oh no, this is a sovereign citizen or some other form of a John Berger

469
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,840
society maniac. Better call Abe. Yeah.

470
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,400
Would have been a real ambulance chaser if there were ambulances. Uh, yeah, that is very interesting.

471
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,200
This guy, I don't think self-taught. I mean, that said, we talked about the imagineers,

472
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,560
like teaching themselves how to build theme park, pretty much inventing theme parks as they

473
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:49,520
learned how to do it. Uh, so, you know, not that long ago in people still are self-taught or jump

474
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:57,520
between, uh, media, but like Disney himself had no right to be being able to draw doodles and steal

475
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,880
other doodles from your friends doesn't imply that you'd be able to be a, uh, you know, a, the opener,

476
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,880
a guy who builds massive real estate and theme parks and perfects robot technology and tells

477
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,680
stories. And, uh, yeah, Hey, it's the American spirit that is shared by Abe and Walt and that's

478
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,440
why their stories are intertwined. A earnest thing to say, but I felt like I had to say it weird or

479
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,840
sarcastic because it's, uh, uh, you know, I'm insecure with how earnest this podcast is.

480
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,960
How would Paul Friese say it though? Add a little bit of a spin to it.

481
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:42,080
I remember one of the great American innovators. Was he not, uh, Disney or Lincoln? He was saying

482
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:49,920
all they were both disruptors. It's the, yeah, we have to reverse apply that term. One of the great

483
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,880
terms. Yeah. Disruptor. What else? Oh, uh, okay. So one thing that was different at the world's fair

484
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,600
attraction was, um, uh, uh, the Illinois pavilion had, uh, you know, cause the world's fair,

485
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:10,480
these giant worldwide events so they can get stuff like the Illinois pavilion had the handwritten

486
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,160
manuscript of the Gettysburg address. That did not make the jump to Disneyland. No, no, I don't

487
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:22,000
think that's there. I haven't seen it. Uh, wow. When this is a crazy attraction. Yeah. Uh, when

488
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:30,560
it opened at Disneyland, of course, um, uh, uh, lots of Abraham Lincoln and also Walt Disney exhibits,

489
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,160
uh, in the, in the lobby that has pretty much never changed. Which is also true of the hall

490
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,920
of presidents and of the American adventure is all these, this is a trilogy really of attractions.

491
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,400
Walt is essentially a president in terms of the Disney mythology, the story, the company tells

492
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,360
like maybe you think he would have run if he hadn't died in the 60s. Maybe it would have been

493
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,640
Nixon versus Disney and 68. No, he would have run with them. Nixon would have been his running mate.

494
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,440
Oh, there's something Disney would have been. That's an Avengers lineup. I think Nixon would

495
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,960
have rat fucked him. Well, yeah, yeah. Uh, but I mean like this, I think Disney was a savvy enough

496
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,160
businessman to know, to not explicitly, even though he was hanging with Nixon, not to say exactly

497
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,800
where he fell on the political spectrum for his business. He didn't really put it out there so

498
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:24,960
thoroughly. We know he's probably more conservative. Yeah. But unlike a Bob Iger who wants to be a

499
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,160
centrist Democrat, he wants to run as a centrist Democrat. Um, and he's been very explicit about

500
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,720
that, except he keeps re-upping his contract every, he's going to say, like he'll say he's done. And

501
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,920
then he goes, Oh, two more years for me. Oh, I see. And he's not running in 2020. He's right.

502
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,640
He can't do that, but he was, he was going, Oprah wants him to do it. So, but he, so he's taking,

503
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,200
it's a different approach is what I'm saying then. Why would he want to stay on for $400 million

504
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,840
when he could get $400,000 as president? It's strange. And criticized by everyone roundly at

505
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:04,560
all times and potentially shot at or assassinated. But he's being, we're currently, we're recording

506
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,120
this in a weekend where he's been, uh, Robert Iger specifically has been, been criticized by

507
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:15,760
Bernie Sanders. Yes. Yeah. Getting his ass roasted. Getting his ass for Disney's poor, uh, labor

508
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,360
treatment. Yeah. I don't know. We're not like obligated to talk about, but I've thought about

509
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:25,680
how we haven't. No, I think we have. We've touched upon it. Yeah. We haven't. Here's what I'll say.

510
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,080
Devoted a whole episode to, uh, labor theories, but, uh, I just, you know, I feel like we should

511
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,560
make clear though we like these parks, we don't like that. I think we have said that before. Yeah,

512
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,080
we said pay them more money. Here's what I want. It's entirely unethical to like keep charging more

513
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:48,800
for tickets and hotels and everything else and not share that with the workers who do the brunt of

514
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,640
the labor. I would like, like these, and I, this truly, I'm saying this with the most love I can

515
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:01,520
possibly muster. These, uh, these wonderful nerds that run this park and are responsible for the

516
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:08,240
day-to-day operations truly are the backbone of this, this whole thing that we love. And these

517
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,840
people deserve more money for it. It is a hard job in a lot of cases. They have to deal with a lot

518
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,480
of people that are angry and yelling at them. There's so many people that come through. The

519
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,640
crowds are insane and maintain a level of friendliness. Yes. He'd be a ambassador of

520
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,600
Disney magic, a very hard thing to do. Uh, we had Jenny Nicholson on, she was like so clearly a, like

521
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,080
it's in her, it was an inner DNA to do that. She doesn't do it anymore, but like, did you ever get

522
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:41,120
mad or flip out at anybody? And the answer is no. Right. But she, and she, and Jenny was not like a,

523
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,160
you know, robotic weird made in a lab Disney person. She just like genuinely believes in it

524
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,960
and was probably very good at, uh, at all. These people are very, are very valuable and it's, uh,

525
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,680
it's amazing that they're, they can keep that up. And on top of just being, you know, nice and

526
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,520
helpful and stuff, they love it. They give a shit about all of it. The history. So much. Yeah. Most

527
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:08,800
of them at least, a majority. Um, and it would be nice if they would show them, you know, basic

528
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,120
decency by giving them an amount of money that would let them live comfortably in Anaheim. Yeah.

529
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:23,120
That's the other thing. It's like, it's not cheap to live in California. I mean, you can live here.

530
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,080
Uh, uh, you just have to make sacrifices to live here pretty much unless you have a lot of money.

531
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,760
I mean, Orange County wouldn't be, well, obviously Orange County has is very rich areas, but like,

532
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,080
there's, you know, like you go around Anaheim and there's some, like there's apartment complexes that

533
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:45,440
are so lame looking, you like make fun of them. And then like, who would live here ever? Oh, people

534
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,040
who have no choice and work really hard to 50 year Disney veteran lives in this apartment.

535
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,960
Three others. Yeah. And someone, someone pointed out like online, well, you know,

536
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,920
anytime this comes up in any industry, it's like, well, if they're not making enough money,

537
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,120
they should find a new job, which first off, fuck you grow a heart. Like second. Yeah. There's a lot

538
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,440
of people on Twitter that are like, well, they should just leave then it's like, shut the fuck up.

539
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,560
One of those other jobs that are so easy to come by. Yeah. Oh, love to get, uh, uh,

540
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:24,080
love to get scolded by, uh, uh, cranky, uh, baby boomers who had a million more like, uh, uh,

541
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:30,400
safety net that we had pensions and like, uh, lots of vacation and all of this stuff

542
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,720
as we live in the gig economy. Hell. Um, but when they say like,

543
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,280
I really enjoyed doing the pod and yeah.

544
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:46,320
Well, you also like, uh, what you're describing the, uh, the, the people who believe

545
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:52,480
in the mythology of the park and these attractions so hard, never will you find that type more than

546
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:59,680
in the trilogy of, uh, patriotic attractions. Oh, sure. You have to put on who do these little,

547
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,960
because if you go see the great moments show or American adventure, I think you talked about this,

548
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:12,640
on that episode, they do these verbal presentations that are like, yes. So carefully

549
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,320
manicured and full of love and enthusiasm. Uh, uh, you know, they, it's not just like

550
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,840
press and play on the robot show. Please enjoy. Grandma's and Mr. Lincoln. Like they,

551
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,960
specifically these positions, people are like these docents and, uh, and they do a good job.

552
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:34,160
And they're great. And they deserve, uh, more money, uh, money and benefits that an in and out

553
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,320
burger employee gets. Like, how about that? That's a good, that's a, like a pretty decent company as

554
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:46,080
far as they're like, nor they're starting wage and their benefits. And yeah. Uh, but one thing

555
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,840
specific to the parks, I saw someone point out when that like, get it. Well, maybe they should

556
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:56,960
find a new job. Someone pointed out like, yeah, often they do. And, uh, uh, cast member turnover,

557
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,880
like can hurt the experience because you have less and less experienced people sticking around

558
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,280
who, uh, uh, and more like newer and newer people who great. I mean, you always need to refresh,

559
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:16,320
uh, your employee base, but like, you know, someone's got to, you know, show the new kids

560
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,040
how it's done. Yeah. And if you don't know how to pilot those canoes, they could sink.

561
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,120
If you don't know how to pilot the main street ambulance, it could go off the,

562
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:30,880
off of main street and into the Emporium and run over 20 people. And even just those like little

563
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,640
extra touches that, that Disney is famous when like someone goes out of the way, your way, like,

564
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,760
Oh, we don't have this item here. Let me call another store. And that, that sort of thing.

565
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,880
Yeah. We did that the other day. Yeah. Oh yeah. That seemed very specific. 30 minute,

566
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,960
a 30 minute journey from somebody trying to call different stores and like they're at a different

567
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,000
kiosk. And I was like, you don't have to do this. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's okay. And they're

568
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,680
like waiting on hold. What were you after? Uh, it was, uh, I had to make a bulk purchase that

569
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,600
we'll talk about on a different show. Oh yes. Those have been alluded to on social media. Although

570
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,960
this may come out after that. So I may have to edit this. Don't know. Well, if you're not hearing

571
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:16,160
it, then it's, uh, it didn't happen. You're one of us. Uh, okay. So, uh, well we've been on a

572
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,600
labor. Yeah. We could go to one. Hey, I think it was you started it. Scott. We're ready to go.

573
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:28,240
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can't always be in inflation. I mean, like Disney, the Disney

574
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,800
pricing and stuff has outpaced inflation so much and the wages across the border stagnant

575
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,320
or like very slowly rising. But like Disney certainly isn't leading the way. Yeah. If I'm

576
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,240
paying this much for the annual pass, I would like to think that the workers are getting paid a

577
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:50,480
little more. That would be nice. Yeah. Cause it's gone up about 500% in the last five years. Yeah.

578
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:57,600
And I, uh, as I am not a Disney shareholder, I don't give a shit about Disney shareholders. Sure.

579
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:04,400
Oh, I am one though. I'm sorry, Jason. Oh no. Do you have a single one? Do you have a single

580
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:11,200
souvenir one? No, I might, might just my, my dad, I'm like a grandfathered into it. Oh, okay. Um,

581
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,440
that was apparently very shit about you. I guess. Now I know I've been hiding in plain sight this

582
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,200
whole time. All right. Uh, this was, it used to be a very common thing. People would give like

583
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,120
a share to newborns and then also you would get the, the shareholder reports used to be nice

584
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:34,880
souvenirs. I'll tell you this, you know, I liked that my family is also shareholders. Okay. But my

585
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:43,040
mom refuses to vote in the elections. My mom won't vote. I told her, uh, and like for years,

586
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,760
States elections. No, no, no. She, yeah. Yeah. She votes in those Disney shareholders. She doesn't

587
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,240
want to offend anyone though. Cause she thinks that then like a CEO will see that she voted

588
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,520
against them and that they'll be mad at her. And that, so she would not, she would never,

589
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,440
cause I would try to tell her what to do and she, she just wouldn't, she would not vote.

590
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,360
Well, that's why I don't vote in national elections. Cause you don't want to make the

591
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:11,680
candidates mad. Yeah. I just want everyone to have a nice time. Trump might have a list of everyone

592
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:18,240
who didn't vote for him. That is true. Probably did have, got me the ledger of all the people.

593
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,800
Yeah. Yeah. He probably, if he's criticized on Twitter, if you've been blocked, he might've like

594
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:29,040
looked you up. Yeah, I think that's probably what I thought. Hey, this is a good Nixon, uh, is a good

595
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:34,800
jumping off point. So, uh, as we said, this ride opened at the world's fair, then opened, uh,

596
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:43,440
simultaneously in 65 opened at Disneyland where it ran, uh, until 1972. Uh, also funny note, uh,

597
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:50,320
sponsored by Lincoln savings and loan association. Fun. Very cute. Um, never required an A through E

598
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,360
ticket. Walt wanted this, wanted everyone to see this because it was important historically.

599
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:01,840
So it was free. You could just walk over to Disney and go on this, this show or enjoy it and then

600
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,640
leave. So like Scott, for instance, in the old days could go down. He'd probably have to smuggle

601
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,440
white wine in and they drink air and you and Aaron would drink it in the car. Would have had to know

602
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,960
a, uh, we would have, we would have paid for club 33 just for, right. It's for wine cheaper. Yeah.

603
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,600
And then you'd go on Lincoln and then you go home. Yeah. You know, it's a thing with no line.

604
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:28,480
They see, although we do it, we certainly do not do it. Uh, these days, do you guys go on this?

605
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,960
It's a once a year for me. Once I believe there are a couple of attractions around the park.

606
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,200
That's once a year. Jason is smiling from ear to ear. I think he's about to tell us that he goes

607
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:44,480
on it very frequently. I do pretty regularly. Do you really? Well, sometimes you hit that point

608
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:51,680
in the day where the wait time for everything else is just, it's just, it's just like a stalemate.

609
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:57,440
Like, Oh, even pirates is too low. You point where I leave the park. That's what I, I haven't gone on

610
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,080
this with you. Have I, or have I, do you have, I don't really recall us going on this. Jason needs

611
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:08,560
to be alone a lot. Well, cause I had never center Jason. It's an emotional experience. Apparently

612
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:14,480
Walt would like tear up when he watched this and, and, uh, Lily and his wife would have to cover for

613
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,920
him and like, Oh, he had something in his eye. And that's, is that your situation as well? Well,

614
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,800
I mean, especially when it's hot, it's air conditioned. You're crying because it's so hot.

615
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,600
Uh, I just, I, you know, I like the animatronic. I like, do you bring a treat in with you?

616
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't think you can. I don't, I think they say you have to finish that before you go. Sorry.

617
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,800
You're tearing up right now. Jersey Mike's and also where did you get it from? Like

618
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:50,240
you hit it in a locker several days in advance. There's, there's some very odd portions of it in

619
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,520
the car. Well, the thing I was getting to earlier about Nixon, uh, uh, I'll talk more when we get

620
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:03,520
to the current version of why I like it. Um, but, uh, Nixon probably among the people, uh, uh,

621
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:09,920
came from orange County Republicans. Um, and they were, I believe where some of the people not very

622
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:18,400
happy in 1973, uh, when Disney opened the Walt Disney story in place of great adventures with

623
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,560
Mr. Lincoln. Oh, uh, great adventures. What did you say? Great moments. Great moments with Mr. Lincoln.

624
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,120
It's not a great adventure. That's for sure. Abraham Lincoln vampire, Hunter, if you want

625
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:35,840
to do a great adventure, greatest American adventure there is. So this lasted, uh, two years.

626
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,640
Nixon was mad. No, no, I'm just saying I think orange County Republicans were mad because they

627
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:49,200
just got rid of this Lincoln attraction for a Walt Disney attraction. And the, and the rap was,

628
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:57,040
it is a dishonor to Walt Disney's legacy to take out Lincoln and put in a thing about

629
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:04,000
Walt Disney's legacy. Very confusingly, people felt that it was more of a tribute to Walt to keep

630
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,360
Lincoln in there. So they eventually sort of combined them in this odd way, right? I think

631
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:17,680
like they played the Walt Disney story in the lobby and then it had like a tortured title that

632
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,040
was the Walt Disney story featuring great moments of Mr. Lincoln. Um, I think they would play it

633
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,320
partly during the show too though. And then Lincoln would appear. Oh, like, so the main theater is

634
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:36,240
still playing a Walt Disney movie. It was like half and half. I believe, huh? Um, I, none of us

635
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:42,080
are interested enough to know officially. That's where our research sometimes lags is when you're

636
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:47,120
bored by the information. So you don't keep looking at it. This two year old attraction that people

637
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:54,960
really didn't like, like is not exactly archived that well. Nobody took an old bolex camera and

638
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:01,920
filmed a film off of a screen. Film was 23 minutes long says here, stitched together archival film

639
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,600
and audio footage, blah, blah, blah. Similar version was in the magic kingdom. Where was that?

640
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:17,280
The magic kingdom from 1973 to 1992. There was a Walt Disney story in Disney world kingdom. Yeah.

641
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,280
I'm trying to write. Sure. I saw this episode cover us on that. Or we're going to have to talk about

642
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:28,080
that and some other horrible episode down the line. Uh, uh, we're going to do magic kingdom

643
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:34,320
specific Walt Disney story. Walt Disney auto bio stuff and whatever. So one man's dream and the,

644
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:40,960
we can talk about how, um, my, um, I owned a couple of Walt Disney biographies as a kid,

645
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,440
if you can imagine that. Yeah. And my dad gave me one one time and the, uh, he just,

646
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,480
I had some book about wall. There you go. Happy birthday. And then, uh, he didn't look at it too

647
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:59,040
carefully because the book was called Hollywood's dark Prince and it was a picture of Walt, but then

648
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:05,120
his shadow was like, like weird and scary and grotesque. He was like, like his shadow showed

649
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:10,640
the true devil that was walled. And I read this whole tie it all together. It was like largely

650
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:17,440
about his union and labor issues and the strikes that he crushed and, uh, communism. And I was D,

651
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,960
I was like 200 pages into this book before my mom figured it out and was like, maybe you shouldn't

652
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,920
be reading that, but I was like, no mommy, please, I must finish Hollywood's dark Prince.

653
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,640
And it was a good book credit where it's due. I think, hold on one second, Edwin laid on my

654
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:39,680
mic cord. There we go. Um, credit where it's due the Disney family museum, uh, uh, that his daughter

655
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:46,560
was, you know, that is up in San Francisco that the family was involved in making does not gloss

656
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:54,160
over the strike stuff. Okay. It's like a pretty big chunk about like the strike. Unlike the moments

657
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:59,040
of mr. Lincoln that glossed over the foot fetish. Yeah. During, uh, I think during Halloween,

658
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,440
they should rename the Walt Disney story, uh, the dark Prince story featuring great moments with mr.

659
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,840
Lincoln. Ooh, yeah. What a, when in a time when you celebrate villains, let's talk about the

660
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,320
villainy of, uh, Walter. Yeah. I, this, well, this is, I, you know, when I wanted to talk about the

661
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:20,720
labor stuff for a second, I think I'm like, I want to convey that we aren't so rosy cheeks and

662
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:26,800
bushy or whatever adjective that we will not, though we are very sincere in our love of the parks.

663
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:32,320
Sure. And I don't, I never wanted this to be a podcast that's about a Walt was secretly,

664
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:38,880
you know, he hated the Jews and like all that, which I always find like, uh, is that based in

665
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,680
factor? We just, is it all urban legend and what are we, I never wanted it to be like an ant, this

666
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:49,600
to be a, uh, so dark of a podcast, but I don't want to ignore that stuff either. I agree. We've

667
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:56,000
got a realists take on all of these things. Well, I think we also would agree that like the

668
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,160
imagineers should probably be paid board. Sure. Like, uh, these are the real heroes. They're real.

669
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,480
Yeah. So the Disney corporation, but then again, the wonderful nerds in all levels of the, of,

670
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,440
of, uh, or the, whatever the hierarchy of all this stuff. I don't know what they're paid,

671
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,920
but it should be more. Let's bring them on. We love them. We love what they do. And ask how much

672
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,920
they're paid. Let's just ask him to show pasted. It'll be like a Howard Stern interview. How much

673
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,160
you, how much you make do something like that, which imagineers you want to bang?

674
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:36,800
Anyway, Hey, back to Lincoln facts. Um, there was also, uh, there was like a couple other little

675
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,600
exhibits in this, in this zone. There was like a, I think you could, you could look at Walt's office

676
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:47,600
for a long time. Is that still the case? That is in, uh, well they've restored his office on the lot

677
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:53,840
and then, uh, uh, the last time I was in Florida, there was a recreation of it. Yeah. But the one

678
01:06:53,840 --> 01:07:00,000
man stream in that same, yes, but there's not one up in Anaheim. I think there was at one point.

679
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,600
And there was also this little thing. Do we guys ever there when there was a, uh, there's this

680
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:09,040
little show that was kind of well done that you would watch with four other people. Nobody ever

681
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:15,440
sat and watched this. That was, it was like, it was an owl with a, with the graduation. I saw,

682
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,360
I saw a picture of this and I got very excited, but I was not, it was before my time going to

683
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,520
Disneyland. This might've been like pre 2000. Yeah. There's this little show in the corner

684
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:28,080
of the lobby where you wait for the Mr. Lincoln attraction and there's a, yeah, it's like a

685
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:34,160
owl with a chalkboard. It's the owl tells you about the true life adventures, the nature movies

686
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,360
that Walt made in the fifties and sixties and how he, and his interest in and love for animals.

687
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:45,600
It's the owl from the old like music shorts. Oh yeah. And the sing Disney sing alongs.

688
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,040
They would repurpose that footage to do those Disney sing alongs. Yes. Um, yeah,

689
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:53,520
that's why I got so excited. I was like, holy crap. It's the owl. I don't know what his character's

690
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:58,720
name is, but you would have loved it because as a, as a checky cheese fan, this was seeing an

691
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:05,280
animatronic, uh, that played to audiences of no one quietly in a corner, wasted animatronics.

692
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,000
Sir. Wonderful. I didn't, that was news to me when I was looking this up that that existed,

693
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,640
that they ever had one of those. Yeah. Well, it was fascinating to see. And then he presses play

694
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,480
on a video and then I stopped watching the video. Uh, but the first two minutes of the video of the

695
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:26,960
video that I watched were a fascinating, uh, I, maybe I have not been less engaged in the

696
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:32,240
source material of a topic before I never, I don't know what you guys did. I don't think I

697
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,520
watched a full Lincoln speech. I don't think I don't really know a lot about how the versions

698
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:44,720
were different. Um, I, uh, I know that it got shorter every time. Like the state fair one was

699
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,040
the world's fair one was very long, got a little shorter when it came to Disney and got a little

700
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,920
shorter again in the seventies, shorter and shorter and shorter. All these, all these shows

701
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,520
over the years, I think I've gotten a little shorter, which is fine by me, but a problem

702
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:07,280
for you, Jason. Well, no, you can't, Jason cannot get to REM if the show is in a certain way.

703
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,000
Minutes isn't enough time to fall all the way asleep. They, they've made, they've certainly

704
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,760
made some edits. I mean, the speeches are, uh, uh, now Edwin is getting, uh, fidgety. Um, they,

705
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:27,440
they've certainly made some edits over the years. I mean, the dialogue of the, the Royal Dano, uh,

706
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,880
section, the actual animatronic is kind of a hodgepodge of speeches. Like it's not one

707
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:40,560
speech all the way through. Yeah. Uh, I think that happened at one point. Um, well, I, I want to get

708
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:47,440
to that cause I know Scott, you're excited about that version. Oh yeah. Real quick in, um, the

709
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:58,960
eighties, uh, so in 1975, Lincoln comes back, uh, at Disneyland. Um, and in 1984, they added in

710
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:05,680
the, uh, golden dream and two brothers from the American adventure in have caught these songs

711
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:13,040
rear in their heads on this podcast again. Yeah. Uh, uh, again, I would like to, yeah, I would like

712
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:19,920
to talk about how occasionally I like to just yell like one war blow and one war gray, like just out

713
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,520
of nowhere. I think it's a very funny bit to do on a date. Where do you do it? Yeah, sure. Let's go

714
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:32,000
with that. Um, just anywhere, just anywhere. Um, and golden dream, I think used to be in the show

715
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,840
somewhere. Now it just kind of plays as you walk out. Oh, it plays in the lobby. Really? I think

716
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,080
it's after the show. Like when the lights come up and you're leaving, when was the last time you saw

717
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:51,600
the show? Um, I think I went in 2014. I'm on a once every four years with Lincoln. See, it's been

718
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,880
a while. Although you know, the most recent time you have been in the theater. Oh yeah. This was

719
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:02,480
a blast. When Scott and I watch when our respective, our significant others, uh, watch the Oscars.

720
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah. There was a special annual pass holder event. Yeah. Um, where, yeah, we watched the live

721
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:17,360
telecast of the Oscars. Um, this ended, what ended up being the, uh, the, the Kimmel, uh, wrong

722
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,960
envelope, uh, snafu year. Although we had long vacated for our blue Bayou reservation by the

723
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:28,560
time all that happened. But yeah, we got to watch the Oscar opening with Justin Timberlake and

724
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,200
Kimmel's monologue with an audience. Second row. With a screen blocking where what you know

725
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,280
has a Lincoln animatronic behind it. So Hollywood's biggest night you got to see projected on a

726
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,960
screen in front of like a sleeping robot and animatronic. Yes. Yeah. It would have been nice

727
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:50,240
if they opened the curtain once in a while and see him. Yeah. But they didn't. The brightest stars

728
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:57,120
in Hollywood sky are out tonight, but the real brightest star is right here. And he was our 16th

729
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:05,360
president. And he rips through the screen. Who cares about this? All this fluff. Um, let's talk

730
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:14,800
about fortitude and having a pride in your bosom. That was a blast. And there was a trivia contest.

731
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,760
Yes. And I won one or no, it wasn't a trivia contest. It was a raffle. Yeah. And they had to

732
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,560
keep skipping past all the empty seats. So eventually once the seat was reached with a

733
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:31,280
person in it, I was that person. And I got a copy of the guardians to cartoon. The guardian

734
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:38,560
guardians cartoon soundtrack, which is by believe still in its original packaging in a closet

735
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:44,160
somewhere and a palette of bulk, uh, Perry, the platypuses, uh, that have not been sold.

736
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,880
You get to take these off our hands. Um, that was a lot of fun. And that, you know, I, I,

737
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,720
pre-thinking about what else do you do with the space? Uh, you know, I leave Lincoln in there

738
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:02,160
certainly, but more, more events, more award shows and stuff. Yeah. Let's do football games.

739
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,800
Let's do the Miss America pageant. I want to watch everything in modern, new modern family

740
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:13,280
episodes screened in live as they air to watch it with a laugh track. I, I was there. I happened

741
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,600
to be there once, I think it was when family was visiting, we were staying down there and it was

742
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:25,680
an AP event in there and they were showing, um, old documentary. They showed like, um, either the

743
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:32,960
Disney world story or they showed like one of the wonderful world of Disney, like documentaries in

744
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:40,560
there just for APs and you got a button. So, so, so, uh, while we, the certain things about

745
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,520
Disneyland, we're not thrilled about the AP program is one of them. That's not on our

746
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,640
show list. You get a, honestly, it is kind of like, oh, no, I feel like they've dialed back on,

747
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,440
they've dialed way back on events. We used to get crazy perks. You would go down and if you signed

748
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:01,520
up or I have on my Twitter, an alert that sends me a message that says if there's an AP thing,

749
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,440
you can sign up for, there used to be wonderful events that would be like closed off. I think

750
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,840
they did one like a year ago and I was too, too slow getting it. It was for Cars Land. And then

751
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,960
it was, it would just be APs after dark. You get two hours with just a small group of people. They

752
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,400
used to do that stuff all the time. They would do previews for new rides, not anymore. Everything

753
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:26,960
sucks now because of how many people are there. And so as protest, you're only going to go, uh,

754
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:33,440
one and a half times a week on average. I only pay $300 to get into Star Wars land. I will not pay

755
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:41,440
five. I swear I have a limit. I am a disciplined man. I will only slip some bribes to the people

756
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:48,320
controlling the line for Star Wars, Galaxy's edge. Scott, I started to tee this up. Uh, now

757
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:55,520
eventually the Walt Disney story with great moments featuring Mr. Lincoln, that's Mr. Lincoln,

758
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:02,880
not Abraham or president. It was never Abraham in the title. Yeah. Uh, but eventually you got a

759
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:11,280
refurb. Yeah. In the, what was it? 2000 2001 is what I'm saying. At which point? Well,

760
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,760
you're talking about the Walt Disney story featuring great moments with Mr. Lincoln,

761
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,160
the journey to Gettysburg colon colon journey to Gettysburg. Yes. I saw a sign that said that had

762
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:27,040
even more. The sign was the Disneyland opera house presents the Walt Disney story featuring great

763
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:32,880
moments of Mr. Lincoln, the journey to Gettysburg. Incredible. Boy, there's a lot of convoluted names

764
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,080
out there. Uh, people that were guardians of the galaxy mission breakout to shame. Yeah. I was

765
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:42,320
going to say people that were complaining about that, Jesus, that this was double the size. The

766
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:47,840
Disney, it's important to know that the Disneyland opera house presents it. I mean, what, cause how

767
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:53,680
do I, they might be presenting something else. Yeah. Could be the Oscars or, uh, um, do you know,

768
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:59,440
did anybody know what the opera house was before Lincoln in general? I don't, I didn't know this

769
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,120
cause I was like, was that building there or did they build it? Cause it was always there, but it

770
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,520
was kind of nothing. There was, it was, I think just a facade and then they put in babes and toy

771
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:14,160
land sets for real years. Yeah. So that's what was there from 61 to 65. And then for Disneyland's

772
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:21,120
10th birthday, Mr. Lincoln evicted the toys. Wow. I didn't know that. Yeah. Um, and that was just

773
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:28,000
there forever. It's time to learn. Babes and Toyland is a horrifying movie. Yeah. Yeah.

774
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,480
Horrifying, but it's, it's very weird and not great. Yeah. But it gave us those, uh, soldiers

775
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:39,920
who factor into so many parades. Yeah. The soldiers are cool. And, uh, there's, there's a great Ed

776
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:46,000
Wynn performance in it. Not Ed Wynn, your dog. Not Ed Wynn the dog, but Ed Wynn. Is that is why your dog is

777
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,880
Ed Wynn though, you said? Yeah, basically he's sort of named after Ed Wynn. Oh man. Have we talked

778
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,560
about how I'm a Keenan Wynn guy? No, I don't think so. Ed Wynn's son Keenan, who was an old

779
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:03,440
grouch. Who's an old like old curly mustache weirdo who's a villain in a lot of old Disney's

780
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:11,200
and like the shaggy DA and the love bug. Oh, get that love bug. He's just this old, sour, cranky.

781
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:18,000
I like him as much as Thorol or any of them. Wow. Love Keenan Wynn. Uh, he, he's responsible for one

782
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,440
of my favorite scenes ever, which is in the movie Super Train, where he's the billionaire who presents

783
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:31,840
the idea of a super train. Gentlemen, we must build Super Train. And then kick into hard disco

784
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:37,600
and shots of a high tech train. Uh, a great scene. Love Keenan Wynn. We've got to do a bunch of Wynn

785
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:43,440
episodes, I think. Yeah. Let's just go through the filmography. Not Steve Wynn though. No, that's a

786
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,400
bad Wynn. That ship has sailed. But like the Danos, that's multiple families. Right, different.

787
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:56,240
But anyway, great moments with Mr. Lincoln, the journey to Gettysburg. Uh, this was a very bizarre

788
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:04,320
attempt to revitalize this attraction because a complaint you might have to this day is that it's

789
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:12,320
a little dull. It's a little dry. And they decided to bring in some technology that was a smash hit

790
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:20,000
at the show Sounds Dangerous with Drew Carey in Florida, which is a show that is a, uh, where

791
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,640
Drew Carey is a private eye and then the, the lights go out and you experience his adventure

792
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:34,240
with headphones and, and the head, the audio is so precise. It's actually the same as Alien Encounter,

793
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:39,600
where the audio is so precise that you feel like these sensations are actually happening, uh, to you,

794
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:46,880
such as, you know, liquid being poured right next to your ears as often happens. Well, and getting a

795
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,680
haircut, right? Getting a haircut happens in this. And this is binaural audio. Binaural sound you

796
01:18:53,680 --> 01:19:00,640
were the, you were given these fancy headphones. Yeah. So disgusting reuse throughout the day,

797
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:06,400
headphones. Yeah. 3D glasses are one thing. They clean them now too. Most of these places,

798
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,360
as you and I know, cause we went backstage to see it. Oh, that's right. We were given an odd

799
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:16,560
tour of the Despicable Me. Years ago, we were at Universal Studios and employees came and said,

800
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,880
Hey, do you want to get a tour of the backstage and then go right in front of the line? And we

801
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,280
were like, what are you talking about? Who are you? And we're like, you don't want the tour. And

802
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,760
we're like, why are you giving us this tour? And this sounds like I'm doing a bit. This is literally

803
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,480
what happened. And then we were like, I guess so, but like, do we have to, is there like a price?

804
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:39,840
Do we have to pay for it? No, it's just free. Come with us. They were like such kind of sedate girls.

805
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,080
And we're like, okay, I guess, but why is this happening? They're like, come on, we're going on

806
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:48,880
the tour. This is the, this is the happy fun land. This is where Grue goes to his daughters.

807
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,200
They're like, you don't want the tour? And we're like, what are we touring? And then they're like,

808
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,040
just, we're like, all right. And we were like laughing, like, why is this happening? And then

809
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,960
they were laughing too, and they don't have an answer for it. And we just like saw where they

810
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,840
washed the glasses. So this is where I watched the glasses. Okay. Why are you showing us this? Ha,

811
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,960
okay. I never understood any of that. And you know, what's funny is that we were with,

812
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:21,520
we happen to be with the hallowed bug main. I'm not familiar with this entity. Oh, really?

813
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:28,240
Yeah. Well, bug may, well, he's a villain who haunts podcasts. And the internet is a twisted

814
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:35,920
man. And he, with this is, we were at universal studios within a month of a man blowing his brains

815
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:42,560
out at the Despicable Me area. I forget the whole, it was some like ongoing dispute with,

816
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,440
he had been dating an employee and he committed suicide next to the Despicable Me fun land.

817
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:52,640
And which caused when we were so confused, why are we getting this Despicable Me tour? And bug

818
01:20:53,680 --> 01:21:03,680
asked, is this because of the thing? A reasonable question. Is it some strange, like, do they have

819
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:09,600
to like go overboard to show that this area is thriving and that it was not effective? Yes.

820
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,400
They were showing us there were no ghosts in the glasses cleaning stations. I guess. We never,

821
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,840
we never got a good answer. They didn't answer that. They didn't answer anything. I also remember

822
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,320
that we were led into a room where we all just started dancing to happy. That's the end of the

823
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,680
ride. That's the end of the ride. You come out there anyway. Oh, okay. Well, they did it in the

824
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:30,400
opposite way and we were there and we were dancing for a while sort of without questioning it. Okay,

825
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:35,680
we're dancing. And then bug was like, can we stop? And they said, yeah. Well, they were,

826
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:41,040
they were surprised. Like we felt like we had an obligation to dance in the happy room. Yeah. And

827
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,360
we didn't apparently. And they were like, no, you don't have to keep dancing. So for whatever

828
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,560
reason, we felt like we had to perform for these people. Well, if somebody comes up to us and is

829
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:55,120
bossing us around and leading us with a clipboard or something, we better do everything they say.

830
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:59,920
Let me ask, were these people flirting with you? I don't think so. I mean, Scott's with his wife.

831
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:05,520
I don't know. Okay. Hey, it doesn't mean anything. That's all that's are off with these despicable

832
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,920
me maidens. They didn't, they did not seem interested in us. They didn't seem like they

833
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:15,680
really wanted to be doing what they had to randomly give people every 20 people. They had to give a

834
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:21,760
tour to like once an hour. The minions have their own morality. Sure. They have their own laws and

835
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,440
rules. So, so they claim mates are their husbands and wives within minion worlds or is it just,

836
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:32,400
is it like a question? Is it like wild, wild country? Are they all, do the minions all have

837
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,800
sex parties? Probably the second one. Probably that. Yeah. Hey, look, they didn't have to ask

838
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,760
me to captain the Mark Twain many years ago, but I still, you know, I think it's just so,

839
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,520
it's those little perks we were talking about. I thought you begged to do that. I thought you went

840
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:53,440
up to the captain and were like, please, it's my birthday. I'm 30 years old. Let me drive the boat.

841
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:58,880
Let me drive the boat. I thought that's what it was. Anyway, I guess not. So the journey to get

842
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:05,120
his birthday. It's been as long as the journey to talk about. How, I, I, I, one of the Drew Carey

843
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:12,720
experience when I was young, I did not go on this binaural sound version of Great Moments.

844
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,040
What were the, were they, I'm trying to remember, were they full headphones?

845
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:23,440
Um, they weren't, I don't think as they weren't thick. They were, they were like a little thicker

846
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:29,520
than, it wasn't earbuds, but it was not as, as you're monitoring the audio and your headphones are

847
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,560
covering your whole ear. Maybe they were though. I don't quite recall. I kind of have a feeling,

848
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,400
I kind of have a memory that they were, at least it's a Drew Carey thing.

849
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,880
Okay. That it was like cushioning. I don't remember if you came in with them.

850
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:48,160
I came in with them. During the Lincoln episode. I, yeah. Just talking about Lincoln is making

851
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:56,880
him remember the naps he's taken in the ride. Yeah. Scoring seven naps ago. So this version

852
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:03,360
of the ride, I mean, look, every ride from nine, every new ride from 1990 or to 2008 involved you

853
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:09,680
getting your hair cut some way. They had to use this haircut thing, which, because it does really

854
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:15,920
work, you feel like there are scissors snipping right at your ears. You know, a fun feeling that

855
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:23,280
there are scissors so close inside your ears. Like, why would you want this? And they make jokes about

856
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:29,120
having cut people before. Oh, that's right. Don't worry. I won't cut you. I've cut a lot of people.

857
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:34,880
Their hair, of course. Yeah. We now this one I did listen to and maybe I, in a way I do like this

858
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:40,640
more than just the dry Lincoln speech because it's so bizarre. So the premise that they lay out,

859
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:47,360
like the lights go out and now you are taking on the role of private Cunningham. You fought in the

860
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:52,560
war and now you're going to get, you're going to meet Lincoln. I don't know if you're, you know,

861
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,920
you're going to meet Lincoln or if it's, it just happens to happen by accident. By accident, you do

862
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:05,360
meet Frederick Douglass. So, uh, audio, but also then just, he's talking. They can't simulate,

863
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,400
Hey, this is Frederick Douglass. He's going to put his finger in your ear.

864
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,960
There's no way to the audio doesn't enhance that. And it was like, must your hair up or anything.

865
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:23,440
Hey, old boy, old guy. Yeah. He had like big weird hair. Yeah. Matthew Brady also in this.

866
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,000
Yes. But yeah, you get the civil war photographer,

867
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,600
but you get your hair cut so that you can get a photo taken by civil war photographer,

868
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,120
Matthew Brady. I'm going to keep talking. I'm going to go get you guys keep talking. I'm going

869
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,360
to go get a couple of pairs of scissors and I'm going to try to recreate this.

870
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,480
ASMR experiment live on the podcast. I like this. Okay. So what can we explain?

871
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:52,480
You, yeah. So then, uh, also, uh, the, they say after you get your picture taken, they say,

872
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,440
Oh, are you mating Mr. You're meeting president Lincoln. I'm heading to the white house too.

873
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:03,360
Let's go together. Yeah. So you hitch a ride with some guy, uh, and then,

874
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:10,640
there's a fly at one point, a fly buzzes around your ear, which, all right, I'll give you that.

875
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:16,480
It was a weird, uh, dirty smelly time. The 1800s, there were flies everywhere. I assume.

876
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:22,320
Um, they, their line is literally said, so private Cunningham, are you ready to meet

877
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:29,040
Abraham Lincoln? Like, Oh, the writing of this. Yeah. Uh, are you, are you ready for this

878
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:33,440
experiment? You have scissors now. You guys can finish a recapping and then I will,

879
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:38,240
and then we'll run an experiment. Do you have a fly you can make go into the listeners ears?

880
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:45,200
I can do a Michael Winslow style, uh, impersonation of a fly. Can we make just this episode by NARL?

881
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:52,000
This episode is officially by NARL. Hey, the first by NARL podcast. The ride. Uh, all right.

882
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
So here I'll, I'll just say my name and it by the, in editing, this should be shifting back and

883
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,920
forth rapidly in a Doppler way between your ears. And if it isn't, then Mike fucked up the editing.

884
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,400
Was that pretty crazy? Do you feel like you were inside a washing machine or something?

885
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:15,520
You know what we should do? Uh, let's do, we'll do a quick, like a quick improv as they call it.

886
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:20,560
Sure. You're going to meet Jason Sheridan. All right. So you're okay. Let's figure out a

887
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:27,680
scenario here that you would be going to meet Jason at, uh, what, uh, what if you're trying

888
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:33,200
to petition me to make it so that white union soldiers and black union soldiers get the same

889
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:41,840
pay. So it's still the same scenario, but you're the president or you're just around. Uh, yeah.

890
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:47,040
I think it's better if you're like in an ice cream parlor. All right. So we're at the drive

891
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:52,640
through. You pick the parlor. Yeah, sure. Uh, we're at one of my favorite LA spots, uh, uh,

892
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:57,520
that I try not to go to a lot less. It becomes less special. The drive through Baskin Robbins.

893
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:04,160
That is also a regional training center. Uh, oh yeah. Right here in Burbank. What is the

894
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:09,280
training center do to make it different? Uh, I don't know. Well, it's just like an office building

895
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:14,560
that looks like it has like a Baskin Robbins glued to it. Uh, that also has a drive through.

896
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:19,040
Okay. The drive through is the real star of the show. In this case, are you eating inside?

897
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:23,040
You're inside. All right. That's good. Okay. Which Mike and I discovered recently pretty nice inside.

898
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:29,360
Yes. It has to be pretty nice. Now is it me? Me? Because really in the show, the audience would be.

899
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,800
Well, I think it's the audience. So we have to come up with a name now that the audience is going

900
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:37,520
to assume. So they're, you know, like private Cunningham, for instance, a different name. And

901
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:42,960
we're all sort of assuming this character. Yeah. So maybe, but it has to be a non-gender specific.

902
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:48,400
So let's say that the listener is a doctor. Uh, so you're, you're Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Reynolds. All

903
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,120
right. And you're going to meet Jason Sheridan. But of course you're in the parking lot now

904
01:28:53,120 --> 01:29:00,560
and a barber comes up to you. Excuse me. Um, um, Dr. Reynolds and Scott, you'll be Dr. Reynolds.

905
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,840
Oh wait, but I thought the listener is Dr. Reynolds. All right. I'm getting confused.

906
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:10,640
You just have to direct it to the audience. We could both be, we're two, uh, both barbers.

907
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:15,600
We're both barbers. Okay. Great. Uh, excuse me, Dr. Reynolds, uh, before you go inside this

908
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,320
Baskin-Robbins training center, I think it's very important that I cut your hair in the parking lot.

909
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:24,960
Yes. And me as well. You need to look your best after all you're meeting Jason Sheridan himself.

910
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,920
Yes. So president of ice cream eating. Yes. Uh, and so I think we're going to both be working

911
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:34,720
on you at the same time. Uh, so just a little bit of a trim. You'll, you won't regret it. You'll

912
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:39,520
look smashing in that photograph and you'll show your grandchildren. Yes. And I want you, we're

913
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:46,240
very good at cutting hair. You know, we've, we've never injured a man. Seriously. Ha ha. Just a bit

914
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:52,480
of a joke there. Seriously. We're very safe. Yes. So, uh, of course you have such, such large hair

915
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,200
here. Uh, we're just going to take a little while. Uh, here we go.

916
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:07,200
Almost there. Just a little bit more off the side. I know we're focusing almost only on the sideburns,

917
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:12,640
but that's what they were incredibly long, almost down to your waist. As you know,

918
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:19,440
this is the style that Jason prefers when he meets a stranger. He is very specific. All right. Hold

919
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:25,760
on. Let me just pour a cup of, let me just pour a quick cup of coffee. Ah, yes. You'll need your

920
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:39,120
energy. Okay. Here you go. Would someone get that horse fly out of here? All right. Are you all set?

921
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:44,240
Are you, are you ready to meet Mr. Sheridan? It seems as though you are right this way.

922
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,600
Ah, Dr. Reynolds, welcome to ice cream.

923
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:58,160
And that's it. I guess that's the experience. Wait a minute, Dr. Don't you want to eat ice cream next

924
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:05,360
to Jason and hear what it's like when he eats ice cream? Look, I've been coming here a long time

925
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,080
and I'm telling these people, they have to use more fudge. There's just not enough fudge for my

926
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:16,320
taste. Hold on. Uh, some of the fudge has hardened and I need to cut it.

927
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:24,480
It's my fudge scissors. I keep on me at all times. America, spend your golden wings.

928
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:31,520
And this is an accurate, new fangled simulation of binaural great moments with Mr. Lincoln.

929
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:40,880
I hope you enjoyed this. The podcast The Ride presents great moments with Jason Sheridan and

930
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:48,320
a Baskin-Robbins training parlor presented by the podcast The Ride Historical Society. Yes.

931
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:53,120
Sponsored by culture since 1872 sponsored by scissors.

932
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:01,920
We should have also said before all that to either close your eyes or shut off all the lights,

933
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:11,520
whether you are in a car or on a jog, you should have for full effect, you should have listened to

934
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,640
that in pure darkness. Yes. So go back and do it again and do all the things Scott just said.

935
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,960
Experience it the way it was meant to be. Well, that was good. I think we've really illustrated

936
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,640
what was so successful about it. We really illustrated. Great moments with Mr. Lincoln.

937
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:29,760
This is another issue. We're missing a big part of this and that is that you're not going to be

938
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:35,680
missing a big part of this and that is that you get in a battle and you lose a leg. Oh, that's

939
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:42,720
right. We should have had a moment where an ice cream machine, a freezing machine, a freezer

940
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:51,040
goes haywire and a bunch of springs. And you get amputated by the ice cream machine. So after you

941
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,680
get the joy of meeting Frederick Douglass and then meeting Mr. Lincoln, there's a great little stiff

942
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,560
exchange that's like, oh, he's getting a haircut as well. And it's like, you'll look like you're

943
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:07,600
going to look very natural, Mr. Lincoln. Why, that's exactly what I'd like to avoid. Oh boy,

944
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:15,440
just clever politeness. But Douglass and Lincoln are arguing about pay disputes about Union soldiers.

945
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:20,400
We were talking about pay earlier. I see. Well, you, in this scenario, you were probably talking

946
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:25,360
about union disputes with the Baskin-Robbins employees. Yes. In between. I was trying to

947
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:31,920
unionize the Baskin-Robbins employees. Yeah. A valuable effort. And the training center is

948
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,920
really the place to do it. That's ground zero. Yeah. But anyway, you meet the president and then

949
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,600
you get, and then you're immediately back in the war and you get amputated. You get a leg,

950
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,000
you get a leg blown off. You like, it seems like somebody's just saying your name, Private

951
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,320
Cunningham, Private Cunningham. And then you wake up and you're in the hospital and the doctors did

952
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:53,520
everything they could, but they cut your leg off. And then Lincoln comes in. But there's no, there's

953
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,880
no like sound of like while they're cutting your leg off. No, no. All right. Just a quick snip.

954
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:06,640
Here, hold your leg up towards your ear, please. Make it easier for me to trim it off. And then

955
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:11,920
Lincoln arrives to see the wounded. So not only do you meet Lincoln once, you meet him twice.

956
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:20,400
And he tells you, you have to live son. He gets right up in your ear. This is ASMR. Yeah. You must

957
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:28,400
live boy. You must live. Which is then followed by the narration of Private Cunningham followed

958
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:39,600
the president's order and lived. He would not have. This was a different time. This was before the

959
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:46,080
president would go visit victims and call the people who shot them wacky and goofs and nut nuts

960
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:56,480
and whatever with paper towel rolls and throwing paper towel rolls. So after many years of dry

961
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:01,600
speeches and choruses of children talking about Illinois, suddenly we end up with a little

962
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:09,680
headphone role play the same that previously had been used to make an alien growl on your neck.

963
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:14,800
And now it's the president, you're getting a haircut to meet the president. This was so strange.

964
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:20,400
This is one of the strangest things ever in the Disney. This is the forcing technology they had

965
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:25,040
onto this. It makes more sense for the other applications. A little more sense. I didn't you

966
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,600
get to try on Lincoln's hat. That would have been perfect. A little bit of hair Russell,

967
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:35,200
the famous stove pipe is low. And he'd like you look why I think you look better than me. Not

968
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:42,640
that that's difficult to do. Sure. Also this ends with the entirety of the Gettysburg dress.

969
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:48,400
Oh yeah. The animatronic does a full speech. And what I don't remember is,

970
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:56,720
obviously the Gettysburg dress is iconic. But I feel like I maybe caught the criticism that it was

971
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:03,200
less interesting in a way of a full speech than this great moments for where that's stitching

972
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:08,640
together the great moments. It's all the hits. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a medley. Your favorite

973
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:14,800
thing in a concert when a band plays a medley. Right. Just the choruses or something. That's

974
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:21,200
weird that that happens. I don't like a medley. Except for when Prince did that sampler set.

975
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:26,560
That was kind of cool but also a real cock tease. He's just plowing through. We know we're not

976
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,480
going to hear the whole song. He's just playing the beginning of When Does Cry and he shuts it

977
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:34,640
off. And then he would play like the first like five seconds of Darling Nikki and then he would

978
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:41,120
be like uh-uh. I saw the roots play once and it was an hour long medley. Really? At least. It was

979
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,720
the whole thing was it. Was it their songs or something else? It was their songs. I feel like

980
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:52,880
you're pro medley to get done with this quicker. I don't know. I was just more like oh this is

981
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:59,120
one long jam. Like I didn't really know them that well at the time. That doesn't sound too bad.

982
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:04,400
Yeah that doesn't sound as corny as the Beach Boys doing a medley of all the car songs

983
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:10,640
or uh. Oh no. Yeah. No. Who else does medleys? I'm trying to remember. I mean Lincoln does medleys.

984
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:15,760
Lincoln met Lincoln, Beach Boys, Prince, Jason. Like that's it basically. All the greats. The

985
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:23,200
greats. The great performers of our time. But so this was very strange. It was very odd. And

986
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:31,520
people seemingly not satisfied with Gettysburg. Yeah and then what replaced it was a 50th

987
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:37,760
anniversary movie starring Steve Martin and Donald Duck. Yeah. Now did you ever watch that? Yes I did.

988
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,960
Was that is that was that any good? I don't think I ever did the whole thing. I still play it in the

989
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,440
lobby. I've watched it in the lobby. I don't think I saw it when it was actually in the main theater.

990
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:51,360
I saw it in what? 2005? I didn't see it on the big screen. 50th anniversary. I saw it that would have been

991
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:58,080
when I first started going to Disneyland in 2006. I would have I remember seeing this. I must have

992
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,960
missed it when I went to because the first time I went in 2007 I think. So I must have missed it.

993
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,600
Yeah. For some reason I didn't feel like I needed to go watch a movie. I thought it was nice.

994
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:12,720
Sure. I thought it was very pleasant. Again it was your air conditioned theater. Yeah I like a nice

995
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:17,760
little movie break or a little show break. You know what I like about this and Lincoln is that they

996
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:24,560
would run continuously. I don't like a show with like a set start time. Wait what do you mean? As

997
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:31,760
much. Like can't box you in. Like if you go to Universal Studios and the animal show is going to be at 11 and 1230.

998
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:36,240
Okay I take it back because I do like the animal actor show but like I like a show that you can

999
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:41,440
just squeeze in wherever because you know oh every 15-20 minutes. It's easier to do if it's robots.

1000
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:47,280
You're just saying it's like it's that runs more basically. Yeah it runs continuously. Still I don't

1001
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,240
know what it says on there but it'll run like 50-20 minutes. It runs continuously for no one and I think maybe

1002
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:58,720
we should talk about the greater issue with this which is I would say at this point it's not a real

1003
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:04,080
priority to like replace this or do something better but there was a moment where they were

1004
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:10,880
going to evict Lincoln for Muppet Vision 3D. Yes. And there was a lot of people were I remember

1005
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:16,720
newspaper articles growing up here. I remember people being upset about that and I even saw a

1006
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:23,280
quote that is so weenery that it sounds like something child Scott would have said which a

1007
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:31,360
12 year old was quoted as saying Lincoln was president Kermit is a frog and that's why you

1008
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:40,160
can't put the fun Muppet show into the theater. Wait frog or fraud? Not a fraud. No this child

1009
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:46,240
didn't think that Kermit didn't earn his entertainment success. Did you just call him Kermit?

1010
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:49,840
Did I say Kermit? I'm pretty sure you just called him Kermit. Probably force of habit I do

1011
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:56,320
something called Tiny Fuppets which is a Portuguese ripoff of Muppet Babies. Did I say Kermit every

1012
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:02,240
time? No no. Last time I think you said call him Kermit. I do a thing with all these ripoffs of

1013
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:08,880
Muppet characters so it's very so I've said the word Kermit a lot more than Kermit so it's very

1014
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:14,160
force of habit thanks for pointing it out. I figured you could get a plug-in real quick too.

1015
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:19,920
Um that's true yeah well and yeah we'll go to tinyfuppets.com and there may be some

1016
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:29,680
new Tiny Fuppets activity in the near future. But anyway Kermit people were upset I was going to

1017
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:34,960
evict Lincoln. There were like like fans really this was an early this is a pretty internet

1018
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:41,600
instance of the fanboys being furious that they were going to take away something beloved and

1019
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:46,320
yet even in that article it's clear like the Imagineers are a little baffled they're like

1020
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:49,840
it's funny that everybody's so upset about this because you know what they weren't doing was

1021
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:57,200
going to the show attraction. Now I don't think they boned that decision necessarily because

1022
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:02,880
Muppet Vision 3D did make it to Disneyland in California Adventure and they don't even run it

1023
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,600
all the time anymore. They use that it's done. Is it done forever? I think so. They use it mainly for

1024
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:14,000
to that theater to preview upcoming films and your wrinkles and times and what have you.

1025
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,920
But the so I don't know that they made the bad decision but Muppet Vision was real hot at the

1026
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:27,600
time. A lot of popularity a lot of hype about it coming out of Florida and I maybe I don't know

1027
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,840
at the time maybe it would have been a good move too and I think we just we should be open to the

1028
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,560
idea that if there's a better idea one day why do we have to keep this attraction? Well it's

1029
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:42,000
it's interesting you're bringing this up. I have I'm conflicted on that because as you know we're

1030
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,560
all very progressive when it comes to rides and people changing things at the parks but I do think

1031
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,560
there's something nice about Main Street sort of being untouched like the idea that it's still

1032
01:41:52,560 --> 01:42:00,720
Lincoln that is a very dry pretty boring historical lesson through the lens of Walt Disney.

1033
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:05,120
It's nice that it's on Main Street because Main Street still kind of feels untouched even though

1034
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:09,680
there's a little Starbucks in there but it's nicely hidden and it's still themed. You know what I will

1035
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:13,920
you know what maybe I'll take that back. I love the Muppet show they do in Orlando there's a real

1036
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:18,400
puppet practical puppet show they do in Liberty Square. Oh yeah they like they poke their heads

1037
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:23,120
out of the windows. It's wonderful and everyone gathers around and it's so nice to see the actual

1038
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:28,000
Muppets like you see them in person and there are five different shows so if you do something I feel

1039
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:34,320
like that might be in the spirit of Main Street it might be okay but I do like I do like having

1040
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:39,440
something dry and boring in that place. Well it also makes the most sense there yeah and it fits

1041
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:46,160
the theme yeah of everything so I would be I would be almost more precious about it than I would be

1042
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:50,320
other places in the park for some reason. I don't know why. I think it's weird that they got away with

1043
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:56,800
taking it out for like four or five years to have Steve Martin and Donald Duck talk about Disneyland but

1044
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,920
it wasn't supposed to last that long but yeah or four years sorry four years and then Lincoln came

1045
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:08,880
back with the new and improved in 2009 the current version that we have now. They made a big deal.

1046
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:14,160
And it is improved yeah what you were saying you were withholding your thoughts. No I just like it I

1047
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:19,360
don't know that I have I like it. It's no revolutionary they actually they went back to a lot of original

1048
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:25,840
stuff. Yeah yeah they did. To Paul Freese. Because they had taken Paul Freese off and Royal Dano there

1049
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:32,240
have been another who are much better than the journeys to Gettysburg. Yeah yeah they had different

1050
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:38,080
actors there and they put the original stuff back on. Yeah that might have been also like the like I

1051
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:42,480
wonder if you actually were to gather up the amount of people that were protesting though the Lincoln

1052
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:47,840
going away and added up to people that were protesting like Tower of Terror going away.

1053
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,560
Is it possible that just because it was early on and people protesting things it felt like a bigger

1054
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:57,760
deal. And because there was less precedent. I think that's what that's what that may be the first

1055
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,640
instance of like a beloved classic thing being taken out. And they were like oh shit like

1056
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:07,200
where people are so mad and it was really like 150 people. We may have just not heard about when

1057
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:13,360
inner space was taken out. Well that is a question I have for imagineers and historians is what were

1058
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:19,760
that what was it like back then when a when a move excuse me a ride like that where was taken out

1059
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:24,720
were people really upset or did people just go to the park and go huh it's gone it's something else

1060
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:29,440
and they didn't give a shit. The way it probably should be although there's things we're upset

1061
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:34,320
about I guess. Yeah it depends I mean obviously it depends what it is. But yeah like I wonder if it

1062
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:40,560
was like just a very vocal 50 people and imagineers and management was like oh no like I don't want to

1063
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,680
I don't want them to be mad at us but like Tower of Terror had maybe some stupid petition online

1064
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:50,000
that was 15,000 strong and they're like who gives a shit they're gonna go on the new one they'll

1065
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,640
like it. I'm sure there's a damned if you do damned if you don't element of like well in the if we

1066
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:02,320
change it people complain if we don't change it yeah either people complain it's boring or

1067
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:07,120
no one goes. Like there should have been I'll say this there should have been a massive protest when

1068
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:12,320
the country bears were taken out of Disneyland. I wasn't here at the time and it wasn't even my

1069
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:17,680
favorite ride at that time but I am so upset that it's not there that that might be the one of the

1070
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:23,280
only ones I would actually like go down there with a sign. I let you down I could have I could have

1071
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:30,640
represented California. Yeah I didn't I apologize. The country bears. I wasn't mobilized now I'm more

1072
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:36,160
engaged and I'll I will fight the fight on anything else that. I would like I will go down there and

1073
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:43,200
protest the wages for the workers and the removal of country bears over a decade ago. Those are two

1074
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:49,360
causes I really believe in. You flip a sign and it says and while I'm here yeah right as well get

1075
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:55,200
this out. Yeah. Is there any way to reverse that? The heads are still up in the back. Yeah can we

1076
01:45:55,200 --> 01:46:02,480
please poo no one goes on that poo bear ride. I think I think my Lincoln thing is like absolutely

1077
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:08,880
leave it and they it's good that they did a refresh and they're you know keeping it you know

1078
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:15,760
pristine but I think we should be open to the idea that if something was better to go in there but

1079
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:23,760
the Disney show situation like I'm not I'm not so into anything they've recently done. I'm not like

1080
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:30,480
dying to get PhilharMagic in their Florida show. I don't think there is a good candidate I'm just

1081
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:36,000
saying if it ever. No. There are probably there's probably a way to make the show a little bit more

1082
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,000
interesting. It's not putting headphones on the audience. Well because a lot of it is the paintings

1083
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:48,240
like from the Epcot. Yeah yeah yeah. From the American Adventure a lot of it before Lincoln

1084
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:53,120
starts talking. Is Two Brothers still in it? Yes oh yeah. Two Brothers is very much alive.

1085
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:59,760
Honestly I would like more of the animatronic. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying there's a version

1086
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:04,320
I don't know if we have other animatronics added to it or he becomes like that cartoonish

1087
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,400
robot more and he like gets up real close to the stage can we get him to walk a little more

1088
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,320
because right now he still kind of just gets like pulled it seems like there's like an invisible

1089
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:16,960
string that pulls him out of the chair. Like if we could get him to walk a little bit if we could

1090
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:21,360
get that robot a little more sophisticated I think a lot more people will go in if he's like maybe

1091
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:26,000
like doing the Jay Leno start of the show he goes down and he slaps hands with the front row or

1092
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,600
something like let's get something flashier in there for Lincoln to do. Have you heard about this? Have you seen this?

1093
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:36,480
I don't want him to do Lewinsky jokes but I'm just saying if he can do something more impressive maybe.

1094
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:42,240
Well you know what we missed is the fact that the the urban legend of the story and I think I saw

1095
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:46,800
an engineer talking about it so I think it's true that when they were first testing this robot during

1096
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:53,280
the uh the 64 World's Fair that they they they brought a bunch of Illinois specific dignitaries

1097
01:47:53,280 --> 01:48:00,480
and they ran a test for them and the uh there was a problem and hydraulic fluid leaked out of the neck

1098
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:06,560
of the robot the shot out of the neck and straight this is where it seems made up but the

1099
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,200
engineer says that it is true that the hydraulic fluid they were using was red.

1100
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:17,760
My god. So it seemed as though he was gushing blood from the neck as though he had been shot.

1101
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:24,240
There's a clip online of the Lincoln animatronic in the hall of presidents slowly falling over.

1102
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:30,080
Oh yes. It's very funny. I think it was in America's funniest videos episode too.

1103
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,480
They had creaky sound effects. Yeah. Oh we'll post that though. That is in the speech. It's great.

1104
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:39,520
Never stops. It never stops. He keeps but he just bends perfectly. The show must go on. But anyway

1105
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:46,800
the I I think maybe you nod to that history and you just I think maybe we do shoot Lincoln

1106
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:52,400
on stage. Oh wow. We load him up with blood. Look I don't normally I wouldn't go for that normally

1107
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:59,680
but for a Halloween overlay yes. Oh that's that's fine. Uh I found a weird fact about this uh show

1108
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:07,440
um in okay in the modern family episode from season three where they go to Disneyland. Uh huh.

1109
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:14,640
Uh okay this is uh quote the episode closed with the family sitting together watching great

1110
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:20,240
moments with Mr. Lincoln. Jay Pritchard which is Ed O'Neill's character reflects that watching the

1111
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:25,680
show with his kids while they were young inspired him to stay with his wife for the sake of the

1112
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:36,640
children. Isn't that weird? Yeah it is weird. Huh well and much much earlier I guess uh on a

1113
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:43,840
different sitcom Lincoln offered advice uh to a different character who was having love issues

1114
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:49,680
uh Blossom's brother. Uh we I did a lot of tweets about a very bizarre Blossom episode that was

1115
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:53,440
shot at Disneyland and there's a very strange moment where you watch the end of the Lincoln

1116
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:59,600
show where he just sits down and then no curtain comes it's just the lights stay on the end.

1117
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:04,480
Everyone gets up and leaves they don't lower the curtain on Lincoln so he's just sitting there

1118
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:08,320
but then you find out why because everybody leaves but then Blossom's brother stays behind

1119
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:13,760
and Lincoln starts talking to him in kind of like a borshbelty voice uh and uh

1120
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:20,080
and he I had one all the audio is great but I just was one of my favorite joke that he says

1121
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:28,720
here you go. I just don't know what to do. Do? Enjoy. You're lucky. Ever see what married Todd

1122
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:36,640
looked like? Whoa! This is this lounge lizard voice delivering a joke about his Lincoln roasting

1123
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:43,520
his wife. Lincoln's unwell wife. Mentally unwell. The old ball and show boy I love the if I had a

1124
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:50,720
melania on my hands it'd be no problem. Um I yeah quite a moment and it's unclear whether it's like

1125
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:55,440
magic there's never a moment where he like somebody comes back and taps Blossom's brother on the

1126
01:50:55,440 --> 01:51:00,640
shoulder and says like hey are you okay you fell asleep there I think just in the reality of Blossom.

1127
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:07,200
Lincoln comes to life. Lincoln came to life. Or he was possessed. Or was possessed sure uh but not by

1128
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:13,120
Lincoln's ghost but by the ghost of like uh. Cat skills comedian. Yeah yeah. Lenny something. Yeah

1129
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:20,480
yeah Lenny or Lenny Allen. Forgotten. Favorite comedian Lenny Allen. But so uh and also but also

1130
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:28,320
they did custom uh animation I think for the like like Blossom got them to do specific programming

1131
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:34,560
uh um uh in an episode apparently directed by Bill Bixby the Incredible Hulk uh odd fact about that

1132
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:42,400
so Bill Bixby was overseeing custom animation turning Lincoln into an old comedian um so I think

1133
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,640
all this does is show that Lincoln is you can reprogram him you can do other things. Yeah. He

1134
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:55,040
can break character a bit. Lincoln sings the atardee let it go. I mean that would kill at the park.

1135
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:59,440
Sure. People would love that. Pack the house in. I think yeah I think you can do with with the big

1136
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:04,160
thing in in rides now is that you know it just changes up every time you go on there's a slightly

1137
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:08,640
different experience or you'd get a different like Indiana Jones you were at a certain point you got

1138
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:13,360
different like temples with different colors and stuff um but with Guardians you get different

1139
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:18,080
songs so I think yeah maybe changing up the Lincoln show sometimes you get the Gettysburg

1140
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:26,640
address sometimes he sings uh you know famous Disney songs. One is all roast jokes about his wife.

1141
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:34,720
Yeah. She's so crazy. I'm gonna uh say you know because because trends are so cyclical um if they

1142
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:40,640
go back to a thing that seemed like they were trying to really get to catch on a few years ago

1143
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:46,960
of personalization so it's just the full Lincoln speeches but just every now and then he has they

1144
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:55,840
have to slip in like Jason Jason no no pal all the armies of Europe and Asia and Africa combined

1145
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:02,560
could not take a drink from the Mississippi Eric. Well you know what you could actually do so you

1146
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:07,920
don't have to use that terrible ET technology where he garbles voices just do the turtle talk

1147
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:14,880
with uh with crush technology have some teenager backstage he's making Lincoln talk so Lincoln can

1148
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:21,200
do crowd work so like he can do the speech too but also he can address the people and they can ask

1149
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:26,240
him questions oh yeah I think that would be great hey that was my time folks but we got a little

1150
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:31,680
bit left if anybody was wondering if you want to line up by the microphone over here he could do

1151
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:37,840
that like a real inoffensive kind of topical comedy where you don't really take a shot at anyone it's

1152
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:45,360
like I don't know about this guy and the current guy in the White House but the opposite isn't much

1153
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:51,760
better either right like it's the most whitewashed. That was a little controversial for a theme park

1154
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:56,160
that that material I feel like it would have to be the non-political he would have to be like uh

1155
01:53:56,160 --> 01:54:02,080
like he would have to be the Simpson's congress joke like those those kooky guys those clowns in

1156
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:08,240
congress on then everyone would clap and that would be it yeah uh what's the uh the congress oh it like

1157
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:13,840
well I thought the civil war was bad but uh I'd trade it in in a second to not have to sit through

1158
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,600
a capital steps performance and then there would be like and it's a small it would be some of the

1159
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:24,000
same jokes from that improv disney show and pleasure island and you'd be like uh you know

1160
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:30,640
it's not as annoying as it's a small world after all that'll make anyone gush red hydraulic fluid

1161
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:38,400
up their neck when I see those little dolls in the animatronic lounge I get I get mad creeped out

1162
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:46,480
what else what else is going on hold on let me check my composition book I mean this would be

1163
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:52,400
the hit of the park quilled any other ideas lately oh here's one

1164
01:54:52,400 --> 01:55:02,960
oh well there we go that's that's a fix yeah you know live puppeting um hey and we I think we all

1165
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:08,560
just clearly proved we could be the puppeteers if they suddenly need three guys to do perfect

1166
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:14,560
Lincoln impressions yeah yeah and then if if that or if you if maybe they want to bring back

1167
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:20,240
binaural sound obviously we're also very good at that yeah so we can and we'll we'll do it live

1168
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:24,880
and we'll do the one here with one hand and scissor with another and like here

1169
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,240
maybe that's like an enhanced experience at gibson girl

1170
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:39,040
we have ice cream with jason jordan i'm in yeah uh you get to hear the sound of the scoop

1171
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:42,720
and then like you're whispering into their ear like isn't that rocky road good

1172
