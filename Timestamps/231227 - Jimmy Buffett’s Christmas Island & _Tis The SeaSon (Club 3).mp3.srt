1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,680
attraction music

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,000
It's official. Christmas is better than magic.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,480
It's been officially determined here on Club 3

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,600
via the last Club 3 poll. I'm Scott Garen, you're my Carlson Jason shirt.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Hello.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Magic sucks.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Magic sucks.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,320
We can finally say it.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,080
We're saying it now. We're saying Merry Christmas and we're saying

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Magic is shitty magic.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Um...

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,080
No magic is better than the birth of the baby Jesus.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,480
As many miracles, don't be true magic.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Yeah, if you didn't notice or don't recall,

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,480
the Club 3 poll, we realized there was something interesting happening.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,480
There were some Christmas topics and several magic topics.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
So why not pair them together?

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,480
The magic of Christmas versus the magic of magic.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,480
And the magic of Christmas ultimately won with today's topic,

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Jimmy Buffett's Christmas Island.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Um...

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Chris Angel's magic with the stars got trounced,

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
coming in hot as a nominee.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
And yet I think maybe...

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
I just think there was a need and a desire to celebrate Jimmy.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,880
As you hear this, we have just passed the...

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Not just the first Christmas, minus Jimmy Buffett,

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
but also his birthday.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
His birthday was Christmas.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
A fact that comes up in some of his Christmas music.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
The song Working and Playing.

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Which is not a Christmas song, I should say.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm blanking because I screwed up.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Do we have to listen to it on this then?

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
If it references that fact?

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
We sure could.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
It's a newer one in the last 10 years, I believe.

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Because I believe the show we saw was the Working and Playing Tour.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
That is correct.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
The one I was at?

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
The one you were at.

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
I believe it was Working and Playing.

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
That was sort of the title of the tour.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I didn't hold on to the premise of the tour.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
The title and theme of the tour.

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Of being working and playing.

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
I believe it's the first line in the song.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
It wasn't by choice that I was born on Christmas.

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I believe that's the lyric.

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
And then something about floating on...

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
What a heavenly sound.

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
I can't even say the word.

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
He does a Christmas-ismus rhyme.

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Did he play it live on the Working and Playing Tour?

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
I think he did. I think he had to do it.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
It's the name of the tour.

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
I gotta do it if it's the name of the tour.

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
We should look up the setlist for that night and see.

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Oh yeah.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
I've been looking at the setlist.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Not for Jimmy.

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Just for lots of bands.

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
It's fun to see a show 20 years ago

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
that you saw and find that the setlist is available

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
and you can remember parts of it

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
and then you forgot totally parts of it.

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Oh certainly.

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
In this case, with me, forgot all of it.

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
The whole thing.

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
He did Cheeseburger in Paradise.

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
You know, Finns Happen.

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Seems right.

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Did he play Margaritaville?

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
I believe he did.

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
I have a faint memory that he played Margaritaville.

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Well Jason looks that up.

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
In terms of magic, Fox's Masked Magician special

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
is held on as the runner-up.

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
So that will need to defend its title

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
one more time.

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
The Fighting Masked Magicians.

82
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Can they make it in January?

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
We will see.

84
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
But we need four new ideas to go against it.

85
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
No theme. Whatever you want.

86
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
I do have one more little Club 3 assignment.

87
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Should I say that now?

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Or do you have the setlist, Jason?

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
I believe October 22, 2015.

90
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Does that sound right?

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,880
I think that's right.

92
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Setlist.fm

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
And I'll remind you, you don't have to read the entire thing.

94
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Oh, okay.

95
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Well, obviously you started with Rag Top Day.

96
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
And then off to see the Lizard.

97
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Working and playing number 3.

98
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
There you go.

99
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
So that does answer the question.

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
So we don't have to continue.

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
What was the encore, perhaps?

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
That's fine. Cut to the end.

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Let's ask what the stretch was.

104
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,280
It just says, oldest surfer on the beach.

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Yeah, I know that.

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Scarlet Begonias, which is a

107
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Grateful Dead cover.

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
And Brown Eyed Girl was Van Moris' cover.

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
I remember he did his cover of Brown Eyed Girl.

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
I do remember that.

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
And of course he did Southern Cross.

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
And he did the Back Where I Come From.

113
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
In what world is of course

114
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
He did Southern Cross a relatable statement

115
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
to even all the people in this room.

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Well, he always does.

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Of course Southern Cross.

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I say that because he always does Southern Cross.

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
What's Southern Cross?

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
The song Southern Cross.

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
I know it's a song.

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
This is the fastest to me being

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
It's a Crosby, Stills, Nash cover.

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
I've seen

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
live videos.

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
And he inevitably does that.

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
And he also does Back Where I Come From.

128
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
The Kenny Chessy song written by Mac McAnally.

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Of course.

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Future Country Bears contributor.

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Mac.

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Look, I know some people know

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
that's a guy in the band.

134
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Some people listening are not

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Buffett experts.

136
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Every single person

137
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
listening is a Jimmy Buffett

138
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
band and set list expert.

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
If this was the main feed I'd say absolutely

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
you're right. But no, I think everybody

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
I'm actually shocked this won.

142
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Quite frankly, I know people have affection

143
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
for the plane and everything, but I'm like

144
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
wow, really?

145
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
I am a little bit too and I think I do

146
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
attribute this to that it was the year of

147
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
his passing. I think everybody

148
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
felt like we needed to

149
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
end because this is the final

150
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
episode of 2023.

151
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
You're getting it here on Club 3. So what better

152
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
way I guess to end

153
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
than with the tributes to one of the greats

154
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
who we lost this year.

155
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
That being said

156
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm not sure if people would have voted for it if they knew

157
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
just how much Buffett was coming

158
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
in the upcoming series

159
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
City Walk Orlando Saga

160
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Multiverse of Madness, which brings me to

161
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
my next point before we fully

162
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
dive into Buffett.

163
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
I didn't talk this over with you guys, but just see

164
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
if you agree with this plan as I say it.

165
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
You know that next year, 2024

166
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
will be the year of the City Walk

167
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Orlando Saga Multiverse of Madness.

168
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
We are currently consulting

169
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
with the Sector Keeper.

170
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
We've had many dense

171
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
prayer sessions and

172
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
workshops to try to figure out

173
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
exactly what our journey will entail

174
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
and how this is going to work for all of us.

175
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
But we've

176
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
had the question

177
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
what do we do with Club 3?

178
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Club 3 has not existed

179
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
for a daily saga

180
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
yet. So this is the first time

181
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
we've previously used

182
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
the second gate, but

183
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
not Club 3. So I guess

184
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
in addition to just give us your regular

185
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
topics for January, separately

186
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
I want to know

187
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
what do you want Club 3

188
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
as far as the City Walk

189
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Orlando Saga goes?

190
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Do we do the most

191
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
deep, obscure

192
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
insane thing,

193
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
a never built thing, a closed thing?

194
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
How obscure do we go?

195
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Or do you

196
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
the elite Club 3 members

197
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
take one of the biggest things that there is?

198
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Whatever that is.

199
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
It's a weird scale we're dealing with here

200
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
as far as City Walk.

201
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Let's find out what you consider

202
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
a big one, or what is the

203
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
deepest possible dive we

204
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
could do. Do we think this is a fair

205
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
question to ask? Just ask our audience

206
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
at this point. What do you want?

207
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Well, I'm going to put my

208
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
thumb on the scale a little for January.

209
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
I want to talk

210
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
about that mass magician. I want to talk

211
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
about those shows that haunted me.

212
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
I've tried twice. So, I think

213
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
there is a clamoring for it, but this is

214
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
a democracy.

215
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
In February, though, you could also vote for

216
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Masked Magician. Maybe you want a nice break

217
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
in the middle of this saga.

218
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
And we'll warp to a different

219
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
universe.

220
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
You're saying that there's a possibility that

221
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Club 3 doesn't want to be

222
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
part of the saga. That they actually want to

223
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
step outside of it. Or I would say even if

224
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
there's an outdoor mall that's in the

225
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
LA area that you like

226
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
and you want to send us there for a mini

227
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
saga, so we could do that too.

228
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
This is true. We haven't said much about, and I don't want

229
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
to say much about what multiverse

230
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
refers to exactly, but it does

231
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
open up possibilities of

232
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
other places that we could

233
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
be sent. So, that's a

234
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
very good think outside the box.

235
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Something completely, you could

236
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
pull us out of Orlando. We might all

237
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
need a break by then from Cityhawk,

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Orlando. I mean, there's plenty of places

239
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
that are pretty close to here that we've mentioned.

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Just think about it. That's all I'll say.

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Does it have to be close to here?

242
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
I guess it doesn't. I suppose it doesn't.

243
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
It helps us to go there, but I think people

244
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
wish it was like Times Square, I don't think.

245
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Well, they can send us to go read about things

246
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
in Times Square. They can send us

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
across the world if they want. I think we've all

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
been to Times Square a number of

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
times. Various years,

250
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
various configurations.

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
That's true.

252
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
So, if you want the topic in that

253
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
month to be Times Square,

254
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
then it could be that.

255
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Basically, possibilities are endless,

256
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
but just, you know, in addition to general

257
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
topics, I'm sorry to give you so much homework.

258
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
I know that it's a holiday break,

259
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
but we do need to, we do need

260
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
a path forward on this.

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
We want to figure out in advance. So, if there's things

262
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
people are excited about in Cityhawk,

263
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Orlando, we'll do a poll way ahead of time

264
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
and figure out what we're doing. We still don't know exactly

265
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
what month it's going to happen, but we do.

266
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
This is a crucial piece, I think, in figuring

267
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
out the puzzle that is going to be

268
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
this daily saga.

269
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
So, please give us your ideas

270
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
for regular stuff and for Cityhawk

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
stuff or wherever you want to send us.

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Vote with your likes. Put that all in the comments.

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
And with that, now we can

274
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
officially move on to JB.

275
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Jimmy Buffett Christmas.

276
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Jimmy Buffett Christmas.

277
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
He was, can I say other people who were born

278
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
on Christmas? Ryan Seacrest,

279
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Karl Rove, great Americans.

280
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Only the best.

281
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Yes.

282
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
It's like, oh, that's good.

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
And it's Karl Rove,

284
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
who was the one who was like, and my

285
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
birthday is separate, okay?

286
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
So, there's gifts on Christmas

287
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
and then there's great gifts

288
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
from my birthday. What's funny, you bring

289
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
this up, this is a thing Jimmy brought up while he

290
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
was alive, obviously, that he didn't

291
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
like it when people would like try to combine

292
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
a gift for him. Yeah.

293
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
And he could smell that a mile away when he was a kid.

294
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Because I imagine that would happen.

295
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
I think that happens to you if your

296
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
birthday is December 20th.

297
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I think anywhere in the vicinity, that's

298
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
the trouble you're getting. My dad's

299
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
is November 29th, my mom's

300
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
is December 15th.

301
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
So, I've tried to make a point of

302
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
like, sending

303
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
a gift or sending flowers

304
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
or something on their actual birthday.

305
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
So, I didn't do the like, and here's the

306
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
extra present on Christmas morning.

307
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Yeah.

308
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
He was talking about his mother, apparently, too,

309
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
was very insistent that the family give

310
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
him two gifts. He said more, he was talking

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
about how this didn't sit well with him, but he said,

312
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
more importantly, it did not sit well with my mother

313
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
who made it known. In no uncertain terms

314
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
to the aunts, uncles, and cousins of the Buffett

315
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
clan strung out along the Gulf

316
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Coast that she expected two

317
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
presents for her bouncing baby

318
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
boy. One for his birthday

319
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
and one for Christmas.

320
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Wow. So, laid down the law.

321
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Not as easy going as her son

322
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
would turn out to be. Right. Or at least

323
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
the character. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

324
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
In reality, yes. He was

325
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
this friendship's over.

326
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
One gift

327
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
and we're done. It's hard because I want to talk about

328
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
more, I guess I really do want to kind of just

329
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
focus on the Christmas Island because, again, there is a

330
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
lot of Buffett coming. I have

331
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
a lot of recent Buffett thoughts, but I don't

332
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
think that they belong here. I think this is

333
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Christmas time. I mean, something could

334
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I mean, you're right, that's

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
good to God, but does anything feel like it

336
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
needs to be said in this, the

337
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
year of his terrible

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh, of his passing?

339
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
I don't know, just sort of general.

340
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I forget who said it, but like

341
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
there was a somebody said it in the

342
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
band, like, you know what? Or no, Jimmy said it to

343
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
the band, like, let the party

344
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
continue. So I'm like, oh, it

345
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
seems like the Coral Reifers

346
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
are going to go out without

347
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
him. So

348
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
this is an interesting topic in general we've talked about

349
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
lately and a lot of things have popped

350
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
up lately is the what happens

351
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
after a very successful

352
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
lucrative band

353
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
or musician dies?

354
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
How will in a state

355
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
continue to make money?

356
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Yes, and especially

357
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
how do

358
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
very popular bands

359
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
that wrap it up or pass away

360
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
that are of the boomer

361
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
generation make sure

362
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
that they keep their mitts

363
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
on the marketplace and don't ever

364
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
give up or pass the baton to

365
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
anyone else even post their death.

366
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
How do we make sure there are no

367
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
new stars and it keeps going

368
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
our great grandchildren? There's no

369
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
bands. You're not allowed to have

370
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
bands. I don't care if you're

371
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Kiss or the Democratic Party, no bands.

372
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah, so I mean it's interesting

373
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I look when I go see the Coral Reifers

374
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
without him, maybe

375
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
it might be fun if it's the same

376
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
environment. I think everyone

377
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
in the audience would, our audience

378
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
who as we established, knows

379
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
every single member of the Coral Reifers.

380
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Of course, yes. The club three only.

381
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
The club three people who know, yes.

382
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Yeah, I mean if Mack

383
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
frontstead. I don't think

384
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I don't know, Mack can sing, Mack's done his own

385
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
concerts, but I feel like you're going to get a different singer.

386
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
You can't get somebody to do an impression

387
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
of him, but I feel like maybe you do rotating singers.

388
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Scott and I saw the revolution without Prince

389
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
after Prince died, but that was sort of

390
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
just that one like stretch of tribute

391
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
shows. I think that would have been not

392
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
a great thing to do.

393
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Well, I guess it was his passing, but it was also

394
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
way after they had ever played with him.

395
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
So there's also the emotion of just

396
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
that they're back together and maybe this is a good

397
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
excuse. I think the immediate

398
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
let's try to keep going

399
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
could be tough. There's something

400
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
odd about that. Or maybe this is

401
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
the time. Maybe you do it, I think you do it

402
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
now and you don't do it forever.

403
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Sure, yeah.

404
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Well, if it's a two-hander

405
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
if all the band backing it up

406
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
and it's Mack and

407
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Jimmy collaborator Alan Jackson

408
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Alan Jackson is like retiring though soon.

409
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
He's like in his late 60s, I think.

410
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
The club three knows that

411
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Mike. Everyone knows what

412
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Alan Jackson's up to.

413
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Alan Jackson, I believe is on some sort of a retirement tour.

414
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I could be wrong. He, of course,

415
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
wrote It's Five O'Clock Somewhere.

416
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
Right. But

417
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Jimmy's on that song and it is

418
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
a big hit and maybe a lot of people

419
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
know that song better than not Margaritaville,

420
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
but almost every other song he's got maybe

421
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
other than Cheeseburger. I think Jimmy's first

422
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
charting song. Something like that.

423
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Yeah, it was a big hit.

424
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
Jimmy does that in concert. So, no, I don't think

425
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Alan, I'm not against it. I like

426
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Alan Jackson. I could list the songs I like

427
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
of Alan Jackson's, but I don't think he's

428
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
the guy to keep the band

429
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
going for another 10 years.

430
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
He's got his own hits. He's got a bunch of them.

431
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Yeah, I know. So I'm just saying

432
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
we need a young person.

433
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
We need a young person who plays the guitar.

434
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
You need a dead in company. You need a

435
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
mayor. Yeah, or you just need like

436
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
a podcaster who maybe

437
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
is seasoned as far as his actual

438
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
age is concerned. Comfortable on stage.

439
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
He's youthful. Yeah, cool.

440
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
You wouldn't be able to, you would never guess

441
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
what age he is. You wouldn't guess.

442
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
And we won't today

443
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
either. 18, 19? Sorry,

444
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
I know I wasn't supposed to guess, but you, sorry,

445
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
you just, you look 18. You got a backwards

446
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
cap. You look 18. You get

447
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
carded for those hard seltzers

448
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
that taste like candy. Those bomb

449
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
pop seltzers.

450
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
So yeah, a guy

451
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
like that maybe you want, maybe somebody

452
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
an unknown perhaps. Cause I don't

453
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
know, but you can't get the Adam Lambert

454
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Queen thing, which they've been doing this now for so

455
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
long and that's pretty popular, but

456
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I don't know. I don't always

457
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
You can't copy that formula.

458
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
You know, you don't want somebody who's well

459
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
known for their great singing.

460
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
You want somebody maybe from

461
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
another medium who could surprise

462
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
people with his breadth of talent.

463
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Exactly.

464
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
And would that person be willing to

465
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
keep up Jimmy's image

466
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
and shave a bald spot

467
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
into his own head?

468
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Only that person can answer.

469
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Whoever that is, I would be comfortable with

470
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
whoever you're talking about. Yes, I think that's what they

471
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
would have to do. Would he be comfortable performing on

472
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
stage barefoot?

473
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Yeah, yes.

474
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
So front of the paywall.

475
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
There was some hesitancy

476
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
there. Yeah, I just I've

477
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
been walking like when I walk outside,

478
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
I feel like my feet get messed up.

479
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Whoever this is, his feet

480
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
might get messed up a little bit. So I

481
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
feel like it's better to have shoes. But again,

482
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
if you're on the, he had like a rug

483
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
out on the stage. That's a comfortable

484
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
place. Yeah, one of those padded

485
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
like, you stand

486
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
at the sink, you get a little pad.

487
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Well, there must be, there's probably

488
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
a way to develop kind of like

489
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
invisible insoles

490
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
that pad your feet,

491
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
but also blend into your skin

492
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
tone so that it looks like you're

493
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
barefoot without you having to actually

494
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
be. And I know that's not something that

495
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
the 70 year old performer needed,

496
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
but maybe the

497
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
close to 40 year old, again, just

498
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
guessing ages. Yeah, the person. Some

499
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
practical calluses on

500
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
the insoles. Right. Yeah.

501
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
And the person could slip in his own, like

502
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
say like, hey, we're doing one of mine tonight

503
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
too.

504
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
And like that would be like a good way to get

505
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
out there. Huck up apps.

506
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
So just really

507
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
quick to explain this is from this is a McGruff

508
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
album. I made some stuff in

509
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
style of McGruff. Yeah, I've tried

510
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
to explain to somebody who doesn't know the podcast

511
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
what that is. And they go, okay.

512
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
McGruff? Oh,

513
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
okay. Interesting.

514
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
What year is it? What year is it?

515
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I don't think I've ever, podcast or no, I don't think I've

516
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
ever been a part of anything that didn't require

517
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
a full four sentences of

518
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
onboarding before you can enjoy the

519
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
this is, yes,

520
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
my body of work and all of ours.

521
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Eventually, you

522
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
develop the phrase, hey, don't worry about

523
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
it. What's up with you?

524
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
How are you doing, brother? How are you?

525
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
How are you?

526
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Been to the movies lately?

527
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
How about the weather? So yeah, so that I was thinking about that

528
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
because yeah, I am

529
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
very interested to see how every

530
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
major act tackles

531
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
this issue of how do we stay alive forever?

532
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Well, we had a good old, you know,

533
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
we got to get to Christmas. We can't get

534
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
in this whole tangent, but we

535
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
were delighted to discover that Griffin Newman

536
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
was a man on the ground for

537
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
a historical event, which was the

538
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
final Kiss concert at

539
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
which it would be determined how

540
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
will Kiss move forward

541
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
post their actually

542
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
being there at the concerts

543
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
and how headlines described

544
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
it was Kiss announces a hologram

545
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Kiss that will take kind of

546
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
like what ABBA's been doing

547
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
and how Griffin described

548
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
it actually playing out was

549
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
the band left and then

550
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
a movie started playing with CGI

551
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Kiss and there was no explanation of what

552
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
it was and the audience was confused

553
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
and Kiss's

554
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
decades long touring

555
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
career ended on a note of absolute

556
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
confusion.

557
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
I mean, it's so much more clear with a press release

558
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
and wait, he said also

559
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
that then they put it then like boom

560
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
put up a big QR code. So

561
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Kiss's touring career ended with

562
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
a QR code and then you scan the QR code and

563
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
it says look check back in one hour

564
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
just enough time

565
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
to be inconvenient for like

566
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
you forget or it takes you a while

567
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
to get home or whatever. Yeah.

568
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
And then that tells you, okay

569
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
it's gonna be like a hologram and ILM

570
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
made a new Kiss. So, okay, so it's

571
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
like they're young again. Well

572
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
not exactly because they aren't bringing back the

573
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
two older original members.

574
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
No, no, yeah. It's the two new ones

575
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
as holograms. They're out. Those guys

576
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
are, I forget which ones have been out. Chris

577
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Peter and Chris and Ace

578
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Fraley. Dead Dust. Not even in hologram form

579
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
can they ever return. Anyway

580
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
basically this sounds to me like

581
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
a bit of a clusterfuck

582
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
but of course, but I'm also a fan

583
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
of clusterfucks. I never saw

584
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
flesh and blood Kiss

585
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
but maybe I'm more likely to see

586
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
confusing hologram Kiss. Did you know Kiss? Yeah.

587
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Yeah. It very much seemed like the

588
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
response to it was like Moe

589
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
at the Bachelor auction on The Simpsons

590
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
when he stretched across stage and the whole

591
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
audience looked so

592
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
mad at him. And he just keeps walking.

593
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Yeah. He doesn't bother to stop and

594
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
get bids. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. I think

595
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
so. Anyway, so that exists as

596
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
that's an option. I think people have been very

597
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
moved by the ABBA version Kiss. I think people

598
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
have been confused by.

599
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Yeah. Buffett.

600
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
I don't know. Is the key, are they gonna have

601
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,480
to, are they gonna have

602
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
to get Jimmy's friend, Frank Marshall,

603
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
to use some of the

604
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
de-aging technology

605
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
deployed on the

606
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
film that I have not

607
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
I haven't even made it

608
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
past the first half hour in two

609
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
sittings, the film

610
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Nina Jones and the Tile of Destiny. Oh, I know.

611
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I haven't tried yet. Oh, boy. Yeah,

612
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I gotta try. Anyway, are we

613
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
gonna have to do that to Jimmy maybe? They got

614
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
the tech for Erason. Yeah.

615
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
I think that's probably

616
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
gonna happen. You know what? Frank maybe

617
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
goes out with them for a year

618
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
because Frank plays the guitar. You know what?

619
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
That actually. Oh, wait a minute.

620
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
That's interesting how I apologize

621
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
that you said Alan and there was some hemming and

622
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
hawing. And now you say Frank

623
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Marshall becomes the new Jimmy.

624
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
I think that's the better one.

625
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Yeah. But physically the

626
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
type. I

627
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
if Alan's in town, he can come out and do

628
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
his song and wave. That's how

629
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
you do it. Yeah, he's in the family. Yeah.

630
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
But, ooh,

631
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
all right. You got me. Yeah.

632
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
And this is me, somebody who's been

633
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
confounded

634
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
by Frank Marshall

635
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
and Buffett related information. Now that

636
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
I get it, I would absolutely go to

637
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
that concert.

638
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
I think everybody in Club 3 would.

639
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
Maybe even Main Feed.

640
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Yeah.

641
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Now, it is sad the way

642
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
things played out with Jimmy because

643
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
at the time of his death, he was due

644
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
to release his 32nd studio album,

645
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Equal Strain on All Parts.

646
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
That's right. Buffett got the idea

647
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
for the album title from his grandfather's

648
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
description of a nap.

649
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
But did

650
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
that come out or is it going to?

651
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
The full album? I believe the full album is out.

652
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Yeah, I think I listened to it. Yeah. Great.

653
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
That's got my like gummy

654
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,480
kicked in. The whole album or just

655
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
the first step? I think so.

656
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
So you didn't scrub through. So this one

657
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
you didn't just do the first half and then stop.

658
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Look, I realized that I finished the

659
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Olivia Rodrigo album, but I

660
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
set in on a thing that's not coming out yet.

661
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. In S.O.P. you didn't get, but you got

662
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
great cheers in person for

663
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
it. That's true. So yeah,

664
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Club 3, I will let Club 3 know

665
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I listened to the whole thing. Wow.

666
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Wow. It's good. It's good.

667
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
There's some good stuff on the second half. I believe when Prist

668
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
for what you liked, you said

669
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Track 10. Yeah, I couldn't

670
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
remember the name of it. The song is called

671
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Pretty as I'm Pretty. I do remember that now.

672
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Yeah, this

673
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
is all out. This has that Paul McCartney

674
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
song My Gummy Just Kicked In

675
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
where he plays bass on it.

676
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Oh, relatable.

677
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Relatable, didn't he? Bubbles up.

678
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
I like the song Bubbles Up better than My

679
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Gummy Just Kicked In, I will say that.

680
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Like My Dog has like a little

681
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
music video that just came out.

682
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Paul is on

683
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
God, we've got to get to

684
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Paul is on that song and then he's

685
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
also on a Rolling Stones

686
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Hackney Diamonds song,

687
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
neither of which, if you listen,

688
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
you go, okay,

689
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
both of them. I'm like, I don't know.

690
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
It's like him chomping the carrots on

691
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
the Beach Boys vegetables. Right.

692
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
You wouldn't know unless you read it. Yeah.

693
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
So I was like, I don't know, maybe they had him

694
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
for an hour. I don't know. But yes,

695
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Jimmy finished the album or got

696
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
finished his a lot of his stuff before

697
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
he passed away. And that's his, yeah,

698
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
final album unless they do some.

699
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
So what's the last song in the album?

700
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
What then serves as his final statement

701
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
to our world? Moe's Ambique,

702
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Him and Emmylou Harris.

703
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
So that's not so bad.

704
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
Country royalty.

705
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
But I wonder if he has a full vault like Prince

706
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
or something of many, many unreleased albums.

707
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
I'm not sure. I didn't know

708
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
that Jimmy was on this Willie Nelson

709
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
live song

710
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
called Roll Me Up

711
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
and Smoke Me When I Die.

712
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Yeah, he did that with Snoop Dogg at the Hollywood Bowl.

713
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Oh, cool. Yeah, it was fun.

714
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
I saw a video of it. I wasn't there.

715
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Yeah, that's good. Oh, and he also

716
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
was on a cover from the same live album

717
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
of On the Road Again.

718
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
OK. Damn. I bet that's

719
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
interesting as hell.

720
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
A lot of interesting takes

721
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
on that little ditty.

722
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
OK, so, oh, you know

723
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
what, I didn't do the official credit for who

724
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
suggested this. This is just simply from

725
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Matt. In memoriam of

726
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Jimmy Buffett, you should do an episode

727
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
of his Christmas album, Christmas Island.

728
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Plus, his birthday is on Christmas Day.

729
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
So there's that. Very popular

730
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
suggestion.

731
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
So this one's for you,

732
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
Matt, and we can dive in here.

733
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
I'm going to

734
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
say this about going forward.

735
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
First of all, I don't want to speak ill

736
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
of the dead. Of course. Secondly,

737
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
and this isn't really speaking ill,

738
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
as with many Christmas

739
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
albums, you get a lot of

740
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
covers. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We got a lot of covers

741
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
here. And the

742
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
covers, by and large, correct

743
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
me if I'm wrong, and

744
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
play ones that are interesting

745
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
and notable. I feel like some of the covers

746
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
are a little less notable

747
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
and essential

748
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
than original Christmas

749
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
songs.

750
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Yeah, you were saying like

751
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
the definitive versions of some of these

752
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
classic Christmas songs.

753
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
I just think, you know, Christmas albums

754
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
have a lot of padding.

755
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
And I shouldn't

756
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
maybe, for my

757
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
own self-care,

758
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
maybe I shouldn't be advocating for a longer

759
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
episode. But I would, I'm

760
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
going to vote for a little

761
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
bit. We don't have to talk about all of

762
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
them, because some of them just kind of are covers.

763
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
But I would like to pull into this,

764
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
and you probably

765
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
want to do this as well, some discussion of his

766
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
second Christmas album, Tis the

767
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Sea Sun. Tis the Sea Sun, which

768
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
has a couple songs I really do like.

769
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Yes. Okay. Right. So let's... And he

770
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
looks like he's jacked on the cover.

771
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Like the Photoshop of him,

772
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
which I think, and maybe that's insulting.

773
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
What is it when you're standing

774
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
on it, is it like wakeboarding?

775
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
What's the name of that? Yeah, that's a good question.

776
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
Yeah, it's like standing on a board.

777
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
No paddle boarding? Okay.

778
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
And he's got like a dog photoshopped on it with him,

779
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
I think. Yeah. Wait,

780
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
wakeboarding, I guess, is if you're stiff,

781
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
you're like pulled, you're still being pulled.

782
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
But if you're being towed, that's wakeboarding.

783
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
So yeah, paddle boarding might be right.

784
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
But so,

785
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
anyway, with

786
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
that, I don't

787
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
want to dictate how you do it. This is

788
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
your rodeo, Mike, and

789
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
whatever you want to do.

790
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Yeah, so

791
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
let me pull up some of the credits

792
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
here. I learned just also just

793
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
looking around that Jingle Bells

794
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
was written by a guy named James Lord Pierpont,

795
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
who was an American songwriter,

796
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
arranger, organist, and a confederate soldier.

797
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Well, I don't like that, but

798
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I like that name, Pierpont.

799
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Yeah. It's one of my favorite spots

800
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
to hang all day with a

801
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
fisher pole. I feel like he could have used that

802
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
somewhere.

803
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Like, owed to James Pierpont.

804
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Pierpont. And then it was like about,

805
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
like, it was really just about singing, like,

806
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,480
like a nickname for him,

807
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Jimmy James. They call

808
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
me James Pierpont.

809
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
I'm always putting my feet in the water.

810
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
So,

811
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
so, yeah.

812
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Confederates, wow.

813
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Jingle Bells canceled? I'll say this.

814
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I canceled it. Yeah, Jingle Bells is canceled now.

815
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
A good collection.

816
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
These are like the Christmas

817
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Carols, by and large, that I like.

818
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
The ones on this album? Yeah, on the album.

819
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
I especially like

820
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
I'll Be Home for Christmas, of course,

821
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
originally written during World

822
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
War II. Sure.

823
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
It was kind of a very sad

824
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
song of soldiers pining to be home.

825
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Irving Berlin, is that right?

826
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Bing Crosby did the

827
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
big cover. Oh, sorry, Irving Berlin is

828
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
White Christmas, I'm sorry.

829
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
So, yeah,

830
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
so, there's

831
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
stuff on here that I do really like

832
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
and then there's stuff on here that I think is

833
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
less good. None of who you just said

834
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
wrote I'll Be Home for Christmas.

835
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,480
No, no. Bing. No, no, I'm wrong.

836
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
I'll Be Home for Christmas was, of course, written by

837
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Buck Ram.

838
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Yes, yes. No, White, I'm

839
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
thinking of White Christmas, that's Irving Berlin. I'll Be Home

840
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
for Christmas, Bing Crosby

841
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
was

842
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
in the top ten on the charts

843
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
with it and then it shows up

844
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
in Meet Me in St. Louis,

845
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Judy Garland sings it. Well, I do

846
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
know that White

847
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Christmas stuff because, of course, I

848
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
worked and did tech for a Katherine

849
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Crosby, Bing Crosby's Widows

850
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
show, which I brought up here and

851
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
there before. So that was the, I should

852
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
remember that. It's embarrassing that I

853
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
attributed that. Audience, raise your hand

854
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
if you've ever heard of Katherine Crosby

855
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
before Mike Carlson

856
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
bringing that name up.

857
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
What was your awareness of Katherine

858
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Crosby? His second wife.

859
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Look, the mother of

860
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Mary, who was on Dallas,

861
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
you know that.

862
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
I don't reference, but I know I

863
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
know other Dallas people. She shot

864
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
JR. That's who shot JR?

865
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
Okay. Yeah, how about it?

866
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
I have her phone number.

867
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
So where I grew up in Woodland Hills,

868
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
sometimes I'd see Charlene Tilden

869
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
at the mall. Well. How about

870
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
that? This is for the Club 3 heads, really.

871
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
An audience of one person

872
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
half-gassed

873
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
out of all of the thousands of listeners.

874
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Yeah, Mike.

875
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
He's in this room. He also has a

876
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
microphone.

877
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
So I will say

878
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Mella Kalikimaka is maybe

879
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
the perfect Christmas song for Jimmy

880
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
to do. And that, I think, you

881
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
could say that sort of should

882
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
be in your rotation of essential

883
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Christmas song versions or whatever you want

884
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
to call it. I guess that's why it

885
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
appears on both albums.

886
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Both albums because

887
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
it's the perfect song for him

888
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
to do because like very

889
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
island flavored. For people on the internet

890
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
like, oh my god, Mella Kalikimaka

891
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
too. It's bad. Score

892
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
guys.

893
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
They're very excited

894
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
about him doing two

895
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
two different recorded versions.

896
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
I'm not sure what was wrong with the first one

897
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
that he needed to re-record it.

898
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
He added like a ukulele

899
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
guy. Ukulele star.

900
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Is it Jake Shima

901
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Bunkura? Shima Bukura.

902
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Shima Bukura, sorry. Yes.

903
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
So he is doing like kind of a duet

904
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
there. So I guess that's why you're doing it.

905
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Like Willie obviously recorded, Willie

906
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Nelson recorded a million on the road again

907
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
I'm sure with many different people.

908
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Like I am kind of fascinated by that

909
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
because I was like, why would you, like Frank

910
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Snatchard doing duets, the

911
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Bono song and with Jimmy

912
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Buffett as well. Like going

913
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
in there and like re-recording your songs feels

914
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
like such a slog to me.

915
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
No way. Writing new

916
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
ones. That's the slog. Let's do

917
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
it again. Mella Kalikimaka.

918
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
And you have to write this one.

919
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
So yeah.

920
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
So like Christmas Island I think is a fun

921
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
song. His Jingle Bells is

922
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
not my favorite version

923
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
of Jingle Bells. Which I think

924
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
a lot of this is going to devolve into

925
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
sort of a discussion of what you like.

926
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Like I liked as a kid.

927
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Because like I liked Jingle Bell

928
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
fine but I loved Jingle Bell Rock.

929
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
That was my preferred.

930
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
I always would lump those two together

931
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
and be like, yeah Jingle Bells is fine.

932
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
I can sing it. But Jingle Bell Rock

933
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
to me was like, that's really fun.

934
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
This is a fun song. Rock and roll.

935
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Rock and roll, yeah. You know I was a little kid

936
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
who loved rock and roll. Rock and roll

937
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
kid. It's like when the music teacher

938
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
would get a bunch of sheet music

939
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Beatles songs.

940
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Like a little rock and roll.

941
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Not just you know. Oh like the teacher would show

942
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
oh you know what I know new stuff.

943
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
You know too. Which is like when our music class

944
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
in 1995.

945
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Yeah in 1995. Hey we're singing

946
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Blackbird.

947
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
We're not just singing

948
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
like American songbook songs or

949
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
what we'd sing. We had

950
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
like in second or third grade we sang

951
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Hero by Mariah Carey in class.

952
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Which was a very new song.

953
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Or maybe later.

954
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Maybe fourth grade. Let me do a sir.

955
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Cause I am not alone in that.

956
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
I think one of Jane's school

957
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
choir sang this. And I

958
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
definitely encountered other people who

959
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
sang this. Did you

960
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
ever in a music class sing Ease On

961
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Down the Road from The Wiz?

962
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
No. No. But I was really

963
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
in a lot of music classes. Okay.

964
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Did you? Yeah. You did.

965
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
The whole chorus of White

966
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Cat's singing Ease On Down the Road.

967
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Yeah. How about it?

968
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting.

969
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
He has a

970
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
song. So he wrote the song A Sailor's Christmas.

971
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Which is kind of

972
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
melancholy sort of in the same

973
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,480
I feel like vein as a son

974
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
of a sailor. Son of a son.

975
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Son of a sailor. Yeah. This is that mode

976
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
that he has of just kind of like

977
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
wistful. Contemplative.

978
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,480
Yeah. And I'm like snooze.

979
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
You don't like those. Yeah. Really?

980
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
I want to hear lists of

981
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
drinks and

982
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
lyrics about conch shells. Yeah.

983
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
I mean I like the party stuff I think better too.

984
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
But I like some of the stuff. I was

985
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
in fact disappointed by

986
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
because you hear the album title Christmas

987
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Island. Oh cool.

988
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Is it like him imagine? Is it like

989
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Scatman's World

990
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
where he's imagining a whole island

991
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
that is decked out

992
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Christmas and then you remember oh no there's just that kind of

993
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
boring song on Christmas

994
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Island. So I felt disappointed

995
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
by that. That he's not like

996
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
architecting a world

997
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
where like a volcano shoots egg

998
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
nog. He gets. And palm

999
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
trees have coconuts that are

1000
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
candied peppermint striped and when you open

1001
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
them up they're full of egg nog.

1002
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Yeah. No that I think he should

1003
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
have made an album more along those lines.

1004
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
But he does in Sailor's Christmas he mentioned

1005
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
like he mentions the realm of King

1006
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Neptune which I like.

1007
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
You get little treats. Okay.

1008
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
But it's not a big treat meal. It's not a big

1009
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
like Christmas celebration of

1010
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,480
full nonsense. He has a song

1011
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
on the. But it's not like is that

1012
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
like. But is

1013
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
is that good old Santa

1014
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
no it's King Neptune.

1015
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Yeah no. He confuses him because they both have white beards.

1016
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
No he doesn't yeah. No that

1017
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
would be more fun like yeah

1018
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Santa. Santa fought King Neptune.

1019
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
They

1020
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
have their hands around each other's necks.

1021
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
The ownership of Christmas.

1022
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Santa got stabbed in the back

1023
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
with a trident.

1024
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
But his healing

1025
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
his North Pole powers brought

1026
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
him back. Santa's

1027
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
fat came in handy.

1028
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Watch out Lord Darkin

1029
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
on Zero Two.

1030
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Yeah no it's not

1031
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
if only we could have produced an album for him.

1032
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
This is my wish.

1033
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
One song that gets a little close.

1034
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
We'll get there. Yes yeah yeah yeah.

1035
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
But yes it is sort of just like a sad

1036
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
like another like sad Christmas

1037
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
song about like somebody being away

1038
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
from home and what it

1039
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
is like being on the ocean

1040
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
being on the water. It's just a sad

1041
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
time. Well it paints a picture of like

1042
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
imagine if it was Christmas. A time

1043
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
when you're supposed to be with the ones you love

1044
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
and instead you're just out in the

1045
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
middle of an ocean and you've got

1046
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
stockings in your tiny

1047
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
boat and Christmas lights in your tiny

1048
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
boat and you're wearing

1049
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
a Santa hat and a Christmas shirt

1050
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
but you're all alone.

1051
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
That's kind of the picture it

1052
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
draws up which is the

1053
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
album cover of Christmas Island.

1054
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
But that's not lonely at all. He's happy as hell.

1055
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
I love it.

1056
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
I gotta do Christmas solo more often.

1057
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Give everybody one

1058
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
extra day to come up with two

1059
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
extra presents for me. Christmas

1060
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
and birthday separate. It really ruins

1061
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
sort of the sadness of the

1062
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
sea life. You see how happy

1063
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
he is being in the tiniest boat you can

1064
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
imagine celebrating Christmas

1065
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
alone.

1066
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
I wish the boat was smaller.

1067
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Well you know what I was saying

1068
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
before I saw the album cover

1069
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
I was just thinking of the

1070
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
Corona commercial that is

1071
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
aired for 30 years.

1072
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Where someone is

1073
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
whistling Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree

1074
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
and they walk out of a little shack

1075
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
and they flick on the

1076
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Christmas lights on the palm tree.

1077
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
That's one of those perennials

1078
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
that's just in there forever along with

1079
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
he does exist

1080
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
I do exist.

1081
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,480
And Folger's

1082
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
incest commercial.

1083
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
I just

1084
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
read an article about that.

1085
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
I think I read the same.

1086
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,480
There was an oral history where the

1087
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
brother and sister are a little too

1088
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
familiar.

1089
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
I think they did pull that though.

1090
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
They should air it.

1091
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,480
It might have gotten pulled eventually.

1092
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,480
It aired for a while.

1093
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
And the Hershey kisses

1094
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
that ring like bells. That one's never going

1095
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
away. I like that one.

1096
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,480
They should do more of that.

1097
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
But you know what they should do is not

1098
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
have them be Christmas and just be commercials Jason

1099
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
and I were in.

1100
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
They should just have those run forever.

1101
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Christmas is a great time to remember what

1102
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
the best insurance on the market is

1103
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
and what the best

1104
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
streamer is.

1105
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Streaming packages is.

1106
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
They end up in little Christmas presents

1107
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
called healthcare for all the

1108
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
actors. Wendy's always has a

1109
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,480
chicken sandwich. Come on.

1110
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
And Hulu

1111
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
is always a great deal.

1112
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
I don't know what

1113
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
they cut by now and I don't know who owns

1114
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
them at this point. But no matter what

1115
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
they're always celebrating the Hulu

1116
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
days. And before that Hulu

1117
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
we and happy Hulu days.

1118
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
So OK. I mean this. OK.

1119
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
I want to play a little

1120
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
bit and this is I'm wondering how

1121
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
where Scott falls on this.

1122
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
If he likes this or not because

1123
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
I actually hadn't I've listened to his album

1124
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
but I really didn't even clock this

1125
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
for like last year when I listened to this

1126
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
or whatever or I wasn't just not paying attention

1127
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
because he does a version of up on the housetop

1128
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
that is a very

1129
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,480
in character

1130
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,480
like song. OK. Did you listen to this at all?

1131
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
I did. Wait I'm trying to replace

1132
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
well I'll just play it. I'll play it. I think it struck me

1133
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
as being kind of a genre in a way.

1134
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Yes absolutely and it's a little bit

1135
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
out of his. It makes sense.

1136
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Christmas is for sure.

1137
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Share that

1138
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,480
way with me. Don't cut me off man.

1139
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
That's cool dude.

1140
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,480
So he's doing like a

1141
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
surfer guy.

1142
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
See my head lips.

1143
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Little dick tail. Yeah.

1144
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
But I'm also wondering if he's doing a little beach

1145
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
boys.

1146
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You know what it struck me

1147
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
as actually is more it's kind of like the cars.

1148
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Little like

1149
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
a little new wave. Yeah.

1150
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
He also sounds like Tom Petty

1151
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,480
though. Yeah.

1152
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
I'm wondering what he was going for.

1153
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
This is obviously a surf rock

1154
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
song.

1155
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Surfer

1156
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
stoner music.

1157
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Like Tom Petty man.

1158
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
But it sounds like he could

1159
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
be trying to do a beach boys

1160
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
ish voice but I'm not sure.

1161
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,480
It's a different voice for sure.

1162
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Yeah it's not his normal.

1163
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
It's a take.

1164
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Does this have a bunch of he like prattles

1165
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
on and on at the end of this.

1166
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
This stoner guy voice.

1167
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Can we hear some of that. Yeah at the end.

1168
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
Yeah. It should be

1169
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
hold on it'll be a little imprecise.

1170
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
I kind of like this.

1171
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
This is more in the style music

1172
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
I guess. Yeah. Besides maybe the

1173
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
character.

1174
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Sounds like 90's Costello.

1175
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
Yeah.

1176
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
This is five songs in by the way on the track list.

1177
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Yeah.

1178
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Nourley.

1179
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,480
OK.

1180
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
So he's got yes.

1181
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
He's doing his SNL audition reel.

1182
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Yeah. So I was like oh yeah I guess

1183
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
and then probably bigger Buffet heads

1184
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
will like find something that where he does

1185
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
more of a character or something.

1186
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
But I was like OK that's.

1187
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Bigger Buffet heads. Yes.

1188
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
There are there exist.

1189
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
They exist. I don't know as much about him

1190
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
as I do pre Stephen Page leaving

1191
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Bearnic and Ladies.

1192
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Where I have like a lot of more

1193
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
more B sides.

1194
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
I know a little more history from the band.

1195
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
I think it's though that it's possible that you know the most

1196
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
about Jimmy Buffett of anyone below

1197
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
fifty five years old.

1198
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
There's a chance that's

1199
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
possible.

1200
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
So yeah. So so he had done

1201
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
yeah the first Christmas Island Jingle Bells

1202
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Sailor's Christmas. Then he does Happy Christmas

1203
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
which is

1204
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
John Lennon War is Over.

1205
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
If you want it. I feel like

1206
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
that's an OK version of it.

1207
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
I feel like you had that on the background.

1208
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
You might go like oh yeah that's that's fine.

1209
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Do I want it on for five minutes

1210
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
thirty five seconds.

1211
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
I'll say I don't know.

1212
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
I think it was because I worked in the container store

1213
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
for a few years and they had

1214
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,480
like this Christmas loop

1215
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
that would play a lot and they would play that

1216
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
John Lennon song all the time.

1217
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
And I do like it but I think I heard

1218
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
it too much in the same way

1219
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
that I heard for like for the longest

1220
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
time by Billy Joel during regular

1221
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
regular seasons.

1222
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
And I'm just like I don't want to hear this song

1223
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
ever again maybe. Sure.

1224
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
But it's like a fine song.

1225
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I still like I want like Wonderful Christmas

1226
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Time better. I don't we don't have to put John

1227
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,480
and Paul against each other but

1228
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Christmas time I think is on

1229
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,480
the other Jimmy Buffett

1230
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
are correct.

1231
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
This by the way

1232
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Christmas Island comes out in nineteen ninety six.

1233
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
Yes. And then he

1234
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
doesn't do the other one for like ten years.

1235
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Yeah it's a fair relatively

1236
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
recent. Yeah. Twenty sixteen.

1237
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Oh yeah. Twenty

1238
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
years. We went twenty years.

1239
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,480
How did the world manage without more. But I do

1240
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
think maybe it's part of it's like you're taking

1241
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
a shot and can you add

1242
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
one of your songs to

1243
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
the list. To the like primaries.

1244
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Yeah. Always played.

1245
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
It's tough. It's tough to penetrate.

1246
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
You can certainly make Christmas music

1247
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,480
but how do you. Right. Become

1248
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
and the dream obviously is to become

1249
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
Mariah Carey. Right.

1250
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,480
But I don't think anybody's getting in there

1251
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
as big as Mariah ever again.

1252
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
In terms of like that song is

1253
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
such a pillar it feels like it

1254
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
it's up there with the ones from the

1255
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
30s. Feels like it was written by James Pierpont.

1256
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,480
It feels that classic at this point.

1257
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,480
The new James Pierpont

1258
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Mariah Carey.

1259
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Right. What are the other

1260
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,480
like last Christmas.

1261
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Yeah. Yeah. Christmas wrapping.

1262
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
It's primary now. Yeah. I feel like

1263
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
it's primary.

1264
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
Fairy tale of New York

1265
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
in some circles. Sure.

1266
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Yeah. It's not

1267
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
primary but I may have spoken

1268
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
before about the new edition Christmas

1269
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
EP. This is my favorite Christmas music.

1270
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,480
Six songs not all original

1271
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
but mostly original and then the covers are

1272
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
not that famous of covers.

1273
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
They aren't doing any winter wonderland

1274
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
sleigh ride. These are

1275
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
they're all like I think it's some

1276
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
of the best new edition songs

1277
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
regardless of the Christmas

1278
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,480
this is the best. Look check this one out

1279
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,480
on Spotify. Highly recommend.

1280
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
That's cool. Should be primary.

1281
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Can I so can I just

1282
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,480
confirm for Christmas Island

1283
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,480
the original Jimmy's songs

1284
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
are Christmas Island

1285
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
and the Sailor's Christmas. Is that

1286
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
it? No.

1287
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
There's one more. Oh. Ho ho ho

1288
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,480
in a bottle of rum. Ho ho ho

1289
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,480
in a bottle of rum. Why don't we talk about a ho ho ho

1290
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
in a bottle of rum. Yeah you want to play a little of it here?

1291
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,480
This to me seems like the closest

1292
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
thing to satisfying

1293
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
what you want silly

1294
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Jimmy Christmas to be. Right right right right.

1295
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
Good. Oh Merry Christmas Alabama

1296
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
I think he has the credit on to him.

1297
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Yes he does yes.

1298
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
This is some nice

1299
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Mario Kart

1300
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Peach level whistles.

1301
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
Original Mario Kart.

1302
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
Beep beep boo boo beep beep boo boo.

1303
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Santa's

1304
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
dressed out as the holiday

1305
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
season draws near.

1306
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,480
He's been doing

1307
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
the same job now going on

1308
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,480
two thousand years.

1309
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
He started right after

1310
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Christ is what he's saying.

1311
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Right. And chimney

1312
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
scars cover his buns.

1313
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Christ is born

1314
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
in year two Santa starts his

1315
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,480
workshop. Is that right?

1316
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
The Christmas bus is more work than fun.

1317
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Aww.

1318
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Aww.

1319
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
He needs a vacation from bad

1320
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,480
decorations and

1321
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,480
snow. Santa does?

1322
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
Even Santa? Yeah.

1323
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
Oh December 26

1324
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,480
he's going to Cali town.

1325
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
Beaches and palm trees

1326
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
appear night and day in his

1327
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
dreams. He's going to have to

1328
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
buy a new wardrobe for that.

1329
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
This is the funniest line.

1330
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
A break from his wife.

1331
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
The elves and that damn reindeer team.

1332
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
That damn reindeer.

1333
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
He doesn't like his wife. He hates the reindeer.

1334
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Santa's run off to the Caribbean.

1335
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
I guess he's on his own getting to the Caribbean.

1336
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
Reindeer not helping him.

1337
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Ho ho ho and a bottle

1338
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
of rum. I mean this is great.

1339
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
This is really good. I like

1340
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
these like images.

1341
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
Santa and the old timey bathing suit

1342
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
are like the tank top and swim

1343
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
trunks. Yeah. I think that's

1344
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,480
fun when Santa gets cut loose a little.

1345
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
Santa in shorts. You're not

1346
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
sold because of the lyrics.

1347
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,480
Oh yeah.

1348
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,480
I got some trouble coming up.

1349
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Yeah here we go.

1350
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,480
Just for the weekend

1351
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,480
he'd like to be Peter Pan.

1352
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
Excuse me? Yeah that's a weird line.

1353
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,480
Get out of his long johns

1354
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,480
and dance with the sword.

1355
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,480
Dance with the sword in the sand.

1356
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,480
Dance with the sword in the sand like Peter Pan.

1357
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,480
Peter Pan?

1358
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,480
Oh I'm like pirates. Oh yeah I guess.

1359
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,480
Yeah he's always singing about pirates.

1360
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
Peter Pan has a place in Buffett type

1361
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
imagery. Yeah.

1362
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,480
Is that what all the

1363
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,480
parrots think they're doing is being

1364
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,480
little like Peter Pans?

1365
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Like pirates? Like never growing up.

1366
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,480
Is that the idea?

1367
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
I don't know. I don't think

1368
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,480
so. I think

1369
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
they're just like being

1370
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
like maybe even I guess pirate

1371
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
just in general is a thing because he

1372
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,480
mentions pirates. I'm confused by

1373
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,480
this. Santa wants to be Peter

1374
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Pan. Santa a two thousand year

1375
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,480
old at least man by the premise

1376
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,480
of the song

1377
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
wants to he's sick of his

1378
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
work and he wants he doesn't

1379
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,480
want to grow up he wants to be a little kid

1380
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,480
again. But Santa's day

1381
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,480
to day is like drinking hot chocolate

1382
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,480
and marshmallows and

1383
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
like no this toy

1384
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
should be this toy should be able to flip

1385
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,480
around this this toy should make

1386
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,480
a little poop this dolly.

1387
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
Like he's still he's kind of pretty

1388
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
I know he's got a lot of work

1389
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,480
to do but he's got as much of like an

1390
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
adolescent adulthood as anybody.

1391
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,480
Why does he need to be like Peter Pan?

1392
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,480
Is there a common yeah like

1393
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,480
okay because because now

1394
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,480
Santa especially in the last couple decades

1395
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
obviously with manufacturing happening

1396
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,480
with toys is the

1397
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,480
idea is Santa day to day

1398
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
working in the toy shop

1399
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,480
with the elves or is

1400
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
that just a Christmas season thing

1401
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,480
or does he work all year

1402
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,480
like doing all his Christmas

1403
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,480
business for the one night?

1404
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,480
It's actually gotten easier they

1405
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
just want Roblox gift cards.

1406
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
But is he

1407
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,480
purchasing Roblox or are the elves making

1408
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,480
the Roblox gift cards?

1409
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,480
I had this exact question in

1410
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
while watching the film Santa Claus

1411
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,480
2 which I'd never seen

1412
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
I was like okay so

1413
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
they make all of these kind of old style

1414
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
like you know dollies and

1415
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,480
the rocking horses

1416
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,480
but then if a kid wants a Nintendo

1417
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Switch did they just get

1418
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,480
that from Nintendo or do Santa

1419
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,480
and elves have to because it's a

1420
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,480
Christmas present did they have to

1421
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,480
make their own version of a Nintendo

1422
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,480
Switch? Right. It's a great

1423
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,480
question and one that I had as a child

1424
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,480
I believe too because

1425
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,480
all the old time

1426
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
Santa stuff is based on old school

1427
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,480
toys that feel much more

1428
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,480
He started again in Christ's time

1429
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,480
so he began

1430
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,480
talk about adapting as a business

1431
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,480
man he started in a pre

1432
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
electronic time

1433
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480
there was an electricity even

1434
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,480
when Santa began so now

1435
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,480
he's got to like figure out

1436
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
microchips and keep up with imagine

1437
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,480
being Santa and now I got to make video games

1438
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,480
now I got to go from 8 bit

1439
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,480
to 16 bit and then every

1440
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,480
generational jump after that

1441
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,480
Is he developing? Yeah

1442
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,480
I think there needs to be

1443
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,480
kind of a

1444
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,480
revision of the Santa

1445
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,480
lore maybe

1446
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
because kids are going to

1447
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
be confused our kids are going to be confused I think

1448
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
when they fully grasp this

1449
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Your alerts

1450
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,480
Deal vibes

1451
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,480
When's he edited the grocery list?

1452
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,480
You get a ding for that

1453
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,480
I have a shared

1454
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,480
list too sometimes I get updates

1455
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Yeah I guess I do get lists

1456
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
More hot cocoa

1457
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
More nog

1458
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,480
So yeah so

1459
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,480
I guess in this Jimmy version he's

1460
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
talking about Santa's day to day I assume

1461
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,480
is very stressful and he's

1462
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,480
shouting at elves

1463
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,480
shouting at Mrs Claus

1464
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,480
I cannot wait I cannot

1465
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,480
wait to be in the Caribbean

1466
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,480
I want to go and be

1467
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,480
play Peter Pan in the sand

1468
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,480
I want to be a little boy forever

1469
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
Mrs Claus Always stop me you tell me

1470
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,480
that wanting to be like a little boy

1471
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,480
is a creepy thing

1472
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
and for the last time no I don't

1473
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
want kids I don't want

1474
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,480
that type of reliving my

1475
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,480
childhood I want to be the Peter

1476
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,480
Pan

1477
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,480
What do you mean the elves

1478
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,480
They're like my lost boys

1479
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,480
I hate them they're no fun at all

1480
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,480
The only thing worse than them

1481
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,480
is that damn reindeer team

1482
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,480
You better believe I'm getting on a

1483
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,480
plane to the Caribbean with one

1484
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,480
seat they're not invited

1485
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,480
you're not invited

1486
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,480
When we're flying over the Pacific sometimes I just wish

1487
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,480
the magic would wear off

1488
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,480
and we all plunge into the water

1489
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,480
To an ocean

1490
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,480
brave at least for a

1491
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,480
minute when I'm splashing around

1492
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,480
I'll be happy I can climb under

1493
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Dasher's corpse and float

1494
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,480
to safety

1495
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
There's none of those cursed

1496
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
Christmas lights in the black unforgiving

1497
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
Pacific

1498
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
No red no green

1499
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
Just brutal

1500
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,480
waves crashing

1501
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,480
I don't think Jimmy's thinking maybe fully about

1502
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
what he's painting picture he's painting

1503
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
of a man difficult Santa

1504
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,480
this almost Scrooge like Santa

1505
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
The jolliest man supposedly that loves

1506
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,480
bringing cheer to children

1507
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,480
That's the character he's got to play

1508
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,480
Johnny Carson was very dark

1509
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
behind closed, you know Dark Side

1510
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,480
All the great public figures do

1511
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
Santa of course among them

1512
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
No exception Santa

1513
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,480
But yeah you're right that gets the closest

1514
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,480
to like fun nonsense

1515
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,480
because you want that

1516
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,480
Is the last song

1517
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
besides a hidden track

1518
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,480
A Visit from St. Nicholas

1519
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,480
Is the song Merry Christmas

1520
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,480
Alabama parentheses

1521
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,480
Never far from whom is that

1522
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
sad too

1523
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,480
Or is that more jaunty

1524
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,480
Yeah it's kind of sad I mean it feels

1525
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,480
It feels sad I guess if we want to

1526
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
analyze the lyrics

1527
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
But it's definitely not one of his

1528
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,480
party songs

1529
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,480
Not like Merry Christmas Alabama

1530
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,480
Let's have enchiladas

1531
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
Which could be another

1532
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
song if he wanted to make another

1533
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
Christmas album posthumously

1534
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,480
Maybe that's part of the living forever

1535
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,480
It's like just use AI

1536
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,480
With his voice and then

1537
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Have people write new songs

1538
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
And have the AI sing it

1539
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Maybe this is a good time to

1540
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
Say again the covers

1541
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,480
Are fine but I don't know

1542
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,480
I don't want to hear him doing the sad John Lennon

1543
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,480
I want like

1544
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,480
I do want the party silly

1545
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,480
Jimmy Christmas

1546
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,480
And I took the liberty

1547
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,480
Of in four minutes

1548
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,480
Time writing

1549
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
What I desire

1550
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,480
And this I also though tried to

1551
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,480
Keep it in like where it's not that

1552
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
Silly this to me feels like plausibly

1553
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,480
Something that he would have

1554
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,480
Written

1555
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,480
If he like just maybe put a little

1556
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,480
More in the realm of the bottle

1557
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,480
Of rum so let me

1558
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,480
This is just a chorus

1559
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,480
And I don't have musical backing

1560
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,480
Or anything but just you know imagine some

1561
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,480
Steel drum and some acoustic

1562
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,480
With this okay

1563
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,480
Alright

1564
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,480
Leave Santa a

1565
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Margarita

1566
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,480
Cause milk is such a bore

1567
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Getting past a big dairy

1568
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,480
Glass sounds like such a chore

1569
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,480
Why not give him

1570
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,480
A salted rim with a splash of

1571
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
Triple sec but Santa

1572
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
Don't over do it

1573
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,480
Or you'll get in a sleigh wreck

1574
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
Hey Santa I'm Margarita

1575
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,480
And everybody comes in you know

1576
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,480
Just repeat it or do more I don't know

1577
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,480
Loosely the same

1578
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,480
Yeah I think if you pitched

1579
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,480
It to him in one of these songwriting sessions

1580
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,480
You bet great got it

1581
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
You turn this way and he turns back

1582
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,480
And he's recorded the whole song already

1583
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,480
I did it

1584
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,480
It's in stores already actually

1585
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,480
Getting back on the battle board

1586
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,480
Had to tweak the you'll be in a wreck

1587
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,480
Live we can't talk about drunk driving

1588
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,480
So I just changed to you're a wreck

1589
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,480
Good point Jason good note

1590
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
He says but don't over do it

1591
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,480
He says it's warning

1592
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,480
It's kind of a drunk driving warning

1593
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
But also Jimmy I would leave you know

1594
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,480
You know your own rules

1595
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,480
But also Parrotheads when you get in those cars on the way home

1596
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,480
My liability is gone

1597
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,480
When I leave the stage my liability

1598
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,480
Is no longer valid

1599
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,480
Rod Sherr encourage to the

1600
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,480
Then you won't have your own tail

1601
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,480
To gate on but

1602
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Bring a blanket

1603
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,480
Yeah there you go

1604
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,480
Jason your

1605
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,480
Question about Merry Christmas Alabama

1606
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,480
Yes he says like Merry Christmas

1607
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,480
To my saints and guardian angels

1608
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,480
Who protect me as I roam

1609
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,480
All the faces in the places that we're home

1610
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,480
It's like that's not

1611
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,480
It's a little yeah

1612
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,480
Not the most fun thing

1613
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,480
Do you picture a better

1614
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,480
Merry Christmas Alabama

1615
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Like well let me ask you this Jason

1616
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,480
You I think do really like

1617
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,480
The sad Buffet you like the

1618
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,480
I like it okay I like he went to Paris

1619
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,480
Yeah

1620
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,480
Yeah I don't know

1621
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,480
Do I wish it was like

1622
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,480
Sweet home Alabama

1623
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,480
But then it was like

1624
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,480
Merry Christmas

1625
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,480
Sweet home Alabama

1626
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Merry Christmas Alabama

1627
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,480
Alabama

1628
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,480
I like that you worked that out

1629
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,480
Yeah I was trying to figure out if the math worked

1630
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,480
Yeah yeah so you do actually

1631
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Like the party Buffet better

1632
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,480
You do like party Buffet better

1633
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,480
I think party Buffet is

1634
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,480
Preferable for most people

1635
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
Like run can we run

1636
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,480
Rudolph? Yes of course

1637
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,480
That's a pretty jaunty song

1638
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,480
No we're going back

1639
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,480
We've been bopping around

1640
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,480
We've been bopping

1641
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
Oh boy alright nevermind

1642
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,480
Yeah no it's uh

1643
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,480
We have to hear this

1644
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,480
You know you're the mastermind

1645
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,480
Run run

1646
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,480
Rudolph Vixen can't be

1647
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,480
Far behind

1648
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,480
That's what I thought too

1649
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,480
It's a little

1650
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,480
More Ryan Censor

1651
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,480
I wonder if you want to hear the

1652
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,480
Why is he so insistent on the

1653
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,480
The Ryan Censor

1654
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,480
Surely has done many versions of Run Run

1655
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,480
This is absolutely

1656
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,480
He might be doing it right now

1657
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,480
On the other side of town

1658
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,480
Yeah that's possible

1659
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,480
We gotta get to him

1660
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,480
He's in the Capitol Records building

1661
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,480
You guys ever trick me into like

1662
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,480
We're going to Knott's Merry Farm

1663
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,480
Okay great I'll drive

1664
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,480
Oh well thank you I'd love a break for a drive

1665
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,480
Guess what wrong we're going to

1666
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,480
Ryan Censor fuck you

1667
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,480
I'll crawl

1668
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,480
I'll force that door open and fly out

1669
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,480
Sorry Scott it's time for you to get

1670
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,480
In the mood

1671
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,480
Da da da da da da da da

1672
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,480
I still don't know if that's something they would play

1673
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,480
Or do play

1674
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,480
Look at setlist.fm

1675
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,480
Jason find the last

1676
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,480
Brian Censor show and see what the

1677
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,480
Setlist he did was cause I would like to know

1678
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,480
Is he with the orchestra now? I know he's

1679
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,480
You know he's gotta be cooking

1680
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,480
That's a good idea and while Jason does that maybe we can move on

1681
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,480
To Tis the Sea Sun

1682
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
Tis the Sea Sun I'm comfortable with that

1683
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,480
Yes yes

1684
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,480
Oh wait actually you know what I will go

1685
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,480
Will you play I forgot the hidden track

1686
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,480
Is him doing Tis the Night Before Christmas

1687
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,480
Can you just go to around

1688
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,480
617

1689
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,480
I miss these hidden tracks

1690
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,480
The fun thing about CDs

1691
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,480
You might actually get tricked

1692
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,480
Like it keeps playing and then oh what's this

1693
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,480
What's this my wondering eyes

1694
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
Should appear

1695
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,480
So you get to hear him do this

1696
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,480
But go to around 617

1697
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,480
Jimmy convinced that this is a

1698
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,480
This is a one take

1699
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,480
Oh I think I know what you're talking about

1700
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,480
And he whistled and shouted

1701
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,480
And called them by name

1702
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,480
Now Dasher now Dancer now Prancer and Vixen

1703
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,480
On Comet on Cupid

1704
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,480
On Donner and Blitzen

1705
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,480
To the top of the porch to the top of the wall

1706
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,480
Now dash away dash away

1707
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,480
Dash away all

1708
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,480
As dry leaves have before of the water

1709
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,480
When they meet

1710
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,480
But again he was already

1711
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
I just do what sorry and he's already out on the pedal

1712
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,480
I'm done

1713
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,480
I finished it

1714
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Should we get Jimmy back for one

1715
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
I'm sorry I looked out the window and he is

1716
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,480
Riding on a dolphin

1717
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,480
He's already half a mile away

1718
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,480
I'm surfing on two turtles

1719
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,480
On my feet

1720
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,480
I'm water skiing with two turtles

1721
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Don't worry they're smiling they're happy

1722
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,480
I'm doing it I asked them

1723
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,480
They're my best friends

1724
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,480
Cheeseburger and paradise

1725
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,480
So that's the

1726
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,480
That's Jimmy's first Christmas album

1727
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,480
And 21st studio album all told

1728
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,480
Now we move to the 29th

1729
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,480
Studio album

1730
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Tis the Zee Sun

1731
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,480
20 years later he had more Christmas to do

1732
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,480
More Melickaliki Maka to do

1733
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,480
And he's on a wakeboard paddle board

1734
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,480
He's ripped

1735
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,480
His muscles look so big

1736
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,480
His arms look huge

1737
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,480
He's wearing a Santa

1738
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,480
Onesie kind of a look

1739
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
It's a Santa shirt with short sleeves

1740
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Well you know what it's a little bit like

1741
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,480
This would be maybe all the way sleeveless

1742
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
But it's getting close to Santa with muscles

1743
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,480
It is close to Santa with muscles

1744
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,480
Kogan style

1745
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
I guess maybe I like this in general

1746
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
For some reason

1747
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,480
I think I like

1748
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,480
Buff Santas

1749
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,480
Not in an attracted to way

1750
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,480
In a I think it's cute way

1751
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,480
I think for all the things I won't put on the cute list

1752
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,480
I think buff Santas are cute

1753
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
I think buff Santas are cute

1754
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,480
It's something adorable

1755
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,480
I like buff Santas

1756
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,480
I don't know that I would even consider them cute

1757
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,480
I think it's such a large swath of Santas

1758
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,480
That I don't know that I could give it a full blanket cute

1759
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,480
I'll just Google

1760
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,480
Buff Santa stuff

1761
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,480
Buff

1762
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,480
Well you know it's like

1763
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,480
I am looking at some of the funniest pictures

1764
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,480
I've ever seen

1765
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Look at this

1766
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,480
I know translate to the listener

1767
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,480
This is a really angry

1768
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,480
Probably AI Santa who's really ripped

1769
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,480
Who's going like

1770
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,480
He's so upset

1771
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,480
He looks upset like he just ate

1772
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,480
Like three meat parts

1773
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,480
And then there's a weird

1774
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,480
Mangled

1775
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,480
Tim Burton candy cane

1776
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,480
In front of him that he looks disgusted by

1777
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,480
What is this picture?

1778
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,480
This is a t-shirt I can buy on

1779
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,480
Redbubble

1780
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,480
That's interesting

1781
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,480
It is AI

1782
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,480
Look up the movie Santa's Slay

1783
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,480
Which I believe is the name of a

1784
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,480
Movie starring pro wrestler

1785
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,480
Goldberg

1786
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,480
Where he's like an evil Santa but he's Jack Santa

1787
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,480
I like this but I don't think it's cute

1788
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,480
Because he's mad

1789
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,480
But this seems like fun

1790
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,480
This is from 2005

1791
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,480
Santa's Slay

1792
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,480
These are some very funny prosthetics and beards

1793
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,480
So yeah I'm pro Buff Santa

1794
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,480
Maybe that's an episode for next year

1795
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,480
Buff Santa next year

1796
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,480
Let's put a pin in that

1797
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,480
So that's

1798
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,480
A pretty big pin

1799
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,480
To get through those muscles

1800
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,480
Santa's Slay

1801
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,480
Is he flanked

1802
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,480
Sidekick wise by

1803
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,480
SCTV's Dave Thomas

1804
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,480
That's who I think I'm looking at in this picture

1805
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,480
Maybe that's right

1806
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,480
I have actually seen a lot of this

1807
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,480
But maybe in 2006

1808
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,480
So I can't remember

1809
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,480
I'm sorry on the poster

1810
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
Brett Ratner presents

1811
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,480
He didn't direct it but he

1812
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,480
Produced it

1813
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,480
Or just like brought it

1814
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,480
Somewhere

1815
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,480
Boy we never stop finding out about crap

1816
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,480
Robert Culp

1817
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,480
Many time

1818
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,480
Columbo villain

1819
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
Who's Saul

1820
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,480
Rubenek

1821
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,480
Shit shit he's a

1822
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,480
What is he in? I know this guy

1823
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,480
Let me keep going Chris Catan

1824
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,480
And our leader

1825
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,480
This strike year Fran Drescher

1826
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,480
Appears in this film

1827
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,480
Saul Rubenek

1828
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,480
You've seen him he's in a bunch of stuff

1829
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,480
And now it just went back to Yo Ho Ho

1830
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,480
And a bottle of rum for some reason on my computer

1831
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,480
While I was looking him up

1832
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,480
He's in

1833
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,480
A lot of things and I can't think of a single one

1834
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,480
He's Kivas Faho

1835
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,480
Kivas Faho on Star Trek Next Gen

1836
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,480
Well that's true

1837
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,480
Kivas Faho

1838
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,480
You're looking at a picture of him right?

1839
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,480
Yeah so you don't recognize him?

1840
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,480
No automatically no

1841
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,480
Oh I probably know him as Detective Saul

1842
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,480
I know him as Detective Saul Panzer

1843
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,480
In the Golden Spiders and Nero Wolf mystery

1844
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,480
That's it

1845
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,480
He's

1846
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,480
Yeah he's in Buster's Scrugs

1847
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,480
I forget where

1848
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,480
He's just in a lot of stuff

1849
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,480
Well

1850
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,480
I like his name

1851
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,480
Speaking of

1852
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,480
While we're looking up things

1853
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,480
Did you ever figure out the set list

1854
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,480
Or we lost that thread?

1855
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,480
Well yeah it's complicated

1856
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,480
Because most of his

1857
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,480
Recent set lists in the last few months

1858
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,480
Have been him performing with

1859
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,480
A show called

1860
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,480
Brian Setzer's Rockabilly Riot

1861
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,480
And those are mostly

1862
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,480
Straight Gats

1863
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,480
That's covers

1864
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,480
Some Hoogie Carmichael in his orchestra covers

1865
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,480
This sounds the same

1866
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,480
This sounds no different

1867
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,480
Than what it usually is

1868
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,480
Well I'm saying it's not really orchestra

1869
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,480
It's not really the big band

1870
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,480
He's not doing in the mood is what you're saying

1871
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,480
No he's doing Rock This Town

1872
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,480
He's doing Fishnet Stockings

1873
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,480
The Straight Gats song

1874
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,480
So glad I don't know more

1875
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,480
Straight Gats songs

1876
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,480
Really thankful this holiday season

1877
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
That's what I'm thankful for

1878
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,480
Rockabilly Riot

1879
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,480
George on my mind

1880
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,480
That's another Hoogie Carmichael

1881
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,480
Oh yeah I see that now

1882
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,480
On the road again

1883
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,480
Okay

1884
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,480
Tis the Sea Sun

1885
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,480
Here's what I'll say off the bat

1886
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,480
I think I like Tis the

1887
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,480
Season better than Christmas Island

1888
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,480
I think I might too

1889
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,480
I don't know what it is about it

1890
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,480
But I think there's more

1891
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,480
I think there's more things on here

1892
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,480
Especially there's an original song I really like

1893
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,480
Called Santa Stole Thanksgiving

1894
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,480
I think that's the big ticket item

1895
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,480
Which is the big yes I think that's the best of all of these

1896
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,480
Of all these songs

1897
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,480
And it is real fun

1898
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,480
But let's give a little wonderful

1899
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,480
Wonderful Christmas time I've realized is controversial

1900
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,480
And I'm just blown away

1901
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,480
Some people do not, Lindsay does not like

1902
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,480
Wonderful Christmas time

1903
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,480
Lindsay's an anti yeah

1904
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,480
I have good friends who are anti

1905
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,480
And sometimes you will get to a list

1906
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,480
Of the worst Christmas songs ever

1907
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,480
And it's on there

1908
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,480
Sometimes you'll see it at number one

1909
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,480
The whole list I'm anticipating

1910
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,480
But what's the big dog going to be

1911
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,480
Excuse me

1912
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,480
Get out of here with that

1913
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Maybe a minute too long

1914
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,480
I guess so

1915
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
I'm giving people a little bone here

1916
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,480
It's really delightful

1917
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,480
Synths he's having a lot of fun noodling with those

1918
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,480
Synths and you take the synths

1919
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,480
And you take them away and you replace them with steel drums

1920
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,480
And I am less of a fan

1921
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,480
It is not

1922
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,480
My favorite version of

1923
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,480
Wonderful Christmas time

1924
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,480
Getting ready for you to do like a

1925
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,480
And I think it's pretty good

1926
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,480
Just

1927
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,480
I mean there's a little synth

1928
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,480
That is a little unusual for Jimmy

1929
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
I'm a synth snob I don't know

1930
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,480
I understand but I'm just saying for him

1931
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,480
That is a noise that is not on a lot of Jimmy songs

1932
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,480
So I'm giving them some credit for at least

1933
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,480
Retaining some magic

1934
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,480
Give me a big

1935
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,480
5% of the magic whatever

1936
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,480
But they've slowed it down

1937
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,480
Which I would not necessarily have done

1938
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,480
That might not be my

1939
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,480
I'm a big synth guy

1940
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,480
I'm not a big organ guy

1941
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,480
That's boring

1942
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,480
That's boring

1943
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,480
And that's enough

1944
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,480
Synths he's having

1945
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,480
A wonderful

1946
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,480
Christmas time

1947
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
Okay

1948
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,480
It's okay

1949
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,480
I'm not going to listen to that over

1950
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,480
Again we were sort of talking before about

1951
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,480
Could it go in the

1952
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,480
Could it be one of the versions you listen to

1953
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,480
And I don't think that would put that in there

1954
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,480
He does Jingle Bell Rock

1955
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,480
Which of course I talked about this

1956
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,480
I do the original Jingle Bells

1957
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,480
He does Jingle Bell Rock on here

1958
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
My favorite

1959
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,480
Now this is pretty just straight ahead

1960
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,480
That's the full regular

1961
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,480
That's how you do it you bring the Jingle Bells in there

1962
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,480
Jingle Bell Jingle Bell

1963
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,480
Jingle Bell Rock

1964
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,480
Jingle Bell Jingle Bell

1965
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,480
Jingle Bell Rock

1966
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,480
That's it

1967
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,480
Whoever oh who's singing it doesn't even matter

1968
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,480
That's just a timeless song

1969
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,480
I love my preferred version

1970
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,480
My preferred version is Hall & Oates

1971
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,480
With the music video where G.E. Smith

1972
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,480
Is grandma

1973
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,480
The family comes over

1974
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,480
I think it's a video they're mortified by

1975
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,480
Because it's very hammy

1976
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,480
Shot in a day quick

1977
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,480
But then you think it's an old granny

1978
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,480
But then

1979
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,480
She rips off for

1980
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,480
Shawl and there's a guitar underneath

1981
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,480
Just in time to play the solo

1982
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,480
Check it out if you're a G. Smith fan

1983
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,480
Which again this is club 3

1984
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,480
So I assume most people

1985
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,480
Are specific to this

1986
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,480
Saturday Night Live band

1987
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,480
Okay so he does

1988
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,480
All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth

1989
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,480
A song I've never

1990
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,480
Liked

1991
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,480
Jason what do you think?

1992
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,480
It wasn't even my favorite when I was in the

1993
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,480
Business of losing teeth

1994
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,480
The business

1995
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,480
It is a business

1996
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,480
A few years

1997
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,480
You're like wiggling it

1998
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,480
You're giving me like hard rolls

1999
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,480
This is almost

2000
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,480
Bite into this and it'll take it out

2001
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,480
Bite into some Italian

2002
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,480
That was kind of a Jimmy Line you pulled off the top of your head too there

2003
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,480
What?

2004
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,480
I didn't even like it when I was in the business

2005
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,480
I didn't even like it

2006
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,480
That was a good turn of freight

2007
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,480
And then the next song

2008
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,480
Is called

2009
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,480
Driving the Pig

2010
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,480
I'm baffled by this song

2011
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,480
And this is a confusing one

2012
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,480
Can we get some Driving the Pig

2013
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,480
Yeah yeah here we go

2014
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,480
Driving the Pig

2015
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,480
Some familiar instruments

2016
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,480
Hold on

2017
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,480
This is sort of like the Billie Jean lead up

2018
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,480
Where you really get into the rhythm of it

2019
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,480
This is a genre song

2020
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,480
Whatever you call this genre song

2021
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,480
Christmas in the Caribbean

2022
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,480
On the island named for snakes

2023
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,480
Songlines took me to Culebra

2024
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,480
For a perfect Yuletide break

2025
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,480
I had gone there for the fishing

2026
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,480
But when I stepped off of the plane

2027
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,480
There was an airy celebration

2028
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,480
I couldn't quite explain

2029
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,480
I had gone there for the fishing

2030
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,480
But when I stepped off of the plane

2031
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,480
There was an airy celebration

2032
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,480
I couldn't quite explain

2033
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,480
I couldn't quite explain

2034
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,480
Driving

2035
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,480
Driving

2036
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,480
Driving the pig tonight

2037
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,480
Driving

2038
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,480
Driving the pig tonight

2039
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,480
It's a smoking revelation

2040
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,480
And a pork pie ecstasy

2041
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,480
Steering wheel is turning toward

2042
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,480
These possibilities

2043
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,480
Little Jesus stole my birthday

2044
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,480
And my savings

2045
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,480
I got you high

2046
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,480
We got to a stagistics to sing

2047
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,480
I like this

2048
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,480
Come and join us for some ham

2049
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,480
Can I stop it?

2050
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,480
Can I read the lyrics?

2051
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,480
Little Jesus stole our birthday

2052
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,480
Christmas babies we got scammed

2053
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,480
Does this mean himself?

2054
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,480
He's mad at Jesus

2055
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,480
Stealing his birthday

2056
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,480
Jesus was there first

2057
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,480
But the three kings were our saviors

2058
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,480
Come and join us for some ham

2059
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,480
And then pork pie ecstasy

2060
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,480
Is driving the pig

2061
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,480
Killing a pig and feasting on the pig

2062
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,480
There's some articles

2063
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,480
And I think a YouTube

2064
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,480
Behind the scenes video

2065
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,480
Where someone says what does this mean

2066
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,480
I would think

2067
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,480
The ham pig

2068
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,480
Unless this is some sort of

2069
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,480
Sick sacrifice he's talking about

2070
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
But it seems like

2071
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,480
That's what he's getting at

2072
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,480
Sometimes he doesn't want to spell it out for you

2073
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
He wants to leave some mystery

2074
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
Some of these biblical figures can't have ham, right?

2075
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,480
Oh, I guess that's true

2076
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,480
Maybe that's a joke

2077
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,480
Is that a part of it?

2078
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,480
I mean, some of the magic of Jimmy's songwriting

2079
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,480
Is that it's not always

2080
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,480
Exactly clear what he's saying

2081
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,480
Now maybe some again, bigger Buffetheads

2082
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,480
Will say always, come on

2083
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,480
He said what the meaning of this is

2084
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,480
Oldtimemusic.com says

2085
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,480
At its core, driving the pig

2086
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,480
Celebrates the spirit of freedom

2087
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,480
And living the life

2088
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,480
On one's own terms

2089
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,480
Oh

2090
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,480
Oh

2091
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,480
Okay

2092
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,480
So, a lot of Jimmy's songs

2093
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,480
Here's what I'll say

2094
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,480
I like his voice better

2095
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,480
On this album

2096
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
I like his older voice

2097
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,480
There's something like, I don't know if it's maybe the quality of the recording

2098
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,480
Of Christmas Island

2099
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,480
I don't know if this is more modern recording

2100
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,480
But I like the quality of his voice more

2101
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,480
It's a little mellower maybe

2102
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,480
It's mellower, but it is a little deeper

2103
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,480
And I like it, I think maybe that contributes to me

2104
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,480
Liking this album better

2105
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,480
Than Christmas Island

2106
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,480
This one, I'm baffled by it

2107
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,480
But I like the genre

2108
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,480
I think some of the covers

2109
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,480
Selections are good

2110
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,480
And I think it's got a little more silliness

2111
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,480
In fact, I'm going to advocate for

2112
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
Skipping the next track, saving it

2113
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,480
Because I think that's actually the real

2114
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,480
Well that's the

2115
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,480
I would say that's the money as far as if you're looking for complete

2116
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,480
Jimmy Universe

2117
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,480
Nonsense

2118
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,480
Maybe that's a closer

2119
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,480
Just the title

2120
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,480
Gives that away

2121
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,480
We get a Mack and Allie

2122
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,480
Original

2123
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,480
Which

2124
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,480
Which

2125
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,480
Which

2126
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,480
Which

2127
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,480
Which

2128
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,480
This has some lyrics

2129
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,480
It's on the leg

2130
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,480
Christmas

2131
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,480
Everything I wanted the most

2132
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,480
No island or peninsula

2133
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,480
Christmas

2134
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,480
Another Christmas

2135
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
So close

2136
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,480
As you can put your finger on it

2137
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,480
So far my wish is just

2138
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,480
Didn't do

2139
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,480
I didn't get for Christmas what I wanted

2140
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
A little more time

2141
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,480
With you

2142
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,480
I want to fool around

2143
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,480
Go to town in the devil

2144
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,480
Meaning way

2145
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,480
Yeah, Mike you should be out on

2146
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,480
That too, this double entendre filth

2147
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,480
Yeah, I mean look

2148
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,480
It's so, I love his little like

2149
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,480
Impish way about him

2150
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,480
And his cheeky smiles

2151
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,480
So I'll let him get away

2152
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,480
There's nothing pervy

2153
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,480
Go to town

2154
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,480
So he's also, he means on a

2155
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,480
On a pork pie

2156
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,480
On a ham

2157
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,480
That's what he means

2158
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,480
Oh, I just by the way

2159
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,480
Oh, I can't, yeah, keep moving

2160
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,480
I just walked into something there

2161
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,480
Really accidentally and I won't even acknowledge it

2162
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,480
Past this line

2163
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,480
Past this sentence, I got worried too

2164
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,480
The word pie was said

2165
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,480
Okay, I don't even know how to collect myself

2166
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
So yeah, Mack

2167
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,480
I like this song though, I'll say that

2168
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,480
There's nothing

2169
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,480
There's nothing that makes you go

2170
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
When you hear this

2171
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,480
What? I just, I did

2172
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
Well, okay, you're right

2173
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
Other than the lyric

2174
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,480
Go to town in the double meaning way

2175
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,480
But I mean it's not, it's fun I guess is really what I'm just trying to say

2176
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Well this is, if you're worried

2177
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,480
About the state of the country bear jamboree

2178
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,480
You can have this kind of

2179
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,480
Songwriting and performing

2180
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,480
To look forward to

2181
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,480
That's it, oh, you know what

2182
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,480
Also, if Frank Marshall's unavailable

2183
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,480
This requires some help from the

2184
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,480
Walt Disney company, but why not get one of those bears

2185
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,480
Whichever one, whichever bear

2186
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,480
Is the most like

2187
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,480
Buffet, make a copy of it

2188
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,480
And send that on the road

2189
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,480
You replace Jimmy Buffet with a country bear

2190
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,480
Which one? Wow

2191
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,480
It's hard to name them even after we did that series

2192
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,480
Henry is kind of the MC

2193
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,480
And he has to wear a lot of hats

2194
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,480
But isn't one of them more

2195
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,480
One of them has more of like the

2196
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,480
The island hat

2197
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,480
And the kind of frayed guitar

2198
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,480
Which one's that?

2199
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,480
Are you talking about newly renamed

2200
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,480
Romeo McGraw?

2201
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,480
Well he's Elvis in the show

2202
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,480
In the Japan show basically

2203
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,480
You know what, well Henry's

2204
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,480
More Buffet-esque

2205
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,480
I'll stick with Henry for now and it's up to them

2206
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,480
If they want the raccoon to

2207
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,480
Burst out of the hat or not

2208
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,480
I heard that they're not

2209
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,480
They're not going to be new robots, they're going to be the same robots

2210
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,480
I think I was saying

2211
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,480
That's good, I don't want

2212
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,480
Yeah, no I think that is good, ultimately

2213
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,480
I think they were going to

2214
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,480
They would just not be the same

2215
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,480
You know he's kind of like Jimmy, he's the one in the

2216
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,480
Five Bear Rugs with the little hat and the banjo

2217
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,480
He's kind of jolly

2218
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,480
Like Jimmy

2219
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,480
Yeah, what about Shaker?

2220
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,480
Shaker maybe?

2221
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,480
They're all good choices

2222
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,480
Let's be honest, country bear wise

2223
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,480
You know what I'm glad is that

2224
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,480
They didn't, what happened with the

2225
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,480
Country Bears is that they didn't say

2226
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,480
Okay this will be the final bear show

2227
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,480
Okay, curtain comes down and then they show just a video

2228
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,480
Of ILM's

2229
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,480
New country bear models

2230
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,480
And then they don't explain

2231
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,480
What's going on until an hour later and say

2232
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,480
Oh now the country bears are just a video basically

2233
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,480
There's a QR code

2234
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,480
But because it's a dizzy website it never works

2235
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,480
And the country bears

2236
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,480
Made it themselves

2237
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,480
Out of thatch

2238
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,480
Oh they have a justification

2239
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,480
Oh

2240
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,480
It doesn't work at all

2241
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,480
You can't make a QR code made out of sticks on your way out

2242
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,480
Each person actually gets a

2243
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,480
Physical QR code

2244
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,480
Rub them together and the smoke will give you a vision

2245
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,480
Then they will show you what we're gonna do

2246
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,480
Splash some Pago's Bill's Salsa on ends

2247
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,480
See if you can figure out what's going on

2248
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,480
Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree

2249
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,480
Again, a song I always liked a lot

2250
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,480
I don't know that we need to play it

2251
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,480
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer

2252
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,480
I'll play a little of this, this is of course the version

2253
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,480
Or the song you know

2254
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,480
Starts a slower

2255
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,480
I always did like Rudolph a lot

2256
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,480
They did, because Rudolph was in

2257
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,480
You're playing the real

2258
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,480
And then, what's that?

2259
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,480
You're playing the real one to compare contrast you're saying

2260
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,480
No this is it, this is the Jimmy one

2261
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,480
Oh I thought this was the, oh wow

2262
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,480
It fooled me

2263
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,480
Rudolph was added later to the Reindeer lore

2264
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,480
Correct? I think that's right

2265
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,480
But I was gonna say it really worked

2266
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,480
Like if Rudolph was like Poochie

2267
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,480
It did really work on me

2268
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,480
Cause like immediately

2269
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,480
I was like Rudolph is the star of this

2270
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,480
Like I never cared about any other reindeer

2271
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,480
But Rudolph because of this song

2272
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,480
They Poochied him

2273
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,480
And it was so effective

2274
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,480
And I think probably remains effective

2275
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
I love this

2276
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,480
Song, I hate this inch

2277
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,480
You know Dasher and Dancer

2278
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
But if you recall

2279
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,480
Like I don't like that

2280
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,480
Was it just anticipation

2281
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,480
You were like get to the fucking fun part

2282
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,480
Get to the start, we're all here for one reason

2283
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,480
Rudolph the red nose reindeer

2284
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,480
You know what this is like for me

2285
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,480
I love

2286
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,480
I love LA, but I don't want to hear

2287
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
That, hey New York City

2288
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,480
Really? It's golden

2289
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,480
I'm like skip, get to the

2290
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,480
I don't like that, all the people dressed like monkeys

2291
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,480
Skip, skip, skip

2292
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,480
If there's a podcast skip button on that

2293
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
It's the same format, little slow intro, I don't want to hear it

2294
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,480
Right to the Dodger's victory

2295
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,480
I love LA

2296
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,480
You know as the fireworks are going off

2297
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,480
And they're running the bass

2298
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,480
Yeah, yeah sure

2299
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,480
I want to get right to

2300
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
The fine work of the Toto gentleman

2301
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,480
Steve Lukather and David Bage

2302
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,480
Great solos

2303
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,480
But if you think about

2304
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,480
Timelines I haven't thought about

2305
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,480
It was the night before Christmas

2306
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,480
1823

2307
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,480
Rudolph the red nose reindeer doesn't

2308
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,480
Show up until 1949

2309
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,480
That is

2310
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,480
120 years

2311
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,480
Of the reindeer as we know them

2312
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,480
And then the boldness

2313
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,480
Of putting a new kid on the block

2314
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,480
And we all love him more

2315
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,480
Yeah, it worked

2316
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,480
You know why it's not Pucci

2317
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,480
Is that Pucci had no character

2318
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,480
And no vulnerability

2319
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,480
And conflict, but Rudolph

2320
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,480
Co-ops the retcons

2321
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,480
The story, and tells you

2322
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,480
You know Dash, you know all them right?

2323
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,480
Well, they're assholes

2324
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,480
And only one of them is nice

2325
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,480
And they only come around

2326
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,480
Because the nice one

2327
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,480
Did something good

2328
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,480
Now they just want to kiss his ass

2329
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,480
Yes, no they really

2330
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,480
Paint them out to be like

2331
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
Fair weather friends

2332
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,480
What have you done for me lately?

2333
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,480
Yeah, absolutely

2334
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,480
Light up your nose and maybe all

2335
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,480
Lead our way tonight

2336
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,480
And then we'll see if I like you

2337
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,480
Has anyone tried to add a new reindeer

2338
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,480
In the last hundred years?

2339
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,480
Somebody had there must have been

2340
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,480
Yes, all of the other reindeer

2341
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,480
A book that has something to do

2342
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,480
With Drew Barrymore

2343
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,480
I forget what she narrated it

2344
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,480
Or I don't know if she wrote it

2345
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,480
Maybe, interesting

2346
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,480
I think maybe that's a book

2347
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,480
And then there was a special

2348
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,480
Yes, a 1999 special

2349
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,480
With Drew Barrymore

2350
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,480
Joey Pants

2351
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,480
And apparently Michael Stipe

2352
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,480
Wow, okay

2353
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,480
So there you go

2354
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,480
I don't know if that's

2355
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,480
I think people like that

2356
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,480
But I don't think that's accepted

2357
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,480
As a forever edition

2358
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,480
Boy, and look at this

2359
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,480
In this special Merry Christmas

2360
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,480
After all, performed by

2361
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,480
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy

2362
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,480
Featuring Drew Barrymore

2363
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,480
Wow, so she's the voice

2364
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,480
Of Olive

2365
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,480
Interesting, so they tried to get

2366
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,480
A new reindeer in

2367
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
But maybe she just didn't take quite as well

2368
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,480
I think it's successful within this

2369
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,480
But we don't need to adopt that

2370
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,480
As permanent lore

2371
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,480
Also, another reindeer added

2372
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,480
Michael Stipe as Schnitzel

2373
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Blitzen's flightless cousin

2374
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,480
Oh my god

2375
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,480
Michael Stipe is Schnitzel

2376
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,480
Michael Stipe is Schnitzel

2377
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,480
Schnitzel

2378
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,480
And Matt Groening is Arturo

2379
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,480
The elf that Schnitzel throws

2380
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,480
Olive into

2381
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,480
Into, not like

2382
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,480
Probably just like

2383
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,480
Doesn't go into Schnitzel's body

2384
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,480
Is 1999 Man on the Moon?

2385
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,480
Yeah

2386
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,480
So in that same year

2387
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,480
Michael Stipe recorded

2388
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,480
That hit song

2389
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,480
For the hit movie

2390
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,480
And then he was also Schnitzel

2391
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,480
Yeah, he did to the score of the film

2392
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,480
The song existed before

2393
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,480
But there was a new song

2394
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,480
The great beyond is that

2395
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,480
Yeah, I'm sorry

2396
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,480
We had to say it

2397
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,480
Yeah, yeah

2398
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,480
Sorry, Rudolph the reindeer

2399
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,480
He does a whole wind up to it

2400
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,480
See, that's Jimmy

2401
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,480
They put the controls around

2402
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,480
The production is better I guess

2403
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,480
I think the production is better

2404
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,480
But also some more of my favorites as well

2405
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,480
The most famous

2406
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,480
Famous reindeer

2407
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,480
Of all

2408
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,480
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

2409
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,480
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

2410
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,480
Had a very shiny nose

2411
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,480
And if you ever saw it

2412
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,480
And if you ever saw it

2413
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,480
You would even say glow

2414
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,480
That's it

2415
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,480
I think I got it

2416
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,480
I like it, I think it's good

2417
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,480
Alright, let's get to my favorite

2418
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,480
Santa's Stole Thanksgiving

2419
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,480
This is an original song

2420
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,480
And I play this

2421
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,480
I do play this every year for sure

2422
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,480
This is on my list

2423
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,480
For who?

2424
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,480
My personal list

2425
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,480
Lindsay likes to listen to the same

2426
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,480
25 Christmas songs

2427
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,480
Over the course of the holiday

2428
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,480
And I don't like to do that

2429
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,480
As much, I like to find other

2430
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,480
Stuff if I'm going to do the holidays

2431
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,480
Oh, holy

2432
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,480
No

2433
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,480
Mostly the religious stuff

2434
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,480
And the works of John Pierpont

2435
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,480
Mostly

2436
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,480
So yeah, this is

2437
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,480
Santa's Stole Thanksgiving

2438
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,480
It's jaunty

2439
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,480
What else would you say about it?

2440
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,480
Santa's Stole Thanksgiving

2441
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,480
For Christmas

2442
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,480
Drug-plammered rock

2443
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,480
To the North Pole with his sledge

2444
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,480
Whoa

2445
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,480
No rooms never saw him coming

2446
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,480
The bump and knocks they kept coming

2447
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,480
That Thursday in November

2448
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,480
Caught gobbled up by December

2449
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,480
Santa's Stole Thanksgiving

2450
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,480
For Christmas

2451
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,480
Why? What was the motive?

2452
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,480
It's such a happy holiday

2453
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,480
No more laid-back relaxation

2454
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,480
It's Black Friday degradation

2455
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,480
It's Santa's Stole Thanksgiving

2456
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,480
To them all

2457
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,480
That didn't rhyme with anything

2458
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
It was not a great rhyme

2459
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,480
Or a rhyme

2460
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,480
It's like he's quoting

2461
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,480
Fruitcakes where he talks about

2462
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,480
Sushi in the mall

2463
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,480
Sushi in the mall

2464
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,480
Yeah

2465
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,480
It was earlier in the 90s

2466
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,480
It's really weird to see here now

2467
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,480
Imagine it

2468
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,480
Sushi in a mall

2469
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,480
So this is a song

2470
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,480
That at least

2471
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,480
It shows me that he's paying

2472
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,480
Some attention in like 30 years

2473
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,480
Or 20 years of being like very rich

2474
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,480
He's noticed that or somebody's mentioned

2475
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,480
That Thanksgiving

2476
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,480
Now is the time when sales happen

2477
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,480
Yeah

2478
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,480
Now maybe that's he was 10, 15 years too late on

2479
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,480
The like door buster

2480
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,480
People trampling each other for TVs

2481
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,480
But it is

2482
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,480
He's a topical song from him

2483
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,480
He usually writes timeless music is what I'm saying

2484
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,480
And this is a topical song

2485
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,480
And it's clear what he's writing about I would say

2486
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,480
We understand what the message is

2487
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,480
And it's jaunty

2488
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,480
So I like all of that about it

2489
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,480
Jason what do you think?

2490
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,480
Yeah I like it too

2491
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,480
It is

2492
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,480
It's that he didn't get to see the big thing this year

2493
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,480
For Black Friday

2494
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,480
I think a lot of companies

2495
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,480
Saying on Thanksgiving

2496
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,480
We're not opening

2497
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,480
So you're saying you might have had to revise the song?

2498
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,480
Well no I'm saying

2499
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,480
Sushi in the mall

2500
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,480
Eventually became common place

2501
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,480
Eventually became the norm

2502
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,480
And now half the malls

2503
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,480
Three quarters are at the malls

2504
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,480
Well his AI will sing a song

2505
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,480
That's revised maybe in a decade

2506
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,480
About what's happening

2507
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,480
Because I

2508
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,480
Dick talk we need to ban it

2509
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,480
I saw some reports

2510
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,480
I don't think the

2511
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,480
Crazy like door buster sales

2512
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,480
Are even happening as much anymore

2513
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,480
And it's not maybe like

2514
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480
Pandemonium as much in the stores

2515
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,480
No

2516
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,480
That we're online I think has to help mitigate

2517
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,480
That has helped

2518
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,480
And everybody is trying to get

2519
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,480
Move the starting line back a little bit

2520
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,480
So you're seeing more places

2521
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
Just like oh by the way ours starts Monday

2522
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,480
Sales start Monday

2523
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,480
They go into the following Monday

2524
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,480
For Cyber Monday

2525
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,480
So now it's spread out over like two months

2526
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,480
So yes this is maybe a specific

2527
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
Moment in time when it was

2528
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,480
Truly Friday or midnight Thursday

2529
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,480
He had seen a news report

2530
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,480
Like you said 15 years prior

2531
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,480
Right

2532
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,480
I gotta write a song about that

2533
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,480
15 years later

2534
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,480
Oh yeah remember

2535
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,480
I wrote it on my notebook

2536
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,480
I wrote it on the husk of a corn

2537
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,480
A corn on the cobite

2538
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,480
That's where I write my notes

2539
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,480
I wrote it in sriracha

2540
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,480
Luckily it held

2541
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,480
Yeah so that's good

2542
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,480
It's good

2543
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,480
Then he does the song

2544
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,480
Mala Kalikimaka again

2545
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,480
But with the ukulele player

2546
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,480
Jake Shimabukura

2547
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,480
Is how you pronounce it I believe

2548
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,480
It's basically the same

2549
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,480
He doesn't do much

2550
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,480
With it which why would you want to mess with it

2551
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,480
It's perfection already

2552
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,480
This is weird to do it twice

2553
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,480
It is weird to do it twice

2554
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,480
But I guess because it's featuring someone else

2555
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,480
That's the reason you know you don't have to

2556
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,480
You wouldn't just

2557
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Keep it at one

2558
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,480
Okay what did he do Winter Wonderland

2559
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,480
What do we think about

2560
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,480
Winter Wonderland in general

2561
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,480
I like that song

2562
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,480
It's like a

2563
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,480
It's like a little bit of a

2564
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,480
Satter

2565
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,480
Snowflakes this far south

2566
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,480
Tell me

2567
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,480
Ah

2568
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,480
It's Christmas

2569
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,480
Come on

2570
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,480
Sleigh bells ring

2571
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,480
Are you listening

2572
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,480
He needed to get in character for the song so he had to do that little

2573
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,480
Improv at the top

2574
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,480
You know what this one has

2575
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,480
Speaking of characters

2576
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,480
I think I'm not so

2577
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,480
Psyched on this one

2578
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,480
He does a little voice

2579
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,480
He does

2580
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,480
I'm married you say no mon

2581
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,480
Yeah

2582
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,480
Mr. Snowmon

2583
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,480
You're going to find that

2584
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,480
Here and there through the Buffett discography

2585
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,480
Yeah it seems like it

2586
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,480
A little bit of reggae voice

2587
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,480
But you know he's

2588
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,480
No one's

2589
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,480
Adrian Brody making guest appearance

2590
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,480
As his character

2591
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,480
Oh man

2592
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,480
It's one of the finest pieces of media

2593
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,480
Adrian Brody's SNL intro

2594
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,480
Sean Paul

2595
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,480
Doing his character reggae mon

2596
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,480
Reggae mon

2597
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,480
I got to see a Q&A for

2598
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,480
Darjeeling limited one time and he was there

2599
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
And I just

2600
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,480
Stared at him

2601
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,480
I'm in the room with the guy who

2602
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,480
I'm in the room with reggae mon

2603
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,480
I couldn't look at anyone

2604
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,480
I just locked

2605
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,480
I think he caught me at one point

2606
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,480
This guy's probably thinking about me doing that reggae thing

2607
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,480
Yes I was

2608
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,480
Telepathically like you're understanding each other

2609
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,480
I know what you're thinking

2610
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,480
Then also at the end he says

2611
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,480
Frolic and play the parrot

2612
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,480
headway

2613
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,480
So we're doing our little

2614
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,480
amendments

2615
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,480
That's basically what I was scanning for in listening to these albums

2616
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,480
When did he change something and he did it

2617
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,480
About six times per

2618
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,480
Yeah baby it's

2619
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,480
Cold outside he does

2620
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,480
And he does a little flip of it

2621
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,480
He does it the other way

2622
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,480
He does it with

2623
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,480
Nadira Shakur who's one of his regular

2624
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,480
Backup singers I believe

2625
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,480
Yes that's right

2626
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,480
The audience knows, they know he's in the Coral Reefer band

2627
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,480
She was in the group Arrested Development though too

2628
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,480
That's impressive

2629
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,480
That's really cool

2630
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,480
And then he does White Christmas

2631
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,480
Which you know

2632
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,480
Was written by Irving Berlin

2633
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,480
Irving Berlin yeah

2634
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,480
I like White Christmas

2635
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,480
I do, I like White Christmas yeah

2636
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,480
It's a sad one though

2637
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,480
You know what here's the thing, have I said this about Christmas before

2638
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,480
That the argument I get in it with Lindsay

2639
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,480
Not it's an argument

2640
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,480
It's not an argument

2641
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,480
Shattering your novelty's skull

2642
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,480
Glasses against the wall

2643
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,480
She's not like Mrs. Claus to me

2644
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,480
Your music's coming off, I'm playing Santa

2645
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,480
Stole Thanksgiving dammit

2646
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,480
I find Christmas time so

2647
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,480
Like kind of melancholy and sad

2648
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,480
That it's not as much like

2649
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,480
I want to be enveloped in it

2650
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,480
And that was before Jimmy Buffet

2651
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,480
That was before yeah

2652
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,480
And Karl Rove

2653
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,480
I learned that Karl Rove

2654
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
Born on Christmas

2655
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,480
That's what all the Kissinger Twitter accounts are going to have to turn to

2656
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,480
Now it's got

2657
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,480
When is Karl Rove still alive

2658
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,480
They've probably

2659
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,480
Switched to it

2660
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,480
I'm going to do one of those

2661
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,480
I'm going to make so much Twitter bucks

2662
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,480
Doing my death count down

2663
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,480
You'll get them

2664
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,480
But yeah some of it

2665
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,480
I want to be sad on a roller coaster

2666
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,480
While tears for fears play

2667
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,480
But that's for a couple minutes

2668
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,480
Of course it's the killer plays

2669
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,480
Christmas is just

2670
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,480
It's the end of the year

2671
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,480
You're looking back

2672
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,480
It feels like the end

2673
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,480
It feels like the end to me

2674
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,480
And everything makes me feel very sad around the time

2675
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,480
The holiday season

2676
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,480
So I'm always just like

2677
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,480
Too much Christmas

2678
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,480
Stuff

2679
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,480
But I understand that seems like I'm being a

2680
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,480
Grinch about it but I feel like it's kind of like

2681
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
I have seasonal whatever it's called

2682
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,480
Effective disorder

2683
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,480
Well that's true

2684
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,480
Allergies whatever but I don't know

2685
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,480
I think that's common

2686
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,480
To some degree but

2687
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,480
White Christmas does make me sad

2688
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,480
But it is good

2689
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,480
There's a song called

2690
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,480
The closing of the year

2691
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,480
That's from the

2692
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,480
1992 feature film Toys

2693
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,480
This is a song by

2694
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,480
It's in the movie

2695
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,480
Toys is one of those bizarre things that ever happened

2696
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,480
It's in the movie and I'm like who's the singer

2697
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,480
Who am I looking at I can't tell

2698
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,480
It's Wendy Melvoin

2699
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,480
Wendy and Lisa do this song

2700
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,480
And it's everything you're describing

2701
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,480
It's about the melancholy and the closing of the year

2702
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,480
The heaviness of

2703
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,480
The kids choirs in it

2704
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,480
And then about half way through

2705
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,480
In the music video a magical moment where there's a

2706
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,480
Dark and silhouetted figure and then

2707
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,480
A light comes on him and it's Seal

2708
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,480
In the biggest

2709
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,480
Hat you've ever seen

2710
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,480
Seal in his giant

2711
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,480
Christmas top hat and he

2712
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,480
Is the most emotional bridge

2713
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,480
It's a weird song that I kind of like but I'm

2714
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,480
Also watching it like who on

2715
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,480
Earth heard this

2716
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,480
And thought yes that is everything I

2717
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,480
Feel everything I felt from the movie Toys

2718
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,480
It's supposed to be the most emotional

2719
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,480
Bleeding out song you've ever heard

2720
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,480
But then it's for Toys and then they'll cut to

2721
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,480
LL Cool J looking mean cause he's

2722
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,480
Like a military guy who wants to build mean

2723
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,480
Toys this is a terrible film

2724
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,480
But it's a awful movie

2725
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,480
No no no there's no guest

2726
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,480
Rap but there's something about it

2727
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,480
Listeners check it out look at this see if you

2728
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,480
Feel the magic I feel when

2729
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,480
Seal shows up in the biggest hat you

2730
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,480
Ever saw

2731
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,480
Wow now I gotta look I gotta

2732
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,480
Watch this

2733
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,480
I might

2734
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,480
People might check this out and say Scott

2735
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,480
That is the shittiest piece of shit

2736
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,480
Of ever and you'd be you wouldn't be wrong

2737
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,480
Yeah well I'll give it a whirl

2738
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,480
Maybe it'll be what come in your standards

2739
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,480
That'll be next year too we'll do an episode

2740
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,480
On that on Seal's big hat

2741
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,480
Yeah we're making declarations here

2742
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,480
It's really I mean if you like Kiss from a Rose

2743
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,480
In the bombast of that song getting to hear him

2744
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,480
Go at the closing

2745
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,480
Of the year

2746
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,480
And he's in the biggest hat

2747
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,480
Seal's pretty fun

2748
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,480
Uh huh I like Seal yeah

2749
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,480
My my

2750
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,480
I understand Mike what you're saying

2751
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,480
And I feel like I get a little of it

2752
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,480
But a lot of the times

2753
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,480
I feel like Jane and I

2754
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,480
Are much more of like let's

2755
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,480
Marathon home our Christmas movies

2756
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,480
Oh there's a chill in the air let's make

2757
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,480
Coco it's time to decorate the

2758
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,480
Tree who's rapping

2759
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,480
Today you're rapping okay

2760
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,480
You're having a ball I am having a ball I love

2761
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,480
Christmas yeah

2762
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,480
I don't think there's anything strange about that

2763
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,480
No no it's not I'm glad that's your

2764
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,480
It's Mike over here and his melancholy

2765
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,480
And that's what he's bringing to the table yeah I'm sorry

2766
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,480
I'm not saying I'm not trying to be a grinch

2767
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,480
But I just that's the way I

2768
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,480
Feel often do you like New

2769
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,480
Year's Eve do you like New Year's time

2770
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,480
I do like New Year's yes I don't like

2771
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,480
New Year's Eve I like New Year's Eve I feel a lot of pressure for it to be fun

2772
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,480
I love the first week in January

2773
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,480
I feel good

2774
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,480
The first week almost every first week in January

2775
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,480
I feel good I feel like

2776
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,480
Like I'm born

2777
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,480
Born anew yeah yeah

2778
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,480
Is that personally

2779
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,480
Because the city of LA is like

2780
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,480
Quiet and deserted

2781
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,480
Well there's something when my parents

2782
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,480
When my parents lived

2783
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,480
In Chicago and I would come back

2784
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,480
I would feel so good getting off like the plane

2785
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,480
In LA like probably

2786
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,480
Either first week in January just at the end of December

2787
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,480
And it was probably partly

2788
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,480
Because like everyone's gone

2789
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,480
And again I'm just like it feels the years

2790
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,480
Fresh it feels like here we go

2791
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,480
Okay okay you know

2792
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,480
But I'm not I if I'm

2793
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,480
Hanging out with you at Christmas time I'm not going to be a downer

2794
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,480
I can still party I can still hang

2795
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,480
You can still go invite Mike to your Christmas parties

2796
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,480
While you're young and cool yeah

2797
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,480
And he won't complain about the songs

2798
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,480
And try to get different songs in the list

2799
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,480
Well I might do that but I would do it in a fun way

2800
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,480
Where you think I'm cool because I am suggesting cool stuff

2801
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,480
Who's that guy who took over my phone and is putting his own music on?

2802
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,480
He's cool I know that

2803
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,480
He's cool

2804
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,480
He's cool he's trying to ask are you 17? 16?

2805
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,480
How old are you?

2806
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,480
Wow he found little Jimmy Dickens Christmas songs

2807
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,480
Yeah hell yeah

2808
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,480
Jason and I were listening to little Jimmy in the car yesterday

2809
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,480
What's that?

2810
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,480
Little Jimmy we've talked about little Jimmy Dickens

2811
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,480
I was probably so annoyed by the name I didn't remember it

2812
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,480
The club three people

2813

No

2814
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,480
We haven't even gotten into

2815
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,480
The club doesn't even know little Jimmy Dickens

2816
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,480
I found little Jimmy Dickens

2817
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,480
Letter to Santa song here

2818
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,480
We can play that at the end

2819
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,480
We're still learning about Kerwin Frost

2820
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,480
GQ calls him our

2821
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,480
Influencers favorite influencer

2822
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,480

2823
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,480
Sorry the new Mcnugget putties

2824
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,480
He designed the new Mcnugget putties

2825
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,480
I didn't know there was new Mcnugget putties

2826
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,480
The new starting yesterday

2827

The new starting yesterday Monday

2828
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,480

Mcnugget putties you can get at McDonald's

2831
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,480
Designed by a guy named Kerwin Frost

2832
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,480
Kerwin Frost who I had never heard of until this

2833
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,480
Happened and I will

2834
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,480
Let the listeners know that hopefully

2835
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,480
Maybe it'll be gone by then but there's a chase

2836
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,480
A secret gold Mcnugget

2837
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,480
That you can also get because these are blind boxes

2838
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,480
There's a chase

2839
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,480
To get the secret Mcnugget

2840
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,480
Well that's what they call a chase is when you

2841
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,480
Don't necessarily know what the design of the

2842
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,480
Blind box character

2843
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,480
It's like a fairy

2844
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,480
Scott's never heard of chase

2845
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,480
Scott doesn't know little Jimmy Dinkins

2846
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,480
Scott doesn't know Mack Mcenally

2847
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,480
He told you he did a

2848
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,480
Thing at like the CMA awards or something

2849
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,480
A couple years ago he just died like

2850
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,480
Within the last ten years but he did a bit with

2851
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,480
What like Brad Paisley where he played

2852
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,480
Little Justin Bieber on the

2853
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,480
CMAs and he's like 90

2854
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,480
He looks like

2855
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,480
Young old Benjamin Button

2856
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,480
Benjamin Button towards the end of the movie

2857
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,480
Or beginning of the movie

2858
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,480
He gets younger

2859
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,480
There's a chase for the little Jimmy Dinkins

2860
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,480
Mcnugget buddy

2861
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,480
Memorial

2862
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,480

2863
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,480
Twelve days of Christmas

2864
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,480

Fertrusion of Pear Tree I know

2867
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,480
This sounds boring

2868
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,480
On the day of Christmas my true love gave to me

2869
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,480
A purple parrot in a palm tree

Two tattoos

2930
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,480
And a purple parrot in a palm tree

2931
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,480
Which one wouldn't fit?

2932
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:40,480
He want, no, he wanted you to put it, give a tattoo to his body.

2933
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:44,480
He took me a couple times here, two fin hats.

2934
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,480
I thought he was saying two thin hats.

2935
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,480
And I was like, what could that be?

2936
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,480
Thin hats.

2937
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,480
Like a paper hat?

2938
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,480
Oh, fins, like that, okay, yeah, yeah.

2939
01:40:54,480 --> 01:41:00,480
Yeah, so that, yes, he does, he does fulfill like the promise of the, the Buffett verse in there.

2940
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:04,480
Which I guess is, yeah, that's the, that's the top song.

2941
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,480
And you can also, listeners, you can also watch a music video of that

2942
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,480
where they got everybody at all the shows to sing along to it.

2943
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:19,480
So if you want a visual representation of all of those things and to see all the people who Jimmy touched

2944
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:22,480
and all the people who purchased this album.

2945
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:28,480
Whatever you do, don't drink twelve lanchard cloggers and get behind the wheel of a mid-sized sedan.

2946
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:36,480
Yeah, so I want to say like, if people feel like we haven't done a good tri-

2947
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:42,480
I don't know why I'm setting us up to fail later, but if they feel like we haven't done a great tribute,

2948
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,480
it is coming soon, hopefully.

2949
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,480
That wasn't it.

2950
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,480
That wasn't the tribute.

2951
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,480
There's more.

2952
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,480
There's more coming.

2953
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:54,480
And I am impressed that so much of the audience is into him.

2954
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,480
And I like that.

2955
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:59,480
That every single Club 3 subscriber knows who Mack McAnally is.

2956
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:05,480
Yeah, sometimes we say stuff on the show and I go, oh, did anyone like that?

2957
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:08,480
Does anyone- people like the story.

2958
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,480
I think they like the bit on the show with the story of the plane.

2959
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:14,480
But it's hard to know sometimes of what we're talking about.

2960
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
It's like people actually have affection for that.

2961
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:23,480
So I'm glad that we know the audience is there for an insane amount of Buffett coming soon.

2962
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:26,480
Hours and hours.

2963
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:34,480
There were some comments in the Patreon that indicated some beleaguerment with the amount of Buffett.

2964
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:42,480
But one of those comments I know, I saw shut down with a classic catchphrase, counterpoint, you were wrong.

2965
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,480
Yes.

2966
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,480
Beep, beep, beep.

2967
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,480
They think it's a little money every time someone says it.

2968
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:51,480
And I have to like, I can't pretend that I think a lot of this music is great music,

2969
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:56,480
but I am delighted by hearing it, talking about it.

2970
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:57,480
Yeah.

2971
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:01,480
I'm glad that, you know, we don't have to leave Jimmy in 2023 and we won't.

2972
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:03,480
Believe us, we won't.

2973
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,480
We will not.

2974
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:07,480
And now playing us out with a song called Letter to Santa.

2975
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,480
Oh, wait, well, you know-

2976
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,480
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2977
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:12,480
First, you survived podcast The Ride.

2978
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,480
Thanks for subscribing to Club 3.

2979
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,480
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2980
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,480
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

2981
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:24,480
There's always that mildly snarky Transformers line, although that is from the most emotional moment in theme park history.

2982
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,480
True.

2983
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,480
So there's always emotion in there.

2984
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:30,480
But truly, this closes out the second year that we have done Club 3.

2985
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,480
That's true, you're right.

2986
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:34,480
And we thank you so much for subscribing to it.

2987
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:38,480
You guys especially make it so this podcast is viable for us to do.

2988
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:43,480
This year, you kept us afloat in a double strike year, a truly-

2989
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,480
Yeah.

2990
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:48,480
A double strike year, and you of course eased our pain in the year of Mr. Buffett's demise.

2991
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:58,480
So in all sincerity, we can't thank you enough for subscribing and truly you guys here, everybody here makes this thing work and keeps this podcast going.

2992
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,480
So let me give that sincere-

2993
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,480
No, you're right.

2994
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,480
That is nice and true.

2995
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,480
Message.

2996
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,480
Thank you so much.

2997
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,480
It's great.

2998
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,480
Thank you, everyone, I say.

2999
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,480
God bless us.

3000
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:08,480
God bless everyone.

3001
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,480
God bless us all.

3002
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:12,480
God bless, but then that's a back on us.

3003
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,480
God bless you, everyone.

3004
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:15,480
God bless you, everyone.

3005
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:21,480
And now your final reward for the year is some- what is it again?

3006
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:22,480
It's called Letter to Sand.

3007
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,480
I've never heard it before.

3008
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,480
It's by little Jimmy Dickens.

3009
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,480
And I-

3010
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:33,480
Now you get to- your present is a bunch of Christmas songs by an old man followed by another Christmas song by a much even older man.

3011
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:47,480
Dear Santa Claus, I sure thank you for all the gifts.

3012
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,480
He sounds like a good character.

3013
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:53,480
And after I thought it over, Santa, I decided to write.

3014
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,480
And thank you for all the toys.

3015
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,480
I immediately do like it, yeah.

3016
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,480
And especially the bike.

3017
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:05,480
My little brother John and my sister Sue and my-

3018
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,480
Like Mickey Rooney and the Simpsons.

3019
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:09,480
And tell you thank you too.

3020
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,480
Oh yeah, Santa.

3021
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,480
There's something else I want to say.

3022
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:16,480
Is it quick?

3023
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,480
Please don't get mad at me.

3024
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,480
Cause I gave my toys away.

3025
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:27,480
You know my friend Jerry who lives across the railroad track?

3026
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,480
Jerry?

3027
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:31,480
He doesn't even have a mom or dad.

3028
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:34,480
Just a little brother Jack.

3029
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,480
I went to see them.

3030
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,480
I went over there.

3031
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,480
Yeah, oh my god.

3032
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:45,480
The other song I like is called Take an Old Cold Tater and Wait.

3033
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:51,480
About how he didn't grow as a child because he was always eating cold taters.

3034
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,480
We'll play that next year.

3035
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,480
Because of coldness?

3036
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,480
Old cold taters.

3037
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:59,480
Is it that it was only taters?

3038
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:01,480
Do you want to keep this going so I can play the song?

3039
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:05,480
I forgot to say once again, regular ideas, submit them.

3040
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,480
City Walk Saga ideas, submit them.

3041
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:12,480
Regular, don't, not, Jimmy Dinkins.

3042
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,480
You can talk while you're playing it.

3043
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:18,480
Give me a holiday present and don't say Jimmy Dinkins.

3044
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,480
Dickins.

3045
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:26,480
Look how much my brain doesn't want to, it's bouncing it back real time.

3046
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,480
I say Dinkins.

3047
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,480
Here we go, this is the good stuff.

3048
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:35,480
The only armor I have is my head to keep them out of my brain.

3049
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,480
Take a tater and wait.

3050
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,480
There you go.
