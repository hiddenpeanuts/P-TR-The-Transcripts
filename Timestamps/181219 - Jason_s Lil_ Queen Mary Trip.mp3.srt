1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:25,544
podcast the ride where we have just sprung a surprise

3
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:28,004
that just came into existence right now.

4
00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:29,224
My name is Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:31,904
I'm joined by Jason Sheridan who is freaking out I think.

6
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:33,524
No, it's okay.

7
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:36,084
I'll harness the thousands of dollars I've spent

8
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:38,944
on improv trading to roll with these punches.

9
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:41,584
I've been surprised with you a lot

10
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:42,804
and you are very good at it.

11
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:44,164
So thank you so much.

12
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:45,324
Scott Garner also here.

13
00:00:45,384 --> 00:00:48,264
Scott Garner is here, but this is hardly about me.

14
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,984
I think we should explain why the bum rush

15
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,964
and what's occurring.

16
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:55,704
I think we casually talked about doing an episode

17
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:58,964
about what happened with Jason on Thanksgiving,

18
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:01,124
how he spent his Thanksgiving vacation

19
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:03,504
and you just gave us the slightest clue

20
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:06,284
to let us know we had to not overthink it

21
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,124
and just start doing it right now.

22
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:10,224
Yeah, we had a different episode planned

23
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:12,964
and truly like three minutes once you gave us a hint

24
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:15,984
of how the trip went, we threw the plans out the window.

25
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:17,484
I said, we have to do this now.

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,144
Which I'm not exactly thrilled about

27
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:21,124
because I spent a lot of time getting ready

28
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:23,384
for that other episode, but we'll do it at some point.

29
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:24,044
We're doing it.

30
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:25,264
We're not gonna not do that episode,

31
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:27,584
but the energy felt like it's here.

32
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:29,724
This is where the energy is in the room right now.

33
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:31,864
This does feel why, we have not done this before.

34
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:34,104
We've never turned on a dime like this.

35
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:35,984
The second topic switch out, yeah.

36
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:39,864
This is pretty exciting, but why are we so excited?

37
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:42,844
What happened over Thanksgiving break?

38
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,664
How did you spend your Thanksgiving break, Jason?

39
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:45,984
Well, I took a little trip, fellas.

40
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:51,404
I spent two nights on the historic cruise liner,

41
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:52,444
the Queen Mary.

42
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,784
The Queen Mary in Long Beach.

43
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:57,804
If you don't know the area, it's come up before

44
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:00,104
because it was going to be the centerpiece

45
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:02,824
of the Port Disney plan, like essentially

46
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:05,264
the West Coast Disney Sea in the 90s

47
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:08,264
that we talked about a little in the parking garage episode.

48
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:12,224
So yes, the big, beautiful boat in Long Beach,

49
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:14,164
which was briefly owned by Disney.

50
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,624
Not Disney's big red boat.

51
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:16,124
Oh, true.

52
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,384
That was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:18,824
Before they had their own cruise ships,

54
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:21,824
you'd see ads in the 90s for the big red boat.

55
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:25,844
But no, it's like, it's in the Long Beach Harbor,

56
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,644
which is otherwise like a little odd and industrial

57
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:31,904
and just like crates and stuff come in.

58
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,604
Yeah, it's interesting to me.

59
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:37,444
I had never spent a ton of time in Long Beach.

60
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:40,364
I'll tell you my memory of being in Long Beach before,

61
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:45,604
and that was PA-ing at a hairstylist convention.

62
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:50,064
On a season of Tabitha's salon takeover.

63
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:53,024
Of what, excuse me?

64
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,724
That was a Bravo show.

65
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:58,424
It was a spin-off of a different hair cutting program

66
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:05,304
mid-20, 20-ots, however you say it, around 2008 or so.

67
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:08,764
And this was, this was, this had been, I guess,

68
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:10,244
after the writer's strike.

69
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:13,144
But the rise of reality TV.

70
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:16,024
No shittier TV than after the writer's strike.

71
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:19,604
Yeah, and just networks literally needed content

72
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:21,004
to fill advertising.

73
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:23,844
Just anything, people waving their arms around.

74
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:25,364
Anything counts as a show.

75
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,064
Yeah, that was my first year living in LA.

76
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,964
Was working on like, my dad is better than your dad,

77
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:33,484
legally blonde, colon the musical,

78
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:35,584
colon the search for Ellie Woods.

79
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:36,524
That's where.

80
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:37,484
Oh, I can remember that.

81
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:39,664
A reality show about making the musical?

82
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:43,524
Trying to find a new lead for the Broadway musical.

83
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:46,424
Elle Woods, sorry, Ellie Woods is the.

84
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,384
Ours and we're all friends.

85
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,284
The comedian who I want to sketch tea with.

86
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,384
Yeah, so that was a bit of a dispiriting year.

87
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:55,784
For a steward in LA.

88
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:56,444
For the world.

89
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:59,564
I mean, I certainly worked, but like content wise,

90
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:00,724
it was a little like.

91
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,344
Is that the year you drove

92
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,924
the American Gladiator to the doctor?

93
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,404
That would have been when, yes,

94
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,004
cause the same company was making American Gladiators.

95
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:10,944
And this I was working for a company called Revly,

96
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,804
which was bought by an international company called Shine,

97
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,624
which was bought by another company.

98
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,444
It's crazy.

99
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,264
It's part of Endemol.

100
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:20,324
Yeah, it is part of it.

101
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,244
I work in the building now with Endemol Shine.

102
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,004
These bizarre, Navy stiff.

103
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:25,524
What are these words?

104
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:26,244
Yeah.

105
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:26,844
Huh.

106
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:28,804
What'd you do on the hair cutting show?

107
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:34,204
So I was a casting PA and then like after it wrapped,

108
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:39,884
they started doing a second season or another season,

109
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:42,564
and they were like, oh, can you come down for a day

110
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:43,624
and work this?

111
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:47,044
Cause they were casting at that convention.

112
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:49,304
So I was just there kind of, you know,

113
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,164
doing runs around the building.

114
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,024
At the Long Beach Convention Center.

115
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:53,764
At the Long Beach Convention Center.

116
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:57,644
There was a large hair care and like beauty expo

117
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:58,184
sort of thing.

118
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:02,024
So that was my main exposure to Long Beach.

119
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:04,224
Besides one other time when I had to drive

120
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:06,764
to a different hair salon to get someone to sign

121
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,304
a 30 page release for.

122
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:11,964
So it's entirely been work and hair related.

123
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:12,924
Work and hair related.

124
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:15,904
You haven't had just a relax and chill

125
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,224
just for Jason time in Long Beach.

126
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:22,184
No, and I had no real plans for Thanksgiving.

127
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,404
I mean, like Thanksgiving, fine.

128
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:27,264
My family never really went.

129
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:30,364
We, I feel like we did stuff when my grandparents

130
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,824
were alive, but now usually my part of my family

131
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:35,664
just does it at home, just a few of them.

132
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:39,164
And so out here, I've never really flown back

133
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:39,924
for Thanksgiving.

134
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:43,204
So I've always just either with friends

135
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:45,704
or with people I was seeing or.

136
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:46,664
Which speaking of.

137
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:47,164
The Carlson family.

138
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:52,144
You guys had a Thanksgiving together in the recent past.

139
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:52,784
Two years ago.

140
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:53,584
Two years ago.

141
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,564
In which, what occurred?

142
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,844
Well, we went to the Disneyland Hotel

143
00:05:57,844 --> 00:06:00,184
and had Thanksgiving, like a Thanksgiving,

144
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:03,244
all you can eat buffet in like the main ballroom

145
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:04,364
of the Disneyland Hotel.

146
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:05,604
It was incredible.

147
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:07,884
There was, we kept getting, we got our pictures

148
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:08,904
with the country bears.

149
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:09,624
Oh yeah.

150
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,624
And like Clarabelle and Horace Horsecaller.

151
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,404
And there was a band.

152
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:14,764
Live band.

153
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:17,924
They brought out like not rarely used characters.

154
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:18,524
At the time.

155
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,864
Or is it because they're like homey and country

156
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,184
and Thanksgiving feeling.

157
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:26,384
I at first was like, oh wow, they know we're nerds

158
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:27,084
so they're bringing them out.

159
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,544
But apparently they're on like the kid,

160
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,704
like Mickey show now.

161
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:33,424
Oh, so kids do know.

162
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:34,344
Oh really?

163
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,984
Yeah, cause I at first thought they were catering to us

164
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:37,744
but they were not.

165
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:40,364
They were just like, I think kids know them now.

166
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:41,884
They know Horace Horsecaller.

167
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:43,484
Which is true cause do we?

168
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:46,644
I have no memories associated with Horace Horsecaller.

169
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,384
No, I know, I like knowing the name

170
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,924
and I like saying the name, but I don't have any like.

171
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:52,364
And it would not surprise me at all

172
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,644
if then we turn to Jason and he's like,

173
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:56,764
I love Horace Horsecaller for some reason.

174
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,824
You never knew Horace Horsecaller?

175
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:01,984
I mean, the main one of those I know is Claribel

176
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:04,604
because she used to have the ice cream parlor

177
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,644
in California Adventure, right?

178
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,184
Oh yeah.

179
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:08,544
Or no, she currently does.

180
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:11,024
It used to be Burbank Ice Cream.

181
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:14,644
Oh, but you miss Burbank Ice Cream probably.

182
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:19,464
Well, it was in an old train car.

183
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:22,164
It wasn't a beautiful old like chrome train car.

184
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:23,244
Yeah, you know what?

185
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:26,444
That was a good thing about original California Adventure.

186
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,424
And I think that train went somewhere.

187
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:31,164
I think it was donated to like a kids museum or something.

188
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:31,804
Oh, that's nice.

189
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:32,344
Somewhere else in California.

190
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:33,604
And so were the letters.

191
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,484
Did you know that?

192
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:38,224
The big California letters are like at some museum

193
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,384
or they're part of like a metro station or something.

194
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:41,744
I did know that.

195
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,484
I forget where, but if you wanna go visit

196
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:44,624
the old California letters.

197
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:47,204
California is a huge state with a lot of museums,

198
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:50,144
a lot of transportation specific museums too.

199
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:52,444
So like, yeah, Disney has definitely donated stuff

200
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:53,384
to those in the past.

201
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:55,204
Yeah, that's nice.

202
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,564
So you guys had a delightful Thanksgiving.

203
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:58,364
I loved it.

204
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:00,644
I tried to get everybody to go back each year,

205
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:02,164
but everyone's like, we got family,

206
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,964
you know, it can't get like 30 people.

207
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:05,584
Oh, I would have gone back.

208
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,804
No, I know not you.

209
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:10,264
Talking about like Lindsay and her mom.

210
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:12,204
Yeah, it was a bit pricey.

211
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:13,964
She has the gall to need to visit her family.

212
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:16,384
Yeah, like I know you and I would go there

213
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:17,464
for every holiday.

214
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:20,424
We would eat a buffet for every holiday if we could.

215
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:21,964
Never see our family.

216
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:22,584
Yeah.

217
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:26,404
Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner eating their stew together

218
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:27,624
every night.

219
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:32,224
You and I eating stew in the Disneyland Hotel ballroom

220
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:32,824
every night.

221
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:36,224
They call it Walt's stew and that lets them charge

222
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,324
$5 more even though Walt never had the stew.

223
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:39,804
Hated stew.

224
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:41,964
Didn't care about, hate specifically hated stew.

225
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:46,824
But you did have, this gets even smaller in scope

226
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,704
because you did have a solo Thanksgiving

227
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:52,084
in kind of a themes attraction.

228
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:56,884
Area, minus even your family, meaning Mike.

229
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,284
His father, you know his father.

230
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:01,324
West Coast dad.

231
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:05,084
Yeah, so I had also been like,

232
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:08,044
oh, I had been meaning to like take a little trip

233
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:08,704
out of town.

234
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:13,644
I had not done it in like a while, maybe like two years

235
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:15,584
or so, like a little weekend trip by myself.

236
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,424
Something that's not like visiting family.

237
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,464
Yeah, besides visiting family.

238
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:22,304
But that can feel like it's, not obligatory,

239
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:25,104
but like, you know, it's, it could be a little more

240
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:27,304
functional, a little more, like just a pure pleasure

241
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:27,784
vacation.

242
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:29,124
Yeah, stuff to do.

243
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,904
If it's Christmas, you know, we do all the holiday stuff.

244
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,684
If it's the summer, we go down to the Jersey shore.

245
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:36,664
So there's lots, lots of stuff to do down there.

246
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:40,624
But no, I do like traveling alone quite a bit

247
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:42,704
since it's following my own whims.

248
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:45,084
And I certainly did that.

249
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,964
What was the main whim, would you say?

250
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:50,184
Like, what were you, was there something you were

251
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:51,504
imagining this trip being?

252
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:56,404
No, just like, just, just a, you know what it was?

253
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:59,184
I feel like, cause I spent, we spent so much time

254
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,404
going to parks, going to theme parks.

255
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:05,024
Are you saying you're hitting a wall?

256
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:05,564
I'm not, no.

257
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,784
How dare you, you son of a bitch.

258
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:08,744
I'm not saying that.

259
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,024
He would never say that.

260
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:13,564
I'm saying I really, and my family, like that would

261
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:17,584
affect other trips we would go, we would pack the days full.

262
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:21,964
So I have not done a lot of vacations where you purposely

263
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:24,544
don't do a lot.

264
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:27,684
Like you purposely just sit at a pool or just go around.

265
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:29,284
Mike, have you ever done a vacation

266
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,344
where you didn't do a lot?

267
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:31,624
That's a good question.

268
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:36,544
Maybe like a day trip like that, but not really.

269
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:37,844
Well, no, I take that back.

270
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:39,604
When I went to Vegas with my buddies,

271
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,704
the old buddies from high school, you know,

272
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:45,484
those old guys, the old gang, we didn't do a ton.

273
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:46,784
We mostly sat by the pool.

274
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:47,424
I like that.

275
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:49,984
I like sitting by the pool for six hours.

276
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,884
I don't need to do that.

277
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,404
That fits in the Margaritaville lifestyle.

278
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,524
Yeah, I can switch when we went.

279
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,344
There was a bachelor party a few years ago,

280
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:00,484
which I think I've talked briefly about on the show,

281
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:03,104
but maybe not fully because there's a great Jason story

282
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:03,624
in there.

283
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:07,804
But yeah, we hung out by the pool for like most of the day.

284
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,844
So I don't need to, I wasn't like seeing every Vegas show.

285
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,164
Sure, right.

286
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:12,844
Anyway.

287
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:18,004
Yeah, so I mean, the trip in general was a friend,

288
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:21,124
Steve Slaga, who is a Universal Tour guide,

289
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,764
posted a picture that he had gone down there.

290
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:26,484
And I was like, oh yeah, you can just stay

291
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,804
on this giant old ship.

292
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,704
You can just book a room.

293
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:35,404
And I was like, wow, these rooms are very like inexpensive.

294
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,024
Like the architecture has been restored,

295
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:40,044
the beautiful art deco design all over the place.

296
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,644
The rooms are very charming.

297
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:44,104
They preserved a lot of the original features and stuff,

298
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,624
even though there's an old heater in the corner.

299
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,244
Okay.

300
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,604
And like the old vents and stuff.

301
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:54,444
Most of them turned off or an updated one next to it.

302
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:57,004
And so I was like, oh, this is very inexpensive.

303
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:58,724
And then I was like, wait a minute.

304
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:03,044
Is it available on the Chase points site?

305
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:03,584
Yeah.

306
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:05,004
Hell yeah.

307
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:06,904
And sure enough it was.

308
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:10,044
And it was even cheaper using points.

309
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,364
Yes, hell yeah.

310
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:14,004
Mike's dream episode has unfolded.

311
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:16,844
I met a couple of listeners at the Staples Center

312
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:19,184
while I was seeing wrestling and he wanted to talk

313
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:20,824
to me about points and I was so happy.

314
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:21,604
Anyway, continue.

315
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,364
Yeah, so I booked two nights with the points,

316
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,504
splurged for the room with portholes

317
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:29,024
because I thought the room.

318
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:29,724
Hell yeah.

319
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:32,144
I thought the interior room.

320
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:34,324
The interior room I thought might get a little.

321
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:34,544
Points and portholes.

322
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:37,124
That's the subtitle of the episode.

323
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:39,084
That's your new podcast with Jim Hill.

324
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,244
Points and portholes.

325
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:43,184
I thought it might get a little claustrophobic

326
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:44,824
in an interior room.

327
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,784
And I didn't find the point.

328
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:47,704
I liked the portholes.

329
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:48,544
The portholes were neat.

330
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:50,004
It's just cool too.

331
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,864
Cause I've only ever been on one cruise in my life.

332
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:53,824
Have you guys done cruise?

333
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:55,064
I've never been on cruise.

334
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:55,564
Really?

335
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:56,904
I don't think I'd like to really.

336
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,444
My family, I think this summer before

337
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,484
we joined the vacation club and then we just ended up

338
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:02,844
going to Disney a lot in the summers.

339
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,904
We took a cruise from, would have left New York

340
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:09,084
for Bermuda.

341
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:12,704
Beautiful tropical island in the middle

342
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,384
of the Atlantic Ocean.

343
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,304
That's a long ways out there.

344
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:16,904
Yeah.

345
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:19,004
It was as, God, seven days.

346
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:22,444
I think seven days with the round trip and everything.

347
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:25,824
And I think it stopped at a couple ports in Bermuda.

348
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,464
And that was kind of neat.

349
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,024
I would have been like 10 or 11.

350
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,504
I was seasick for the first couple of days.

351
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:36,064
And then I got my sea legs

352
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,804
and I enjoyed it.

353
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:39,084
Besides that.

354
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:42,324
I had not taken a cruise otherwise.

355
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,664
But nor are you at this.

356
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:46,204
Cause if you don't know the Queen Mary,

357
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:48,224
it is just docked and has been.

358
00:13:48,364 --> 00:13:48,624
It's docked.

359
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:50,464
But it is not attached to the ground.

360
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:51,584
It is still floating.

361
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,044
Oh, so it kind of teeters.

362
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,204
I didn't really notice much teeter.

363
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:56,724
I think that the weather was worse.

364
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:58,384
You would have noticed some teeter.

365
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:00,424
Did you have to take seasick medication then?

366
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:01,304
I did not.

367
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,364
Thankfully.

368
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:07,364
Alternating dramamine and cocktails.

369
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,584
Pop a pill, take a sip.

370
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:13,524
Well, I did a version.

371
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:14,404
We'll get to that.

372
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:15,524
Ooh. Wow.

373
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:19,204
So the one, the big thing about it though,

374
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,904
was that the signs everywhere saying,

375
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:26,944
when the ship used to run, the engines were very loud.

376
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:30,984
So please be courteous in your cabin

377
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,784
because essentially the walls are paper thin.

378
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:35,284
Oh. Uh-oh.

379
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:39,284
So that did not come into play until the second day.

380
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:40,904
But so I checked in.

381
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:41,724
A lot of good teases here.

382
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:42,384
Yeah, yeah.

383
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,944
I checked in.

384
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,084
I took the subway down.

385
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:49,784
It cost me all 350 to get to and back.

386
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:52,064
All the way from the valley.

387
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:52,824
From the valley.

388
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:53,524
Wow.

389
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,944
Cause you can get the red line and then downtown,

390
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:57,624
you just transfer to the blue line.

391
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:59,144
How much time are we talking there?

392
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:03,664
I think it was about an hour, 20 minutes, maybe hour 30.

393
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:04,464
Not bad. Not bad.

394
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:05,804
You're not driving.

395
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:09,024
There's some tricky freeways to get down there.

396
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:12,404
Your hands are free to read a book or what have you.

397
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:12,844
That's great.

398
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:13,324
Sure.

399
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:16,424
Also, I will, gotta put them on blast for this.

400
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:19,084
Parking with Queen Mary, $22 a night.

401
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:19,964
Oh, geez.

402
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:20,744
Yeah, a lot.

403
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:21,984
So you avoid that.

404
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:23,124
Yeah, you avoid that.

405
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:27,304
Yeah, the train ride down, a lot of people was very pleasant.

406
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,564
A lot of people traveling.

407
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:30,284
I left on Thanksgiving morning.

408
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,904
So a lot of people heading out for Thanksgiving stuff.

409
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,544
And then when you get down there right in downtown,

410
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:43,124
there's a free bus that hits the tourist spots

411
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:43,804
in Long Beach.

412
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:47,324
The aquarium, the Queen Mary, the outlets,

413
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,084
and the Seaport Village.

414
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:53,104
Yeah, I'm a big Seaport Village fan.

415
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:54,704
And the Pike.

416
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,944
I mean, the Pike's pretty, I guess, silly and cruddy,

417
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:00,724
but every chain restaurant is down there.

418
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:01,704
That is, yes.

419
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,564
Long Beach is the amount of chilies

420
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,944
that there are in Long Beach.

421
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:07,904
Cause now I've gone to Long Beach like three times

422
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,524
for New Japan Pro Wrestling and we always eat at chilies.

423
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,444
Are there multiple chilies or do you eat at the one

424
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:13,184
by the outlets?

425
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:16,804
I've eaten at least two different chilies,

426
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:20,544
three different times, if not three different chilies.

427
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:21,564
I consider that.

428
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:21,904
Very lucky city.

429
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:24,544
That must be why Snoop Dogg is so proud.

430
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,064
Yeah.

431
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:26,884
I assume in one of those songs,

432
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,804
he has a line about multiple chilies.

433
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:29,824
Multiple chilies, yeah.

434
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:30,624
The number one thing.

435
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,044
That's a song name, I think.

436
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,684
Yeah, yeah, on every album.

437
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:36,344
That's multiple chilies part eight.

438
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:37,584
Produced by the Neptunes.

439
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,944
I considered going to chilies,

440
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:42,564
but usually when I'm back East for the holidays,

441
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:45,824
one night end up at chilies with my family.

442
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:47,824
I was like, I will hold off on chilies for now.

443
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,644
You gotta branch out, you gotta try Bubba Gums

444
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:50,764
or something else.

445
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:51,284
Sure.

446
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:55,824
You gotta get like a burger at the Improv Club down there.

447
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,464
Yeah, there is an improv down there.

448
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:58,184
Oh yeah, it's weird.

449
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:58,764
It's weird.

450
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:02,764
All of the mall improvs outside of LA,

451
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:04,904
that there's one in Irvine,

452
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:08,084
or I was just by the Flappers in Claremont.

453
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:08,744
Wow.

454
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,864
Just kind of jammed into a weird little mall zone.

455
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:14,604
Yeah, mall stand up clubs, very odd.

456
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:17,424
But I'd love to play any of them.

457
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:18,804
I'd love to do a Fuck Get's Thrive Live.

458
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,044
Oh yeah, let's do one in Long Beach.

459
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:20,944
I'd the most be excited.

460
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:22,324
Yeah, sure, all right, great.

461
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:23,564
We'll stay on the boat.

462
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:27,964
Free drink minimums and $60 admission,

463
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:30,044
I assume if you do it down there.

464
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,704
The comedy is so scarce in Long Beach,

465
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:33,804
it's a resource that you have to pay for.

466
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:38,184
So yeah, so I got down there,

467
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:40,224
got the free bus to the Queen Mary,

468
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:43,104
went to get on the, and it's packed.

469
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,944
Like getting on the ship is packed because.

470
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:47,404
So like you're going, like you're at Ellis Island

471
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:49,664
or something, like getting on a giant ship.

472
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:51,624
Pretty much, well because here's,

473
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:53,584
what I didn't think about is,

474
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:56,684
so the Queen Mary is a fully functioning hotel

475
00:17:56,684 --> 00:18:00,604
and there are also tours and there's also events.

476
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,104
You can have, you can get married on the Queen Mary

477
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,444
and like friends of friends have gotten married

478
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:07,704
on the ship and then the guests stay on the ship and stuff.

479
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:08,824
Probably not while you were there,

480
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,244
but there's concerts and stuff.

481
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:14,124
I know you can go see those mega tours of like Sugar Ray

482
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,464
and Smash Mouth.

483
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:16,224
Oh yeah.

484
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,464
And Dishwala.

485
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,364
And just the singer of Fastball and Lit, yeah.

486
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,364
But you know, there's a lot going on.

487
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:26,304
That's a hub of activity.

488
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,844
Well the other thing is, and this was,

489
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:32,464
the first day I was like, what the hell is that building?

490
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,704
Next to the Queen Mary there is a giant dome.

491
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:39,884
And I just, I didn't even have to finish Googling it

492
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,184
and it auto completed Long Beach Dome.

493
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:43,584
What is the Long Beach Dome?

494
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:45,444
It's the hanger for the Spruce Goose.

495
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:48,024
It was built to house the Spruce Goose.

496
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:51,384
And it is now, the Spruce Goose is now in Oregon

497
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:52,944
or Washington, a museum up there.

498
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:55,344
It is now the cruise terminal

499
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,804
for the actual cruises that leave Long Beach.

500
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:00,524
So like two or three cruise ships left

501
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:03,104
from next to this docked ancient cruise ship.

502
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:04,324
Oh, so all that too.

503
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:05,024
Oh my God.

504
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:08,544
Yeah, so people use the Queen Mary if they're like,

505
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:11,184
I am on a cruise that leaves early tomorrow.

506
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:14,804
I will book a $95 hotel room next to it.

507
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,544
And then I just roll out of bed.

508
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:18,284
Just roll the bag right over.

509
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:20,444
Yeah, you know, before we move on from the dome,

510
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:23,324
I also wanna say that that was where they built the set

511
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,704
of the Riddler's Lair in Batman Forever.

512
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:27,024
Holy shit, really?

513
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:27,464
I didn't know that.

514
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:29,024
There's a lot of history in this.

515
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:31,104
Jeez, I gotta get down there.

516
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:32,604
I mean, Long Beach is-

517
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,024
You can see the outside of a dome

518
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:36,104
where my set was 23 years ago.

519
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:37,184
It's dirty.

520
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,304
Dirty, Jason shared the dirty dome.

521
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:40,844
Dirty dome.

522
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:44,744
There was also like a half finished Christmas village

523
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,464
next in between the dome and the Queen Mary,

524
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:49,944
but I couldn't figure out how to get over there.

525
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:51,364
It's called something really just,

526
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:56,324
it's called like freeze or frost or ice or something.

527
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:58,004
It's just like nothing weird.

528
00:19:58,244 --> 00:19:59,464
And I think that's where,

529
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,664
and then the Queen Mary does a lot of haunt stuff

530
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,684
around Halloween too.

531
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:05,784
We'll get down there next year.

532
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:09,504
Yeah, I mean, the ship is famously haunted.

533
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:10,484
Right.

534
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:11,304
Oh, that's right.

535
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,284
Does that come into play on this?

536
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:18,024
Well, it comes into play with one of the weird,

537
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:19,424
well, we'll get there.

538
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:24,784
So I checked in, got all my keys,

539
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:28,604
got my tickets for a complimentary glass of champagne.

540
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:31,684
Every day I was there at the captain's toast.

541
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,344
Bad news, never got to always miss the captain.

542
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:36,044
What?

543
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:39,724
Yeah, it was an hour.

544
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:44,024
I missed him by like an hour the first day

545
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,884
and the second day replaced by Mrs. Claus.

546
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:48,824
Mrs. Claus is reading to kids,

547
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,744
Black Friday is the first day

548
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:52,664
of the Queen Mary's Christmas event.

549
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,224
So I went to bed and when I woke up,

550
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,624
the entire place was covered in Christmas trees

551
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,044
and lights and stuff.

552
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:00,124
Oh, wow.

553
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:02,624
Did you watch Mrs. Claus give a toast?

554
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:05,144
I mean, no, she was reading

555
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:07,004
how the grits stole Christmas to children.

556
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:10,124
Wait, wait, so explain the captain's toast

557
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:13,024
because this was a big thing that I was excited for you to do.

558
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:15,704
How does it work if you're missing him by an hour?

559
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,664
Is he just toasting for six hours?

560
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:21,284
So they give you these drink tickets when you check in

561
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,384
and they're like, it's good from two to six

562
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:28,104
and the captain is there from either three to four

563
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:30,884
or five to six, but it kept changing.

564
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,704
Like it said one thing on the website

565
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,304
and then it said one thing on the post

566
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:35,884
at like daily events things

567
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,624
and I was going off the website and that was wrong that day.

568
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:41,124
Why would this be so complicated?

569
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:41,764
I don't know.

570
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,424
Well, figure it out Queen Mary.

571
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:44,864
It kind of becomes a theme.

572
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:50,544
So I got I got to I was there a couple of hours before check in.

573
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:51,884
But the room was already ready.

574
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:53,244
I went down to the cabin.

575
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:54,344
You sort of move back real quick.

576
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,044
Yeah, just because we're talking about captain's toast.

577
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:59,024
The boat doesn't need a captain when it's docked.

578
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,664
But I saw him walking in the hole.

579
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:01,884
I saw him getting in the elevator.

580
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:03,624
He is in full white.

581
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:04,464
He's in full.

582
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:06,884
But is he a real boat captain

583
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:10,084
or is he just a performer who plays the captain?

584
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:14,004
I I am not I'm not sure about that,

585
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,424
because everyone else on the ship was dressed like, you know, either

586
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:22,864
in suits, everyone else was dressed like those

587
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:25,704
the people giving chores were dressed like museum docents.

588
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,984
The people checking in were dressed in like business attire,

589
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:30,204
like any nice hotel.

590
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:33,824
So it's there's it's possible he is a real boat captain.

591
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:38,824
It's also possible he's just an teenager that was recruited

592
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,744
like a Disney character.

593
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:43,164
Well, like a middle aged middle aged.

594
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:43,624
Yeah, fair enough.

595
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:47,844
Because the Queen Mary has been docked at Long Beach since 1967.

596
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:52,264
So would not have been an actual captain on the boat.

597
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,904
Is it possible they're worried that at a certain point,

598
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:58,224
they may need to get away from the dock and take the ship out to sea,

599
00:22:58,264 --> 00:23:00,864
maybe if their war breaks out and the captain has to be there

600
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,764
in case he has to navigate in command.

601
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:06,384
I mean, it's entirely possible the Queen Mary was used for a number of years

602
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,104
as troop transport during World War II.

603
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:11,424
Would there be a possibility that if a war broke out between,

604
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:13,504
like, let's say North Korea, that you would have been on the boat

605
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:15,824
and then had to like automatically enlist?

606
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:19,584
I mean, I'd be happy to do my part,

607
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,364
but they did not walk us through the rules of maritime law

608
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:26,224
or where the life jackets were on the cruise ship.

609
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:30,144
I remember the first day before we even like the first thing we got on the boat.

610
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:33,284
They're like, all right, here's where your life jackets are in your room.

611
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:35,664
And now everyone report to your life.

612
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:39,164
But like just so you knew how to get to your life.

613
00:23:39,504 --> 00:23:41,324
Yeah, that's why. Interesting.

614
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:45,004
I would like to say it did occur to me as soon as it came up

615
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:49,804
that a perfect job for Jason would be the captain of a dock ship.

616
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:54,644
I mean, I would I would love that.

617
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,504
Yeah, I would 100% do that.

618
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:57,904
You would not shake hands.

619
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:01,384
You would not only have an hour window for the captain's toast,

620
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:05,104
you know, for four hours, continually toasting and getting hammered.

621
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:07,124
I would just live on the ship.

622
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:11,424
Of course, I would want either like a corner room, though,

623
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:14,584
or empty rooms on either side of me, because again, the walls are paper thin.

624
00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:17,844
Right, right. OK, so so got to my cabin.

625
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:19,084
Yeah, very nice.

626
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:20,604
Turn on the bathroom light.

627
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:26,364
And it is flickering, like buzzing and flickering, like a creepy light in a movie.

628
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:30,364
So I was like, OK, that's not in other hotels.

629
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:33,844
I probably would have let this slide because how often are you using the.

630
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:36,244
But I was like, this ship is very haunted.

631
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:39,924
I feel like this is this could catch me off guard.

632
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:44,604
So I was like, I am going to call and ask them to replace this light bulb.

633
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:50,024
I picked up the phone and only the zero for operator worked.

634
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:52,764
None of the other buttons that say like front desk room

635
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:55,064
serve, all those other buttons just gave a dial to.

636
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:56,744
I'm like, that's not great.

637
00:24:57,884 --> 00:25:00,524
So that was too down.

638
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:02,564
That was two, two items

639
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:06,584
of the five things in the room that have to work.

640
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:10,704
And then I I this is probably

641
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:14,104
look, this is just a thing I got into a few years ago.

642
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:17,964
I pulled the sheet back just to make sure there was no bed bugs.

643
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:19,144
Oh, yeah.

644
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:23,044
This is just a habit I do now at hotels, even nice hotels have.

645
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:23,944
It happens.

646
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:30,104
And there was like the sheets were like kind of like rust stained.

647
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:33,964
And I was like, OK, so I have to call the operator again and go like,

648
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:40,324
and can you also set someone up to change these sheets to something not stained?

649
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:43,604
Does the operator sound like Lurch from that family?

650
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:45,004
Yes.

651
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:50,224
I don't remember, but I did have to call back later

652
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:52,644
because what happened was I left the room for a while, came back

653
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:54,364
and they had just made the bed.

654
00:25:54,724 --> 00:25:56,424
They had not changed the sheets.

655
00:25:56,844 --> 00:25:58,884
So eventually, though, that was fixed.

656
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,564
So let's see.

657
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,304
Checked in, got in the room.

658
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:07,484
I went and I had a bite to eat at the one restaurant on the ship

659
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:13,344
and opted for a an early Thanksgiving meal of chicken and waffles.

660
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,324
Eggs Benedict. Whoa.

661
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:17,104
It was delicious.

662
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:21,724
It was so eggs Benedict, traditionally Canadian bacon and

663
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:23,464
English muffins.

664
00:26:23,464 --> 00:26:28,984
This had just waffle pieces and then fried chicken instead of Canadian bacon.

665
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:33,164
Collard greens, poached egg, hollandaise sauce.

666
00:26:33,564 --> 00:26:34,584
Delicious, delightful.

667
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:37,904
And it's it's not all inclusive like a cruise.

668
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:41,944
No, it is not. My mom asked that, too, because she she likes to go on cruises.

669
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,724
Right. So you had to pay all the cars.

670
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:48,364
I have to say, pretty affordable to eat on the ship.

671
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:49,504
And the food was good.

672
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,744
All the meals I had on the ship were good.

673
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,364
How many different restaurants on the ship?

674
00:26:53,604 --> 00:26:55,384
There's three. I ate at two of them.

675
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:59,444
OK, so I had the crab cakes Benedict.

676
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:04,624
And then I walked around the ship a little.

677
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:06,384
Do the restaurants have fun names?

678
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:08,904
No, it's like the promenade cafe.

679
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:10,124
There's a chowder house.

680
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:12,264
That's fun. Chowder house is fun.

681
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:15,644
And then there's then there's is it Sir Winston's?

682
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:16,524
That's the steakhouse.

683
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:21,044
So the Queen Mary know notable built in England.

684
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:24,824
Winston Churchill considered it his like office at sea

685
00:27:24,824 --> 00:27:28,924
and is in fact the ship when he had to travel, he preferred to travel on

686
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:33,104
is the ship that he signed the D-Day Declaration on.

687
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:33,984
Wow, really?

688
00:27:34,324 --> 00:27:37,224
And it's the ship that I ate weed chocolate on.

689
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:41,744
So it's the greatest moments in humanity.

690
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:46,124
So then I was very full and had my edible

691
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,744
and watch the last two Harry Potter movies because they're a Thanksgiving

692
00:27:49,744 --> 00:27:50,884
marathon every year.

693
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:52,864
And that was in your room.

694
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:53,664
Just in my room.

695
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:56,884
I mean, that was, again, the whole point of the trip was like,

696
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,204
oh, I want to go do something and relax.

697
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:03,664
Thanksgiving fun weekend for holiday specials, marathon.

698
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:06,084
So just kind of doing that.

699
00:28:06,324 --> 00:28:10,284
Reading a little of the solo trip, by the way, I don't do it a lot.

700
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,544
I get a little worried.

701
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:15,244
It's possible that I like get weird and think and spin out.

702
00:28:15,324 --> 00:28:18,124
So I'm a little afraid of sometimes doing the solo trip.

703
00:28:18,124 --> 00:28:19,744
But if you really need to like

704
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:24,064
get your head together and chill out and just sometimes it can be very calming.

705
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:27,664
I did that a little and more just from like,

706
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,704
like, oh, well, was I going to go check out this tomorrow?

707
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:35,424
But then and like that the one one of the complaints about the Queen Mary stuff

708
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,884
is not open terribly late.

709
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:39,164
The second day I was there was a was a Friday.

710
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:41,464
And so stuff was open a little later.

711
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,044
Oh, yeah. What do you do?

712
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:46,484
Like if there's nothing, it's not like one place to go one in the morning.

713
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:47,724
There was room. Yes.

714
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:51,504
Well, that free bus runs until pretty late.

715
00:28:51,544 --> 00:28:53,664
So you can get over to the seaport or whatever.

716
00:28:53,944 --> 00:28:56,004
But did people know this story?

717
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:59,944
I feel like our Facebook group might have talked about it, that there was like

718
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:01,224
this. This is a different thing.

719
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:03,984
This is like the transport from the Queen Mary Halloween

720
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:07,764
Haunt event back to the mainland and the parking lot

721
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:12,184
that a bus driver like flipped out and just kept driving and driving.

722
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:15,504
And they ended up in Carson and the police had to go get him.

723
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,704
That was from the Queen Mary. Yeah.

724
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:19,864
Yeah. They were trying to get out the windows.

725
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:21,124
It was like, oh, yeah.

726
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:23,884
And he was he just wasn't responding and people are screaming like,

727
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:25,264
you're kidnapping us.

728
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,604
And it sounded horrible.

729
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:31,004
So I'm just that makes me not want to get on that shuttle at two in the morning.

730
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:36,144
I mean, yeah, I I well, they must have used like overflow parking

731
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:38,604
because there is a huge parking lot next to the ship.

732
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:41,084
But I bet. And then the yeah, for Halloween.

733
00:29:41,084 --> 00:29:45,004
And then the the city bus, the passport bus system,

734
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:48,804
which is the free bus I was talking about that.

735
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:52,724
I mean, that's run by the city and it's people driving it,

736
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:54,544
doing the same routes all day long.

737
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:58,444
So, yeah, the Queen Mary probably outsourced whatever Halloween.

738
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:04,844
I'm not worried about a city employee doing a circle over and over again

739
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,764
all day, suddenly snapping.

740
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:09,464
Yeah, that'll be fine.

741
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:10,304
No, it'll be fine.

742
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:14,504
So, yeah, so I that was what I did.

743
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:17,204
I did go up to the Chowder house that first night

744
00:30:17,204 --> 00:30:20,664
to have a quick bowl of Manhattan clam chowder.

745
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:21,884
How's that?

746
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:24,284
Well, I got to say, too.

747
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:27,364
Not enough clams, not enough potatoes, too much zucchini.

748
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:30,904
A thing I do not associate being in Manhattan clam chowder.

749
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:32,124
Not all too creative.

750
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:34,004
What's this California bullshit?

751
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:36,484
Basic stuff, please.

752
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:41,224
But was was the seafood was redeemed on the last day.

753
00:30:41,764 --> 00:30:43,844
I'll get to that when I wrap up.

754
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:46,404
Because you were so high, it came to life and talk to you.

755
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:47,584
That is true.

756
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,944
I Jason, I'm the sea bass.

757
00:30:50,344 --> 00:30:50,764
You know what?

758
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:54,524
I never got too high because I just kept eating.

759
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:59,364
So like it didn't kick in like if I had an empty stomach.

760
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:01,304
And it was also a new location.

761
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:06,224
So I was probably a little more like not as relaxed as if I was at home.

762
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:08,444
But I was relaxed. I had a nice time.

763
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:14,124
So went to bed, woke up the next day.

764
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:18,844
I think I just had a oh, I coffee and a slice of lemon pound cake for breakfast

765
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:23,844
before I took the bus over to the Seaport Village, walked around the Seaport Village,

766
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:29,044
walked around the Pike, which is a massive outlet mall that appears to have eight stores.

767
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:33,944
Like it does not have a lot of stores, but it is very large

768
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:38,764
and was not really that crowded on Black Friday.

769
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:42,104
So it was it was a little strange.

770
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:45,784
I find that mall to be mostly pretty deserted.

771
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:50,284
Yeah. My experience with it is that a long time ago, I made a video where I needed a segue

772
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:54,864
and the closest possible place to rent a segue from segue of Long Beach,

773
00:31:55,044 --> 00:31:57,504
one of the eight stores in the Pike Mall.

774
00:31:57,504 --> 00:32:00,764
And it was like a lot cheaper if I returned it myself.

775
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:02,944
Like they brought it to me in the valley.

776
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,204
But I had to take it back.

777
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:08,984
So I took a weird little drive, maybe with Aaron, I forget,

778
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:11,364
but like a little drive to return the segue.

779
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:14,344
And I think I got out of the car and like did a big segue loop

780
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:17,684
just by myself in this mall and then returned it.

781
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,044
It was a very pleasant day.

782
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:21,464
I got to say, honey, can you put the blinkers on?

783
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,064
I'm just going to do a segue loop.

784
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:26,124
Just want to kiss the old baby goodbye.

785
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:30,384
You know, I also though there was a bad story with that, where I, you know,

786
00:32:30,404 --> 00:32:33,764
the novelty of having a segue in the house and I was kind of filming it.

787
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:40,084
I was a video I filmed in my dad's office, a good location that's free.

788
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,924
And so my dad is around and like, you want to take the thing for a spin?

789
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:43,644
Yeah, sure.

790
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:48,364
And I watched him go up the block and then go into a spin and a faster spin.

791
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:50,864
And a faster and faster and faster helix.

792
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:53,084
And luckily, he jumped off and he made it.

793
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:56,924
But in that moment, I was imagining like, hey, make a fun video with a segue.

794
00:32:57,284 --> 00:33:00,164
Oh, God, my dad split his head open.

795
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:02,764
I watched the demise of my dad.

796
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:06,224
Like if he like hit his head really hard and like never recovered.

797
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:11,124
And like because I filmed some dumb video, my dad was a vegetable for the rest.

798
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:13,524
Oh, I flashed to some terrible stuff.

799
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,144
It's all fine. My dad is fine.

800
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:17,824
So I was concerned about getting haunted by ghosts on a ship.

801
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,824
And you were concerned about getting haunted by probably poorly

802
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:26,204
regulated segue results, because for sure you signed away

803
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:28,064
any waiver for you.

804
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:31,864
And your father was definitely not authorized with that company.

805
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:33,624
No, no, not at all.

806
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:34,484
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,384
No, it's hey, look, we're in a different county.

808
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:37,984
Rules don't apply.

809
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:40,864
You shouldn't take this thing out of the LBC to begin with.

810
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:42,364
I mean, that's that's probably right.

811
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:46,704
I used to I associated segues with interventions on both coasts.

812
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:50,844
And they're always being like, you could try it out for like a minute or two.

813
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,584
But the line was always so long.

814
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:54,264
Sure, sure, sure. And not that way.

815
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,424
It's a little fun.

816
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:59,544
I had fun, but you cannot imagine incorporating it into your day to day.

817
00:33:59,644 --> 00:34:02,764
And then, of course, famously, the inventor of Segway died

818
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:05,864
while using Segway, he like fell off a cliff.

819
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,404
So Segway's are bad news.

820
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,964
I don't know if the Segway Long Beach is still open, but that was one of the eight.

821
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,564
We'll do an episode about it.

822
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:14,284
About Segway.

823
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:19,364
Each regional Segway office throughout the country.

824
00:34:19,364 --> 00:34:20,044
Oh, I wonder.

825
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:25,484
This island, Disney was doing Segway tours of DCA for a little while.

826
00:34:25,484 --> 00:34:27,244
Oh, I can't be doing that anymore. Right.

827
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:31,024
I was like before the park open like six a.m. or something.

828
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:33,184
Really? Yeah.

829
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,384
Man, I had a look at Segway's count as a ride.

830
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:36,584
I guess they do.

831
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:38,604
They're going to do things, a ride. Yeah.

832
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:40,384
We got to loosen our definition.

833
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:42,424
We got these patreons to fill now.

834
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:43,324
Everything. Yeah.

835
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,824
Your shoes are wheels in your shoes. That's a ride.

836
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:48,124
I do not.

837
00:34:48,364 --> 00:34:50,344
Well, yeah, we got to get wheel shoes.

838
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:50,784
Cruising.

839
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,464
California Ventures Segway tour closed.

840
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,884
Closed. Yeah.

841
00:34:55,264 --> 00:34:58,344
All right. Oh, well, that'll be when we're really scraping the

842
00:34:58,344 --> 00:35:00,184
the sea ticket bottom of the barrel.

843
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:01,764
That's what we'll get to. Yeah.

844
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:05,464
The Segway tours that were open for three months that we didn't attend.

845
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:08,884
Right. Based on the two Yelp reviews that exist.

846
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:10,124
Well, two reviews.

847
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:11,964
We can stretch that into an hour. It's fine.

848
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:13,164
Half an hour per.

849
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,764
Anyway, the Pike, the Pike.

850
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:19,764
Yeah. And then you go visit our friend Truffles

851
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,944
at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.

852
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:26,204
As a matter of fact, Scott, I did visit Truffles.

853
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:30,044
So Truffles is the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory bear.

854
00:35:30,884 --> 00:35:32,284
Yeah. That Scott and Aaron love.

855
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:34,824
My wife and I, we've had this thing for many years.

856
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:37,524
If you're in a store or if you're in a mall that has a Rocky Mountain Chocolate

857
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:40,064
Factory, there's this big rotund bear.

858
00:35:40,364 --> 00:35:42,124
This will be an episode two. We'll do the Truffles.

859
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:44,224
That was it. But there's this big rotund bear.

860
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:48,364
He is so big and so fat and he looks so sad to be alive.

861
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:52,924
And he's always in a costume like a smock or something for the holidays or like a,

862
00:35:52,924 --> 00:35:54,824
you know, like like a Dracula outfit.

863
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:57,884
And he looks so humiliated to be in whatever he's wearing.

864
00:35:58,064 --> 00:35:59,644
And I love him and Aaron loves him.

865
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:04,404
And we've been we've like gone out of our way to go to Truffles.

866
00:36:04,564 --> 00:36:09,644
We've like gone way off the road into Victorville while coming back from Vegas.

867
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:14,384
We like we went to Phoenix and we did three different Truffles stops.

868
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:19,804
I found all the Truffles in the and sometimes we'll call ahead to Rocky Mountain

869
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:23,164
Chocolate Factory's does ask, Hey, do you have that bear?

870
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:26,844
Is the bear in your store? And if they say no, we're very sad.

871
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:29,284
Anyway, I can't believe I haven't talked about Truffles.

872
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:31,104
Is Truffles in the Galleria?

873
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:33,844
Is that even still there?

874
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:36,224
Is the Glendale Galleria Macarachy Mountain still there?

875
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:38,344
I don't know, because I see what I see.

876
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,484
Because I've seen him there and I also.

877
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:43,504
Oh, OK. I was going to say, because there's another chocolate company

878
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,244
with like the same aesthetic.

879
00:36:46,224 --> 00:36:50,664
But Truffles, I don't I feel like I wasn't that long ago that I saw Truffles there.

880
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:52,004
I didn't know his name either.

881
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:53,404
I have an affection for him.

882
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:57,024
I have not driven to him, which I'm not putting down.

883
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:58,404
I would drive to him.

884
00:36:58,404 --> 00:36:59,984
It's gotten out of control.

885
00:37:00,124 --> 00:37:01,684
I don't forget how we found out the name.

886
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,704
It's on some official Facebook or something.

887
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:04,984
But yeah, we love Truffles.

888
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:06,144
Truffles was there.

889
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:10,384
I don't know that any employees were there because I walked through that store

890
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:12,924
and no one said anything to me.

891
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:18,264
We, Aaron and I have so much experience walking into Rocky Mountain Chocolate

892
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:22,864
Factory is ignoring the employees because we have no intention of buying chocolate.

893
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:27,044
We are there to take a quick photo of Aaron comforting a sad bear.

894
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:28,624
And then we're getting out of there.

895
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,544
Well, knowing you guys to take this, always take those.

896
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:33,144
I made sure to take one, too.

897
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:34,984
And I put my sunglasses on.

898
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,704
So he looks like a cool.

899
00:37:36,784 --> 00:37:38,504
Oh, he looks so great.

900
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:40,144
Oh, wow. Yeah. Oh, wait.

901
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:41,104
We'll post this.

902
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:44,784
Oh, man. Jason and Truffles sunglasses selfie.

903
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:46,444
I'm so happy. I did not.

904
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:53,184
I tried to put the the arms of the sunglasses like on his face, but he was he's too fat.

905
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:54,664
Too big. So fat.

906
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:56,644
So I closed him and just rest him on his nose.

907
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:58,004
I was like, yeah, this is Truffles.

908
00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:59,904
He has so many problems.

909
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:01,864
I bet he's in poor health.

910
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:02,844
He has diabetes.

911
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:04,324
A lot of problems with Trump.

912
00:38:04,444 --> 00:38:07,404
But that's why you got to go say what's up, please.

913
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:08,684
Listeners. Oh, my God.

914
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:12,404
If I can get the fans in on this, if you're near Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory,

915
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,544
please tweet it at us.

916
00:38:13,764 --> 00:38:16,664
This is in the category of things I want to know about.

917
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:19,584
Send us yourself with Truffles, please. Yes.

918
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:23,584
Until you get Aaron to at friendship, but at friendship underscore 500.

919
00:38:23,824 --> 00:38:25,224
Yeah. Truffles.

920
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:30,424
I like Seaport Village because it seems like the perfectly

921
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:36,964
like an algorithm designed like Native American store,

922
00:38:37,604 --> 00:38:39,724
jerky store, chocolate factory,

923
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:46,004
like kites or pirate stuff like it was it was all Shady Mary ground.

924
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,064
It looks like it's just going to rust over one day.

925
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:50,604
Just just pure rust.

926
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:53,044
It'll just explode into pure rust powder.

927
00:38:53,384 --> 00:39:00,404
Boring restaurant, boring like Pavilion restaurant where you get a lot of

928
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,024
it should be. I did eat at a bar.

929
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:03,304
I ate at a barbecue place.

930
00:39:03,784 --> 00:39:05,404
I love pulled pork.

931
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,824
And I was like, oh, there's barbecue place right here.

932
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:11,304
Had a lovely pulled pork sandwich and fries.

933
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:15,304
Apparently, I kept looking because the Pike website said stores,

934
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:19,524
including like Converse and H&M and The Gap and restaurants like

935
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,544
Chili's and Starbucks and Famous Dave's.

936
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:24,224
And I'm like, where the fuck is this Famous Dave's barbecue?

937
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:30,284
Oh, I think it had evolved into a Q smoke, a different barbecue place.

938
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:31,844
Which is where I ate.

939
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:36,584
But there was it wasn't until like I found the closed on Yelp page

940
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:40,784
that I figured out like, where is this mysterious famous Dave's?

941
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:42,324
That's not coming up for anything.

942
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,964
A lot of turnover in the Long Beach area.

943
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:46,344
Yeah, this is great.

944
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:51,144
This is your like solo day with the one day where you're playing it to the.

945
00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:51,844
Yeah. To the light.

946
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:55,644
There's a lighthouse on a big hill, a big green hill.

947
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:58,084
And I saw my bike all around there.

948
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,304
Those are great bike paths.

949
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:02,044
I think I'm determining I'm a big Long Beach fan.

950
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:06,364
I have a beautiful view of the Queen Mary and the other ships docked.

951
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,044
And that once I saw that big hill with a light, I as I've said in the past,

952
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:12,564
I'm like a goat. I want to be on the highest point.

953
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:16,504
So I was like, well, I got to go up there and figure it out my way up there.

954
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:18,524
Do you love lighthouses in general?

955
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:19,924
I do like lighthouses.

956
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:23,624
Did you pay for the champagne toast with the lighthouse keeper?

957
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:24,924
No, you don't.

958
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:26,444
You don't get to go in the lighthouse.

959
00:40:26,444 --> 00:40:27,864
I think it's too small.

960
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:29,144
It's pretty small.

961
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:32,344
I was surprised there was not a big maybe there was a bigger one at some point.

962
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:36,664
But yeah, I mean, beautiful, beautiful view picture.

963
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,244
The lighthouse, blue sky, great weather.

964
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:39,864
There should be.

965
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:42,564
And I was down there should be a whole walkthrough of it.

966
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:45,124
Right. You're saying there's not like a room for a whole tour.

967
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:47,864
I don't think there's room for two people in this lighthouse.

968
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:50,124
I think it's a really small spiral staircase.

969
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:54,684
I spent some time in some lighthouses in my day.

970
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:56,284
I was very what's your favorite lighthouse?

971
00:40:56,884 --> 00:40:59,224
Yeah, we haven't talked lighthouses yet.

972
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,344
Lighthouses are rides.

973
00:41:00,444 --> 00:41:02,704
Well, I remember one that was very cool.

974
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:06,444
They went to the top of that was on the island of Bermuda on that cruise I took.

975
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:07,184
Whoa.

976
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:12,524
I don't remember where it was because I know some of the places I saw in Bermuda

977
00:41:12,524 --> 00:41:16,044
and some of the beaches we went to have been washed away by storms.

978
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:19,984
Like not global warming, like normal tropical storms.

979
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,764
How can we make sure of those?

980
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:23,264
Well, that's true.

981
00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:24,824
You know, all in the wash now.

982
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:28,584
Maybe I've never been in a lighthouse like a probably I've been in a lighthouse.

983
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:29,564
Oh, man.

984
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:33,604
If you have a lighthouse you want us to come to, let us know your favorite lighthouse.

985
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:40,204
I in along the coast in Jersey and New England, there's so many preserved lighthouses.

986
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:43,444
Yeah. And that that's what reminded me.

987
00:41:43,444 --> 00:41:46,484
I mean, the big thing about that I found staying on the Queen Mary

988
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:52,104
was sort of like you went to a museum and then you are sleeping at the museum tonight.

989
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:57,084
And also you can walk around the museum at all hours of the day.

990
00:41:57,144 --> 00:42:00,664
That's odd. Did you did that freak you out?

991
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:04,264
I think the only thing

992
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:09,124
no, because they do a good job of like coordinate

993
00:42:09,124 --> 00:42:13,084
blocking off like hotel guests only areas.

994
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:19,524
So so I went back to the ship and this was

995
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,764
I forget when the first time this happened, but I went back.

996
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:25,904
I was like, well, I got to go back for the afternoon champagne toast.

997
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:27,144
See if I can meet the captain.

998
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,704
As I said, I did not.

999
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,844
But my key didn't work.

1000
00:42:32,124 --> 00:42:36,124
My keys deactivated twice on this trip and I had to go back up.

1001
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:39,324
And unfortunately, that weekend, there was a lot of cruises leaving.

1002
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:42,344
So there was always a massive lie to check in and check out.

1003
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:44,704
And so like I kept having to wait.

1004
00:42:44,744 --> 00:42:48,084
And the second time they're like, well, it could be a problem with the lock.

1005
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:49,624
We could move you to another room.

1006
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:51,824
And I'm like, no, no, it's too much trouble.

1007
00:42:51,824 --> 00:42:55,064
And then when I went back to my room Saturday afternoon,

1008
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:59,144
different people had checked in in the cabin next to me.

1009
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:02,404
And they again, walls paper thin.

1010
00:43:02,724 --> 00:43:04,844
They were playing music so loud.

1011
00:43:04,964 --> 00:43:08,664
No, I thought I had put on Beyonce's Lemonade

1012
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:11,164
and was going track by track like it was.

1013
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:14,344
And then I could hear every line of their conversation.

1014
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:17,564
So at that point, I I went back to the front desk and went, hey,

1015
00:43:17,564 --> 00:43:20,344
I'm going to take you up on that offer to move me to another room.

1016
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:23,204
And what were they talking about?

1017
00:43:23,364 --> 00:43:26,204
Just like general conversation, general conversation.

1018
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:29,764
I heard a lot of like, where's the beer? Where's the beer?

1019
00:43:30,624 --> 00:43:34,964
I said, where did you put the no, I see the vodka like they were.

1020
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:37,484
Yeah, there was tons of people checking in.

1021
00:43:37,544 --> 00:43:40,144
And you would hear people going like, yeah, my cruise leaves tomorrow.

1022
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:45,144
So and I have found in my experience, like, as I said, my mom and stepdad

1023
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:50,124
like cruising, going on cruises, not cruising in the other

1024
00:43:50,124 --> 00:43:53,144
tradition, but they were going on cruises.

1025
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:56,884
And then I was reminded, like, oh, you know, I was like going on cruises.

1026
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,244
The other demographic,

1027
00:43:59,444 --> 00:44:03,524
20 to 30 something couples who want to get fucked up

1028
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:06,624
and are starting before they get on the boat,

1029
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:11,044
because there was a lot of squirrely looking Orange County people

1030
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,564
there to get fucked up.

1031
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:16,544
Like everyone was either dressed in the nines to go to the old ship

1032
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:21,784
and have a nice meal, or they were dressed like we were on an island

1033
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:25,604
and were in the like Tommy Bahama flip flops beaches,

1034
00:44:25,604 --> 00:44:29,664
or they were in like a muscle shirt and covered in tattoos.

1035
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:33,944
Like there was a lot of guys who looked like they could kick my ass.

1036
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:38,564
So that's why I opted the path of least resistance to not

1037
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:42,544
because I was like, well, I could call because I've had I've been at hotels.

1038
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:48,404
Where it's like, oh, no, we have a connecting room, but we're not using.

1039
00:44:48,904 --> 00:44:51,984
It's just the rooms could connect if you book two together.

1040
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,864
And sometimes you can really hear people.

1041
00:44:55,104 --> 00:44:58,724
And we'd started this episode and bum rush Jason.

1042
00:44:58,744 --> 00:45:03,704
And he he was weird and squirrely and not participating and then kind of penta.

1043
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:08,864
And then five minutes in, he's like, I got beat up by a bro. OK.

1044
00:45:09,144 --> 00:45:11,084
They beat I was in the hospital.

1045
00:45:11,464 --> 00:45:13,064
I have makeup on.

1046
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:15,264
That's why you can't see my bruises.

1047
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:17,884
My teeth are missing, man.

1048
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,464
I mean, I think great content is the.

1049
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:26,704
I think it was an arraignment to Jason admitting his abuse was powerful.

1050
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:30,344
Yeah, this is a word where the Patreon content.

1051
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:33,464
Yeah, they're not in my ass kicked.

1052
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:34,464
They're not really.

1053
00:45:34,944 --> 00:45:40,664
Yeah, I think the champagne toasts like there wasn't a lot of people,

1054
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:43,864
unlike actual cruises where I think people mingle a lot more.

1055
00:45:43,884 --> 00:45:45,184
There wasn't a ton of mingling.

1056
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:46,304
It seemed like going on.

1057
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:47,744
Is there a scene there?

1058
00:45:47,824 --> 00:45:50,484
Is there a place you would go and hang out a bar scene or something?

1059
00:45:50,844 --> 00:45:52,204
You could talk to beautiful bar.

1060
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:56,044
The observation deck bar, I believe, was the first class bar on the ship.

1061
00:45:56,384 --> 00:45:59,324
Beautifully preserved Art Deco style bar.

1062
00:45:59,484 --> 00:46:02,584
I had a quick drink, but honestly, it was so packed in there.

1063
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:06,204
I didn't spend a lot of time in there.

1064
00:46:06,424 --> 00:46:11,544
Was this supposed to be like a was this potentially a like saber toast?

1065
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:15,844
Was that ever advertised where they take the cork off with the sword?

1066
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:18,224
Oh, no, I don't think so.

1067
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:19,864
Well, because one of those ever.

1068
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,184
That's the coolest thing.

1069
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:22,864
That's the coolest thing you ever did see.

1070
00:46:22,984 --> 00:46:25,084
I have seen someone do that.

1071
00:46:25,184 --> 00:46:26,204
Yes, it is very cool.

1072
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:28,524
I think you can do it with a butcher knife, but I'm not.

1073
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:29,184
Oh, really?

1074
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:31,884
You want to go get one and try it?

1075
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:36,184
And one of the 10 bottles of champagne.

1076
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:37,764
Yeah, it's there.

1077
00:46:38,624 --> 00:46:39,984
Uh, yeah.

1078
00:46:40,204 --> 00:46:43,004
So so it's there's not much of a social scene.

1079
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:43,784
There's not much.

1080
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:47,324
And I wish they had, you know, a lot of the ship has been converted.

1081
00:46:47,544 --> 00:46:48,784
A lot. A lot has been preserved.

1082
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:50,244
A lot's been converted.

1083
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:53,084
And then there was stuff that was closed when I was there

1084
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:55,684
because they do restorations kind of in chunks.

1085
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:58,724
So there were some parts of the ship you could not go on.

1086
00:46:58,744 --> 00:46:59,604
They were redoing.

1087
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:03,204
They didn't have the self-guided audio tour, but it was easy enough to.

1088
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:07,484
There was so many plaques and some informational signs like the self-guided

1089
00:47:07,484 --> 00:47:11,844
tour was easy enough and was very cool to see the bridge and the officer's quarters.

1090
00:47:12,324 --> 00:47:16,044
One thing I like some of these showers in my first room and these showers

1091
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:17,624
in the officer's quarters still had this.

1092
00:47:17,964 --> 00:47:21,964
It had four knobs on it for hot fresh water, cold fresh water,

1093
00:47:22,284 --> 00:47:24,424
cold salt water or hot salt water.

1094
00:47:24,524 --> 00:47:27,564
So if you wanted to take a hot salt water bath.

1095
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:28,864
Back in the day.

1096
00:47:28,864 --> 00:47:29,644
When you were a child.

1097
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:32,444
These, of course, do not work anymore.

1098
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:36,544
There were modern knobs put in, but I did like try them immediately.

1099
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:40,544
You would have never gone back once you had that hot salt water bath.

1100
00:47:41,004 --> 00:47:42,524
Aysen lives in the Queen Mary.

1101
00:47:43,004 --> 00:47:43,824
We have to go.

1102
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:45,544
We have to drive to Long Beach.

1103
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:46,564
Try to record.

1104
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:50,424
Pay the admission to get inside the building at all.

1105
00:47:50,864 --> 00:47:51,624
And then.

1106
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:56,704
Cut. They do toot the horn of the ship at like 10 a.m.

1107
00:47:56,924 --> 00:47:59,144
noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m.

1108
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:03,264
Oh, and so we'd have to edit out like hold for a whore.

1109
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:07,744
Did you? Is there any way they let a passenger toot the horn?

1110
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,224
I don't know how they toot the horn.

1111
00:48:10,344 --> 00:48:11,804
I did not see that option.

1112
00:48:12,024 --> 00:48:15,724
I said I listened to the guy in the bridge answer questions for a little while.

1113
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:21,104
Fun fact, they they only have records of eight confirmed deaths on the ship.

1114
00:48:21,404 --> 00:48:22,264
Did the guy say that?

1115
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:24,804
Yes, he did, because everyone

1116
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:27,024
inevitably, it always comes back to ghosts.

1117
00:48:27,244 --> 00:48:27,504
All right.

1118
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:29,604
Oh, that was the thing that happened the first night.

1119
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:32,024
The fire alarm went off at about 2 a.m.

1120
00:48:32,044 --> 00:48:38,044
Oh, so little Logie had been asleep for those off for a little while.

1121
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:40,284
Sure. Got out of the ship and.

1122
00:48:40,404 --> 00:48:41,504
And leave the ship.

1123
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:44,264
Yes. Everyone exited the ship.

1124
00:48:44,264 --> 00:48:44,984
Everyone exited.

1125
00:48:44,984 --> 00:48:45,744
Yes.

1126
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,344
I did remember this.

1127
00:48:48,744 --> 00:48:52,004
You know, I don't think it was to a it might have been closer to midnight

1128
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:56,064
because I exited right next to the ghost tour that had exited.

1129
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:57,764
There was a ghost tour.

1130
00:48:57,784 --> 00:48:58,704
There was a good there.

1131
00:48:58,944 --> 00:48:59,444
You didn't take it.

1132
00:48:59,624 --> 00:49:01,924
I did not know. I did not do any of the.

1133
00:49:01,924 --> 00:49:02,844
How much was it?

1134
00:49:02,944 --> 00:49:04,364
They were all like forty dollars.

1135
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:08,144
Oh, how can you be sure that there's not some secret window

1136
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:10,364
or two way mirror that you don't know about?

1137
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:12,504
And they're passing you off as a ghost.

1138
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:17,464
Like all the sleep and you can see him in there right now.

1139
00:49:17,644 --> 00:49:20,264
This ghost is Logie from too much clam chowder.

1140
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:21,424
It's clam chowder of weed.

1141
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:25,024
This I don't know, but I.

1142
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:26,344
Logie is ghost on the boat.

1143
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:30,764
I was walking back to my room at about four fifteen in the afternoon.

1144
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:35,084
The one day a couple who was hammered was like, is he a ghost?

1145
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:36,344
Are you a ghost man?

1146
00:49:36,524 --> 00:49:38,584
Like they were. Someone asked you if you were a ghost.

1147
00:49:38,624 --> 00:49:39,584
If I was a ghost.

1148
00:49:39,764 --> 00:49:41,844
I want right into this.

1149
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:43,824
Wow. They.

1150
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:47,684
And then one of them almost fell over and the other one caught them.

1151
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,344
Again, four o'clock in the afternoon.

1152
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:52,684
What about when it was so like a guest at being like

1153
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:55,924
but thinking that you were a ghost that they almost teetered over like a cartoon?

1154
00:49:55,924 --> 00:49:57,584
No, they were joking about it.

1155
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:59,904
They were laughing. They were just hammered.

1156
00:49:59,904 --> 00:50:02,004
And I went, no, but I made them change a light bulb

1157
00:50:02,004 --> 00:50:04,164
because the flickering was creeping me out from the ghost.

1158
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:06,264
And they thought that was hysterical.

1159
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:08,324
So you knocked people over.

1160
00:50:08,384 --> 00:50:10,364
That was so funny. Yeah.

1161
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:13,244
And then, oh, yeah.

1162
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,484
And then the Christmas stuff really kicked in at night.

1163
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:19,204
So there was carolers walking around.

1164
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:22,804
And all the lights were lit up and stuff.

1165
00:50:22,844 --> 00:50:28,324
And then there was three very kind of lost looking toy soldiers.

1166
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:32,204
And I'm like, oh, God, are they just do they just have to wander around?

1167
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:33,344
That's those poor people.

1168
00:50:33,524 --> 00:50:36,044
And then later on, I saw them again.

1169
00:50:36,044 --> 00:50:40,124
And they walked up onto this little stage that was set up on the one deck

1170
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:43,344
in between the shops and started tap dancing.

1171
00:50:43,784 --> 00:50:45,384
And they were great.

1172
00:50:45,464 --> 00:50:47,584
And I was like, oh, that's why they seemed lost earlier.

1173
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,564
They are here to tap dance.

1174
00:50:49,564 --> 00:50:52,624
And we're probably told in between your showtimes,

1175
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:55,264
just wander around and get your picture with people.

1176
00:50:55,264 --> 00:50:58,144
And I was like, oh, just let them tap.

1177
00:50:58,144 --> 00:50:59,344
Do you have a photo with them?

1178
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:03,624
No, I didn't, because then I tried to find that and I never saw them again.

1179
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,924
That's too bad. But either way, you're like you're watching

1180
00:51:06,924 --> 00:51:10,404
Captain characters go by as ghosts.

1181
00:51:10,464 --> 00:51:12,704
You visited a teddy bear that I love.

1182
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:14,504
There's toys coming alive.

1183
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,284
I have you.

1184
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,524
Vapes every which way.

1185
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:19,064
Pretend you're a ghost.

1186
00:51:19,364 --> 00:51:21,044
Yeah, I get to pretend I'm a ghost.

1187
00:51:21,504 --> 00:51:24,824
And then the morning, the next morning, I checked out

1188
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:28,584
a couple couple of things to note when I went to check out,

1189
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:31,444
I went to the front desk because another point against the Queen Mary,

1190
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:35,304
they do tack on that annoying $15 resort fee every night.

1191
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,564
So that's like 30 bucks.

1192
00:51:37,904 --> 00:51:41,924
And I very I learned this from some travel website.

1193
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:45,404
I went up to them as like, hey, I had a few things go wrong in my room.

1194
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:46,984
Could you possibly waive the resort fee?

1195
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:48,604
And they're like, yes, of course, sir.

1196
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:52,044
So just happened to me down by Disneyland because I really.

1197
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:57,744
Yeah, and I spent the night one night and the the room they put us in

1198
00:51:57,744 --> 00:51:58,564
reeked of weed.

1199
00:51:59,024 --> 00:52:02,844
So we went downstairs and they moved us to another room and they

1200
00:52:02,844 --> 00:52:05,044
and that all was waived.

1201
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:05,964
So that's nice.

1202
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:09,804
That's a good little fine one complaint, especially if it's true.

1203
00:52:10,144 --> 00:52:13,904
Yeah, because I think it's kind of shitty to browbeat.

1204
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:14,904
Like, could you come through?

1205
00:52:15,024 --> 00:52:16,384
Like, that's that's a little much.

1206
00:52:16,444 --> 00:52:17,524
I did have a hotel.

1207
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,964
There's a beautiful hotel up at Lake Arrowhead.

1208
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:21,524
And I stayed there twice.

1209
00:52:21,524 --> 00:52:23,324
And there was always something a little wrong.

1210
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:26,664
But the first time it was that the air conditioner was out that night.

1211
00:52:26,684 --> 00:52:27,924
And it was the middle of the heat wave.

1212
00:52:28,164 --> 00:52:30,944
And the engine, an engineer came and tried to fix it.

1213
00:52:30,944 --> 00:52:32,484
He's like, yeah, that's the best I can do.

1214
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:35,904
And he's like, let me see what I can do for you.

1215
00:52:35,964 --> 00:52:37,524
And he called. He's like, all right, I got your room

1216
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:38,844
taken care of for the night.

1217
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:44,184
Damn. So some guest like, excuse me.

1218
00:52:44,344 --> 00:52:46,444
Um, I don't they don't they don't budge.

1219
00:52:46,444 --> 00:52:51,004
But if like a gruff handyman said, hey, listen, assholes.

1220
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:55,064
Well, also, it's like sleeping with a sliding door open, like to try

1221
00:52:55,064 --> 00:52:57,884
and like, try and like get in the cave as a fan.

1222
00:52:58,344 --> 00:52:59,264
Like, that's what that was.

1223
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:02,124
Is not fulfilling its basic duty as a room.

1224
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:06,224
Yeah. The next year, the next time I stayed there was just kind of noisy.

1225
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,264
And I was like, oh, no, it's like there are two teenagers

1226
00:53:09,264 --> 00:53:11,684
started fighting in the lobby and went back to the room.

1227
00:53:11,904 --> 00:53:15,264
And the arguments continued from the lobby down the hallway.

1228
00:53:15,264 --> 00:53:16,784
I was like, can you do it?

1229
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:18,684
And they're like, well, we can weigh the resort fee.

1230
00:53:19,024 --> 00:53:23,764
And so the resort fee is an arbitrary tack on if something.

1231
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:25,084
Yeah. Something goes wrong in your room.

1232
00:53:25,144 --> 00:53:27,164
That's the thing to ask to get rid of.

1233
00:53:27,464 --> 00:53:31,304
And it's really it's very easy for most people to do.

1234
00:53:31,624 --> 00:53:32,684
I feel like it's made up.

1235
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:34,544
It is made up very much.

1236
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,644
Yeah, it's like whatever car stuff they try to upsell you.

1237
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:38,684
So I got that done.

1238
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:42,044
And then I went to back to the restaurant and I had crab cakes.

1239
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:43,184
Better eggs Benedict.

1240
00:53:43,484 --> 00:53:44,424
Whoa. More Benedict.

1241
00:53:44,444 --> 00:53:45,084
More Benedict.

1242
00:53:45,224 --> 00:53:47,544
The best crab cakes I've had in California.

1243
00:53:47,584 --> 00:53:49,224
Whoa. Wow. Delicious.

1244
00:53:49,564 --> 00:53:53,064
Mostly crab, very little breading or any delightful.

1245
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:55,704
What a delightful way to check out.

1246
00:53:56,144 --> 00:53:57,484
Geez. Yeah, this is here.

1247
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:00,104
I thought this was going to be a thing of like poking and prodding you.

1248
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:02,684
I'm very happy you had a great time.

1249
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:05,644
Now, the subway ride back was a little interesting.

1250
00:54:06,204 --> 00:54:10,104
The first car first train that pulled up, there was a guy.

1251
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:17,224
The car was empty, except one guy just banging on the door to the.

1252
00:54:17,884 --> 00:54:21,544
I guess where the conductor would be banging on the door.

1253
00:54:21,684 --> 00:54:25,364
And when that didn't work, he was just tapping on the door with a pen and going

1254
00:54:25,364 --> 00:54:29,384
like, hey, and I'm like, I will wait for the next train.

1255
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:31,204
That's another themed experience.

1256
00:54:31,204 --> 00:54:35,744
It's like a horror night's type situation, you know, it's like you're on a subway

1257
00:54:35,744 --> 00:54:38,664
and there's zombies trying to get in and you love scares.

1258
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:39,424
I love haunts.

1259
00:54:39,424 --> 00:54:40,884
You love if this happened to you.

1260
00:54:40,884 --> 00:54:43,604
I love. Yeah. Now I don't get scared on anywhere.

1261
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:45,084
It's like a character in real life.

1262
00:54:45,644 --> 00:54:50,664
The next train that pulled up a few stops in, someone got on with like a Bluetooth

1263
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:52,824
speaker, like blasting music.

1264
00:54:53,004 --> 00:54:55,424
And I was like, yeah, OK, yeah, this is the subway.

1265
00:54:55,524 --> 00:54:57,924
This happened a few stops later.

1266
00:54:57,924 --> 00:55:01,244
Someone else got on with a Bluetooth speaker, blasting music.

1267
00:55:01,584 --> 00:55:03,084
Neither of them back down.

1268
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:05,744
This was just a horrible mashup.

1269
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:07,484
Beyonce's Lemonade playing from both.

1270
00:55:08,164 --> 00:55:12,884
No, maddeningly not like 15 seconds apart.

1271
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:19,304
And then two stops from the end, a third person turned on

1272
00:55:19,304 --> 00:55:21,004
his speaker. Oh, God.

1273
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,824
So that was a bit funny at that point.

1274
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:26,544
No, I think just didn't consider it.

1275
00:55:26,544 --> 00:55:28,504
But, you know, it's not the subway.

1276
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:29,684
You know what? Right.

1277
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:31,044
I got to pick a fight on this.

1278
00:55:31,184 --> 00:55:32,004
I want my own business.

1279
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:34,464
Did you have an opportunity to get up and walk to another car

1280
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:35,844
real fast when they stopped?

1281
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:40,184
I know by that point, it was pretty full.

1282
00:55:40,944 --> 00:55:43,524
Not as far. I mean, Thanksgiving was pretty full because people were traveling.

1283
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:46,044
But yeah, it was very nice trip.

1284
00:55:46,424 --> 00:55:51,764
Again, I think the caveats with Queen Mary do the service was very good.

1285
00:55:52,324 --> 00:55:56,284
It is an old ship and they've done wonderful work preserving it.

1286
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:02,204
But like I do think I would not be surprised if they did a refurb

1287
00:56:02,204 --> 00:56:04,004
on those rooms at some point soon.

1288
00:56:04,184 --> 00:56:08,924
I have to say LG TV's with DirecTV, the full DirecTV package.

1289
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:13,264
So that was very fun to be a little stoned watching TV in the room.

1290
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:14,764
I love that.

1291
00:56:14,924 --> 00:56:18,644
That's a big benefit of hotel stayovers at this point,

1292
00:56:18,744 --> 00:56:22,004
is because I don't have cable at home now, as a lot of people probably don't.

1293
00:56:22,084 --> 00:56:26,144
So it's like your one chance to see what's happening on cable, which, as you said,

1294
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:28,724
most likely is Harry Potter playing all day.

1295
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:30,584
There was this one man.

1296
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:34,204
You're reminding me the first time I went to Disney World with Aaron

1297
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:37,084
almost a decade ago. Oh, my God.

1298
00:56:37,344 --> 00:56:39,564
We there was this ad, this half hour.

1299
00:56:39,644 --> 00:56:42,884
I love when you get the full half hour infomercial.

1300
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:46,184
That just just completely takes up this block on TV.

1301
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:50,144
And we were feeling so loopy in general from like we're staying at a weird,

1302
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,864
shady, just off site

1303
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:56,304
property, a Radisson or something just off of Disney World.

1304
00:56:56,544 --> 00:57:00,744
And felt like so insane from all the Disney madness in general.

1305
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,464
And then we get back to the room and there's this ad

1306
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:06,684
that's it's it's might be popular a little bit.

1307
00:57:06,684 --> 00:57:08,344
It's called Appliance Direct.

1308
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:13,864
And it's this maddening commercial where every time there's a line

1309
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:19,104
and the guy finishes Appliance Direct, it's all with that tone.

1310
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:23,364
And when the line is done, he pauses there.

1311
00:57:23,424 --> 00:57:27,104
The frame that he's in slides all the way to the right.

1312
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:31,784
The next frame slides in and the next line begins.

1313
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:36,104
There's never just a cut every it's always a slide transition

1314
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:37,524
that takes five seconds.

1315
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,344
And then beyond that, there's this insane thing where he's proving

1316
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:46,264
how well the dishwasher works by because you could put a cake in it.

1317
00:57:46,264 --> 00:57:48,284
So we put a cake in it.

1318
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:52,784
Like watching an entire full multi-layer chocolate cake

1319
00:57:52,784 --> 00:57:58,244
go into a dishwasher like we watch this thing front to back.

1320
00:57:58,244 --> 00:58:00,044
We never wanted it to end. That's great.

1321
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:01,964
Yeah. Insane Hotel TV.

1322
00:58:02,284 --> 00:58:05,464
If it if the right thing hits you at the right time, you never forget it.

1323
00:58:05,464 --> 00:58:10,004
I caught some of a very interesting documentary that was like for a chunk of it.

1324
00:58:10,004 --> 00:58:15,964
It was about Native American cinema and actors and and,

1325
00:58:15,964 --> 00:58:19,664
you know, Native Americans making their own movies

1326
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:22,004
and getting modern Native voices out there and stuff.

1327
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:25,004
And then a chunk of it was about Iron Eyes Cody,

1328
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:30,344
the guy who was the crying Native American from the PSA.

1329
00:58:30,604 --> 00:58:33,104
That motherfucker was an Italian.

1330
00:58:33,504 --> 00:58:34,824
Oh, yeah, I heard that. Yes.

1331
00:58:34,824 --> 00:58:37,564
Played Native American from the ad.

1332
00:58:37,884 --> 00:58:40,384
But then got famous for playing Native Americans.

1333
00:58:40,644 --> 00:58:44,704
And towards the end of his life, never got out of character.

1334
00:58:44,704 --> 00:58:46,544
Like just started living.

1335
00:58:46,984 --> 00:58:51,344
Yeah, like, I mean, I think maybe lost it a little.

1336
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:52,704
I think that happens towards the end.

1337
00:58:52,884 --> 00:58:55,264
Isn't it isn't Johnny isn't there's a story about Johnny Weiss

1338
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:58,364
Miller being Tarzan in a retirement home when he lost his mind.

1339
00:58:58,684 --> 00:59:01,824
Oh, my God, Michael, that you just remind me there's a Johnny Weiss

1340
00:59:01,824 --> 00:59:03,864
Mueller fact about Mueller. Sorry.

1341
00:59:04,544 --> 00:59:05,184
Right. Yeah, Mueller.

1342
00:59:05,184 --> 00:59:08,564
So there was a room where they were showing like short documentaries

1343
00:59:08,564 --> 00:59:11,244
about the Queen Mary and.

1344
00:59:12,384 --> 00:59:13,904
In the room, do you get Queen?

1345
00:59:13,904 --> 00:59:16,384
Oh, no, they should have had a channel in the room.

1346
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:19,964
But no, there was a little viewing room and there there.

1347
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:22,164
You could peek into like this used to be the pool.

1348
00:59:22,244 --> 00:59:26,444
This used to be like on on a boat movie theater.

1349
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:31,804
But one of the facts was like memories of the Queen Mary from passengers

1350
00:59:31,804 --> 00:59:33,584
who had written it.

1351
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:36,324
And there was a story of a guy going like when I was a child,

1352
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:39,504
I was on the Queen Mary and I jumped in the point and know how, you know,

1353
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:42,564
I couldn't swim very well or I was too far from the edge.

1354
00:59:42,564 --> 00:59:44,464
And I started to like drown.

1355
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:48,864
And this giant arm reached in, pulled me out.

1356
00:59:48,864 --> 00:59:53,364
And I looked up and I was looking at the face of Tarzan

1357
00:59:53,364 --> 00:59:56,724
because Johnny Weiss Mueller had pulled him out of the water.

1358
00:59:56,724 --> 00:59:59,304
What? He was a passenger.

1359
00:59:59,404 --> 01:00:01,764
It was a very popular thing.

1360
01:00:01,824 --> 01:00:05,504
People would take the Queen Mary from England to New York

1361
01:00:05,504 --> 01:00:07,784
or England to the West to see and be seen.

1362
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,424
So there's all these pictures like Audrey Hepburn on the ship.

1363
01:00:10,424 --> 01:00:14,664
There's a lot of Laurel and Hardy picture.

1364
01:00:15,004 --> 01:00:16,164
I guess they wrote it.

1365
01:00:16,164 --> 01:00:18,684
Maybe they wrote it during their failed

1366
01:00:18,684 --> 01:00:24,004
comeback tour in England that you could see Stan and whatever that weird.

1367
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:24,864
What is it called?

1368
01:00:25,424 --> 01:00:27,304
Stan and Ollie, the John C.

1369
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:28,044
Riley movie.

1370
01:00:29,304 --> 01:00:31,684
But yeah, there was a bunch of pictures of them on the ship.

1371
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:33,824
I have one more question. Yeah.

1372
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:37,644
And I don't I assume you would have mentioned something if something had gone down.

1373
01:00:37,864 --> 01:00:39,064
What is your philosophy?

1374
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:43,484
I've been to places on little vacations with people who are single

1375
01:00:43,484 --> 01:00:47,464
and they get right on a dating app and start looking

1376
01:00:47,464 --> 01:00:49,704
for matches of people in the area.

1377
01:00:49,704 --> 01:00:51,044
Is that even playing into your mind?

1378
01:00:51,044 --> 01:00:54,784
I tried on Tinder for like a few minutes and I didn't get anything.

1379
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:59,444
And there was not a lot of anyone like around our age staying on that ship

1380
01:00:59,444 --> 01:01:03,024
besides me was there with like a family or with a couple.

1381
01:01:03,044 --> 01:01:07,464
Well, why don't you just why don't you just turn up the age to 60 or 70?

1382
01:01:08,784 --> 01:01:11,404
And and and add willing to be a third.

1383
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:15,984
I don't know that you could toggle that on.

1384
01:01:16,044 --> 01:01:18,024
I don't toggle it on. I've never been on these apps.

1385
01:01:18,044 --> 01:01:19,884
I can't have been in a relationship since this has been in.

1386
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:21,064
So I've never downloaded it.

1387
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:25,024
I don't know how it works, but I assume you just toggle the age and toggle.

1388
01:01:25,404 --> 01:01:27,824
There's a third option on all these apps.

1389
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,104
Click it. Yeah.

1390
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:33,284
Change the bio to I'm on the Queen Mary ready to party. Right.

1391
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:35,904
And change your photo to you holding up the number three.

1392
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:40,004
Oh, so very clearly.

1393
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:44,284
Bowl of chowder in one hand and three in the other. Yeah.

1394
01:01:44,824 --> 01:01:48,544
So with the aphrodisiac being a little bit of Benedict,

1395
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:53,064
then we'll ease our way into a love of wonderful three.

1396
01:01:53,404 --> 01:01:55,504
Hollandaise does not keep for very long.

1397
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:58,004
It must be eaten at a quick pace.

1398
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:01,224
Oh, local local

1399
01:02:01,224 --> 01:02:03,584
the valley face, see why T.

1400
01:02:03,584 --> 01:02:04,784
I think it is soft serve.

1401
01:02:04,984 --> 01:02:07,264
There's a truck parked a few trucks parked along Ventura.

1402
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:09,984
Sometimes they had they were serving that at the coffee shop.

1403
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:12,784
That was delightful to have one night out on the deck.

1404
01:02:12,784 --> 01:02:19,224
So what I'm imagining now is that this the success of this trip

1405
01:02:19,224 --> 01:02:21,484
will loom large in your life.

1406
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:26,404
And when you pass on what you will first see in the afterlife

1407
01:02:26,404 --> 01:02:32,404
is a sweeping shot of the lobby of the Queen Mary, a la Titanic.

1408
01:02:32,404 --> 01:02:35,364
And you will be just like Rose.

1409
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:38,724
You'll be forever living in your ship of dreams.

1410
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:40,284
They'll all be there.

1411
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:46,664
The captain, the yogurt, the Hollandaise, the rowdy OC.

1412
01:02:46,984 --> 01:02:50,864
You see Johnny Weissmuller with my sunglasses on.

1413
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:52,224
He's alive now.

1414
01:02:52,224 --> 01:02:55,444
He like tips his sunglasses in a cool guy way.

1415
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:57,364
Winston Churchill's there.

1416
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:00,264
It's signing a declaration welcoming me.

1417
01:03:01,484 --> 01:03:03,964
I declare this Jay Day.

1418
01:03:03,964 --> 01:03:07,944
Handing me a vape pen saying, take a poll, my boy.

1419
01:03:10,164 --> 01:03:14,684
That's you officially dying that like perfectly when you dream,

1420
01:03:15,264 --> 01:03:20,084
take the vape pen that that's exactly when the art monitor goes.

1421
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:21,504
Be. Yeah.

1422
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:23,384
Yeah, this is your this is your afterlife.

1423
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:27,084
By the way, I have to say the one side of the ship full of ashtrays

1424
01:03:27,084 --> 01:03:28,604
and people smoking and vaping.

1425
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,664
So I was like, oh, can you even smoke on this ship?

1426
01:03:30,704 --> 01:03:33,064
And it's like, oh, yes, you definitely can.

1427
01:03:34,404 --> 01:03:38,424
So you see you just getting high with truffles, getting high with truffles.

1428
01:03:38,424 --> 01:03:42,984
You the captain, the truffles, the lighthouse keeper, a lot of rich foods,

1429
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:46,284
nary a vegetable in sight besides those collard greens.

1430
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:52,964
You have a romantic relations three ways with truffles.

1431
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:55,844
Audrey Hepburn.

1432
01:03:56,284 --> 01:03:57,184
Yeah, you.

1433
01:03:57,764 --> 01:03:59,684
And a beautiful toy soldier.

1434
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,404
That's a four. That's a orgy.

1435
01:04:02,944 --> 01:04:04,644
And then the cow forging. Yeah.

1436
01:04:04,644 --> 01:04:07,204
Forgy. Yeah, that's you call for.

1437
01:04:07,204 --> 01:04:08,224
Four ways sexism.

1438
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:13,484
And so I had a forgy that lasted forever on the ship of dreams.

1439
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:17,184
The ship of creams, ice cream,

1440
01:04:18,384 --> 01:04:19,984
see why it was called.

1441
01:04:20,484 --> 01:04:23,784
We can't launch another campaign for Jason for Captain and Jason

1442
01:04:23,784 --> 01:04:26,264
for Lighthouse Keeper, but that would be great.

1443
01:04:26,264 --> 01:04:30,184
I'm not too worried about the campaign and this naturally happen.

1444
01:04:30,224 --> 01:04:31,204
Yeah, you're right.

1445
01:04:31,464 --> 01:04:34,504
This way, if you just keep if you if you made this an annual trip,

1446
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:38,304
you'll get to know the Queen Mary regulars and you'll just get invited.

1447
01:04:38,524 --> 01:04:40,504
Sure. He's who's that guy, the captain.

1448
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:42,204
Oh, he's this local eccentric.

1449
01:04:42,204 --> 01:04:44,464
Started showing up once a year.

1450
01:04:44,864 --> 01:04:46,224
The family or no, no, no.

1451
01:04:46,324 --> 01:04:47,724
What's him? What time is he toast?

1452
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:49,284
Anytime. Go up to him.

1453
01:04:50,184 --> 01:04:53,604
He's ready to walk up with anything you need open to soda bottle.

1454
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:54,844
Yeah, sure.

1455
01:04:55,504 --> 01:04:57,544
Today, it's coffee or chocolate milk or something.

1456
01:04:57,764 --> 01:05:00,564
It's not always the official Queen.

1457
01:05:00,724 --> 01:05:02,144
Queen Mary has its own.

1458
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:04,264
They had its own label of champagne,

1459
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:06,484
which was neat.

1460
01:05:06,604 --> 01:05:07,504
Sure. Yeah.

1461
01:05:07,564 --> 01:05:09,184
I mean, there's there's lots of cool stuff.

1462
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,084
But I think it's worth worth visiting for a day trip

1463
01:05:12,084 --> 01:05:14,684
or stay overnight on day.

1464
01:05:14,684 --> 01:05:18,184
It was cool to stay on the ship or a forgy or a forgy.

1465
01:05:18,204 --> 01:05:20,604
A forgy. But hey, again, those walls are paper thin.

1466
01:05:20,704 --> 01:05:23,404
So and maybe if you want to hear that, hey, great.

1467
01:05:23,604 --> 01:05:25,784
Walls are paper thin. Heads up perverts.

1468
01:05:26,104 --> 01:05:30,284
Maybe you attract some people over and turn it into an eight G and octet.

1469
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:34,764
But if you are getting on that Carnival Cruise the next day,

1470
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:38,184
please be considerate of the people who just want to stay on an old boat.

1471
01:05:38,524 --> 01:05:40,264
Just figure out where the beer is.

1472
01:05:40,284 --> 01:05:43,324
Have a concerted beer location and don't lose it.

1473
01:05:43,344 --> 01:05:44,024
This was one.

1474
01:05:44,084 --> 01:05:45,904
And this is the last thing I'll add on the guy.

1475
01:05:46,004 --> 01:05:48,544
An old man was checking in before me.

1476
01:05:48,664 --> 01:05:49,364
Also alone.

1477
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:52,104
And I heard the front desk person go like,

1478
01:05:52,104 --> 01:05:54,204
so we have you down for eight nights.

1479
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:56,024
Oh, man.

1480
01:05:56,204 --> 01:05:59,344
So you got a bill to that.

1481
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:03,224
And you were just like, like jealous with rage in that moment.

1482
01:06:03,264 --> 01:06:07,204
Yeah, I'd like to be his agent, spend eight nights on this boat.

1483
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:09,784
On the boat. He's so wise.

1484
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:13,344
I hope he had quiet neighbors because, you know, he was calling security.

1485
01:06:13,444 --> 01:06:15,644
Sure. Oh, maybe he was partying, too.

1486
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:17,904
Maybe he was on the. He was partying. Yeah, sure.

1487
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:21,244
That's the that's the one person you would have found him.

1488
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:24,664
Yeah, him giving you a big wink. He was.

1489
01:06:24,664 --> 01:06:26,544
Also holding the number three.

1490
01:06:26,724 --> 01:06:28,124
Let me take you out of my way.

1491
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,464
Jason, here's how you do eight nights on the Queen Mary.

1492
01:06:31,624 --> 01:06:34,384
Right. That 24 hour party people, too.

1493
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:36,244
Right.

1494
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:40,204
You know, I was that one that Steve Coogan takes like his nephew under the

1495
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:45,284
that another movie, another movie with the same poster from the same time period.

1496
01:06:45,404 --> 01:06:47,464
I might be thinking there's a lot of movies where like Steve Coogan

1497
01:06:47,464 --> 01:06:49,364
takes a trip, right? Yes.

1498
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:51,084
There's multiple multiple trips.

1499
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:53,164
There's there's Stan and Ollie.

1500
01:06:53,664 --> 01:06:55,184
I know Stan and Ollie.

1501
01:06:55,484 --> 01:06:57,464
Did Stan and Ollie take a trip at the end of that?

1502
01:06:57,864 --> 01:07:01,384
Well, that the movie is about they take a trip to England to try to do

1503
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,624
a comeback tour after they kind of watched.

1504
01:07:03,784 --> 01:07:05,284
A trip. They do take a trip.

1505
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:07,644
I don't think the tour goes well. Spoiler alert.

1506
01:07:07,684 --> 01:07:10,544
It was a million years ago.

1507
01:07:10,844 --> 01:07:12,544
Sorry, everyone. Yeah.

1508
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:16,484
All right. Well, that I'm you know what?

1509
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:19,304
I might I might think about this later and not agree.

1510
01:07:19,304 --> 01:07:21,064
I think that was my favorite episode.

1511
01:07:21,064 --> 01:07:23,944
I have the most fun.

1512
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:25,704
There was no research involved.

1513
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:26,984
Yeah. Sweating it.

1514
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:29,784
I just got to you. You got to hear about a nice time. Yeah.

1515
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:31,724
Yeah. I really.

1516
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:35,204
Maybe it's my ship of dreams will just be the recording of this.

1517
01:07:35,324 --> 01:07:37,324
We've been doing all of the lifting.

1518
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:39,244
Yeah, I know. Heavy lifting.

1519
01:07:39,584 --> 01:07:40,524
Oh, man, I love it.

1520
01:07:40,544 --> 01:07:41,804
Let's just cancel the show.

1521
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,764
That's it. We start. We peaked.

1522
01:07:43,964 --> 01:07:46,964
Yep. I know a hard cut in December.

1523
01:07:46,964 --> 01:07:50,144
It's a Patreon. I agree.

1524
01:07:50,144 --> 01:07:51,924
Jason, well, you should.

1525
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:54,084
You should have thought before you got on that boat and then.

1526
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:55,604
Before I had a perfect episode.

1527
01:07:56,744 --> 01:08:00,304
Yeah. You survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

1528
01:08:00,524 --> 01:08:04,504
Jason's portholes and was it for.

1529
01:08:04,504 --> 01:08:05,784
Yeah. What was the other?

1530
01:08:05,804 --> 01:08:07,304
I love it. Oh, no.

1531
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:09,724
Points, points and portholes.

1532
01:08:09,744 --> 01:08:11,944
Yeah, Jason's points and portholes edition
