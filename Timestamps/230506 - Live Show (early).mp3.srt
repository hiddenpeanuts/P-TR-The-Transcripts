1
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Look, we gotta turn it off somehow, people.

2
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What do you think, I gotta stick on a magic button

3
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
that just shuts power off?

4
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a shutdown cycle, it's a hot lamp.

5
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Anyway, hey Dynasty Typewriter,

6
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
how's it going out there?

7
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
All right, the streaming audience at home

8
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
knows no idea what I was talking about.

9
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm gonna go ahead and say,

10
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
hey, I'm gonna go ahead and say,

11
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
hey, I'm gonna go ahead and say,

12
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
hey, I'm gonna go ahead and say,

13
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
hey, I'm gonna go ahead and say,

14
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
hey, I'm gonna go ahead and say,

15
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
hey, I'm gonna go ahead and say.

16
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So, what I was talking about.

17
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Must be some kinda inside joke, it sure is.

18
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Ha ha, we laughed.

19
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Thank you so much for coming out.

20
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Who's been here to Dynasty Typewriter before?

21
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Wow, thanks for coming back, we appreciate it.

22
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hope you're topping your pop

23
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
with some entirely new delicious treat.

24
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Who's here for the very first time ever?

25
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Wow, thanks so much for coming,

26
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
we hope you're enjoying our fine selection of sodas

27
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you've never heard of.

28
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But now you have.

29
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Alright, just a few rules, let's go ahead and extinguish

30
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
our cell phones, place our e-cigarettes on vibrate.

31
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Remember, there's no talking or heckling during the show.

32
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Sound good?

33
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, then it's time to make good.

34
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's have ourselves a good time.

35
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Give it up for a podcast, The Ride.

36
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Applause

37
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We should be hearing a drone.

38
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
There it is.

39
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Warning!

40
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The following live podcast

41
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
requires both a ticket and a reservation.

42
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If you only have a ticket and not a reservation,

43
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
get the hell out of the theater!

44
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Tonight's show will mostly consist

45
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
of the hosts on their phones,

46
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
silently checking for $4 off CBS coupons.

47
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Please be aware, the ever-present PTR curse,

48
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
any celebrities over 75 mentioned in tonight's show

49
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
should expect to die almost immediately.

50
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And now, live, just seven and a half miles away

51
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
from Tootsum Chocolate Emporium and Savory Feast Kitchen,

52
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
it's podcast The Ride!

53
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Applause

54
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The Ride!

55
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Music

56
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Whoa, folks!

57
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, my gosh!

58
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I tried to fill that space with dancing,

59
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and I felt kind of uncomfortable with it.

60
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I shan't be doing that again.

61
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
How'd you feel about what you did during the theme?

62
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I was doing, like, an interpretive dance almost,

63
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
like, hello there, welcome to the, like,

64
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I was in a parade or something.

65
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And I feel okay about it, but not,

66
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't feel great about it.

67
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Jason, rank your thing.

68
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I did some waves and some respectful bows,

69
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and I'm feeling great.

70
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Wow.

71
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You nailed it. With confidence, you nailed it.

72
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Now I can officially say welcome to podcast The Ride! live,

73
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
or as we are calling it, due to the writer's strike,

74
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
the only way we can do comedy without being scabs!

75
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah!

76
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Applause

77
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This is allowed.

78
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I wrote the joke down, but I think this is not

79
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
an under-the-guild purview, so I think I'm okay.

80
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Please don't ram me out.

81
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We respect the go-we-are union strong.

82
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I am striking right now from everything but this,

83
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and my name is Scott Gardner. Hi.

84
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Applause

85
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I am also doing this. My name is Mike Carlson.

86
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Applause

87
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And I don't have a lot going on besides this,

88
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and I'm Jason Sheridan.

89
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Applause

90
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you.

91
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Applause

92
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Well, then it's a good thing you do have this going on,

93
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and it's a good thing you folks came.

94
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We're so happy to see you. It's been a while.

95
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We have not done this anywhere for over a year.

96
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I know.

97
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Somehow this happened.

98
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It might have something to do with that Mike has been

99
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
preoccupied with the miracle of life.

100
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Applause

101
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
A little bit.

102
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'll say this.

103
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Somebody sat up on her own for the first time today.

104
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Applause

105
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
My baby did.

106
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Laughter

107
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
People just like the idea of someone sitting up,

108
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
regardless of who it was.

109
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
We're feeling great. We're happy to be doing the live stream.

110
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
This is a first time for us.

111
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Hi, live stream.

112
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
That's an awkward, we're like, do you guys cheer?

113
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You're not watching the live stream.

114
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, cheer for them for watching.

115
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Give them some support.

116
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
For this new endeavor for everyone.

117
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Look, we're all really excited to be here,

118
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and it means a lot that you guys are here.

119
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's been like, this is a little crazy.

120
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's been kind of a tough time for me,

121
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and I don't want to bring anybody down,

122
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
but I experienced a loss recently,

123
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and it's been a little rough,

124
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and it's a little tough to talk about.

125
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It might be better if I,

126
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
this just seems like maybe a good venue to vent some of what I've been going through.

127
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And it, you know, maybe easier to do with this little presentation, Mike, do you mind?

128
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
We should have music on this too.

129
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
He's dancing again.

130
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You should feel good about this dancing.

131
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This is a dance I have to do.

132
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah.

133
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Seems like yesterday I was hanging there.

134
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Downtown Disney, open air.

135
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Reasonably priced beer and we're low.

136
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Uva bar, you've got to know that.

137
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Life ain't always what it seemed to be.

138
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The best way to get drunk at Disney, even though you're gone, we're still a team.

139
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Corner rapers are in my dreams.

140
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I know you're up there looking down.

141
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yellow umbrellas all around, watching us while we pray for you.

142
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And your owner, Patina Group.

143
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I once made fun of your ugly font, but now that font is all I want.

144
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Give anything to take half a sip.

145
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And I can still almost taste your pita dip.

146
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Every fried corn cake.

147
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Your rosé tastes great.

148
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Plus you validate.

149
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll be missing uva.

150
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Thinking of the days.

151
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Thinking of the days.

152
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Drinking chardonnay.

153
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Drinking chardonnay.

154
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What a far to take.

155
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
What a lease to break.

156
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll be missing uva.

157
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Alright.

158
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Now folks, if you're like me and you're upset that Downtown Disney closed their casual outdoor restaurant, uva bar,

159
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and you are not looking forward to the new location, which is called Centrico, then say something with me.

160
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Okay.

161
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Fuck Centrico!

162
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Fuck Centrico!

163
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Fuck Centrico!

164
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Fuck Centrico!

165
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Fuck Centrico!

166
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You guys keep doing it!

167
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It feels so good.

168
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Thank you.

169
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I did what I needed. Thank you. Thank you so much.

170
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Wow.

171
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm so sorry about what happened.

172
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah, thanks.

173
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What have they taken from us?

174
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
A place that has basic wine and food that has to be awkwardly carted out from a separate kitchen and into kind of the middle zone.

175
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Of course you all know it. Everybody's an uva fan. Who isn't an uva fan, right?

176
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Sure.

177
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The answer technically might be me.

178
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Alright, now that that part is over, let me admit this.

179
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I had the idea for the song.

180
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I went down there to say goodbye and to film a little video.

181
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And then they didn't have any of the drinks that I wanted.

182
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
They didn't take my Disney gift card.

183
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What?

184
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And the...

185
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It's just dead in the center of something with Disney in the name.

186
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Wait, you're saying... Am I wrong for wanting the discount?

187
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
No, no. They are. It's just...

188
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yes. That's what I... Yeah.

189
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This isn't the uva I knew.

190
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And also, the food made me very sick.

191
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So, I wanted to do the song, but I also wanted to be honest with you.

192
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And I might... Look, I'm not happy to say this, but maybe fuck uva bar?

193
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh, wow. It could be fuck uva bar.

194
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I was wondering, is there any other comedy room in Los Angeles where that would have played?

195
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well, listen up! Comedy store! Laugh Factory!

196
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Joe Rogan's woke free comedy club in Texas?

197
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, man. All the ghosts that haunt that wretched, cursed place would love that.

198
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Do you think, Scott, if you were to host the Oscars, would you do an Oprah uva joke?

199
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Ooh!

200
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Do you think?

201
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I think so. I think the letterman had it right, except for one letter.

202
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's right.

203
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna crush it. It's proven. It's proven here. It'll work anywhere, obviously.

204
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes, of course.

205
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So, that's one thing that we do.

206
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Obviously.

207
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, that's one thing that we needed to take care of.

208
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And unless I'm mistaken, well, Mike, do you feel comfortable talking about the thing that's going on, the legal thing?

209
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, I guess. Yeah, I guess.

210
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah. I mean, it's tough. We're in a bind, but again, transparency.

211
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Basically, Mike and I have been served a legal injunction from Jason.

212
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, look. Hey, it's called show business, not show friends. Okay?

213
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's true.

214
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I have a copy of it right here, just to make sure I get everything correct.

215
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Basically, what...I mean, I think Jason saw some writing on the wall about how things have been going for the last six years.

216
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And what was...basically what was determined is that the next time that Mike or I made fun of Jason for a Pennsylvania-specific term, pronunciation, or food, that Jason would be entitled to pick the topic of the next live show.

217
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Seems fair. Seems fair. And you were just kind of waiting for this to rear its head.

218
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And then, sure enough, we were recording last week an episode you haven't heard yet.

219
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And there was this whole thing about...what is this? Sandwich? What's the deal with the...

220
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Well, it's a sandwich meat.

221
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh, it's not a sandwich. It's a sandwich. Okay. It's a sandwich meat. What is it again?

222
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's called Lebanon bologna. Yeah, we got some...yeah, there it is.

223
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So it's kind of packaged like you would buy a package of bologna, but it's kind of a smoky...like a summer sausage almost. And it comes in slices.

224
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
That feels like the description for all these weird meats you bring up. It's like a summer sausage.

225
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah. What of it?

226
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You have 50 varieties. They will all be addressed on the show by the time it comes to an end. It's like a fall sausage.

227
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Or a winter sausage.

228
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's a year-round sausage, really.

229
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So it seems like any sausage is a year-round sausage for you. For me, yeah, of course.

230
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
All of Pennsylvania, really. Anyway, we got caught on this for about 20 minutes.

231
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Completely ruined a Space Mountain episode. We didn't even get to the right. So it's mostly about...

232
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Mostly about this? We'll get to it. Yeah, we'll give it a second try, maybe. Way down the road.

233
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Anyway, long story short, what that has led us to, what the bologna has led us to, is...

234
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Jason, what is the topic of tonight's show?

235
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Folks, it's the Mark Twain. Yeah! That's right.

236
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Wow. Yeah.

237
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay. Oh yeah, yeah. Let's see it. Look at that. Yeah.

238
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
We made the life preserver, whatever you call it. Also a reaction you'd get in any comedy room, I think.

239
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Any of them. That much love for the old river boat. So let's get into it.

240
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay, so this was an opening day attraction in 1955.

241
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Well, a few days before, because they did an event where they were celebrating Walt and his wife's anniversary.

242
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
The wedding anniversary. Yeah, yeah. Admiral Joe Fowler.

243
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, so it's something that Walt loved very much.

244
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
They actually were running out of money and he paid for it himself.

245
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Uh-huh. Wait a minute. I feel like even you forgot about the...

246
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yeah. Yeah, there's a sub-clause in that legal document.

247
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
All right. Do we even see this? Okay.

248
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:28,000
To properly compensate for his emotional distress, upon commencement of the Mark Twain show, Mr. Sheridan shall be declared captain of the episode.

249
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's in there. Yeah. Oh. In accordance? Oh yeah, in accordance. I can't see anything.

250
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
In accordance... Yeah, thanks. We're in the... There we go.

251
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's a weird angle. There was like a black light hitting it.

252
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
We don't know our way around here.

253
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
In accordance, Captain Sheridan shall be granted a little hat, a little whistle, and a little steering wheel.

254
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Now come on. Where are we going to get that stuff?

255
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh.

256
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I was wondering.

257
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I didn't think that was like a stripper waiting for a while or anything.

258
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
All right. Get your little hat. Get your...

259
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Okay. Fair enough. Flip ABF's bottle.

260
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh, let me say this.

261
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Let's give him some space. Let's hear it. Let's hear it.

262
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Man. I'll say this. Like if it weren't for that legal... Man, I would hate this. I hate this.

263
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, you'd hate this shit.

264
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You'd love to see this shit go down in flames, but the law is the law.

265
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Oh.

266
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The captains are like lawyers of the sea.

267
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
All right. Well, have a seat. Let's get into the Mark Twain here, I guess. Yeah. Wow.

268
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
All right.

269
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Can you get that little wheel a little closer?

270
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, fine. I'll get the wheel.

271
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah, but you handle this.

272
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, I hate this.

273
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I hate Jason wearing a little hat.

274
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
This is your worst nightmare happening in front of all these people.

275
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I don't have a decade's worth of photos of him with different little hats on in my phone.

276
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Oh, I hate it.

277
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
All right. Yeah. Well, here, give it a spin. There we go. Captain of the show.

278
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yay.

279
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And just in case anyone's concerned about my, you know, admiral authority,

280
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
this is not my first rodeo when it comes to captaining.

281
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I have the

282
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
sealed up tight

283
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
pilot certificate for Captain Jason.

284
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Wow. Yes. Wow.

285
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
From November 10th, 2011, when I got to pilot the Mark Twain.

286
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Eleven. Twelve years ago.

287
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah. And I also saw a YouTube video where they gave one of these to a three year old.

288
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So I guess I just had a, you know, having a pair of mouse ears with my name stitched in the back, like you can get down there and just a giant shit eating grin on my face.

289
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
They're like, oh, there's no kids on this voyage.

290
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Let's go with this dipshit.

291
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So, so they asked you to be the pilot. You didn't demand it at gunpoint.

292
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
No, you don't get the gun until after you're made in charge of the vessel.

293
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No, I was walking up the stairs because second deck is my preferred way to stand.

294
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'll cross that question off my list.

295
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We can circle back around.

296
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We got to do bra and then deck at a time, deck at a time.

297
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So and then, you know, there's a big steering wheel, much like this up there.

298
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And I was kind of death gripping it.

299
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And it wasn't until we got to Pirates of the Caribbean, it dawned on me that I was doing nothing.

300
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And that it would be foolish of them to give a random guest control of a vessel with hundreds of people on it.

301
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And that this was merely decorative.

302
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I had recently turned 26 years old.

303
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So, you know, that said, as we were going by the Haunted Mansion, I did like jerk it the other direction just to see, like, does it do something?

304
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
If you would collide with the Haunted Mansion.

305
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Well, I just wanted to say, like, is there a track?

306
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Well, I because I think there was there is track, which then I learned there is a track.

307
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And I was like, well, maybe it's like Autopia and we'll like bang the track a little.

308
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Just shake a bunch of people loose.

309
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah, just shake a bunch of people.

310
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You know, they always you know, they talk about Autopia is that formative ride where kids get to drive for the first time.

311
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And it would be nice if this was a formative ride.

312
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The Mark Twain where kids would get to pilot a riverboat for the first time in their lives.

313
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So I see what he's saying.

314
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
What child is not fascinated with 1800s Mississippi?

315
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's right.

316
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:47,000
They could go on to any number of careers of like riverboat gambler, riverboat con man, riverboat coal shoveler, steam wrangler.

317
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Well, and just the literal wrangler wrangler.

318
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Somebody's got to wrangle it.

319
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
OK, fair.

320
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And just the literal wheel turning.

321
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I mean, if you've piloted the Mark Twain, then you're you're set on Wheel of Fortune.

322
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Oh, yeah. Other people struggle.

323
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
They go right to bankrupt because they can barely turn the thing.

324
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Sure.

325
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So I mean, this is like all my thoughts about the Mark Twain.

326
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You know, there's the history of it and everything.

327
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But I'm completely curious about about you, about your this is a this is a personal one for you.

328
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I think this is a personal performance we're going to put on here.

329
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And I if I could get sort of inside the actors studio.

330
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Why the Mark Twain?

331
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What is it about?

332
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Oh, and don't forget when you can to steer the wheel.

333
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't mean to make you like juggle and podcast at the same time.

334
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But keep in mind, the wheel is there.

335
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'll remind you at various times to the show.

336
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
OK. And I will also be blowing the whistle at various times during the show.

337
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Maybe if there is a tangent going too long, a tangent not going long enough

338
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
or just I'm getting teased in a way I don't like.

339
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Tells me you're going to keep this.

340
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The wheel will factor into all future episodes.

341
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, the wheel and the whistle.

342
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But yes, Captain Jason.

343
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah. Do you have any idea like why?

344
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I mean, and of course, it's wonderful.

345
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And we all like I write.

346
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We all like the Mark Twain.

347
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
What a wonderful part of the Disneyland experience.

348
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
But yeah, what can you speak to about what appeals to you about this?

349
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Well, you know, I love my modes of transit.

350
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And this is like a very it's exciting.

351
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I say I realize I'm saying that about something that goes two point five miles per hour.

352
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But it's just how often do you get on a riverboat?

353
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The only other time I remember being on a riverboat.

354
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's true. He's right. He's right. He's right.

355
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,000
In this day and age, because like this riverboat was like the first one built in America in like 50 years.

356
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
When it was built in 55, it's unique.

357
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's a unique mode of transit.

358
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah. The only other time I remember is a friend and I were driving across country to move here.

359
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And we stopped in St. Louis and you could buy a ticket to go up in the arch

360
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
or you could buy a combo ticket to go up in the arch and the river.

361
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And you better believe I pushed hard and got my way for that combo ticket.

362
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Because it was it because it was a discount for both.

363
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That was partially. Yeah, that helped.

364
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I suspected it was also exciting.

365
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But like I had already been in L.A. I'd been to Disneyland and I'd ridden the Mark Twain.

366
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I think the first time I was here with college friends, like we were passing by it.

367
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And I was like, we got to do we got to do that.

368
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And you had ridden in Disney World.

369
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You had already been on like like did you have your did you see it for the first time and you went you fell in love?

370
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Or did you know of it? Did you know of your love before?

371
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And then going to going to Disneyland, you saw it and then it was exciting.

372
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You just he just heard like an oral history of it is what you're saying.

373
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah, sure. I've heard whispers of a boat out there that's the queen of them all.

374
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Well, let's just get it straight.

375
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Let's just get our boat straight. Yes, that's pretty important.

376
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Disneyland's Mark Twain is not Disney World's Admiral Joe Fowler,

377
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:48,000
which, of course, was destroyed in the 90s when it was dropped from a crane onto its dry dock.

378
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
However, you know, you know how you're just dropping boats when you got a crane.

379
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The guts of that the steam engine did end up in Tokyo Disney's Mark Twain,

380
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
which is so big it needed to be registered as a nautical vessel.

381
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The Mark Twain is also not the Liberty Bell, Disney World's current steamship,

382
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:22,000
which used to be named and I this sounds like a thing we would make up.

383
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Just I just want to get it right. It used to be called the Richard F Irvine,

384
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,000
which absolutely sounds like something I would say as a child like mother, mother, father, mother.

385
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We must ride the Richard Irvine first thing, post haste first thing when we get in the park today.

386
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Jason Teacups or Peter Pan. What are we thinking?

387
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I think we're doing the Richard F Irvine.

388
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Then your mom misses something. Okay, so what was that you wanted to do the Richard Irvine? That was it?

389
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:09,000
No, Richard F Irvine. Mother, get the middle initial right or don't speak at all for the rest of the day.

390
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You've ruined our vacation.

391
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
May as well just go back to Philadelphia at this point.

392
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Load up on Lebanon?

393
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Lebanon baloney.

394
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah, Lebanon baloney.

395
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It sounded like lemon and to us. You could see why we got caught on it for so long.

396
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Richard F Irvine, that's an Imagineer and I'm sure a good person who did good work,

397
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
but that is the worst name of a theme park attraction in history.

398
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:45,000
We complain about all of our mission breakouts and our dots and dashes, but just a man's name.

399
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
All right, let's get ready to ride the Norman H Litmeyer.

400
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I'll say this about it. With the middle initial it makes it better.

401
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
If it was just the first and last name, I think it would really suck.

402
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But with the middle initial it makes it sound official at least.

403
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It makes it sound formal in the way that the Admiral Joe Fowler, the Admiral part makes that sound.

404
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,000
My name is Michael Carlson, but if you say Michael R Carlson, it makes me sound better.

405
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You add another R and then you sound like one of the greatest authors of all time.

406
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Michael R R Carlson. You might want to consider that.

407
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm not a WGA member, but if I do join, can you have a different WGA name than a SAG name?

408
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I hear a S.

409
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You cut off a lot of Heming and Hawing. Thank you for having me.

410
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You're about to watch ten minutes of us all on our phones trying to find a name.

411
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Hold on one second here. So maybe that's what I'll do.

412
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Unless he's taken it for all RRs. Only he can be RR.

413
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's like Paris Hilton trademarking it's hot or something where it seems like it would be impossible to do it.

414
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But he's done it somehow. Good thing George R R Martin didn't trademark it at first.

415
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That's something when somebody gets burned by a dragon. That was a famous phrase they said in the Game of Thrones books.

416
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
A little less flowery. It's hot. Ah, it's hot.

417
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
If you haven't read the books, you won't know.

418
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah. Big lower the ring. They didn't do it on the show. They just did it in the books.

419
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
The funny thing is, you said that it's now the Liberty Bell today.

420
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And also today. And I mean today the boat got stuck.

421
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
For the first time in the history of Disney World. What happened today is we're getting ready for this.

422
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And they had to rescue people with the Tom Sawyer wraps.

423
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Well, the second most efficient mode of transport rescuing people for the first most efficient form of transport.

424
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So I mean, you know, all I can say is, all right, so that now it had gone 50 years without an accident.

425
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Now that record is blemished. Yeah. Mark Twain has been good for a long time.

426
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Sure got me pumped to come here and talk about Mark Twain. Yeah. The fucking baller Mark Twain.

427
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,000
No accidents this month, that's for sure. Until the DeSantis board takes over the inspections for it.

428
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Caught on fire. Why are they doing this? Until DeSantis renames it to the J.K. Rowling.

429
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Let's call it the J.K. Rowling boat from now on. No, hold on, Mike. You got to do that. Yeah, do that.

430
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I'm rechristening this boat, the J.K. Rowling. One of our finest patriots from England.

431
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Look, Liberty Bell. I feel pity for the audience that eventually comes to the Liberty Bell show.

432
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Those sad sacks. That's not you. We're cheering a champion tonight, the Mark Twain. Yeah.

433
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And one that of course is, you know, is very associated with you, Jason, and the lore of our show.

434
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,000
There is the, if I could conjure a five timer, there is the tail. Well, Scott, we're saying a different thing now.

435
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh. Five timer. We're saying the story strikes back.

436
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Kind of empowers the story, doesn't it? Yeah.

437
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah, so this story is rising from the grave. Its fist just shot up.

438
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:03,000
The story, I mean, feel free to tell it in your own. I think you should grab the wheel and tell it like, it was a dark and stormy night.

439
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
We were in rocky waters. There was no phantasmic that night.

440
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Look at that steering. So you could.

441
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Should it be, you need it closer? Huh?

442
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Do you need it closer? No, that wonderful live stream audience won't be able to see my pretty face. Oh, you're right.

443
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Or the wonderful in person audience.

444
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We were on a nighttime Mark Twain ride, which I love. I was just gripping one of the handles.

445
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's making me anxious. Reliving the story is making me anxious.

446
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

447
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Listeners at home, he snapped it off. He snapped off the whole bar. You're calling this dessert fear.

448
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
We were on a nighttime ride, which it's awesome at night. It's really fun at night. It's all lit up.

449
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You get to see all the show scenes at night and such.

450
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And that doesn't happen a lot because it's used in phantasmic.

451
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And so very excited to ride it at night.

452
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But I also really wanted to try this limited time Sunday that was at the Golden Horse Show.

453
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That I really used to be better at tracking the limited time food.

454
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And then I don't know if I just started eating at better restaurants or the food got worse.

455
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Or was it COVID fog?

456
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, or COVID fog.

457
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
He's the biggest victim in a way.

458
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I really wanted to have my cake and eat it too.

459
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So we got on the Mark Twain, like one of the last go arounds of the night.

460
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
As we could see, they were like packing up at the Golden Horse Show.

461
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And I quickly made my way from the whatever deck we were on.

462
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
We were definitely upstairs.

463
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
To the river.

464
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Second or third.

465
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You jumped off the boat into the river.

466
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I jumped off the boat.

467
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
There's no time.

468
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I drop kicked an animatronic duck.

469
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And so we're pulling very slowly docks.

470
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And so I am making my way down the stairs.

471
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I know you're not supposed to run.

472
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm a good boy.

473
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I don't want to run on a boat.

474
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't want to run through frontier land.

475
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But they have not joined me.

476
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I think Mike and Lindsay and Anthony Geo were there.

477
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And they were just paying witness.

478
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Here's something that is disappointing.

479
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I have a video of you doing this that's not in the presentation.

480
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah.

481
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
What?

482
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I mean I guess I could try to put it in there.

483
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It might completely ruin the rest of the show, but we could try it.

484
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So you have this you're saying?

485
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I have this video, but the video is not that satisfying.

486
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Oh.

487
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Yeah, you got to edit it, right?

488
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You have to like get ins and outs.

489
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Because there's no resolution to it.

490
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I just have a video of you walking from Mark Twain to the Golden Horseshoe.

491
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And it's not like, oh, you come out with a big Sunday at the end.

492
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So I think in my mind I was like, well, this doesn't have a great resolution.

493
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So we'll tell the story.

494
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But now you're saying it, I guess I should have put it in.

495
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Wait a minute.

496
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And it wasn't like, this wasn't a sprint?

497
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
This wasn't a Tom Cruise?

498
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
No, he didn't sprint.

499
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
He walked at a reasonable pace.

500
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I wanted to be respectful, you know.

501
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And so I got in and I got it.

502
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I got the Sunday and once again.

503
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I think I made the right choice.

504
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I think I made the right choice not to put it in.

505
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Uh huh.

506
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Because that's the story.

507
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah, that's the story.

508
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You can imagine Jason shuffling in the dark.

509
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
If you came out with a Golden Horseshoe with it over your head,

510
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
like cheering and throwing ice cream at people or something.

511
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
No, of course that didn't happen.

512
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I came out already eating it.

513
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But I don't have it on video.

514
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I came out with a very similar shit eating grin on my face as when we boarded the Mark Twain.

515
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Because now every time I try to board it, I try to look very excited to see if they'll let me pilot it again.

516
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And I signed that captain's log.

517
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I signed the guest book that they have up there, which are supposedly all archived.

518
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But also they could just be lying about that.

519
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,000
They just throw it in the incinerator of the boat at the end of the day.

520
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Jason, I did not clear this with you.

521
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:36,000
But I have photos from a different time when we were on the Mark Twain of you looking very happy and pleased.

522
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And it looks like we're alone on the boat, but I'm sure we weren't.

523
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
But I'm also not 100% sure.

524
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Do you mean alone as in it was just you and I who weren't with other people or we had the boat to ourselves?

525
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah, that's it. That's the grin. That's it.

526
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Why is the...

527
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It looks like they emptied the boat for us.

528
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Which I don't think they did.

529
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Wow.

530
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And then, was this the one with the closed eyes?

531
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Closed eyes.

532
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Wish and a wish.

533
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yes.

534
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Make this moment last forever.

535
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So yeah, that's the proof. This is pre-podcast, I think.

536
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I think it's pre-podcast, but this is a thing you've done for many years.

537
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You have a very thorough iCloud photo library.

538
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Very thorough.

539
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Very thorough. Very well organized.

540
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So every now and then, Mike will just send me or me and Gio,

541
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
he will just send pictures where we look foolish from years and years ago.

542
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Not me, I guess.

543
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Somebody didn't make the iCloud, I suppose.

544
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
You're in there.

545
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You had the album within the iCloud labeled the light of my life,

546
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
and you had to switch it to your daughter from Jason.

547
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You were getting errors because you had a new light of my life album,

548
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
and it was conflicting. It kept adding JPEG.

549
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Subalbums being like he sat up on his own for the first time today.

550
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
On the boat, on the Mark Twain.

551
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
He sat up in a river boat for the first time.

552
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah. Yes, that's all true.

553
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
There's photos of Jason on the boat, but there's also artwork.

554
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Let me set it up first.

555
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
We did a call at some point due to some episode we asked for artwork of Jason

556
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
holding a turkey leg, piloting a Mark Twain made of cake,

557
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and I believe the person who came through is Zachariah Dyrr.

558
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Zachariah gave us this.

559
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
What else do you want?

560
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Wow.

561
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And if you're wondering what happened to that original art, I haven't.

562
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
He sent it. I haven't.

563
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Oh, wow.

564
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Didn't bring that one?

565
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Framed?

566
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
No, it's like in a protective sleeve because I was too nervous to get it framed.

567
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'll get it framed one of these days.

568
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You don't trust those frame groups.

569
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I think there's another cake one.

570
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
What kind of a sleeve?

571
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Like a padded sleeve.

572
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Like what you would put in a three-ring binder?

573
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
No, because it's big.

574
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
That's like 9 by 12.

575
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You have a custom sleeve?

576
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
No, I just used the sleeve, like the mailing sleeve he sent it in.

577
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I left it in there so it wouldn't get damaged.

578
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
An envelope.

579
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I guess normal people would say an envelope.

580
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Scott, you were right.

581
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I was curious if you might allow other people access just for fun, just to see how it feels,

582
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
to let somebody else grab the wheel or blow the whistle.

583
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Jason, blow the whistle and let's talk about sleeves more.

584
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
What kind of whistle is that?

585
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Does that mean more sleeves or less sleeves?

586
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Less sleeve, more?

587
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
What does the whistle mean?

588
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It means more sleeves.

589
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
More sleeves.

590
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
More sleeves.

591
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
More sleeves.

592
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
What does the whistle mean?

593
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Jason's so peaceful he's not paying attention to us.

594
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It appears we've gotten to that point in most shows where I'm just like,

595
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I've gotten myself into a hole and I don't know how to get out of it.

596
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But Jason, you have something you could do this time.

597
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You could steer out of a hole.

598
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Steer us out.

599
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Steer us out.

600
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Alright.

601
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And Jason is now steering us to the next point.

602
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And this is the point, which is that we had this idea, a Mark Twain made of cake,

603
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and in my research for this episode I discovered this idea was had many years ago by Madison Avenue.

604
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
In an old Disney magazine of some kind there was a, yeah, it's their next one, Mike.

605
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Look at that.

606
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That is, courtesy of Disney history 101, that is a sugar ad that actually gives you the recipe for a riverboat cake inspired by the Mark Twain.

607
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
There's candle smokestacks.

608
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It says, such sweet things happen with Spreckle Sugar.

609
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I'm not going to add an H, I guess.

610
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Spreckle Sugar.

611
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So there you go.

612
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So somebody thought of this, it looks like wafers as the stern wheel, right?

613
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
That's smart.

614
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, it looks like wafers into icing.

615
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Good way to incorporate it if we were doing this in a chopped manner or a bake-off manner.

616
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Anyway, I thought this was nice.

617
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I wanted to know, and that's it.

618
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
That's the end of that?

619
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It is nice, yeah.

620
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I did not, yes, a pause for niceness.

621
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Well, I didn't see the handwriting either.

622
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
The Westerners are sweet on Spreckle Sugar.

623
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I didn't know, I think, oh, it says in all caps, no wonder Spreckle, I choose to do it angrily.

624
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
No wonder Spreckles is the sugar used exclusively at Disneyland.

625
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
They're going to keep it that way or else.

626
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Wow.

627
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You guys ever heard of Spreckle Sugar?

628
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I think I've heard of Spreckles.

629
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I don't know if it's around anymore.

630
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
It may have gotten absorbed by Domino or, you know.

631
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah, you know what?

632
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
This is a good time.

633
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Jason, what's your sugar brand?

634
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Oh.

635
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Oh, we walked right into it.

636
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
You a Domino guy?

637
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I like a Domino.

638
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I like, you know, the store brand is fine.

639
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Sugar in the Raw, I like Sugar in the Raw.

640
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Sugar in the Raw is good.

641
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I'm feeling a little fancy, you know.

642
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah.

643
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
How often do you, sorry, I'm so sorry.

644
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Well, I was going to ask him to, if you could just triumphantly say store brand and blow

645
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
the whistle.

646
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Oh, yeah.

647
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

648
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

649
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

650
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

651
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

652
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

653
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

654
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Oh, yeah.

655
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Store brand.

656
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Yeah, wow.

657
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
What an ad for a store brand.

658
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Love it.

659
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Did you, or do you have to follow up?

660
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I forgot.

661
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Okay.

662
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I bring up Spreckel's to say I was curious what is up with Spreckel's Sugar and any other

663
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
history with them in Disneyland.

664
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I found different history about Spreckel's.

665
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Spreckel's was owned.

666
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Somebody went, oh.

667
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
They're correct.

668
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yeah, it has to be.

669
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The investigative journalists who took down the Spreckel's cabal.

670
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Spreckel's?

671
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That's right.

672
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm going to shine my investigative light on actions from 120 years ago.

673
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
At least it's a family and it was run by Adolf Spreckel's.

674
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
That's not the bad thing.

675
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
That's not true.

676
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
It was a common name.

677
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Nice people could have been named Spreckel's.

678
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
This is not.

679
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Spreckel's was a common name.

680
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
We've all had one major brain fart.

681
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
We'll see how many there are for the rest of this.

682
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Nice people can be named Adolf, I was saying.

683
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Let me get that on the record.

684
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I don't need that on the record.

685
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Yeah, clip that.

686
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Stiff.

687
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Post it.

688
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Adolf Spreckel's married a woman who, this is a quote from somewhere, now my words,

689
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
a working class girl turned nude model who never hid her ambition to marry a wealthy older man.

690
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So far, so good.

691
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Nice.

692
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
The thing is, marrying a wealthy older man, we know what that syndrome is.

693
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
This is literally where the phrase sugar daddy came from.

694
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
This is what it is.

695
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,000
She, Alma, the wife, called Adolf Spreckel's her sugar daddy.

696
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Wow.

697
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And that's why we all use the term with our various sugar daddies.

698
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Wow.

699
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
This is nice because you've given everyone a topic of conversation when they talk to their sugar daddy later.

700
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's hard to bridge that gap sometimes.

701
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Right, sometimes the age difference is so great.

702
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
You have trouble finding things to talk about, especially if they're on death's door.

703
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Which they are.

704
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Because they're sugar daddies.

705
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Wow.

706
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
That's interesting.

707
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
They could have, the time has passed for this, but certain women could have said, you know, Sumner Redstone,

708
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
you're the best sugar daddy, but do you know about the first?

709
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And what, Scott, what would he have said back?

710
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah.

711
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Suck my toes.

712
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Sorry, one more thing about, if you will keep us in the Spreckel's waters, the other story about this guy.

713
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yeah, rub the wheel a little bit.

714
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Just be ready if you don't like where it's going.

715
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
The San Francisco Chronicle wrote an article about this guy and suggested that Spreckel's sugar defrauded its shareholders.

716
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And Adolf Spreckel's responded by shooting the editor in chief twice.

717
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Two whistles for two bullets.

718
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Flag on the field, you're not supposed to shoot the editor in chief of a newspaper.

719
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
There then was a trial.

720
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
He said, temporary insanity?

721
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And they said, sure, you're fine.

722
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So the guy didn't die, but he did, everyone knew he did shoot him.

723
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That wasn't up for, he also, alright, sure.

724
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,000
He also had syphilis and didn't tell his wife until she was delivering their third child.

725
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Oh, Jesus.

726
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
At that moment.

727
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Get out of this.

728
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Wait really quick.

729
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And still, he didn't tell her because, hey, I gotta tell you I have syphilis.

730
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,000
He went into a syphilis seizure and he had to be wheeled out of the room.

731
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Like, oh, what happened there?

732
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Oh, I guess he must be, he must have syphilis.

733
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Okay, let's get to delivering that baby then.

734
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
It sounds like he had it for a while.

735
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I think so, yes.

736
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
His whole life?

737
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I don't know when syphilis came about, he could have been the first.

738
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Patient zero.

739
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So Adolf Spreckels wasn't a great guy.

740
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
No, no.

741
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,000
If you can imagine, I did not bring him up to say, let's learn about a good sugar man.

742
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Anyway, seriously, you might have been right, but that's during before.

743
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah, you prefer the more benevolent sugar barons like Heimlich von Domino or something.

744
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Mussolini Domino.

745
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Vladimir Storbrand.

746
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Alright.

747
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Steer us out, Jason.

748
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Well, let's take a back onto the rivers of America.

749
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Let's take a slight detour towards the other insane man associated with this boat, Walt Disney.

750
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
When this was being built, when Disneyland was being built and they were building the riverboat,

751
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:48,000
you know, the riverboat was in the plans for the unbuilt Mickey Mouse park they were going to put in Burbank next to the studios.

752
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That never happened and it stayed in the plans when they started working on Disneyland.

753
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Admiral Joe Fowler was consulting.

754
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
He had been in the Navy and he was consulting on construction and stuff.

755
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
He was a man, not just a boat.

756
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
He was not just a boat.

757
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
He was not just a hyper intelligent boat.

758
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
If Chris Evans were to have tweeted about him, he is a man.

759
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
The boat was based on the man.

760
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Yeah.

761
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
The man was not a boat before and he copied the boat man.

762
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Just for clarity's sake.

763
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But Admiral Joe Fowler really pushed.

764
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Like, we need a dry dock.

765
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:38,000
We have to have a dry dock that you can pull the boats into when they need to be built and worked on and all this stuff.

766
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And Walt apparently hated that.

767
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
He hated how much room it took up and that it cost money and stuff.

768
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So it just seems like there's all these stories of Walt like discovering stuff when they were building Disneyland.

769
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Like, yeah, you need a place to work on the boat.

770
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
People can't just jump on.

771
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Yeah, you can't just jump on.

772
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
We can't just build it in the driveway.

773
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
We have to build it elsewhere.

774
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
We got to slow down for these slow pokes.

775
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Slow pokes, I guess.

776
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Doesn't seem exciting to me.

777
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:22,000
So Walt was the one who would call the dry dock Fowler's Harbor as like an own on Joe Fowler.

778
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And that is still what it's called to to this day.

779
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
He was owning it?

780
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
He was like teasing him.

781
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
He was just like, hated it.

782
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
This tribute.

783
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
This will show everybody.

784
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
He didn't name like the toilet after him.

785
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Yeah.

786
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Like that would feel like more of a, I guess it feels good nature is what I'm saying.

787
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It doesn't feel like he's that upset.

788
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
When you enter Disneyland, any shit that you take will be called a Fowler.

789
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Now that's a rez.

790
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Makes sense. Fowls up the room.

791
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yeah.

792
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So I just thought that was, the stories of Walt like going, you know, I'm sure he was pissed

793
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
because the story about the rivers of America, they tried to fill it up the first time and the water just sank in the ground.

794
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So once again, Admiral Joe Fowler, how to come to the rescue, found a bunch of clay.

795
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I don't know where he found a giant deposit of clay or like a riverbeds worth of clay.

796
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
This is just the apocryphal story and they lined it with clay.

797
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
There's clay in the mills.

798
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And that worked.

799
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That worked. The river did get filled.

800
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But Walt may also just have been mad that they're like, we're out of money.

801
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I have to pay to build a boat out of my own pocket.

802
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
He did this himself.

803
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Yeah.

804
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:54,000
When you go on that boat, especially you, Jason, when you go on that boat, I hope that when you close your eyes in a photo like that one, just think about Walt.

805
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Little Walt reflection.

806
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah.

807
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I'm thinking about it.

808
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Okay.

809
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Next time make sure.

810
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Well, let's hear this a photo of Walt.

811
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Oh, yeah.

812
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
On the dock.

813
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Here he is.

814
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Yeah.

815
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
He's smoking some Chesterfields.

816
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Yeah.

817
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Here's people.

818
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Some people are shining his shoes and other people are playing instruments and then he's smoking a cig.

819
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
So he loved this thing.

820
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Do we steer out of this photo?

821
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yeah, we steer out of this.

822
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Boat.

823
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Bye bye photo.

824
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:38,000
The term optics had not been invented yet.

825
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
But he did.

826
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:58,000
He loved the thing and he, Joe Fowler, who you mentioned, when he was especially stressed when they were putting the park together, when he was feeling like this is not going to come together, this might even be very stressful still once it is open, he said to Joe Fowler, you know, when things get hectic, we can always get the mark.

827
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And always get the mark twain and just ride around the rivers of America.

828
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So it was always his kind of peaceful plays much like you, you have that in common.

829
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And he also loves to get drunk there.

830
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And I, and I, you know, it's something you might just like assume or wish to be true.

831
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But luckily, there is a witness to this and a fellow participant in this and that person is Art Linkletter.

832
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
See if he owes to Art Linkletter.

833
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Okay, from the Disney History Institute.

834
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Linkletter recalled a few evenings that he spent with Walt at Disneyland sipping cocktails in the firehouse and riding the riverboat with a couple glasses of scotch under his belt.

835
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Once Walt climbed up into the rigging of the Mark Twain ship.

836
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I thought he was going to dive off.

837
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
We've all considered it.

838
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You know, I think that Walt quote like a big selling point I think for this attraction for me is just the vibes are immaculate.

839
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Like it's so chill like the the narration is very chill.

840
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Except here I just want to do the one line.

841
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
This line is not very chill, but I do love it.

842
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:26,000
When the because there's a narrator on the ride and then there's also like crew members yelling things.

843
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So when you're first pulling out they yell by the mock mock one mock twain.

844
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I love that shit.

845
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And then like they kind of they do some other marks later on.

846
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
But the was that the not chill line.

847
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That is the not chill line.

848
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
He's kind of yelling it at you.

849
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's not the captain.

850
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's one of the crew guys.

851
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
You love this man yelling.

852
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I love the man yelling mock twain.

853
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
That's kind of like that like DJ Khaled of its day.

854
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It is.

855
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Mark Twain and another one and another one Mark Twain.

856
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Here we go.

857
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So so the vibe of it you're talking about.

858
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Walt's.

859
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
First of all Walt was drunk on the boat but obviously you can only drink a Club 33 in Disneyland.

860
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Well or he could he had his private stash up in the firehouse.

861
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Right.

862
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So so this is really he should have abided by the rules that he set forth because so many people we talk about this all the time are very much like well on Walt's sacred land a drink must not be consumed.

863
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
An adult's libation must not be consumed on Walt's favorite park.

864
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:53,000
The way you said that made it sound like you had sprinkled a circle of salt and we're trying to summon him.

865
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Wouldn't that be so I think we'd be the guys to do it.

866
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Come back for anybody.

867
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Yeah.

868
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
He's a drunk.

869
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Yeah.

870
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah.

871
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
No you got that.

872
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
His man his special light.

873
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And during the pandemic the special light in the firehouse always stayed burning right in the spot on this table where he.

874
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Spilled glasses all the time and cut his hands on the trip.

875
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
He tripped.

876
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:27,000
He tripped and hit his head on this table when he was drunk once and will never forget it.

877
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It's by the big stain where they couldn't get the denizens chili out.

878
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Walt's magic chili stain.

879
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It is stayed burning all over.

880
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
All over his bed.

881
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
We refresh the chili on the stain every night.

882
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
We have a new.

883
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Pouring one out for Walt Disney and a full can of Gebhard's chili.

884
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
It's chili and then a bottle of black and white scotch right on top of it.

885
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
You have to pour out every bean or he cries in heaven.

886
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
That's right.

887
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Here's my here's my quote.

888
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
This is what I started fantasizing about and just just go with me on this.

889
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
OK.

890
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
We all know how Walt Disney died or we or we think we know.

891
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yes.

892
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
What if what if it was a cover up.

893
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,000
What if one unfortunate night a few scotches too many with art link litter.

894
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
He did a dive.

895
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And he ended up in the big thing on the back.

896
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah.

897
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yes.

898
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And he got the stern the stern wheel.

899
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yes.

900
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
He got caught in the stern wheel and ground up into little chunks.

901
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I'll say this much like chili.

902
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I'll say this though.

903
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You're falling into the stern wheel and it seems like it could be a really interesting like cartoon presentation.

904
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Boom boom boom boom boom like over and over again.

905
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Of course.

906
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I'm a fool.

907
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I'm imagining it.

908
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
You getting ground up.

909
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
But that would be in like the propeller of a plane.

910
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
This would be that you get stretched every which way.

911
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yeah.

912
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Like who's who's a beaker like the Muppet Beaker.

913
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Yes.

914
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yes.

915
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
That happened to Walt for like and and then art didn't hear him yelling.

916
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So they did the entire 20 minute journey.

917
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
He got bent bent up like so much loose dough.

918
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And that's how Walt Disney passed away.

919
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
God rest his soul.

920
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
You heard it here first.

921
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
You know the real story.

922
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
The truth.

923
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Yeah.

924
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
OK.

925
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Let's just it's a little late but let's just get our vocab here.

926
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Right front of the ship bow.

927
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Yeah.

928
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Rear stern port is the left when you're looking at the bow and starboard is the right.

929
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I think that's correct.

930
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Thank you.

931
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I heard a little clap so that sounds somebody knows.

932
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
But how does it work when you're on a stage.

933
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Everything's.

934
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Stage left stage left stage right down stage up stage.

935
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I each ports we need to know where stage port is you the captain especially.

936
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I went on my family to go on a cruise when I was younger and they did tell us about port and starboard and would refer to it when you would ask questions.

937
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And I was never right.

938
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I was very nervous that I would get lost on that boat.

939
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
So were they calling they asking questions or this is to tell you where to go if there's a problem.

940
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah port side starboard side.

941
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
OK.

942
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But you just never could keep it straight.

943
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I yeah I still am bad at my middle school theater director would be very mad because I still have to look up stage left and state stage left and stage right.

944
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Sometimes I fucked it up in that moment.

945
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So is this being told to you like they're OK in the event of an emergency get to the starboard side or else your parents are toast.

946
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Oh fuck.

947
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Oh shit.

948
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
It's like your nightmare.

949
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I think they were a little more chill probably.

950
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I think the Norwegian cruise line people would cave at the first side of a child looking confused and upset.

951
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
How many big boats have you been on in your life.

952
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Are we talking tall ships.

953
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:35,000
We talk of big boats because I've been on a fair amount of tall shit when you grow up in the northeast of America.

954
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
There's a lot of fucking day trips to tall ships.

955
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
All right.

956
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The curse before that.

957
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Let me first.

958
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Mother F.

959
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And there's a cockiest I've ever seen him.

960
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Philadelphia Baltimore.

961
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You want to talk about all ships motherfucker.

962
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I've been on some tall ships.

963
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Tall ships.

964
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Can you say when you say tall ships does that mean two stories or more.

965
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I know like have the big sales have the big.

966
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Also sales is part of a tall ship.

967
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yeah.

968
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
It's not just decks like old ships old old ships.

969
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So how tall does the sale have to be for the ship to be tall.

970
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I don't know.

971
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I can barely tell you about a riverboat.

972
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
It's by the grace of God.

973
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I'm even here tonight.

974
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Because I spent a lot of time trying to I spent a good amount of time trying to find that captain certificate boat.

975
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It was buried in a box.

976
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Would you not have shown up if you didn't find that.

977
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
They'll know I'm a fraud.

978
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
It'd be bad show.

979
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And then you're driving.

980
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
You're driving.

981
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
You're like wait which one's the port side of the car.

982
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I need to turn starboard on Wilshire.

983
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Jason Jason Jason Jason driving his car.

984
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
That guy cut me off.

985
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Now that that is a vessel that if you if you jerk the wheel of a Honda Civic it does do something.

986
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Not like the Autopia.

987
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Not well the Autopia does something to that's true but it's yeah not like the Mark Twain not like the Mark Twain.

988
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Yeah like the Mark Twain.

989
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It is like the Mark Twain.

990
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It is just to go back to you piloting for a second.

991
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It is funny that like OK here's just this is another true fact about the Mark Twain.

992
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
This whole that it is on a track and the wheel doesn't do anything.

993
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
It's so funny that you in particular are obsessed with this.

994
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Like that's the ride.

995
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
That's the one I want to do and I want to be a captain on it.

996
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Even just in addition to that cast members have called it the floating break room.

997
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Oh boy that's a little too on game for me honestly.

998
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Due to how little has to be done to pilot it.

999
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And I just flashed to like I know there was one episode where we were talking about some show where Mickey Mouse is down on a stage by the castle.

1000
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And then there's a magic trick and suddenly Mickey Mouse is up in the castle and another magic trick and he's back down on the ground again.

1001
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And you were like hey wait a minute that second Mickey does barely anything.

1002
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
It's to hang out in that castle and maybe gets paid the same as the Mickey who's hoofing it all day.

1003
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Yeah that's called a sweet gig folks.

1004
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Like that's the one you want.

1005
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
This has come up more than once on the podcast.

1006
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Is that Jason notices there's two costume performers for some sort of a magic trick that happens in a show.

1007
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And he makes sure to point out that second performer has the sweetest gig imaginable.

1008
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
He's like daydreaming about that second character gig.

1009
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Just like during a performance of like Fantastic or something that second Mickey is just like sitting like this for the whole show.

1010
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Thinking of all the money they're making without putting in any effort and then like oh it's my time okay.

1011
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
And then lights down.

1012
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Back to your club sandwich.

1013
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Jason taking a nap in a Mickey head.

1014
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Mickey time of the show.

1015
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Mickey he's not moving.

1016
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
What?

1017
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Did he die?

1018
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Jason.

1019
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
What?

1020
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Here just wheel me out.

1021
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Just push the desk chair out.

1022
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Somebody wave my arms for me.

1023
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That's what we're saying.

1024
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It's an easy going attraction and I think it's the sign of an easy going day in the park.

1025
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Like if you're on the Mark Twain it is not a rush to get the time to get in the virtual.

1026
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Like it's the epitome of we got time.

1027
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
We're relaxing and I think that's something that's great about it.

1028
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
It's one of the only like because we everyone knows that Carousel of Progress.

1029
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
There's these great slower moving attractions that have air conditioning.

1030
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
That's primarily why a lot of the dads like to go on them.

1031
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Not daddies like me.

1032
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I like the show part of it.

1033
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:27,000
But the Mark Twain is like that version for like if a dad doesn't need the air conditioning and he just wants the relaxed vibe the Mark Twain is perfect for him.

1034
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Is what I'm saying.

1035
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Oh yeah.

1036
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Well it's also a good lifesaver of like we have to do something.

1037
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Everything's broken down or it's backed up.

1038
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Let's go on the Mark Twain.

1039
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That'll chill everyone out.

1040
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
The music, the narration, the show scenes, all the animals, you know.

1041
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Except Mike can you bring up the beaver image?

1042
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Oh hey that's the 10 o'clock show.

1043
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Listeners you wouldn't believe this was meant for the late ones.

1044
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,000
You can take it off the screen Mike.

1045
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So this you can see this is one of my favorite probably one of the dark darker jokes in Disneyland.

1046
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
This is a beaver that you can see from the Mark Twain.

1047
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It is chewing on a railroad beam like post.

1048
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,000
This beaver is Jason's favorite character in fiction.

1049
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Because this beaver is like a stone cold killer.

1050
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Like he could really kill people on that train.

1051
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
And it's funny that I don't know I just think it's funny they got it in.

1052
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
They got it approved.

1053
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
He moves a little.

1054
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
You know.

1055
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I also like the dog that's looking at the little fish that are jumping out of the water.

1056
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
We don't have a photo of that.

1057
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
It's kind of what we don't have a photo.

1058
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You do not have a photo of the dog you can imagine.

1059
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I thought the murder beaver was better to illustrate you know.

1060
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yeah.

1061
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
They really this is how old is this now at this point?

1062
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
This beaver?

1063
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I think this was added back in when they closed it for over a year.

1064
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So we have four or five years at this point?

1065
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
They closed it for over a year for Galaxy's Edge constructions.

1066
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And trust me they sent letters.

1067
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I got letters.

1068
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
What?

1069
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
They returned.

1070
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
What?

1071
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I have no idea where this is going.

1072
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Oh I sent letters complaining.

1073
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And I know they got them because I clearly Kathleen Kennedy did not like them because my tires were clearly slashed.

1074
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
You sent Kathleen Kennedy letters about this?

1075
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I sent them complaining about the closure.

1076
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Oh I see.

1077
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
That it's going to make the route shorter.

1078
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You get like ten minutes less of precious mercury.

1079
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You get a little less time but the rock work is immaculate.

1080
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It is immaculate.

1081
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Let's hear it for Rockworks.

1082
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Let's hear it for the Rockworks.

1083
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Well we should talk about that because they drained the river and they shortened the length of the ride.

1084
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I remember you and I at least speaking about the concern that perhaps the Mark Twain was going to go away because we knew they were going to have to bring out some of the, they were going to have to sort of encroach on the land.

1085
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And there was, I remember message boards and there was a lot of panic happening that the Mark Twain was maybe going to go away or it was going to be maybe just docked somewhere and there would be no trip around.

1086
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
But thank goodness.

1087
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
You were reading about this and ignoring the rise of Trump.

1088
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I'm not a political person okay.

1089
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I'm like Pitbull.

1090
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I call politics, politics.

1091
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Well we all know that old Pitbull, ba-ma.

1092
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Look I've heard him say it twice.

1093
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
In interviews or in songs?

1094
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Interviews, interviews, interviews.

1095
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Okay.

1096
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
So you've watched more than one Pitbull interview.

1097
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I do, I love Pitbull.

1098
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I like Pitbull too.

1099
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I never thought to like check out the behind the scenes features.

1100
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Yeah.

1101
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's not so much about the music.

1102
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
That's one text.

1103
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
The other, the interview, that's where you get the real Pitbull.

1104
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Jason, Jason blow the whistle before I start talking about Three to Tango, the video with Pitbull and John Travolta.

1105
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Blow the whistle so we get out of here.

1106
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And, and the wheel.

1107
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Alright, alright.

1108
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
The wheel, yay.

1109
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Here we go, here we go.

1110
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Nudging us.

1111
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Just faintly, faintly you can hear Mike in the background.

1112
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Mr. Bull, where do you get your gloves?

1113
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Where do you get those cool leather gloves?

1114
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Mr. Bull.

1115
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,000
You know what we, what we gotta, we cannot leave here without talking about decks.

1116
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
What's your deck Jason?

1117
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

1118
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Let's get back to that.

1119
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Oh let's get back to it.

1120
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
How do you twain?

1121
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Okay.

1122
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
The bottom deck.

1123
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Oh.

1124
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Is that your deck?

1125
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I think that's the one I like.

1126
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Yeah, that's I think the second deck.

1127
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I like the middle deck.

1128
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I like the second deck.

1129
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:18,000
The bottom deck has those fun old metal chairs, but it's right in the sun and you don't necessarily have the best view.

1130
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
The very top deck is just all sunlight.

1131
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It's kind of brutal on hot days, but that second deck kind of go in and out.

1132
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
You get a little shade.

1133
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You step out.

1134
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
You see it.

1135
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
You get a good view of all the animals and the animatronics and such.

1136
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Well yeah, and you can really, the second, I, oh look I'm a second deck guy.

1137
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
It's pretty obvious I think.

1138
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

1139
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
No, we could all sit just by looking at you.

1140
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:53,000
What you really can get, I feel you get the most as far as like theming in addition to, you have a lot of options on the second deck because you can do that.

1141
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Like this little room makes you feel like you're back in time or something like in a different place, but then it's just a couple steps away where you can just lean out on the, like the balcony, whatever the hell that's called.

1142
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Sure.

1143
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Bannister? Do they call it a bannister?

1144
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Railing?

1145
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Railing.

1146
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I'm tired.

1147
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
That was an odd.

1148
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
That is an odd.

1149
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Halsetto.

1150
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
We were almost falling into a one fathom area and we saved it.

1151
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Getting railing got us back into two fathoms.

1152
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:31,000
So, so yeah, if you want to have like, you can have, all of the things that make Mark Twain great are on the second level.

1153
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Yeah.

1154
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That's what I think.

1155
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I don't think I prefer any of the, I think I wander.

1156
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I think I like plant in the front enough to say I try to get up in the front, you know, jack and rose it if I can.

1157
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
You gotta jack and rose it.

1158
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Yeah.

1159
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And then, you know, then you wander.

1160
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
You try to see it from all angles.

1161
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So you're not committal as far as your favorite deck?

1162
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Yeah, I think a must is a little bit on the bottom.

1163
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Just a bit.

1164
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
But then you're right about the sun and then I like to explore.

1165
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
But not so, I think you get to split the difference.

1166
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
You know, you have your, it's like half relax and then half wander.

1167
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
You can steer if you want.

1168
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I'm asking for my own steer.

1169
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
You did caution us.

1170
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,000
You did caution us ahead of time that the steering wheel was very fragile.

1171
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And I think I've been a little anxious about steering.

1172
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
But it's holding up very well.

1173
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Here, give it a big old spin.

1174
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I think we'll see what happens.

1175
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And apologies, my parents.

1176
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
People in the front rows, get your Gallagher tarps ready.

1177
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I'm gonna spin the wheel.

1178
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Oh, it went 70 miles an hour.

1179
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Yay, look at it go.

1180
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Spin, spin, spin, spin.

1181
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Wait, why'd you stop it?

1182
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I'm gonna do it the other way.

1183
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Okay.

1184
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Whoa.

1185
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
That's pretty sturdy.

1186
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
All right.

1187
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
The stakes were high because my parents are watching the live stream.

1188
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And this is my dad's item.

1189
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So if I had destroyed it.

1190
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Their decoration, our mic stand.

1191
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Till we actually record the shows on it.

1192
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
But my dad's watching like, okay, I liked it.

1193
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I don't know how I felt about that part about Walt getting ground up into little bits.

1194
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But I liked a lot of it.

1195
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Wait, no, he broke my precious wheel.

1196
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And we never spoke again.

1197
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
You'd have to find a 24-hour Long John Silver's to find a new one.

1198
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Jason knows where those are though.

1199
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I just found out there's a Quiznos just south of Los Feliz.

1200
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You spotted him?

1201
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Wait, where's the Quiznos?

1202
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Huh?

1203
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Where is it?

1204
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Just south of Los Feliz, die town.

1205
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Like it's.

1206
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yeah, there's a Quiznos.

1207
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
He's blowing mines in the front row.

1208
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Is it new?

1209
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I look it up.

1210
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Is it new?

1211
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
No.

1212
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
No, I hear no.

1213
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
It's hanging on.

1214
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Quiznos has the oven, right?

1215
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Where they put it through.

1216
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Yeah, they have the oven, but they expanded way too fast.

1217
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
His tail is old as time.

1218
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Tail is old as time.

1219
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I'm worried Dave's Hot Chicken is gonna do the same thing.

1220
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Well, there is one coming to Burbank though.

1221
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Yeah, the Empire Center, of course.

1222
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Coming to the beautiful Empire Center.

1223
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Of course.

1224
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Hey, hey, hey, get lost.

1225
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1226
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Get lost one.

1227
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Hey, look at me, look at me.

1228
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Yeah.

1229
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I am the captain now.

1230
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Oh no, we're going into 80's Beach Boys territory.

1231
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Alright, okay.

1232
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Oh no.

1233
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
We're gonna talk about Get Ya Back.

1234
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
The pressure was on.

1235
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Dennis was dead and how are they gonna do the drums?

1236
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And they used a drum machine.

1237
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
It's actually a pretty good song.

1238
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
It holds up.

1239
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Oh, he's talking about everything but John Stamos.

1240
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
The thing people might know.

1241
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
No, no, no.

1242
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Obscure recession musicians.

1243
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
That's what I'm after.

1244
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Okay, no, no, I'll relieve you.

1245
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I'll relieve you.

1246
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Wow.

1247
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Oh, thank goodness.

1248
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I'm a little fascinated by the Quiznos to be honest.

1249
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
But more in a way of like, I'm not gonna go, but it's like,

1250
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
what's the mountain lion that died?

1251
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
P23.

1252
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Hold on, hold on.

1253
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I don't see where this tangent is going.

1254
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That used to be like, ooh, a sighting, like an RIP.

1255
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
But you know, now that he's passed, all we have is spotting Quiznos.

1256
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Like, you're saying it's like a rare white elk.

1257
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1258
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Even better.

1259
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Nature boring.

1260
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
The beloved Quiznos has been taken from us.

1261
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Like, that'll be the big article that'll be written.

1262
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
About when the aliens write about humanity.

1263
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Yeah.

1264
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
They had everything.

1265
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And they destroyed it.

1266
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
They had a tiny oven for sandwiches.

1267
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Beep bop bop bop bop.

1268
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
That's kind of a robot voice.

1269
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Did you guys come across the voice actors on this ride?

1270
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah.

1271
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I think so.

1272
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:22,000
So the navigational commands are done by two people, Jim Etchinson

1273
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
and Peter Rennaday, who comes up seemingly every episode.

1274
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
He's worked a lot in the theme parks.

1275
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
But the thing that struck me, the captain is voiced by a guy named

1276
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Stephen Stanton.

1277
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
And this is just from Wikipedia.

1278
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Stanton is well known as a voice double for Tim Allen, Nicholas Cage,

1279
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
John Cusack, Peter Cushing, Robert Downey Jr., Roger Ebert, Jeff Goldblum,

1280
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Alec Yannis, Clive Owen, Vincent Scavelli, and Bruce Willis, among others.

1281
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
So this guy fucking works.

1282
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Pull it back.

1283
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Pull it back.

1284
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Pull it back.

1285
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
What needs a Roger Ebert voice double?

1286
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Alive or dead, what would need a Roger Ebert?

1287
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Yes.

1288
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I'm not sure.

1289
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Was there ever a Siskel and Ebert video game?

1290
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
They were on the critic, but they did their own voices on that.

1291
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Yes, yes, of course.

1292
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Yeah, you're for the critic.

1293
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
So I wonder, yeah, was there...

1294
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:31,000
The video game would have been throwing thumbs at movies that were of poor quality.

1295
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Film canisters are flying at them, and only their thumbs can slice them in half.

1296
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I think that people were throwing VHSs at them.

1297
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
VHSs, okay.

1298
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
VHSs sort of came to life, and they were anthropomorphic, and they had eyes,

1299
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and they were flying at them, and then they would just kind of go like this.

1300
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
And then they would destroy the VHSs.

1301
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Wow, wow.

1302
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
The thumbs are maybe made bigger just to read in a video game.

1303
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Yes, and then you would get a power-up that would make the thumb giant.

1304
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Damn, wow.

1305
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And Roger Ebert refused to do the voice for it.

1306
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
It's an unauthorized Siskel and Ebert video game.

1307
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
His laws.

1308
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
This game rules.

1309
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Is it like Mortal Kombat? Is it bloody?

1310
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Yeah. Yeah, it is very bloody.

1311
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Tapes bleed.

1312
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Yes, the VHSs bleed.

1313
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
What else? Why did that bring the room down, by the way?

1314
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Think about those tapes bleeding.

1315
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Too sad. It was too sad.

1316
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Too sad.

1317
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
You watched it happen in front of you.

1318
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Yeah, we all fell in love with the movies with the VHS tapes.

1319
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
The idea of the shell-case Little Mermaid tape bleeding makes me upset.

1320
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
No.

1321
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Oh, you got me too. You got me with that one too.

1322
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
That's why they had those shell cases, so they didn't get caught and bleed.

1323
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
That was their armor. It was their armor.

1324
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Okay, so let's see what else.

1325
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
The shell cases of the VHS tapes armor. What else about the Mark Twain?

1326
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
We do need to start bringing it back to dock.

1327
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Not to already. It feels crazy.

1328
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Does anyone have the harmonica music cue that plays at the very end of the ride?

1329
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
That would have been on you to bring, Jason.

1330
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Are you talking about the audience?

1331
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Right before I left the house, I watched a ride through and I was like,

1332
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Oh, I really like that harmonica at the end. It's very pleasant.

1333
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Yeah, but you're not going to get to hear it.

1334
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Oh, if you heard it. It's so good. It's so sweet.

1335
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
You know, look, it's an important sternwheeler.

1336
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It's an important... Look, if you...

1337
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Here in Los Angeles, if we want to go on a sternwheeler, that's our option.

1338
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It has to be preserved. There was another one.

1339
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Can you pull up, Senatriz?

1340
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

1341
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
The closest one would have been in Long Beach.

1342
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
It was a boat called the Newport Princess.

1343
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
And I say would have because this happened last year.

1344
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Oh!

1345
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Look at that.

1346
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
It's exciting, yeah.

1347
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Sorry, it's been a violent show. The tapes and now the Newport Princess.

1348
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
For the listener, it's just like...

1349
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
It's sunk. It's sinking.

1350
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Yeah, yeah. Just the top deck is showing and probably not for long.

1351
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
What you can't see is under the water, it's bleeding.

1352
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And I'm drowning.

1353
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
But loving it.

1354
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
To experience that once in your life.

1355
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Sure.

1356
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Amazing. I think maybe there's one more thing to talk about with the Mark Twain and it's this.

1357
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's done this pleasant journey for many years.

1358
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And that narration is pleasant. You see the animals and everything.

1359
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:03,000
But it's only since the 90s has it been used in this elevated, exciting way.

1360
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Which is as a big centerpiece of the finale of Phantasmic.

1361
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
You can pull up a still of that, Mike, if you could.

1362
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Sincerely, how cool is it, this ending?

1363
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
It's such a nice tribute to classic Disneyland.

1364
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
But then they're pulling it into this thing with newer, cooler technology.

1365
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And of course, there is an all-star lineup of characters.

1366
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
All waving ribbons.

1367
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Characters who make no real sense together.

1368
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I mean, the Toy Story gang's on the top.

1369
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
But then there's Cinderella Mice and maybe I see Pumba in there.

1370
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
They're all from different worlds, but they all come together.

1371
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You know, in the shared goal of making a fun ending to a show.

1372
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,000
And it's sad that we're not going to get to see this for a little bit because the dragon burn-up.

1373
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
There's probably not going to be Phantasmic for a little while.

1374
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:13,000
And it makes me sad that there's no way that we could see a big, character-packed, all-star finale to a big show.

1375
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Unless...unless...

1376
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Here's the deal. We don't have that exactly.

1377
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
What we have are a couple piles of masks.

1378
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
And a number of dance ribbons.

1379
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And the way that this all can become a finale, I feel, is with a little bit of help from you, the audience.

1380
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,000
So, alright, let's direct everybody through this.

1381
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Okay, if you want to come up on stage and be part of the big finale, we need four people over here.

1382
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,000
You guys just pick yourselves. Show initiative. Four in this...

1383
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Everyone be good! Be good!

1384
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Four over here, four over here. That's great. Okay, okay. That's perfect.

1385
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And you can just wait on the sides for a second. Watch your step, please.

1386
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And you will see, you guys can look there, you will find your masks and your dance ribbons.

1387
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Pick them up. Be mindful of the stage space. Don't trip on a wire. Don't fall off the stage.

1388
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Wait for the big reveal.

1389
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I think you'll have enough peripheral vision here to get this done.

1390
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
So here we go. Alright, now that you're getting a sense of who...

1391
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Alright, so, ladies and gentlemen, here to close out the show, an all-star lineup of the references we make all the goddamn time!

1392
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Yeah!

1393
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Alright, come on out. Just come on out, everybody, at once.

1394
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Guys, you have streamers too. Mike and Jason, you keep piloting.

1395
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Oh my gosh! It's all your friends.

1396
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1397
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Wow, look, who do we have here? Oh my gosh. I got to see him in...

1398
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Okay, wow, we got William Frawley from I Love Lucy.

1399
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
We got Jimmy Buffett.

1400
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
We got Jimmy Buffett's best friend, Frank Marshall.

1401
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
We all know what he looks like.

1402
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
We got him. Let's save his name.

1403
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
We have Mike's favorite, Armand Shimmerman.

1404
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Wow! Wallace Shawn.

1405
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
They're part of the story that will never stop being told, never ever, we promise.

1406
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Mike Love from the Beach Boys. Give it up, ladies and gentlemen.

1407
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
I missed one. I think over here we got Michael Eisner. That's right.

1408
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
And right here, younger, hotter Michael Eisner.

1409
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Yay!

1410
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Okay, part ways a little bit so we can see the screen. I think there's some more friends showing up.

1411
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Dr. Chase Meridian.

1412
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Armand Shimmerman is quark.

1413
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Wow, another Armand.

1414
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Paging Mr. Morrow.

1415
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Yeah!

1416
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Baby Aladar.

1417
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Gargoyles villain David Zanatos.

1418
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Daniel Roebuck is Grandpa Monster.

1419
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Daniel Roebuck is Jay Leno.

1420
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Johnny Depp and Brian Setzer.

1421
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
No!

1422
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
No, start cheering.

1423
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Michael Eisner wearing a John Cena hat.

1424
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
The new Toontown grass.

1425
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
The grass! The grass!

1426
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
The CVS $4 coupon.

1427
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Oh my God!

1428
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Jason Sheridan with the fake tuxedo.

1429
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Wow!

1430
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
He found it!

1431
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I hope you're all happy.

1432
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
The grand finale is Steamboat John Taffer.

1433
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Yay!

1434
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
We all love John Taffer.

1435
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
All the listeners want an episode about him.

1436
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
But it'll have to wait until later because that is our show.

1437
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
You survived Podcast the Ride.

1438
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Thank you all of you on the stage.

1439
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
You may keep these things.

1440
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
You don't have to leave. You can keep streaming for right now.

1441
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Hey!

1442
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Thanks to Dax, Raven, Misty and everybody here at Dynasty Typewriter.

1443
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Thanks to everybody live streaming at home.

1444
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Thanks Mom and Dad. I will return the wheel.

1445
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Even unless Jason is coming, I'm going to have to take it out of his cold dead hands.

1446
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Thank you so much. This is so much fun. Thanks everybody.

1447
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Thank you!

1448
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Enjoy the rest of your night. Maybe see you at the next show.

1449
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Alright.

1450
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Thanks again for coming out to Dynasty Typewriter. If you got any trash, please take it with you.

1451
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Bye!

1452
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
you
