1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,680
Forever.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,300
Dog.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,500
Warning, the following podcast includes a high octane discussion of ASCAP song registration rules,

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,580
a guest rattling lack of knowledge about DreamWorks animation,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,640
and Jason's spellbinding encounter with a plate of assorted meats and cheeses.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,280
You've heard us talk about the land, now you're just the restaurant.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,840
Zach Reno pulls up a chair at the Three Brewsticks on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,360
We'll be right back.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:55,140
podcast the ride the theme park podcast hosted by three men whose favorite songs are as follows jason sherryden grim-gritting ghosts mike carlson

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,940
blood on the saddle by big al and scott tomorrowland area music loop

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:08,520
Listen to that tomorrowland music loop when I when I write sometimes because it's just me

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,260
Exactly just like nice instrumental kind of like, you know, like mall music but slightly

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,980
Respecified you know, I mean really I like to call it the colloquial name though the the bubble shuffle loop

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,260
Oh, right, of course the first song on it is the song bubble shuffle by jazz guitarist Larry Carlton

15
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,580
You really lit me up you set me off right at the top of this episode Mike

16
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:32,880
Yeah

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,280
it is like I said something like I was I was getting Jason very excited on the Tokyo episode because I was talking about

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,800
Different food stuffs and certain different experiences the rides and the excitement I saw in Jason's face you matched

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,500
I believe when I said tomorrowland area music loop. Yep 80s smooth instrumental jazz

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,780
But but also but it's I like that answer better, but it's in tight competition with another part of me

21
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,060
Oh sure. Yeah, I like we're here to change the world too

22
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,280
But the the song on bad that is at the end of Captain EO also one of my favorite part

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,860
So I would like to keep talking about this. Let's bring the guest in. He's a music man

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,200
Do it you know him from the great podcast off book, this is Zach Reno

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:27,800
I do get the phantasmic theme stuck in my head all the time

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:35,500
It's really good. I think at one point when like lime wire was still a thing. I downloaded just the audio for it to listen to it

27
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,840
particularly there's a part where like heffa lumps and woozles kicks in with like a

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,840
hardcore electric guitars like

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,620
It's like it's legitimately badass

30
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,920
They add lyrics to

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,800
There's a guy and I hate him and that's like just like

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,540
Like he's I don't know what he says, but it's bad. It's like not cool, but the guitar itself is cool

33
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,520
Yeah, I think phantasmic is really great. Although side note when we went out with the crafts

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,520
The Richard Nicholas craft who did the that's from Disneyland Gallery

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,200
They're pretty versed in like music and score and stuff and we brought up

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,780
Phantasmic and they said well, you know and they said to look up the 1988 winter games song done by David Foster

37
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,760
Musicians it's pretty close. Look it up yourselves

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,180
Extremely fantastic. Here's the thing guys

39
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,400
Western music we don't we don't use quarter tones. So we only have so many notes

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,200
Put them in so many orders before I works

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Saying is thank you so much for having me

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:54,880
We've completed the off-book collection we had Jess we've had you on mm-hmm that was that was easy

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,700
Two for two are not Zack's first appearance on the show

44
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,420
Yeah

45
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,680
On the show in fact, I believe it is

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,020
17 appearances specific. Yes, cuz Zach of course saying the city walk

47
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:21,240
Be careful people are gonna cry all over their phones people were oddly emotional about that song as I was why it's first of all

48
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,460
Michael it's a great. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's very very good

49
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,880
It was stuck after recording it was stuck in my head a lot after seeing it

50
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,060
I was walking through city walk you guys the Zen zone was popping off

51
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,240
830 at night

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,120
Sunday Wow

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:47,580
Like like full and I've and I've never seen anyone in the Zen zone before so I feel like one y'all really turned it around

54
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,820
to a walk by the fountain that the

55
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,840
sector keeper the sector keeper passed away

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Well, it's happy ending but yeah

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Not to spoil anything if you haven't heard the saga, but yeah, he's in a better place

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,640
He's fully dead has been for a while. Yes, but

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,520
Well, that's boy. That's that's nice to hear at night

60
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,400
It is odd going to use the water coffins and in the dark. It's weird. It's real weird

61
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,920
Yeah, did you find yourself kind of just hanging around stores kind of singing it like half under your breath?

62
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,440
But hoping that maybe you get discovered

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Stars born me

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Recognized from your you're very popular podcast

65
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Recognized from our from singing the song on our pod

66
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm trying to think of like what the phrase would have to be that I could like casually just say

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,300
Hoping that someone to not be too obvious. I think I'll be like, oh a place where Oakland Raiders merches sold

68
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,500
Outside the store

69
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,820
I don't think I real I don't think I re clocked that there was such an

70
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:03,540
Enormous hot topic there. It is a lyric in the song and I don't think I've ever realized that there was one there before

71
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,880
And I didn't until my wife Nicole was like, what is this? Oh, it's a massive hot topic. Hmm

72
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,140
Yeah, there's look there's a lot of stuff there that a lot of people don't realize and we just were doing our civic duty by

73
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,400
I can't believe you guys

74
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,300
It's truly I when I describe it out loud now, it's wonderful

75
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,800
I'm so happy you did but I also cannot believe that you did one

76
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,040
Thank you for contributing to it in such a wonderful way

77
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:34,500
Do you feel like you were like channeling any particular influence or vibe in your vocal performance?

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,120
Yeah, well I had direction from from the composer and it was supposed to be

79
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,560
Mike what did you say? You said you said do it I can look at you said do it

80
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:53,520
Intense but also sincere it was not it was meant to sound like someone trying very like to say very stupid things

81
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,920
But to do it as if it was like a very

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,440
Beautiful pose doing it more. You don't want to be don't like power ballad D

83
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,120
Like like poor man's Jack Black like you're trying to do it band or something. Yeah

84
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,380
Would have been okay

85
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,520
I said poor man's Jack Black doing intense vocals a lot of fun. There's

86
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

87
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,340
I'm looking through my directions and I'm not sure what did I say here?

88
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,500
That was that was the vibe that I got it was think you may have just been like I know what to do

89
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,320
You sure did it was beautiful and now I feel like I'm I was trying to think of a good

90
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,920
Analog like not the right it's it's like you're this you're the Celine Dion

91
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,980
and Mike is the

92
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,380
The Diane Warren agenda flipped both of you

93
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,160
But I'm like, you know to be around the songwriter and the singer for the first time right?

94
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,100
Electric I'm happy to give you that experience. You know what? I think it was I think if I was channeling anyone

95
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,880
It's probably it was like a matchbox 20 years

96
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,440
Yeah, what feels right?

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,860
Can you help me?

98
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,500
One thing about this is this is not necessarily theme park related one of my favorite things about

99
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,240
Zack ever is that he said that and this is gonna make Scott very upset and I just realized it now

100
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,380
He thinks that counting crows are a much better band than the Beach Boys. Oh

101
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,160
Why are you putting those together because Mike asked me

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,340
Well, you know, I love counting crows this unironically my favorite band

103
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,480
Oh, Mike was basically just being like better than this and I was like, yeah

104
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,920
For me. Yeah hundred percent. Well for me is a fine qualifier

105
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,840
I get that that that that helps me out and you're also making my wife happy cuz she hates the Beach Boys

106
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,980
It's a big our big our literal biggest difference is I'm a real Beach Boys worshiper and she hates them

107
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,220
It's important to also know that I don't know anything about music. It's a very it's a very

108
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,080
Very music music. Thank you

109
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
Yeah, I don't know like I don't know anything about

110
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,960
Bands like I had to say Matchbox 20 because I didn't remember that

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:09,140
Thomas was his name until I was saying it and even then I wasn't super confident until this moment when you all affirmed it

112
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,220
That was the name of the singer of that band. That is also a 20 year old band. Sure

113
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,600
All the reference points at the moment on the table are pretty including Celine Dion and Diane Warren

114
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,460
I'm no hipper than anybody and the Beach Boys and Larry Carlton

115
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:32,440
I'm sounding like a very old man right now. Yeah, the most recent artists are Mike Carlson and Zach Reno

116
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,660
What recent music am I into? Yeah crossing Reno?

117
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:46,440
This is a song from this podcast all about city walk that's my podcast that I'm on so I'm into that

118
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,780
People I saw somebody today. We're like they want it on iTunes. They want us to sell it on iTunes

119
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,600
I don't even know how to start. I don't know

120
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,160
It's very easy. Okay

121
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,120
Point of time it was not it's well it is now. I mean it depends on I mean, how do I register with ASCAP?

122
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
I need to like join and then like you need to get

123
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,600
ASCAP is ASCAP is music ASCAP is the one that is

124
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,740
Like $25 to join for forever or something. Oh, is that right?

125
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,720
It's a union that we're talking about by the way for anyone who doesn't know ASCAP is a composers union. It's basically

126
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,800
It's a one-time fee. It's very very easy to join it

127
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,360
All of the composer unions are except for one and I forget the name of it

128
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,280
And yeah, so you join that then you go to like tunecore.com and you're like, here's my track

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm putting it up. They say where do you want it? You say iTunes and Spotify

130
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,420
They say do you also want it on zoom and you say no, I don't

131
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,660
They say here like five other streaming services you have never heard of some in Latin America

132
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,680
Do you want it on those and then you think like well Latin America is a huge listening audience

133
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,760
I want it to be on Latin American Spotify and then you still say no and you just put it on iTunes

134
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:10,060
Wow you've done this journey and then the cash comes rolling in and then the cash comes rolling in you live off those residuals from

135
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,420
That one track because you know Spotify famously pays artists right very very well. Of course

136
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,520
Yes, our podcast is available on Spotify and we're not quite sure how that happens

137
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,920
so ours is too and I know many people listen to it on Spotify and

138
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,980
As far as I know we've never been paid through it. Maybe earwolf has and they're just like keeping that money, but also I

139
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,660
Truly don't know. It's all very confused. How did these things pop up and why it's there's nothing

140
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,740
Feeling we probably all have all the time like what something I did is here that's something I would get paid for

141
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,660
Absolutely not never all right. I'll never mind

142
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,020
But whatever it's a hey, it's if these things are out there

143
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:02,860
Anyway, I mean enough talk about the biz

144
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,500
Now the listeners at home know how to sign up for

145
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,240
Sign up for s cap but how to

146
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:19,460
Once signed up get their music out there. So any aspiring musicians you weren't expecting to get a tip today, but you did

147
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,160
One for you lander

148
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,700
Landr.com will master all of your tracks with robots for very cheap and is it good? Yeah

149
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:36,260
Really than I can do I'm not a man. I don't know mastering should I remaster the song Citywalk song through lander calm?

150
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,560
I don't think you need to pull vocals too much out of that mix do you it's pretty I jacked the vocals up

151
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,900
I had a lot of compression on them. Oh if you want to maybe it's very cheap. Wow we could talk about yeah

152
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,980
Well, we'll talk Michael project is Mike a better

153
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,260
Producer than Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I don't know

154
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,160
Question for the ages put it up to the audience. Yes

155
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,340
So look Zach your music guy you love phantasmic

156
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:11,100
Today we're talking about three broomsticks the restaurant from the Hogsmeade part of

157
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,360
Harry Potter land. Yeah, we kind of did the overview with Jess, but it felt like yes

158
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,500
She did with you coming on it's like well Zach's gonna want to talk about Harry Potter

159
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:30,020
Right only do you want to talk about Harry Potter? I mean I could have and it's also like I grew up going to

160
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,280
I'm from Santa Barbara, California

161
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,600
So I'm at it was you know an hour and a half away sure and there were I want to say

162
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,020
Like eight to ten years of my life where we went once a year as a family

163
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,920
So I went to do that a lot. So were you okay?

164
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,440
I mean you like fun and we I know you're like when I think of you

165
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,460
I think of like a person who likes whimsy a person who likes fantasy and fun

166
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,040
Were you obsessed with it as a kid or was it just a thing you did once in a while?

167
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:02,940
I was never Disney obsessed, but I loved Disneyland right and ironically unabashedly

168
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,920
Oh, I think I still really really really like Disneyland. I haven't been in a couple years

169
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,360
but

170
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,880
You are correct in terms of things that

171
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,460
Spark my soul as it were being in a place that like has a castle and is

172
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,760
Beautifully manicured and themed and we'll get to talking about this

173
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,780
But I am more about theme park elements that I am about rides themselves

174
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,660
Well, I mean you're in the right zone

175
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,760
I think cuz we're not we like the rides too, but we like rides with a lot of robots

176
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,300
We like fake rocks. Yeah, and we like yeah, that's the type of stuff

177
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,660
We like to obsess about and I think that's what cuz I I've all I've only been to Magic Mountain once and I had a

178
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,720
Good time and I did you know X2 which was terrifying and once was enough, but it was I'm glad I did it

179
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,140
I had a good time. I like roller coasters, but I would take I will take a not as good roller

180
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,820
Take thunder Mountain over X to any day of short, right?

181
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,700
I mean we just did Thunder Mountain and we all declared it a perfect ride. There was nothing that could be done

182
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:11,980
It's got with a dynamite in its mouth. It's truly wonderful an icon an icon of the park

183
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,000
Mark or any tattoo if I'm not mistaken. Oh is that right?

184
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,860
Yes, I think we need to have it. Oh, yeah, that's crazy. Wow. So yeah you so yeah, we're just while we're talking Disneyland

185
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,580
So top right like top rides at Disney real quick top places top zone areas

186
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,820
As a kid

187
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,980
It was definitely

188
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,200
Peter Pan's flight was number one which you mentioned as a possible topic

189
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,680
I did bring it up and you could I feel like you could you have the bill to play Peter Pan in a movie

190
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,140
Of course never on the stage only women play it on the stage

191
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,620
We've talked about Mary Martin a few times I think on this podcast

192
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,200
That doesn't surprise me it was an early one where you and I were talking about how our moms made sure we knew who Mary

193
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,220
Martin was and saying I did it come up because

194
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:05,420
It was that the Sandy Duncan episode we know all the pans who's the other pans tell me that my freak

195
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,800
There's another one. I don't know all the pan Robin Williams. No, I'm talking about the musical

196
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,680
There's Mary Martin and then the other big Oh Alison Williams

197
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,920
No, the biggest the one who looms biggest of all from the NBC live production

198
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,980
Featuring Christopher Walken as Captain Hook. Well, this is like a repressed memory coming back to me

199
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:32,100
It feels like a lifetime ago, I think it was only like two mm-hmm. What's everybody's favorite live musical?

200
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,580
I can't believe the last five years. Yeah, there's been a lot of them now

201
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:43,280
I haven't watched all of them so I was because I love Greece. Okay, I've said a lot

202
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,120
That's a weird thing with me I

203
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,940
Do not like Greece regular but I so that's how good the live one was it

204
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,320
Overshot that I specifically really dislike Greece. I was just so impressed by production value

205
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,780
I'm gonna be crazy as a person that does a lot of musical theater

206
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:06,800
I have not seen most of the the new live I've seen like parts of hairspray

207
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,020
Mm-hmm cool parts of errors. I filmed at the Universal lot in fact, they utilized the lot in a fun way

208
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:18,500
Yeah, that what I did like what I saw that one I liked I only saw the second act of Jesus Christ Superstar

209
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,460
But I thought that one was good. Yeah, that seemed pretty solid

210
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,600
I think it did very well. Were you in play? Were you in musicals?

211
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,320
Mm-hmm, and what would be what have you been in? What would I know you're from?

212
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,260
You would know me from nothing unless you were watching community theater

213
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,200
No, I did I did I started the first well my

214
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,400
Elementary school made every sixth grader be in a musical every year

215
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,460
We did like a kid's version of Into the Woods

216
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,660
Which basically means you stop at the halfway point before it gets dark

217
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,980
Oh friends friends at a neighboring school did that when I was growing up and it didn't occur

218
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,260
I didn't really know that musical it wasn't until I was in college and learned about that musical

219
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,500
I'm like wait, so it's just the first half where it ends happily before all the fucked up song time

220
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,740
For children, yeah for sure. Yeah, we didn't even do the straight-up kids version

221
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,540
They I think because it was probably only I don't know 45 minutes long or whatever

222
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:17,880
They were also like princes were singing country songs like one of the princess thing. She's right on the money

223
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:25,400
For some reason and we all did a square dance because like it was it was part of the program was we I think as like

224
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,900
Bizzette we're learning a dance to do together as well. It was wild

225
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,480
So then in junior high I did a hello dolly and kiss me Kate and then high school I did

226
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,480
pirates of penzance lame is fiddler on the roof and

227
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,660
Anything goes in outer space because we had to take the set to Edinburgh Scotland and we needed a reason to have the scat be inflatable

228
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:59,200
Guys I could talk for hours about just that by itself and then in college I did you're in town

229
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,300
Westside story

230
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,320
Anything goes again

231
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
Normal style

232
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:11,340
Time me boat and maybe something else, but that's all I'm remembering right now. Wow amazing buddy work. You have a favorite from there

233
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,260
Doing it. Mmm. I don't know. Oh, I did

234
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,760
Okay, so there is a lesser-known

235
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,680
Because it's bad

236
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:25,260
Sequel to you're a good man Charlie Brown, but it was just called Snoopy, which is a bunch of dumb

237
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,920
Bullshit that should not have been turned. It was like a couple of good songs in it, but largely

238
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,120
It's like you're a good man Charlie Brown is pretty much wall-to-wall

239
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,480
Good songs and Snoopy has like a couple

240
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:43,620
Okay, but I did I did you're a good man Charlie Brown also before doing Snoopy and that was real fun

241
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,120
Oh sure enjoyed that one

242
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,820
I'm a noted fan of at knots when they're the little shows in Camp Snoopy

243
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:58,860
Where like Charlie Brown is a Frankenstein head and they like they do thriller and they but they simplify the dance to just be

244
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:06,020
Like they spin around my mother and this is the reason she like my family never went to Knott's Berry Farm because

245
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,540
Apparently, this is a story we were always told and I assume it's true

246
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:15,700
They used to have a sign outside that said no dogs. No Jews. I don't know when they're talking about

247
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,680
Way way way back unless this is apocryphal and this is just something that my mother heard

248
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,920
But she definitely said no, this is the reason we will never go to Knott's Berry Farm

249
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,660
I mean not sis coming up not sis in its original form is a hundred years old

250
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,760
Okay, their court they they are coming up on their hundred year anniversary in in a couple years

251
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,980
The fact that y'all hadn't heard of this makes me wonder if it's real. I wonder the other hand there was a lot of weird

252
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,000
Not says a very

253
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,220
Interesting background Walter not as a very famous

254
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,160
Conservative man and that he had like a weird center in the park where you would go and learn conservative values

255
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,360
Okay, but like John Birch Society like so crazy

256
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,380
if anyone can confirm the or or

257
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,340
Disapprove this sign existed that would be very interesting to me because that was what I was always told

258
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,240
Was that not had this sign and I feel like there is this weird lore?

259
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,820
I mean like you guys would know this better than me about Walt Disney and anti-semitism, too

260
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,880
Well the Disney stuff. Yeah, there is I mean everyone is also very anti-semitic

261
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:32,720
To some sort of there was so much anti communist stuff and right back in the day and and a lot of that was

262
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,080
legitimate fears of communism and then a lot of it was coded anti-semitism someone let me know if there really was a no dogs

263
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,020
No, geez sign it not sparrif I mean like we would

264
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,960
There's some truth to some I bet there's truth to something in there

265
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,160
But there's some thread that you go like always very conservative man

266
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,760
And he wanted because they have a chapel on the grounds as well

267
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,600
So maybe there is some there is some obviously religious only element there, but I want I wonder maybe I'm so curious

268
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,280
Maybe I don't know we would have seen I think we would have seen it

269
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,800
They are not selling that in their throwback merchandise

270
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,220
Replicant no dogs no juice

271
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,380
No, no a no Jews sign that doesn't sound too Nazi

272
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:25,300
That was sitting there because I found myself over the years

273
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:32,200
Describing something with a nots vibe as being Nazi and I've done this in public places

274
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,220
Out loud and Aaron has had to say

275
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,040
Do you realize what you're saying?

276
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,760
You have to get that word out of your vocabulary

277
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,740
I believe we're talking about plays and musicals and stuff

278
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,320
I believe Jason played a Nazi when he was like 10 years old. I played a Nazi spy in a

279
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,060
Children's musical was music or something else. No, it was okay

280
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,080
There is I think the company is called and I think I've talked about this on the show before there's a company

281
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,240
I think it's called pioneer drama services. They churn out all of these

282
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,320
dust pioneer drama services

283
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,740
No, it is not but they churn out all of these musicals specifically for like middle school age kids because there's like

284
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,260
30 to 40 characters. Yeah

285
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,780
one character always tap dances because inevitably they'll be a

286
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,380
Kid who has taken tap

287
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,260
and

288
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,240
a

289
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,600
Handful of people get solos and but then there's also a lot of extra part

290
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,640
You know a lot of one-line roles and stuff

291
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:43,520
And so the first play I ever did was play called Kilroy was here and it was about a USO in New York City and

292
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,060
I played a roving hypnotist that was an entertainer at the club, but he was also feeding

293
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,520
He was a Nazi spy. He was like

294
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,420
But and they like they made me

295
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,520
I got it because they're like and everyone when you're auditioning

296
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,700
try to do a German accent for some of the lines and I

297
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,540
Got the German accent down, but it wasn't until like a month before the play

298
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,320
They're like wait

299
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,860
It doesn't really make sense that he would be doing the German accent

300
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm doing the hypnotism accent

301
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,140
So then they're like can you try and do a British accent and I like tried my best and God knows what it sounded like

302
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:29,360
But then in the scenes when I'm meeting with the other Nazis then I'm talking like, you know talking like this and the the

303
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,280
TH's sound like V's and you're very good. That's it. Yeah, that's pretty much it

304
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,000
I kept having to watch they're like, oh go watch this movie

305
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,080
I think it's called IQ and it's about it's from the 90s and it's about

306
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:52,840
And he tries to help like some young couple fall in love yes, and they're like, well he speaks in German

307
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,020
He's got a German accent. That's a new wrinkle. I had not heard that part of the story before

308
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,600
By the way ten years old years old and I have no memory of this movie

309
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,300
Even though I probably watched it like five times to try and get the accent down and I like learned my line

310
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:14,440
I like had my lines down Pat you're emulating Walter Mathau like the original Homer Simpson. Oh, yes

311
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,880
The original yeah Dan Caslon is original Homer voice is very math

312
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,980
I'll ask each kind of bark talks like this more than he does how he would eventually sound this is madness

313
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,880
Let's keep on our patreon content I want to hear a reading of

314
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,580
Your scenes from I think I bet I will look at Christmas and see if I have the script

315
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,440
I know I have a copy of the full script. I've begged you

316
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,340
Where is a video because I have a full script of a play that you did when you were ten years old

317
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,120
Haven't done 30 plays in musicals. Okay, we hold on to these precious memories

318
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,940
Well, we were supposed to give the scripts back but that year

319
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:03,060
But and I did but that year because it was my first one my family got so invested

320
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,200
My mom photocopied the whole script so she could run lines with me

321
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,980
And so I always had this copy and like a keepsake box

322
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,120
But Mike really wants me to bring back the video tape because they would be

323
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,520
I have a three camera shoot

324
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:25,920
Edited but I have this V it's the only copy I have so I have to figure out how to

325
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,420
Because I'm so afraid of traveling with it if it gets damaged or I guess I could get it

326
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,620
Duplicated at Walmart, but yes, they hand it off to a teenager at Walmart film off the TV for now

327
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,700
It'll be it won't be perfect, but I'll get the idea across

328
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:47,740
That's actually not a bad idea that literally didn't occur to me that I could put a little iPod

329
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,820
Hey, and there's ways to hook to VCRs up. I don't want to get back into ASCAP

330
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:59,040
Just list a process territory, but you can hook up two VCRs and do a little dub

331
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,300
Oh, I didn't even think about what I used to because I made

332
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,020
Copies of three driven three camera shot local plays from my high school

333
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,600
So I was the media crew so you the actor and me the media crew need to put our hands together

334
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,060
We can okay piece of art back to life

335
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,080
And traveling with a copy I would feel a lot better and Mike you do have a VCR here

336
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,040
So yeah, what is the this is a good question for you guys?

337
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:31,620
What is the Disney property that has not been turned into a stage musical that should be?

338
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,720
Oh interesting. That's a great question captainio flushed out by other Michael Jackson songs and the Tomorrowland music loop

339
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,520
Yeah, new lyrics Michael Jackson captainio jukebox music. That was another I was in leader of the pack the Ellie Greenwich musical

340
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,200
Which is all Brill building songs and like Phil Spector is a character in it

341
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,080
There's like hardly any story because it's mostly like 30 like to do Ron Ron and

342
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,560
Going to the chapel and sure my captainio is the best answer except for my answer

343
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,140
Which is of course country bear jamboree live on Broadway

344
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,220
Oh, man country jamboree live on Broadway human beings in bear

345
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,660
Was and this is a movie not a ride, but was the Robin Hood the Fox. Oh, yeah

346
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,060
Oh

347
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,540
Full music

348
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:30,120
It's just most on stage it would be like the whistling for two hours

349
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,720
You have to you have to be whistling mostly Allen and Dale whistling. Yeah. Yeah, you would have to flush it out

350
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,780
But that's good. You want to have right things if you had a country bird jamboree

351
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,180
Definitely have to write some more songs

352
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,940
The great American songbook and just have them sing a lot or like Delta bluesy kind of stuff brother

353
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,280
We're now a lot of the songs are abbreviated versions though in the country bear

354
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,960
So I think if you maybe just did the full versions of all of them

355
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,240
I think you guys should do a live the three of you should do a live country bear jamboree

356
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:07,240
I'll start right now. We will stop doing this

357
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,860
A live country bear jamboree show and then seven years later we open off Broadway

358
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,660
It takes and it's literally all of our time up until that point

359
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,420
That's pretty good suit and it's over. Does it? Yeah

360
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:32,540
They wait for us to start the performance then send in lawyers and you can get around it you just call it like

361
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:39,840
Good old good old bears sing a long time jamber good jamberoo. Jamberoo. That's all you have to

362
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,120
2025

363
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:52,380
Jason what was your answer? Did you answer? Oh, well doesn't have to be parks. I realized your question was Disney

364
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,480
Well, it shouldn't be in parks because I was trying to theme it for this podcast

365
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,180
There is Disney's open the issue of Robin Hood the Fox, right? Although I believe there is

366
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,760
The walk around characters, yeah, yeah

367
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,660
Chip and Dale feel like an also an obvious

368
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,780
They're like their performers Chip and Dale like be a Hope and Crosby style buddy comedy

369
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,160
Yeah

370
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:21,960
But that was the rumor that was gonna be Mickey and Roger Rabbit hopes in open cross. Oh, yes, that's true

371
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,400
When a dark horse back this was like I think it might have been one of the first movies I saw in theaters

372
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,980
Oliver and company with the cat

373
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah, with the cat very many dogs in the one cat. Yeah and little cat and the Billy Joel dog

374
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,660
a lot of songs in there the best

375
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:48,200
Billy Joel song it's a great song. It's yes. That's also a great just like that animation sequence of that

376
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,620
that song is so great because they're like walking through construction zones and

377
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,620
He he gets the like sausages around his neck and I love that as a kid

378
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,840
I don't know why that was so memorable to me

379
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,060
But he stole sausages and I thought that man this dog is the coolest dog. Yeah, cool as hell

380
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:13,560
I'm still I get a little like weirdly emotional from the Huey Lewis song that opens the film

381
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:23,820
I think is I think maybe the first movie I ever saw in the theater as a child was that movie

382
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,760
So I think I have some just like weird baby brain

383
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,080
I'd block it from my memory, but I just remember I saw Tarzan live on Broadway. Oh

384
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,380
Yeah, so long people swinging around sure. There's a man turn off the dark mostly swinging

385
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,600
I want to say directly up and back down

386
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,080
Mostly holding on to vines that would go up and down

387
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,900
Jumping from the third balcony. I didn't see it that does exist, right? Yeah, it did

388
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,520
Yeah, that was one of Disney's like they had the big hit with Beauty and the Beast and then again with Lion King

389
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,920
And I think was Tarzan like the third Broadway almost pause when they were doing

390
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:05,140
No, I'm we're dining if I saw right. I must have doesn't matter. Sorry. What's this podcast?

391
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:12,240
I love this musical area that we're in though, and I want to make all of these things happen sure

392
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,500
Yeah, I mean, maybe we need to revisit this at some point and like just say kind of our thoughts

393
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,260
We need to like flesh out how these would work right exactly

394
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,940
Yeah, well, I let me I'll bring it back around Zach. What do you think about?

395
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,840
Although there's quite a lot of music and the Harry Potter stuff in the parks. How do you feel about that?

396
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,360
I mean you get the movie soundtrack in a lot of the stores and the three broomsticks and yeah the Frog

397
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,080
Choir and we ever seen recordings of the Frog choir. I've never actually caught it live and I've tried multiple times

398
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,520
Yeah, I just never seen it. Mm-hmm. So that's my boring answer to question

399
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,000
I think that the way that music functions

400
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,800
Inside Wizarding World at least LA is the one I've ever been to is very good

401
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,960
Yeah, it for the most part

402
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,600
there's only one place where I've heard sound bleed from a different section of the park and it's the very very back of

403
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,440
Did it did it do three broomsticks, it's the outdoor section of three broomsticks, it's right on the edge of

404
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,400
Springfield yeah, yeah, but weirdly the sound that I was not Springfield it was I was hearing the like Jurassic Park theme

405
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,440
It was just there was some some section walkway that park is just playing like the generic universal

406
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,020
Tracks maybe the tram entrances right there. So you're getting like hooray for Hollywood

407
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,800
But I think that I think that and I was I said this to Nicole if we were leaving for your booms

408
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,260
Just because we were there the other night

409
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:41,380
That the level at which the music is playing in that restaurant is fantastic because it's pervasive

410
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,680
You can hear it really clearly all the time, but it's not so loud that you ever feel like you need to scream over it

411
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,720
It's it's almost a little haunting like I have found myself at the three broomsticks in a weird mood

412
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,660
And then catch the right part of the music and a wash in melancholy

413
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,940
No, it's it's

414
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,760
That's a really often. Are you melancholy?

415
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,380
0% of the time I'm only ever living I'm only ever in a

416
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,260
100% joyous

417
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,880
I see I'll see what you're saying Jason in that like not it's definitely not all

418
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,560
Celebratory super up happy music. No, it's not it is more melancholy parts of the score certainly

419
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,300
Mm-hmm, but it's still it you know, it's fun. It adds to the magic

420
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,400
And you know, I'll say as we start getting into it

421
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,540
I went up there with my wife also on on Friday and we had a wonderful time a long conversation

422
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:40,960
Like we we you know had a wonderful beer there that the the custom beer they have up there is wonderful

423
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,440
We like whatever the Scottish ale one is which is

424
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:56,020
Hogshead yes, I had the red one. I think that was the first one brewed exclusively for

425
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,800
What we're doing are we supposed to do that we said yeah

426
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,700
Yeah, we did say that we do we started we do it in a tease at the top and part of the design

427
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:10,140
There is so that if we get way off course, then we don't write we did pre record us saying

428
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,280
What it was so that if it isn't an hour until we get to the main topic

429
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:22,660
That's sort of the design but hey, but I still like announcing it three broomsticks

430
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:28,940
Yeah, I know this is a great topic idea like this this within

431
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,720
Wizarding world because I think you know sometimes we pick these topics and you end up feeling

432
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,540
Sort of rushed honestly and within within with Jess. You're a comedic partner

433
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,960
You know she it's like she clearly could talk about

434
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,200
Wizarding world for 10 hours each individual part of it. I mean you there's

435
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,140
two right I mean there's not much to talk about with like flight of the hippogriff, but but

436
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:59,960
Forbidden journey you could talk about easily for an entire episode and we will and you will I'm sure then you have the wand

437
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,520
Ceremony then you have all of the many many carts and

438
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,120
Stores in there and then you have the three broomsticks, which is I think I think

439
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:18,360
Mmm, my either favorite or second favorite part even even compared to the the ride. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're not wrong

440
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,060
I don't that's not an insane opinion and not because I don't like the ride but because just for me

441
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,540
the appeal of a theme park is to is the immersive element of it and

442
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,500
the idea of eating in the three broomsticks is

443
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,840
Better immersion than the actual being on the ride with the possible exception of the line rate

444
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,240
up to the ride because

445
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:47,140
Walk because once you're on the ride you're like on a bench that's flying around and you're somehow part of the Harry Potter

446
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:53,380
Cannon at some point. I guess this happened. Well, you're taking an enchanted bench. Yeah, the famous Harry Potter

447
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,980
It was bench where they put muggles on a bench and they fly it

448
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,840
I don't like being called out that I'm a muggle. I think that's I think

449
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:08,040
I think that's not but I know you're saying cuz it makes you feel less special because what you want really is the full

450
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,040
Experience that I've never read the books. I've seen all the movies. I like

451
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,240
The episode I meant to talk to you about having I read the books. Yeah, so a bad reader

452
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm a slow reader audiobooks from an asshole who can't read who does the audio book who reads someone really good

453
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,240
I don't know just listens to them all in loop every year

454
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:31,080
Right, I should do the audiobooks of Harry Potter because I like all the mythology. I like it's all right up my alley

455
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,940
But it does seem like what you would want is you want to go in there and you want to feel special you want to

456
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,520
Feel like you're getting off the Hogwarts Express. You're going to live in this school

457
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,300
That's you're getting away from your bad parents or your bad caretakers

458
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,340
That's what you should feel. You shouldn't feel like oh shit. They're mad at me for being a tourist here

459
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,020
We're all dressed like shit

460
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:56,360
The wizards here look cool. I look like shit and shorts and a t-shirt

461
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,000
I happen to be there when they were doing some I think like

462
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,120
9 and 3 for dress to the 9 and 3 4th ball or something

463
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,480
It's one of those things where just fans who are very very fancy dress up in like I think I want to say

464
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,840
1930s

465
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,860
40s garb, I don't know and just kind of hung out in Harry Potter

466
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,320
Period appropriate to that era in the park

467
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,080
So it was it wasn't like the school uniform

468
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,980
It would be like you were a fancy wizard around the time of the movies that are coming out now, right?

469
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,020
With a level of nerd that you like what is your level of nerd?

470
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,640
I guess what I'm asking like do you have a rope? Do you own a robe?

471
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,500
Do you own whatever your house is which I believe I know is Slytherin is Slytherin

472
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,880
I am also a fellow Slytherin. Yeah, let's just review two Hufflepuffs over here on the couch

473
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,660
We got two Hufflepuffs. Yeah, I didn't remember

474
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,040
Thanks for knowing. I also I double-checked

475
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,560
My Patronus is a st. Bernard dog

476
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,740
My Patronus was my wand is an elmwood with unicorn hair core

477
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,180
11 inch and quite bendy flexibility not terribly interesting that one

478
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:13,500
But I love that my Patronus was a big floppy dog. That's very good. Yeah, do you what is your Patronus?

479
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,500
I've taken

480
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:22,680
So because I'm very interested in exploring the Pottermore website to a lot of depth. I have multiple accounts on there

481
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,080
What because the questions are so like you can take the test two times

482
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,400
Answer truthfully every time and get a completely different set of questions both time you've done it

483
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:40,560
So I've gotten both nightjar, which is a bird. Okay, and then rat which is a rat

484
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:48,840
As to what kind it is and then I went up and looked like that at the matrix breakdown about how to

485
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:54,360
Get it to do all of the like all of the animals that it can give you and all the ones that you

486
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,420
Based on what choices you make?

487
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,880
And I was like one question away from Fox which was a bummer for me because that's your favorite

488
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,520
That's what I would have thought it would have been

489
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,600
But you know, we're all just like asked a butterflies wing between a fox and a rat

490
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:17,480
So you're a nerd who goes on Pottermore and tries to get every possible combination and tries to almost beat the site

491
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,080
You're trying to figure out how to get what you want

492
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,560
so the first time I like a real Slytherin is from what I

493
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,460
First time I got sorted I got sorted into Slytherin and I was very

494
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,900
Shocked because I had always thought that I was a Ravenclaw

495
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,700
So I went back on to Pottermore again to cheat my way into Ravenclaw and realized like no

496
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:43,820
What a Slytherin should be it would be doing it the sites the sites got you pegged

497
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:51,440
Which is crafty Ravenclaw is crafty or their hard work no Hufflepuff is hard workers, but also very lazy

498
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,800
Slytherin is shrewd

499
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,400
Okay, I'm rude which is weirdly like I feel like look is it loaded term?

500
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:06,800
Yeah shrewd feels like a little bit. Well, there's a tape is the most famous right Slytherin professor Snape

501
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,620
Merlin is the most famous

502
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,060
Wow

503
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,420
Talk about people that got like

504
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,860
Retroactively added to Harry Potter Canada, but yes

505
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:25,720
Snape also in in hmm. How did Merlin get added? He would have been sort of the same either. He was what piece of

506
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,820
Perfect answer. Oh, you mean

507
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,980
added

508
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,840
Like someone

509
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,180
Witter and she's like

510
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:41,700
When you get and I'm sorry I just just like what piece of media is this available Pottermore? Oh, it's just this is Pottermore

511
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,940
Laura which is all canon because it's all written by her but it's it's

512
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,900
When you get sorted into your house you get a welcome letter from your house

513
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:55,020
Which is another reason why I took it multiple times because I was interested in like what happens when you get into Hufflepuff like

514
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,360
What happens to get into Ravenclaw?

515
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,980
What are the things that they write for you?

516
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,920
Because they also all shit talk the other houses

517
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,700
Which is very funny to me like Ravenclaw doesn't shit clock shit talk Ravenclaw Ravenclaw's

518
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:13,480
Prefect's letter but the other houses all do and one of the things in the Slytherin letter is that like Mervin was

519
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,060
Merlin was a Ravenclaw Wow

520
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,220
So Merlin as a famous he's a public domain wizard at this point

521
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,380
I guess so you can add him so she could add like everyone who's in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

522
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,400
Into the Potter universe now like Frankenstein could be in yeah, he could be a wizard

523
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,880
He could not be he could just be a different bad guy. So that's interesting. I didn't know Merlin was so Merlin

524
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,560
Is a Grindelwald collaborator?

525
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,500
Merlin was kind of in this series already

526
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,080
Okay, because there is an award that Dumbledore has which is order of Merlin first class

527
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,940
I believe it's like an organization within the wizarding world

528
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,840
So Merlin I guess had already been lightly put into

529
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:07,400
Harry Potter canon at that point, but they had never gone into any detail about what it was or or who or what or what?

530
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,900
Do you think the wizard who walked around the City Walk nightclub wizards?

531
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,140
Is he in this is he the same as Merlin or is he like a trickster?

532
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,760
Since he's ripping off Merlin to some extent so he's and I don't we don't know much about

533
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,000
Three seconds in a sizzle reel, but I like to just add him officially to the Potter more cannon

534
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,980
Yeah, we're putting him in you know, I did see that was a little bit someone was dressed

535
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:42,380
I think as Grindelwald and I think as Harry Potter Grindelwald, which is Johnny Depp

536
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,360
Which is a weird costuming choice to be making

537
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,980
Like Disney is

538
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:57,440
Looking into rebooting the Pirates franchise like that's the rumor that Disney like the Pirates movies are super successful internationally

539
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,920
But they want to divest from Johnny Depp where it's more brothers. It's just stuck with them down for years

540
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,700
Isn't is the poster right now is the poster?

541
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,120
This the guy with his back turned is that Johnny Depp? Yes, so they are keeping him in the shadows

542
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:18,740
Yeah, kind of but then it was also really is the word crimes are so big

543
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:26,880
I mean the crimes of Grindelwald are sneaking dogs into Australia and also domestic abuse

544
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,300
Buried the lead there

545
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:37,380
And then all the I mean cuz Grindelwald like the Hitler of the Wizarding World straight right the straight-up Hitler analogy in a weird

546
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,560
world in which Dumbledore and

547
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,860
Hitler have a weird

548
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,320
Gay relationship do you huh?

549
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,280
Does that happen somewhere as a relationship with Dumbledore and and

550
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,840
Grindelwald because Dumbledore again, this is post-canon

551
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,980
But did JK Rowling does this she releases like a lot of stuff that like the whole Nagini thing

552
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:07,160
Which I guess I can't get too much into with y'all because none of us have seen the movie and whatever but Nagini is

553
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,920
Voldemort's

554
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,740
big snake big movies pet question mark, but in

555
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:20,540
The new movie that's coming out Nagini is a character that is a woman that becomes a snake which is

556
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,500
Problematic for a lot of reasons, but I guess it depends on how they deal with it. We'll see

557
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:30,680
I think it was also that that they they added the the story

558
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:37,060
The story is sourced from an Asian culture and they just kind of cherry picked a lot of it

559
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,500
And the snake story is the Nagini

560
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,520
Some of the Nagini

561
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:49,440
The lore of a person cursed to be a snake and that's most of the Harry Potter magic is pulled from some culture or another like

562
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,900
JK Rowling also got in a lot of hot water when they released the American Hogwarts

563
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,660
Oh, yeah, right. I remember this.

564
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,280
Ilvermorny is like these in I believe Salem, Massachusetts

565
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,940
Makes sense. I believe is where the school is. I don't remember but

566
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:14,020
All of the houses in that school are based off of Native American iconography and it wasn't treated with

567
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,740
necessarily the most like

568
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,180
respect or reverence or even like

569
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,660
I guess they're hmm. It's been a while since I've gone looked at it

570
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,560
That one is stranger to me because like yeah, you said it in Salem

571
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,660
You have the Salem witch trials that seems like a slam dunk like it's right there for you

572
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,520
You take this circuitous route and you just like trip over your own shoes

573
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,780
I get the impulse because you're trying to make the world ancient and if you're looking back to like, okay

574
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,480
So what would the roots of magic have been in?

575
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,980
North America, it would have been Native American culture, right?

576
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,400
It just wasn't like researched enough or done with any respect carefully enough

577
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,820
Which is a bummer because it's a really cool idea

578
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,500
Yeah

579
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,380
So so you're something of a nerd for all this stuff

580
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,080
I could yeah Harry Potter is very much you or you like theme parks to us Harry Potter is

581
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah, maybe you enter this. Do you have how much how much clothes? How many of the clothes do you have?

582
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,320
Do you have wands multiple wands? Do you have how much give it the merch? What's your merch?

583
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,820
So this is my this is my similar answer to what Jessica said

584
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:27,860
I would not wear like a full Hogwarts uniform and walk through the park. That's just that's not me. That's not my bag

585
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:29,240
I fully

586
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,520
Respect people that can I just can't it's like too much for me personally

587
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,180
And on the one till you were in the Wizarding World part, you'd feel real embarrassed

588
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:46,060
I will say though when you're going to it right now half of the people you see walking around universal are just straight-up wearing robes

589
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,840
Yeah, that's the people in city walk

590
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,460
So you're very much not alone if you're doing it

591
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:57,460
I will say though when I went I wore it so they're in socks and my shirt that has snakes all over it

592
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,200
Like okay, those were like just for me. I was wearing a sweatshirt over it. No one else knew

593
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:08,360
You're Potter bounding really because there's a new phenomenon called Disney bounding where you sort of like dress a little bit

594
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:15,040
It's like a sad nod, but you're so you're like Potter bounding. Yes a little snake here and there, but you're not doing the full outfit

595
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,800
Yeah, I love it

596
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:22,120
also because the idea like if I'm wearing a Hogwarts outfit that means I am between the ages of

597
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,980
12 and

598
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,480
19 and going to school at like I'm cosplaying as a child at that point

599
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,120
Like a beanie hat and a big lolly. Yeah

600
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,680
cuz I'm not I'm like

601
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,000
when you see people wearing a sweatshirt that says like

602
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,160
Slytherin seeker like that's you're wearing a high school football jersey at that point

603
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:51,620
So it would seem like a sad guy may be wearing his old Jersey going back to visit his high school. I love I love

604
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,300
I'm into the merch stuff. I don't have a ton of it

605
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,120
Merch merches, I don't have any ones, but I think they're really cool

606
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,040
I look at them every time I see them because as you know

607
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:08,820
They have the little I don't know tech the tech in them that when you go around to various windows in the park and move

608
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,540
Stuff it makes things happen. There's more of those than I thought there were before

609
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:17,620
There's one that makes like fire shoot out of really the top of one of the roofs and makes a door like rattle like there's a dragon

610
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,600
Behind it. It's right by the train. Yeah, they add every now and then they add a few more

611
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,800
I think I think they're very cool and yeah that like as a kid

612
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,500
I would have lost my mind for that sure, but I don't own any of the ones when did you?

613
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,280
Do you remember what age you got into the Harry Potter? Yeah, I

614
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,860
Grew with the series. I think only only the book only book one had come out when I started reading it

615
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,120
It was on one of those things where you remember in school you would get a magazine

616
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,280
Yeah, I like books to buy and my mom was I think might have actually checked it for me

617
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,680
She's like you might like this and then so I would have been you're like 11 or 12. Is that 99 or?

618
00:49:59,460 --> 00:49:59,540
2000

619
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:05,060
And you followed book rule every book really like yeah from book one

620
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:10,420
So you would wait the day would you get him day of mm-hmm? Amazon actually if you bought them like later on

621
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,700
When Amazon was the thing if you bought them they would show up

622
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,180
The same day that you would like the next morning

623
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,240
as if you had waited till like midnight to get it at the store, but

624
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,380
Later on I found that there was a hack of like weird

625
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,440
Grocery stores would have the books and there would be no line

626
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,020
So I didn't hang out at lunch parties so much that again wasn't that wasn't like the important part for me

627
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,460
The important part was to get the book the night that it came out

628
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,620
Wow, so your hardcore is what we're saying and you know, I'm a full ten in terms of Harry Potter

629
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:48,340
I don't I don't express it through wearing this stuff all the time, but I it's it's you default to like

630
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,260
Thinking about it and like bored online

631
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,860
Probably you're digging into something if like a Harry Potter thing like pops up online

632
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,400
I will click it like there was recently leaked footage of a Harry Potter video game

633
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,900
That's coming out and though there isn't too much more information than that and I looked at I watched it

634
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,420
There should be a an M. M. What is it?

635
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,420
RPG Jason you're preaching to the goddamn there should be where you are a student at

636
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,820
Hogwarts and you go through the school and you help Harry and his friend

637
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,240
It would be amazing now Jason

638
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,560
You'll be happy to know that that that fact did not go unnoticed by the video game industry and there is a fact a game

639
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:32,160
Called Wizard 101 that is for all intents and purposes a weird little Harry Potter clone game

640
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,880
But it's like card based combat. You're basically building it. I mean, it's a cool

641
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,640
Spent money on it. I played it. I'm gonna get as close as I can, but you're right there

642
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:48,480
I think they're I think they're just leaving an insane amount of money on the table by not making

643
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,700
subscription based

644
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,960
Harry Potter MMORPG guys hit me when the longer month if you're paying monthly

645
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:02,460
You're incentivized to do it faster because if you're like it the longer you take the more of those fees

646
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,000
Accrue those games work

647
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,380
monthly content every month

648
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,220
Most of those games are moving towards micro transactions right now

649
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,120
Yeah, they're basically where you it's a free but you pay for the skin you pay for different outfits

650
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,360
I'm gonna tell you young guys talking about

651
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:26,700
I got Larry Carlton jazz in my head

652
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:32,900
Fortnite Zach so when you're looking at when stuff's popping up about Harry Potter like you have Google Alerts

653
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,820
Does this stuff pop up?

654
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:40,520
Do you see like for instance that there may be a giant new amazing Harry Potter coaster coming to Florida next year

655
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,340
No, I'm not have you heard about this?

656
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:49,260
forest roller coaster what no full forest building and for around a giant roller coaster with full

657
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:54,140
animatronic scenes and that sounds incredible the only stuff that I know about it and even the

658
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:58,840
Like you guys were my clue into the fact that there are owls that

659
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,420
Harry Potter Japan or no, that's the one in the lake

660
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,400
Lake they all think they also had the owls. Yeah

661
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,360
Hang it out. You got you guys are my lifeline for that stuff

662
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,940
So you guys gotta I mean that you Jess has been to Orlando though, right? Has she been to Diagon Alley?

663
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,480
I don't think she had when she was here. I think it hadn't opened yet. She not okay

664
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,000
We've talked about if we ever had doing an off book. Yeah, you got a book just

665
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,460
Excuse we will definitely do a show in Florida. Yeah. Yeah, so

666
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:35,980
Yeah, so you and your part your partner Jessica McKinnon go to the three broomsticks to work

667
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,940
Am I correct? We have had multiple right here just meetings there correct? Okay good because that's what I heard

668
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,560
and that's why yeah when we heard you want to do this it makes a lot of sense because

669
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,380
This is a thing that we do in various states at CityWalk

670
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,520
It is I kind of did it a little bit alone at Disneyland by myself on Sunday

671
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,680
We were there to do some work which is just we want to we love these places so much

672
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,680
We're just going to sit here and like not necessarily go on a ride

673
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,980
But just enjoy the ambiance and maybe get some work done

674
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:11,760
Maybe get a beer and just kind of like pretend you're working in a castle that you love from a world that you've spent

675
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,060
You know days of your life thinking about better way to open up your brain

676
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:20,000
I was trying to say my wife and I yeah, we had like these like great meal

677
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,000
Wonderful beers and we're having this like heady conversation about childhood and religion and all this stuff with that

678
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,820
Score playing and the light coming in through the windows and week after like being we were just kind of in a trance for like

679
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,760
Over an hour, and then we kind of snapped out of and like wow well that was something

680
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,880
I think that's really transported. It was great. Yeah, I think that those spaces work best when they are

681
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,140
When they do kind of seal you off from everything which three room sticks does very well

682
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:52,240
There's a bunch of windows in it, but they're all semi frosted so you can see like light comes into it

683
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,920
But you can't see what's going on. This was the one I was the other day

684
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,500
What's the first time I had been ever there when it was black like night outside?

685
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,240
Like full full black and it made me really think about the lighting design of the place

686
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,320
Which is really cool every light in there is meant to simulate a weird gas flame

687
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,680
There's no like straight up lights in the ceiling type down stuff

688
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:20,980
There's also projections of house elves working that pop up every once while that I had never noticed before and they come in

689
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,300
There's definitely two places

690
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:28,180
But in both of the places on the walls where it's just like you'll see a house elf like carrying some trays around or something

691
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,120
There's multiple different ones that show up on that same

692
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,180
Screen for lack of a better and there's like I have there's owl projections also

693
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,520
Yeah, I kept seeing something at like once every 15 minutes or so

694
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,700
I was really looking at it this time because I knew we were gonna come talk about it

695
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:49,940
But there's there's only one actual mounted head and it's the the hogs head for the for the bar

696
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,280
Yeah, excuse me

697
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:58,320
There's a ton of antlers everywhere and some of them are weird fantasy antlers of animals that are like far too big to be actual

698
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,680
Like deer or elk or stags or whatever and I thought that was very cool, too

699
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,680
Oh like there if you stop and stare at you're like well, this is a mythological

700
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,040
Huge

701
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:16,600
There's there are some that are I want to say like 15 feet wide and it's like well this couldn't and and and there's weird details

702
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:21,100
And then there's like oh, this is not an actual animal only a fantastic beast could have this

703
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:30,540
Cryptid of some sort and there's also all of the art on the walls is like weirdly like there's weird magical creatures like

704
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:33,820
hidden in them not all of them, but a lot of them also

705
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:41,280
I'm sure this came up on the on Jess episode no coca-cola products like everything

706
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:48,100
Hogshead has gotten a little more leeway. I don't I I guess they had this when they like hogshead does have

707
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,880
Your British beers and German be like you can get Stella in Guinness

708
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,000
But on the website they say they list the custom ones and then they say or you could have you know

709
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,080
One of your muggle beers. Yeah, yeah, and you make sure go well the hell no

710
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,940
Have a muggle beer and you put it that way that's correct. You shouldn't you shouldn't be getting like yeah

711
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:15,200
Yeah, yeah, especially because as I said beers awesome similar to the Duff and I we went for we walked from

712
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,140
three brimsticks over to get a we went to Moe's and got a

713
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:26,800
Holiday season Dufftoberfest Wow. It was great. It was really Universal Studios. It's good beer

714
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,320
it's good for them and also the

715
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:36,620
Fire whiskey that is liquor made for them. It's like fireball

716
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,860
I've never had it

717
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:44,600
It's I found on a beer review site or a liquor review site like the fire whiskey is like fireball

718
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,240
But it is smoother and people like to get it with a little strong, but you dump it into strong both cider

719
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,520
It's a little cinnamon a drink

720
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,040
I also found I didn't realize this because

721
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,480
We should say we are including the hogshead pub

722
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:05,300
Which is connected to the three brimsticks is we're including that in this episode

723
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,880
Yeah, sorry to disappoint

724
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,880
Do Zach do you know and listeners maybe you don't know do you know about the drink?

725
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,800
They're called the triple. I do not sometimes called the deathly hollows

726
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:27,820
It's three it's a layer of strong both cider and then a layer of hogshead and then it's topped with a layer of Guinness

727
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,480
So it's like three different things. Yeah, it's a lot that sounds bad. I don't know if it's good

728
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:39,920
That was very funny. It's a light beer and a dark beer in a cider. It's a it's a beer suicide

729
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,080
It's a snake bite that has something else going on too. I mean I gotta try that I'll try that

730
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,280
Yeah, I would try it just to try it when we were there

731
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,740
I bought I was buying multiple desserts just to try them because I've recently been like

732
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:59,180
Kind of a pescatarian so I there isn't a whole lot to eat there limited options limited options

733
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,040
Oh sure, and my wife's a vegetarian and so she did not eat a main meal there

734
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,220
Yeah, you although I did discover you can do the bangers and mash where they will substitute the sausages for asparagus

735
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:12,460
Which is basically like a spare a bunch of potatoes and peas and cabbage

736
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,260
It feels very British in a way that everything in that place kind of does in a really good way

737
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,940
Yeah, but we got multiple desserts which were

738
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,100
So did we what'd you do I was very

739
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:33,260
Surprisingly I have not sampled a lot of desserts no neither neither had I now they were out of one

740
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:37,320
I wanted to get the chocolate trifle and I couldn't okay they were out of it

741
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,440
Um, so we got the potted butter beer

742
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:46,940
What I have had yeah sweetest thing I have ever eaten. It's very very very sweet. It's good

743
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,260
Yeah, a bit much it's like too probably too rich for me and we thought about doing another

744
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,560
was the other with there's another thing that sounds like

745
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:01,460
Super super rich and we I was glad we didn't do them both. Yeah, I've been an overload but I

746
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,040
It's it's great though. It's just over well

747
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:10,640
It is yeah, but I love that they presented in the little in the little pot with a little latch. Yeah, that's pretty good

748
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,580
It feels magical you have to eat it with a plastic spoon which sucks, but I get it

749
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,420
See we got the sticky toffee pudding which that's why I was worried about that being too rich

750
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,940
I have had before and I will tell you that the sticky toffee pudding is great

751
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:30,800
It does it is playing with I want to say the same flavors as the potted butter beer

752
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,520
It's just in like different consistencies and it's very like

753
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,920
Caramel II very sweet

754
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,880
It's just one is like a baked good with ice cream on top on top of like melted caramel chips and the other is like

755
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,140
a straight-up

756
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,980
Not a yogurt pudding. It's a pudding. It's a pudding. It's like

757
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,080
Chocolate mousse, but caramel. Yeah

758
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,300
Butterscotch it's like a layer of butterscotch pudding with like a layer of caramel on it

759
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,380
And then what tastes like cool whip a little top. Yes, I flower just on top of it

760
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,440
I don't mean to throw shade. It's very good

761
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,680
It's very sweet and then we also got the apple pie because they didn't know the chopped

762
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,600
Yes, we do the apple pie to the great solid apple pie. Absolutely. I was worried

763
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,780
I was like is that like a dull option?

764
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,880
Is that just gonna be a the piece like you get in the market that and like no is great

765
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,140
It comes in this little tin you got a raisin component that kind of elevates it

766
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,720
Oh, whoa. Whoa, really good and I that I like the sound of that

767
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,640
It's kind of the whole thing has kind of it is like apple pie with kind of a run raisin overlay

768
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,460
It's a little like smokier or something. I love the idea of that. It's pretty you give it a try

769
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,960
I gotta try it. I actually did not notice that

770
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,680
Yeah, it took Aaron a sec

771
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:45,840
They're not is it wasn't immediately evident but I would I had also eaten a bunch of the other two as previously stated

772
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:51,060
Extremely sweet things right before that. That's your over. Have you had the I haven't had that

773
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:56,240
I've had the soft serve version in Florida the butter beer ice cream. They have hard pack butter beer ice cream

774
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,740
Oh, yeah, we saw that there and I asked like what it was and they were like, it's it's kind of how it tastes

775
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:05,280
I was like no no, like how is it actually served is in the cup. They're like, no, it's just like a scoop of ice cream

776
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,520
I was like, yeah

777
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:13,380
They didn't really there's a full ice cream parlor in Diagon Alley. That's just a life

778
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:20,180
Yeah, Jason loves ice cream I do like dream about that ice cream parlor

779
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:24,040
So good. It's so much you've been yeah

780
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,320
Yeah, a friend of ours was just there last week and I kept saying go to the ice cream parlor good

781
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:32,360
He's like I'm standing right outside it. I would die. I would love to go speaking of this same friend

782
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,060
His name is Andrew Grissom and I was at the funniest order

783
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:46,980
I'll say I've ever seen at the three broomsticks is one time he ordered a cup of water and corn on the cob

784
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,160
As long as he proves of it

785
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,320
Pretty funny you can just get a la carte anything. I think there

786
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:01,220
We what do I like to say he was texting us a lot about his trip because he was he was working there

787
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:07,740
So he was at universe studios for like for a week solid and essentially living in the world of Harry Potter. Yes

788
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,020
everyone's dreams magical but like the

789
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:15,720
he was I think a little overwhelmed right away by the

790
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,160
like he was starting to feel like

791
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,420
Am I not going to have like a fruit or a vegetable the entire time that I'm here?

792
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,780
Is that not an option here at Universal Florida?

793
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:31,200
And he was where he was we were commiserating about that fact and I threw out a joke that it was apparently too accurate for

794
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:36,420
Him I said what have you been to the all pez place you got to try the pez potatoes

795
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:43,500
Fairly accurate what CityWalk would have and then the next day he was like hey, where's that pez place?

796
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:51,380
Also in terms of like theme park food I feel like three broomsticks is pretty good cuz I

797
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,540
Had their like lemon chicken that comes with a bunch of vegetables

798
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,520
Which I thought was great by restaurant or theme park standards

799
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:04,800
I've had their fish and chips, which is good. Certainly good enough for theme park standards. Yeah

800
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,580
Well, yeah, I thought JK Rowling has to approve all the food stuff

801
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,700
Or like all the take it to your house and feed it to her with a spoon

802
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,380
Yeah, I mean you're not far off apparently they tried like 15 different

803
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:21,160
recipes for butter beer before they got it right and eat

804
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,260
Is there's no high fructose corn syrup in it? It's all sugar

805
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:30,420
Which I was surprised by very sweet but I love it

806
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,600
Can I give a shout out?

807
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:39,580
I started getting curious with the with the beers and everything with butter beer and and though the sort of like very

808
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:47,260
Specific nature of this food. I was like, is there a specific person you can trace it all to and in fact the executive chef

809
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:53,880
In Florida, okay, Steven Jason is the guy's name went to the Culinary Institute of America

810
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,660
Worked a lot of country clubs and for the Hyatt Corporation and then was hired

811
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:06,380
Just all like very low on the totem pole for at Universal Studios in in 1990 right before it opened and has graduated all

812
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:10,420
The way up to the executive chef and he is the guy

813
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,020
responsible for

814
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:14,080
Figuring out the butter beer flavor

815
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,400
It's it's a specific guy who I think we should try to talk to on

816
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,660
Twitter because he doesn't have a lot of followers and he mainly tweets about like soccer

817
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:25,380
So I feel like he might talk to us and be nice to us especially because I want to praise his work

818
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:32,180
He seems like great. Yeah, and and like cuz what I like like to have to manifest

819
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:40,320
the very specific flavor that children are obsessed with and why I've want like millions of children want to have very badly and

820
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,960
To do it with such success people love all of these butter beer products

821
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,800
So I'm very impressed and just like we're just really quick. I read a big interview with him

822
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:56,380
He talks about how like he had people in his office go through the books highlight every food and beverage like put tabs in the book

823
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:03,720
So he and then he's so he's really seeing every mention of any piece of food anywhere in the books watch the films paused

824
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,480
Anytime they're in the Great Hall looked at what's on the table

825
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,420
He went to England Scotland Ireland went to pubs taverns talked to chefs figured out how to make it an authentic

826
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,720
Experience from that area then he flew to Scotland to meet with Rowling presented the menu

827
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:24,060
Like served her pumpkin juice. She tried the butter beer and she ended up with the white foamy mustache

828
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,680
So like just it seems like this guy like really cared about doing this

829
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:35,220
So I want to give him his proper credit and then this one he's after your heart here Mike with this

830
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,920
They ask like just favorite culinary experiences at Universal Studios

831
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,660
He says I eat most of my meals at Universal Studios

832
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:49,760
So that's something first of all and I have to say my favorite breakfast is the fluffy pancakes they serve at the leaky cauldron

833
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,820
Creating this world and taking it from the books to real life will be a member always be a memory that I'll never forget

834
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,320
This and the opening of Jimmy Buffett's margarita

835
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,820
So let's meet this man

836
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:08,580
He's my patronus

837
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:14,500
Steven Jason is your patronus from the sky from the slither in and patronus is Steven Jason

838
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,520
Patronus is a human man

839
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,540
What I like I was looking at the breakfast menus at at three rooms six and

840
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:35,160
Is that when you their breakfast items all come with both bacon and sausage and a fluffy croissant

841
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:40,660
Even the pancakes come with a croissant and I was just delighted by that Wow

842
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:48,380
The real quick the butter beer we were talking about butterbeer butterbeer on a recent one of Jim Hill's 15 podcasts

843
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:53,720
He said that they had like just reached like 20 million in sales of butterbeer

844
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,080
Yeah, and I don't remember exactly the the amount of time it took but he said after like six months

845
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:01,860
Universal just when they initially opened up the Harry Potter world in Florida

846
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,480
They made back the money that it cost to build it just by butterbeer it's like sales

847
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:18,160
They like showed somebody like the ledger and they were like look we've made the money back just through the butter beer

848
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:21,660
Butter beer is their minions. Yeah

849
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,840
And they have the minions too

850
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:31,140
Concessions are like 30% of right in park revenue if the if Steven Jason had not nailed it

851
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:35,540
Like he's responsible for recouping the amount of money in a such a

852
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:42,280
It is also outside of Canon and brave for him to decide to be like also we have three ways of making it

853
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:48,900
We're starting with frozen and liquid and then later we're gonna add in hot which I have not tried hot and I've not tried fudge

854
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:54,540
Okay, I've tried fudge, but I've not tried hot. I've tried hot but I've not tried fudge

855
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:58,260
Hot's great. I will say it's very sweet

856
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:04,120
But if it's like cold outside and drizzly and rainy which it seldom is in Los Angeles

857
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,160
But I happen to be there one time when it was it's perfect

858
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:13,600
I mean that sounds you almost don't need the whole thing because it's very sweet. It's very sweet another hack

859
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,080
I've heard and I I think they started selling it

860
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,900
But now I think or maybe they encourage they're like, oh, we don't want to encourage this

861
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:26,960
So just buy it separately is you you order the fire whiskey and a butter beer and you pour it in so it's like a hard

862
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,640
Butterbeer. Yeah, they don't want to encourage

863
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,560
Do that off-site if you're gonna do it. Yeah

864
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,500
I've had the fudge is good, but it is insane

865
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,940
It's too much you need it needs to be like a little tiny piece

866
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:44,520
I think cuz they give you the big block and I didn't like shove the block in my mouth or anything

867
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,460
But I cut a normal punt mount off of it and it was still like a little too much at one time

868
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:53,560
y'all talked about this one when Jess was on but the

869
01:09:54,140 --> 01:10:01,100
My god, what is it called not Zonko's joke stop the shop that is attached honey dukes honey dukes honey dukes

870
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:07,560
Candy counter is a little bit of a missed opportunity for them still the candy is good

871
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,340
but it's just like if they had put the amount of time into

872
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:19,180
Three rooms because they had into the selection of like what is available what that potentially could be if you can imagine going into like

873
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:22,940
a Wonka esque shop of all the insane

874
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,820
candies that are mentioned in the Harry Potter books, it's like truly

875
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:36,140
It's it's they're leaving a ton of money on the table by having things that look like they could kind of have bought anywhere

876
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:41,900
We're zipping all around here in our topics, but just since you bring that up. Is there something in the books?

877
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:49,080
Ride or other or food or something that you're thinking specifically. I wish this food or candy

878
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:56,640
In the park so here so I wish they did chocolate frogs but did it better because they do have chocolate frogs, right?

879
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:01,620
They're big they're like 20 bucks a piece and there are I think

880
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:06,380
Somewhere between five and seven actual cards that you can collect and this is yes

881
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,740
There is them back for people there is no way to do this the way that it should be done

882
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:18,280
but in Harry Potter canon there are hundreds and hundreds of wizard cards and you buy it kind of akin to buying a

883
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,580
Baseball cards exactly. So it should be

884
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:27,400
$5 much smaller chocolate and a ton more cards because no one cares about the frog

885
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,860
You've made a chocolate in the shape of the frog. You're done. That's great. Sorry. No one cares about the frog

886
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,980
What did I say? I don't know it's for the cards, right?

887
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,840
And then it's like the gum in baseball cards

888
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,020
Yeah, basically baseball cards would have a stick of gum in it, right?

889
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,240
And then like that's what it was fun to have that but it's like the cards are sort of the thing

890
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,860
It's like when you eat those popsicles for those sweet sweet jokes

891
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,400
I

892
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,880
Hurry get it done. I don't know in the book. Sorry

893
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,840
I have a lot of questions about these cards in the book

894
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,040
Is it the only way you can get these cards through the chocolate frogs?

895
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,700
No, I got frog cards. This is the card. I feel that universal

896
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,760
Disney at least is catching on more that

897
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,180
Universal doesn't sort of embrace like a big crazy

898
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,280
like

899
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,520
Marketing merchandise opportunity like Disney like pins like pins. Yes, exactly

900
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:23,360
We've talked like there is not really equivalent to so many different like whether it's pins or whether it's when Disney was doing on those

901
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,520
final nation vinyl toys like

902
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,160
And they do have universal vinyl they do

903
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,860
Rudging it's kind of exactly the same level and not at the same amount

904
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:41,560
And I will say something that both Nicole and I like stopped and spent I want to say five minutes looking at not outside of Harry

905
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:47,280
Because we went to it was one of those universal stores that kind of sells stuff from all over the park

906
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:47,680
Yeah

907
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:53,800
and we were there specifically to see if they had a gretzko stuff in which if you haven't watched on Netflix is the

908
01:12:53,800 --> 01:13:00,480
Hello Kitty company made a cartoon about a red panda who works in an office job and hates it

909
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,900
Oh, yes, and she's furious

910
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:08,980
This has come up on the ship and she sings heavy metal to release from that and it's very very good watch the

911
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,880
Subtitles we went to Pearl land in Japan. Okay. Yeah, so they have Hello Kitty

912
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,000
Universal crossover merchandise, which is very good

913
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,860
It's like Hello Kitty in the jaws poster and she's above the shark and the shark also has a bow on its head

914
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:32,780
And it's all kind of and it's smiling. The shark is smiling. The shark still looks scary King Kong is Oh King Kong

915
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,700
Oh, okay, but King Kong's cute

916
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,620
It's like immediately a great

917
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:44,480
It's great. They're doing a lot of great stuff. I have or the best wrestling company in the world is New Japan professional wrestling

918
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,320
I have a Hello Kitty New Japan professional wrestling shirt. So maybe it's just

919
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:55,040
Hello Kitty is like Hello Kitty and then the New Japan logo. I bought it at the show in Long Beach last month Wow

920
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:01,680
That I don't think has that character as that newer Sanrio character is not there at all

921
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:09,020
Because I had this experience in 2014 when I was trying to find good atama stuff at the Universal Sanrio store and

922
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:14,320
Just had not hit peak. Yeah good atama yet. Now you can get good atama everywhere. He's the egg. Yeah. Yes

923
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,820
He's the lazy egg

924
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:22,400
Jason's favorite character in fiction. I mean it's a piece of bacon as a blanket. It's very good

925
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,620
I mean, sorry, you're looking for an egg everybody good atama. Yeah. Yeah, we all have our good at that

926
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,240
Let's get detective good atama out

927
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:37,620
We're making detective movies, I mean Disney is the undisputable king of like merch

928
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:43,940
I don't think anyone would argue that they they make so many products that are based off of their properties

929
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:48,780
They find like but yeah, like I'm just saying like they have a whole like collector

930
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,040
Gotta have it man

931
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,340
I have these two

932
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:54,420
Tiki mugs that I had to get on eBay because they sold out

933
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,980
Because there were like a thousand people in line to get them because they're exclusive and they're only gonna make a certain amount

934
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:04,340
Of them if they did this with Harry Potter and there were certain cards and then all of a sudden a hundred of them would be

935
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:09,680
Retired like people go nuts. If you could go wizard cards, I would be fucking broke

936
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:15,500
I would have every single I would like they're screwing up here by not doing this and like just taking money from you

937
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:22,040
They're not possibly removing it from you is a like it is a like take my money scenario now what they are doing

938
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,500
That's the weird thing they're doing it but the price point is too high to be a collector because if you look at the

939
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:32,860
Wands they have right and they just released a bunch of new ones for Fantastic Beasts crimes of Grindelwald

940
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:36,840
And there's a bunch they like every time there is a character

941
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:43,820
They take whatever their wand is in the movie and they make a replica of it that is functional within their park

942
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:51,620
But they're all over a hundred dollars. So you're never gonna buy more than like right who one for you and one for your you know

943
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,040
Child who you don't want to share

944
01:15:53,040 --> 01:16:00,920
Me and my brother each got a Gameboy one year because they're like what we were gonna get you one Gameboy to share

945
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,760
Yeah, like don't come on

946
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,100
Because once and it occurred to me that like if you were made of money, that would be a cool

947
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:14,420
Kind of like this is I guess only a slightly cooler version if you ever been to someone's house and see they have like

948
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:18,060
What's what's what's Aragorn sword called?

949
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:23,920
Oh, I don't know I yeah, I know yeah all those Lord of the Rings replicas if you have any of the like Lord of the Rings

950
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,940
replica swords

951
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:32,820
If you see that up on the wall, it's like almost

952
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:36,180
Normal enough to be a normal adult house decoration swords

953
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:41,900
Maybe not so much but the ones are like tiny little things, right? They look cool. They look like art pieces

954
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:48,040
They look like movie replicas. They're very cool. They're they're basically looking they're they're shooting much more still I think for tourists

955
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:49,680
versus

956
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,760
Hardcore nerds people that go there and have meetings at three broomsticks

957
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:58,700
Well, I mean as you guys have said Universal is not a go-to it all the time type park

958
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:02,620
There's just not enough there. You can do the whole thing in like less than half a day

959
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:08,480
I don't think they were prepared for the amount of people that like specifically would go for

960
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,600
Harry Potter

961
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:16,700
World to just be there and that's really that's really all they're going. Yeah, you can imagine a scenario where they

962
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:23,420
Knowing what they know now totally redo Springfield or like add on to Springfield in a way that makes it much more

963
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,200
Hangout able they have they have hangout able places there. Mm-hmm, but yeah

964
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,000
I mean Harry Potter is the first time like they had a built they had a built-in culture

965
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:40,040
Surround it whereas Disney has always had a culture of people like kind of just hanging around and it's not just marketing exactly

966
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:46,680
Towards tourists. Yeah, it's marketing towards like idiot Southern Californians who want to go and line up at 7 a.m

967
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:50,520
For a tiki mug and then certain ones who didn't are mad at themselves

968
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,960
And then they have to get it. Yeah, I did get it

969
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:59,400
I had to pay more than it's than the cost of it was but I felt there was a period of time when Universal was basically

970
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,260
Giving away their year-long pass. Oh, yeah

971
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,940
They're doing much better now

972
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:09,260
Financially, but it's they should have been they weren't offering and there wasn't much

973
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:09,720
But yeah

974
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:16,240
the addition of potter like just the perfect thing to get them to Disney level and to prove they could do

975
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,860
I'm kind of very upset that it doesn't seem like Diagon Alley is ever gonna come

976
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:31,020
Yeah, we're not sure what would go I mean those water worlds

977
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,600
Yeah, you could do that. Could you really?

978
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,960
Put that much in there. You probably can't do the Hogwarts Express and it's probably got to be a slightly

979
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:46,020
You'd have to change the architecture of the ride of the Hogwarts Express to simulate like it was moving and it only really moved

980
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:51,320
100 feet or something. I don't even know that that's the I mean honestly if you just want to double

981
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:56,800
Shop footage that would be enough for fans like me who don't like the rides are almost secondary

982
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,280
It's the theme park stuff that you're going for you would rather have just a land without the actual ride

983
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,640
If if it was that or nothing I hundred percent

984
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:10,760
That's the thing with Diagon is like people like that ride but like it's mainly just being there

985
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:14,640
I like though I like being there so much more than the ride and I like the ride fine

986
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:20,920
But it's the fact of like could there be an ice cream parlor? Can you do a leaky cauldron though?

987
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,480
I mean those two things way higher priority for me than then yeah

988
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:31,620
Which a different menu the leaky cauldron then three broomsticks great like they purposely both in one day

989
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:38,300
Yeah, I'll tease what the my favorite part is of is nocturne le I loved I'd love to go to nocturne

990
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:42,200
I watch a bunch of wizard. Yes. What are they selling? It's the greatest. I'm into it

991
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,660
There's heads that talk to you in the alley there. Whoa

992
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:49,060
And skeleton dancing skeletons and a friend of ours

993
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:54,740
Anthony Geo just took Jason and I around the Universal a lot and we were doing some snooping

994
01:19:54,740 --> 01:20:00,140
And there is a big plot of land down down on the you know level of Jurassic Park

995
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:04,820
But it's probably Nintendo. It's probably not gonna be dying on alley

996
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:09,660
Next to Transformers. Yeah, right. Yes, right next to Transformers. That's what people are saying

997
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,160
Very active construction site, there's a ton. It's a ton of land

998
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:17,500
It still doesn't look enough land for a bit still doesn't look enough for anything too substantial

999
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:23,000
Yeah, supposedly secret life of pets is going up on the top lot in the New York area

1000
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:29,180
I agree with you. No, but like even for did that

1001
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:32,780
Did that make them that much money? Is that a land they can make?

1002
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:37,300
Now okay, there's no problem anymore

1003
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:46,720
Okay, is the dog he saved us yes, he's the dog the dog has been recast who was the dog we don't want to

1004
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,980
Know it doesn't matter cuz it's Patton now

1005
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:56,120
They've made it the correct rotund alternative comedian

1006
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,740
It is no problem

1007
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:03,740
Now I think you have to don't you have to do

1008
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:07,120
On on the back lot somewhere and you take the

1009
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:16,700
Can I throw out something real outside the box though, you know, I might get screamed I might get shouted down

1010
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:21,860
Doesn't it seem like you think about what's right next to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter?

1011
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:28,380
What if some of Harry Potter invaded the place we call CityWalk? Oh

1012
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,420
What if oh, what if you what part of it?

1013
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:40,480
Some of CityWalk I got a look at the map here. I'm not sure

1014
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:47,020
Underground tunnel into parts of CityWalk do it like it's under ground that would be

1015
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:51,600
Here I'll write it for you. You take it's not the other green guard green gods bank ride

1016
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:59,680
It's a new one and it's just for taking you underground from Wizarding World to the parts of CityWalk that you've knocked down

1017
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:06,420
And you come out of the Goblin Bank and you go past the dragon and it's very scary and you come out and you're in

1018
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:11,560
Diagon Alley, which is attached to green gods banks. What's canon? It's fine. Everyone loves it

1019
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:20,320
I mean a rumor that we talked we've talked about before there's also a rumor of an expansion to Diagon Alley potentially a ministry of magic

1020
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,900
battle ride

1021
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,340
Ministry of magic ride and

1022
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,760
Battle breaks out like a magic land is a rumor as well land

1023
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:36,440
Is third park or fourth park in Orlando rumor ministry of magic land or as your third do it?

1024
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:40,900
But as your second here, no, give me the things that I already like yes

1025
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:41,880
I mean, I agree

1026
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:48,200
I pitched a few episodes ago like yank that were the world set out there build a Diagon Alley

1027
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:52,760
Maybe the primus it's very prime real estate

1028
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,720
But it is like it is a big people do like it on the studio tour because it is a huge set

1029
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,460
I just had a thought and this is a little bit of last term

1030
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:06,180
But we were talking about how Patton is the dog now and it made me thought about another beloved like DreamWorks character

1031
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:10,300
Poe the panda who is voiced by a very good friend Jack Black

1032
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:17,420
I guess he's can we talk about how wild it is that Jack I guess just is because he's a star of a certain

1033
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:20,060
brightness is allowed to

1034
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,340
Simultaneously do Poe the panda and

1035
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:28,180
Tenacious D and no one has been able to stop him from doing that. Well, so what do you mean?

1036
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,600
What do you mean? You mean because he's because tenacious D is of an R rated or but there's many exactly

1037
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:40,540
I mean Sarah Silverman is in wreck at Ralph and she has some material that's not PG 13 like Don Rickles

1038
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:44,660
Himself used to make fun of all the races and gender

1039
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:47,760
I just think and I don't dislike it

1040
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:55,120
I just think that it is incredibly savvy of Jack Black to have simultaneously had a career where he

1041
01:23:55,120 --> 01:24:01,180
Can be Poe the panda and the house with the clocks in the house and the walls of the house

1042
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:05,120
Is like a keys more of a kid movie star than an adult movie

1043
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:11,800
But he is like simultaneously releasing like fucker. Gently is like sure. Yeah, just D type stuff

1044
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,240
I think that's a thing. I really I've always really liked about Jack Black's he like keeps the cred alive

1045
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:21,480
He'll still make a cameo in some weird thing or being a channel 101 thing. Let me be 100% clear

1046
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:28,520
I love Jack Black. I love tenacious D their new album apocalypto is out now. They're on tour that it's very very silly

1047
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,580
It's very fun. I haven't heard of tenacious D. Sure

1048
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:35,460
Out of the kindness of your Jack Black can get it, but I'm

1049
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:37,180
so you feel

1050
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,760
So you're are you trying to like you're admiring basically

1051
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,760
I'm admiring the fact that I feel like a lot of people get so worried when they go into quote-unquote children's entertainment

1052
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,480
I think Dreamworks has done a good job with Kung Fu Panda all the Kung Fu Panda movies are great

1053
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,760
I as an adult like all three of them a lot. Do you like the new show?

1054
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,480
The new 3d Kung Fu Panda show Universal

1055
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:05,900
I didn't watch it was closed when I came and weirdly Pinocchio still work in the turnstile at that

1056
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,360
So so they could swap stuff in and out

1057
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:16,820
He's got a gig, you know, all right, yeah have some income

1058
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:24,560
I think I'm just I feel like I don't know would Disney have hired him to be a main voice knowing that that was still

1059
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,600
What I think that it's yeah

1060
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:31,960
I think unless some weird conservative guy on Twitter makes a big case out of something like what happened to James Gunn

1061
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,980
I think that no one's paying any attention. No one cares

1062
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:42,900
But you can like fool Bob Iger and Alan Horn into firing somebody very easily it seems

1063
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:50,720
So like maybe we're maybe what you have just done on this podcast is open people's eyes to the fact that there's a very filthy

1064
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:55,000
Album and that Jack Black is about to lose his job is poe the panda

1065
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,400
I think Jack just found out about some very upsetting material that Jack Black

1066
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,620
Released over a decade ago

1067
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:12,240
This man is encouraging people to fuck gently. I don't understand this at all and hard and hard

1068
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:16,440
Part of the song he's sending mixed messages, too

1069
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:22,580
Well, no, he'll keep his job. I think it'll be fine. I don't think Bob Iger Alan Horn listen to the show

1070
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:28,920
Hmm, and I can grab the congratulations to everybody at Disney by the way on the smash success of Bohemian Rhapsody

1071
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:33,660
Fox's biggest hit of Disney who only works with the most upstanding

1072
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:41,040
Great to see Bryan Singer coming back from international waters to have a number one movie again truly

1073
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,640
He's still got really incredible

1074
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,100
moral compass no

1075
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:52,800
Great cinematic. Ah, yes, I was trying to figure out the moral compass in international waters joke

1076
01:26:52,800 --> 01:27:01,620
Sailed through international waters without the use of any sort of moral compass

1077
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,420
The official director of pizza gate Brian

1078
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:16,620
The pizza gate the movie Jason that movie you can it should cannot buy or you or you can buy just on the dark web

1079
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:20,880
That is that joke is gonna cost you a number of different voiceover gigs. I think

1080
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:26,960
Unfortunately all your blue material over the years. Oh all of my blue all of my

1081
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,980
dragging Brian Singer for

1082
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:30,080
Eight years

1083
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,920
All right

1084
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:41,740
Newer entrees at three broomsticks like the Christmas ones

1085
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:48,200
No, I haven't seen the Christmas ones, but this you know, they do rotate stuff in and out and they added a

1086
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:53,880
Sunday roast sandwich. Mm-hmm the cheese toasty with chicken Nicole got the cheese toasty

1087
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,140
Was a good title it looked

1088
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:59,960
I mean like well, yeah toasty is a much more common

1089
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:06,180
European thing to call it or I guess maybe specifically British or crazy stuffed grilled cheese with a fried egg

1090
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,660
It's a stuffed good cheese. It did not have fried grilled on top when she bought it

1091
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:14,860
It had chicken and bacon inside of it. She said it was very good. Very greasy the bread itself

1092
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:18,940
She actually described this kind of garlic bread ish. Mm-hmm. I had it. Yeah, but it looked good

1093
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:23,020
I've had it. It's a little too much. It's a lot believe it or not

1094
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,860
And then the last one is the plowman's lunch

1095
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:32,260
No, is that meat in it that I can't eat? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's a lot of meat

1096
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:40,120
In fact, it's a scotch egg a bunch of a sort of deli beats like three or four kinds of cheeses a cut-up apple

1097
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,840
sliced bread

1098
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,720
pickles olives and then like a

1099
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:49,020
Cranberry shot. I don't think all of these are available at Universal Studios, Los Angeles

1100
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,560
I know because Jason ordered it so I ordered it

1101
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:58,900
Okay, so I had seen this in Florida and in Florida it says serves two and in Florida

1102
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:02,160
It's mostly salad and a scotch egg and some cheeses

1103
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,140
That's what you're showing me right now is a lot more reasonable than what Mike was showing me

1104
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:10,920
Yes, and again, it says on the menu for two or more

1105
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,800
Hollywood did not say that and they replaced the salad with assorted deli beats

1106
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:20,080
Well, this will be a lighter fare and

1107
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,180
It was not at all

1108
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:27,940
And look like you had just taken a tray out of a like a deli counter at a supermarket

1109
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:32,340
When Mike before we started recording had said he was gonna show us something that you had ordered

1110
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:36,220
I was almost I was 90% sure you had ordered the great feast

1111
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:40,600
For I think like six

1112
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:46,440
It's just is it just chicken and ribs and all this side

1113
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,540
Yeah, I believe if I'm correct

1114
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:57,120
I think Mike did the great feast for four and it was weird because you had booked a flight out of LAX 15 minutes

1115
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,580
Later and then you thought like well, this is too much

1116
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:05,980
I have to go and then you went back up and just out of your business for no reason out of your mouth

1117
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,980
You said another great feast, please

1118
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,760
Classic Carlson I had to review I wanted I knew we were gonna review and I want to try it twice

1119
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:22,280
Anyway, everything on this plate was very good, but it felt like an ordeal once I was halfway through

1120
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:35,740
It was so much and then once you said like well you can get a lot of the stuff a la carte and now it's just

1121
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:41,440
I probably just wanted the Scotch egg. Why didn't I just say ask could I get

1122
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:48,620
You could get this stuff all a cart. Is there what's the meat in a Scotch egg? It's sausage. It's pork sausage. Okay, cool

1123
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:53,880
The catchphrase of this podcast is gonna become my tummy is too full

1124
01:30:53,880 --> 01:31:03,820
Fully too fall after eating most of three desserts that they had to come with yeah

1125
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,820
Asparagus and mashed potatoes and I think with a lot of theme park menus

1126
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:15,840
This goes for Disney too. You can get things a la carte, but they don't advertise it because they want you to buy it together

1127
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,300
So if there's a hamburger with fries, I'm sure 99% of the time you can get it with no fries

1128
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,940
It's just they want to sell it to you

1129
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:26,100
So all you have to do is go can I just have the hamburger? Can I have it without this?

1130
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:29,160
There's I read a whole like article like years ago

1131
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,840
About like how to save money and it's like don't get cheese on the hamburger

1132
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,320
Okay

1133
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:39,560
That's when I think I first learned that the wall of though like just asking for a cup of water because they don't advertise that

1134
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,560
Obviously either they just want you to buy a bottle of water

1135
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,540
You buy a pumpkin fist which is very good

1136
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:49,300
But very sweet and if it is the only thing that you have to kind of like drink down the potted butterbeer

1137
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:52,820
It does become problematic even though it by itself. It's a very good drink

1138
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:58,660
Yeah, it mixed with yeah a giant meat feast topped off with pumpkin

1139
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,120
Juice mixed mixed thankfully with seltzer because I think the pumpkin juice by itself would be a little too much

1140
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,540
But the pumpkin fizz is good

1141
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:11,320
And I think Jessica had suggested that that is what you throw the fire whiskey into

1142
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:19,600
The pumpkin the bottled pumpkin juice is good too, but very very sweet is a juice you're drinking a juice

1143
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,320
Yeah, you're drinking a juice like a child

1144
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:28,380
Drinking a juice flavored with like pumpkin pie spices like whatever the cardamom nutmeg

1145
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,440
Whatever the classic pumpkin pie that sounds right. Mm-hmm

1146
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,860
I want to throw out a broader point here that gets us outside of Potter a little bit what I was mainly

1147
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:41,700
I'm sitting in that that main ballroom ballroom. What do you get the main out of the main room?

1148
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:50,240
Three brimsticks they're just thinking this is this is so grand it enhances the experience so much that this is like that

1149
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:54,220
There's an experience that is so immersive and cool in this park

1150
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:59,420
That is not a ride and I started thinking there are a lot of these now

1151
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,460
I clearly

1152
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:08,240
Star Wars is gonna be great in the food department with the Cantina. I haven't been to the avatar

1153
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:13,760
Restaurant, but it seems like that really adds to the dull experience and expands it

1154
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,860
if this isn't quite on that level, but I think that cars diner is really fun and

1155
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:25,420
Keeps the story going and yeah decent food there and I just first of all, I just want to say I

1156
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:32,280
Disney and Universal how great a job the chefs are doing the the people building these places

1157
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:36,560
It's like it just expands these worlds in such a wonderful way

1158
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:43,760
But I also I also thinking I just wanted to pose in general if you now that

1159
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,720
movie-based

1160
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:53,800
Restaurants are on the table a little more is there a place in like or or specifically a menu item

1161
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:59,020
From a film or media that you would most want to have done to perfection

1162
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:01,300
you know in a

1163
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:07,880
Immediately, I think that I would like to get I would like to go up to a replicator on a starship

1164
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:10,640
I order just and put cars. I was just thinking

1165
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,080
Tea hot

1166
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,460
And I wanted to replicate hot

1167
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:20,340
Yeah, tea Earl Grey hot is what he would say and it would replicate and then I would want to enjoy it in my quarters

1168
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:26,040
Well, you know, you know what? I was just thinking is that I think that one potential for

1169
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,380
Future growth that I haven't seen before in Harry Potter

1170
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:34,740
Famously in the the Great Hall where they all eat food just sort of appears on the table

1171
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:39,360
It's not taken anywhere and it doesn't it's just like the plates appear and then they vanish

1172
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:45,060
So picture a restaurant that you have to walk up to the second floor to get into and you're seated around a table and

1173
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:50,920
The method for meal delivery is such that the kitchen is below it and dishes dumbwaiter style

1174
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,320
Just go up and appear like under what it like, you know

1175
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,000
You could magic it up or whatever

1176
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,660
But that would be a sort of that is really sort of like blending the line between what is a ride and what is a restaurant

1177
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,080
In a way that is very cool to me

1178
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:11,320
The other two things that I also just thought of were if you were to theme a sort of like outdoor place as a

1179
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:16,180
Lady and the tramp eating spaghetti and meatballs in an alleyway style restaurant

1180
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:21,520
Could be fun and a ratatouille restaurant where a rat makes your food

1181
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:27,040
They have Tony's in Florida, but they don't have an alley

1182
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,040
Special that being their version of the chef's table is the alley is a special romantic

1183
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,880
Also that restaurant famously

1184
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:42,780
Fine like it's fine. No one cares about what they now I just saw over the weekend that they have a care a guy playing Tony

1185
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:48,120
That I would like to eat at

1186
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:51,340
And I've been it's probably a year

1187
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:54,560
I've been stringing this out because there's I'm getting close to the end

1188
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,560
But I've been watching the Sopranos and I would like a pop-up

1189
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,680
Whatever. No

1190
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,460
No, I want to go to Vesuvius

1191
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:10,220
I want to go to Artie Bucco's restaurant and I want to walk around Artie Bucco to bother your table

1192
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:17,460
Too much to constantly be asking how the food is and trying to encourage you to order dessert and try to tell you bad

1193
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:18,220
stories

1194
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,820
I want that like the mom's diner at Hollywood Studios

1195
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:28,480
We're like mom yells at you if you don't clean your plate just already going like I got the sea bass. Oh

1196
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,920
Maroon, this is it's crazy

1197
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:38,840
HBO is owned by who Warner Brothers. Yeah, so we're working maybe maybe a Sopranos land in that Dubai Park

1198
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:46,240
And Warner Brothers movie worlds. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah some wise guys sitting at another table. They don't even need to make a scene

1199
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:54,200
They're just there they eat and they leave without paying they just nod at Artie and they have a tab and you actually had another good idea

1200
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:58,100
For a theme bar on the our episode we do with Jeff Garland was a rock

1201
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,480
I believe a Rockford files theme bar

1202
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:09,060
Yeah, well, I wanted a Rockford files a themed bar kind of and like the bartender would be

1203
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:12,220
Rockford would be an old cranky

1204
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:19,940
Like sunburned man who would serve you what I want is for the the Sheraton

1205
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:27,600
Universal to make things right and to reconvert it to being telly's been in fact amended perhaps to be sloppy

1206
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:32,620
And maybe a walk around telly's of all this checking in on

1207
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:44,720
Yeah, yeah, they have a lot of very generic photos hanging in that lobby like old Hollywood photos. Those should all be telly's of all this

1208
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:51,780
Project if you're living in like the sort of like rainforest cafe vibe also where you can make a restaurant and just kind of generally

1209
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:53,460
theme it rain forest

1210
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:56,420
I'm down for that game. I like I'm

1211
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:58,900
Like if you want to do just like a general

1212
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,000
fantasy

1213
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,480
Tavern, right? I'm not even talking Harry Potter. I'm talking like Lord of the like every

1214
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:08,960
Every King Arthur Lord of the Rings or X elves, whatever

1215
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:15,140
Yeah, yeah, like that there is now the problem is this place is famously the food is like gross because it's a media medieval food

1216
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:19,860
No, yeah, it's all pretty like it's like a trough. There's gotta be I mean like you don't consider

1217
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:23,920
the that in real life to be round table pizza

1218
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:29,000
That doesn't go far enough for you man, I wish I could have a place where there was around table pizza

1219
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:36,180
In like other cities around me there's one in Burbank, you know, is it came on

1220
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:44,980
It's like a Panera had like someone like dashed a little camel on on top like a sprinkle

1221
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:48,080
I don't know that it's nice like Panera. I think the theme

1222
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:52,200
According to what are two old co-workers. The theme was a food poisoning

1223
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:57,200
Dined at that King's table. I

1224
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:02,200
Have one more just like the ideal meal that I would like to have and Jason

1225
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:09,160
I know you'll you'll be into this and back me up. I want to go into the little cafe in

1226
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:18,440
Phantom Thread where Reynolds Woodcock meets Alma for the first time so that you can do his massive order of

1227
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,860
bacon some scones

1228
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:24,460
Butter butter and cream butter and cream

1229
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:31,820
And the only thing on the menu is that big list and then you and then you order it you have but you have

1230
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:38,460
To say the whole thing in whatever that accent is and then she and then the walk around Alma actress will write

1231
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,260
to my hungry boy

1232
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:44,440
I love it since it got on HBO go

1233
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:50,840
I keep I keep getting just a little stoned and watching theater Phantom Thread and making it about

1234
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:57,020
20 minutes 20 minutes at a time before I fall asleep, but it feels like

1235
01:39:57,020 --> 01:40:03,980
It's so heightened every line is so loaded and it's also just it's such an intense experience

1236
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:08,920
I think you only get something about that very funny. Yes. It's very funny on repeat viewings

1237
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,600
You start to see like all the little the cuts all the slights

1238
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,740
They're giving each other on the barbs and stuff

1239
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:22,180
Seen Paul F. Tompkins recording of what he thought the Phantom Thread opening credit song should have been

1240
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:38,620
He did one for halt and catch fire which my friend created is a really good hall and catch fire

1241
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:42,600
Like the crossfire song a little bit great

1242
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,480
I

1243
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:50,860
Who owns Phantom Thread and where can we put that experience what park I'm thinking practical sure sure sure

1244
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:54,980
Megan Ellison land what's the who's that woman who finances?

1245
01:40:56,980 --> 01:41:01,840
Yeah, right so Anna perna Kingdom, okay

1246
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:06,220
This isn't one specifically. I don't know. I know where they would go cuz Disney owns it

1247
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:11,220
but I don't know what it would be there needs to be a

1248
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:12,980
Muppet

1249
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:14,960
Restaurant mm-hmm. What is it? Well?

1250
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:20,320
There is a bad Muppet restaurant in Hollywood Studios called Rizzo's which is a pizzeria

1251
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,480
But there's barely any reference to the Muppets inside

1252
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:28,500
It's just like Rizzo is on the outside of it only recently became full like Fraggle Rock

1253
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,780
Restaurant well sure

1254
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:33,540
What are the crystals I forget they eat something

1255
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,400
I

1256
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:43,960
Know you're the big ogres or whatever and you eat Fraggles all the every meal is

1257
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:50,120
Imagine like

1258
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:54,480
Sausages or other meat products, but they have to like carve them into the shape of a Fraggle

1259
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:59,900
Yeah, and then you get a plate of just fried up. That's that's you eat Fraggle worse

1260
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,200
Idea

1261
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:15,060
I'm wondering if the new the newer the Toy Story land and Hollywood Studios in Magic Kingdom now that we live in a

1262
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:21,300
PF world, and I'm not talking about PFT Paul F. Tonkin talking about chains. No I'm talking about

1263
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:28,960
No, this is you can divide a line in modern society the

1264
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:32,300
Post forky and pre forky

1265
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:37,180
Screams I don't belong

1266
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:44,340
the the craft project that seems to be having an identity crisis that a lot of

1267
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:48,500
Toy Story 4 hinges upon will all the forks now in Toy Story land

1268
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:55,140
Oh good will they look like forky will you use forky to then you throw forky or there's a mass grave of forks in the

1269
01:42:55,140 --> 01:43:00,060
Garbage can someone's someone famously treated forky is no rambi and there

1270
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:03,400
Thing a little tiny puppets not

1271
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:10,760
If you like if you had to eat with a with pipe cleaners

1272
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:17,280
Like and they're permanently attached you can't like dismount them. That's it. That's a deeply unpleasant experience

1273
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:22,040
Yeah, and it's also if people have pointed out isn't forky a spork. Yes

1274
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:28,280
Rounded head sure is you know well, I'm sorry. I keep this thing about more restaurants

1275
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:41,660
I feel like Kung Fu Panda has become a de facto Thanksgiving Day movie always plays on your favorite movie

1276
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:45,540
And your favorite band the con and crows no

1277
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:53,300
Panda saying long December would that be your greatest musical performance if Jack Black's saying

1278
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,780
long December as

1279
01:43:55,780 --> 01:44:01,440
Poe from Kung Fu Panda, but with sincerity. I don't feel like he would sing that song Michael

1280
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:10,940
This is the sort of thing Mike would do is because that Mike Zach and I were on an improv team together for a number of

1281
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,240
Four five

1282
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:20,420
Four five and and we would we would all do this to each other where like you keep bringing up this

1283
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,420
Is this one of your pocket like favorite things?

1284
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:29,560
Yeah, I mean I do I do like Kung Fu Panda a lot. It scratches a lot of issues for me

1285
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:33,260
It's Jack ever seen all Kung Fu Panda against it

1286
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,580
Jason

1287
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,940
I think I've only seen bits and pieces

1288
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:43,540
Movies I'm a man you know Jesus no

1289
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:51,000
Okay, come Kung Fu Panda. It's on almost every Thanksgiving on TV. So like if like what channel every channel

1290
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,960
It's not on every channel. It's on Fox News. It's on CBS

1291
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:04,560
Drug special for for real Kung Fu Panda is is a very good movie. We should have done Kung Fu Panda the 3d movie

1292
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:05,740
I haven't seen it though. I can't

1293
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:12,540
Do that yeah, I for sure will my point was sorry Kung Fu Panda's

1294
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:16,160
Adopted father is a duck that works at a noodles restaurant

1295
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:20,900
I know the duck cuz they have a character of him that has shown up in the parks and he talks to the people

1296
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:26,260
There's a lot of parts. We know it if it's not we don't know all the all the cartoon food and Kung Fu Panda looks very good

1297
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:29,320
there's no reason that there shouldn't be a

1298
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:34,480
Chinese restaurant in Dreamworks that is a kung fu

1299
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,280
That's great

1300
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:47,480
There is our food and accounting crows song you would want to eat I'm gonna think here

1301
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:50,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1302
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:55,660
Hard candy shop an album that really grew on me if I'm gonna be a hard candy

1303
01:45:55,660 --> 01:46:00,180
I always liked and tightest back in the Dreamworks. Yeah counting crows do a

1304
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:06,200
Song what's the problem, baby? What's the problem? I don't know well, maybe

1305
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:18,180
The opening song from Jack to good song Wow well we demand a counting crows presence in Universal Studios

1306
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:21,200
This must have among many other things there's a lot of stuff

1307
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:25,720
We have the counting crows replace the Blues Brothers as the Universal

1308
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:29,380
Resident musical in Adam Durant's wings

1309
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,200
So you've seen all the cars movies I assume

1310
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:41,180
You see the first two okay, you've seen you've seen multiple minions movies Jason

1311
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:42,720
Yes, Despicable Me

1312
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:47,340
One that's not a new movie and the minions. Okay, that's a minions movie

1313
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:51,260
You don't think the people me one and two are minions movie. No, they're Despicable Me

1314
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:56,820
It's come from there. I think I see what you're saying if you're gonna call one minions then that

1315
01:46:58,820 --> 01:46:59,460
Is

1316
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:04,800
There are those are crew movies I've seen some of the minion shorts as well sure

1317
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,960
Your man, so you go down the movies that are worse that we've seen

1318
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:15,660
I'm trying to establish that I know that you guys are not like snobs about watching animation

1319
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:22,540
You like you like Wally up, right? Sure. Yes. Yeah, you saw brave of a very seem brave sure

1320
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:25,760
Okay, so I

1321
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:31,400
Panda is much much better than brave. Have you seen how to train your dragon? I've never seen any

1322
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:39,220
Now those I know are supposed to be very good. Yes. They're anyone go the music is great

1323
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:44,600
I mean you talk about like that's we're minutes away from having that be a theme park

1324
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:48,580
I guarantee you they will make rumors about that going in the third parking universal

1325
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:51,100
It's an incredible world that they've created

1326
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:55,900
Like Wally where you'd have to make like a trash planet and be like come hang out on trash miserable

1327
01:47:55,900 --> 01:48:00,400
Yes, yeah, I cannot I cannot believe that you guys have not seen

1328
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:07,420
The third one's coming out there one's coming out two of them so I can catch up on that I guess to

1329
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:12,560
It's two movies like I'm a bad movie watcher in addition

1330
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,840
Watch in the first 20 minutes

1331
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:20,160
And then I pick up where I left off

1332
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:29,480
When it first came out and now I'm rewatching and I'm savoring it like he savored that 4,000 calorie breakfast

1333
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:32,120
Ten hours of professional wrestling to watch a week

1334
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:38,880
Videos on YouTube and that's about like boycott some of it until they pull their shit out of Saudi Arabia or whatever

1335
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,940
Well, it's not that I'm not saying WWE. Okay. I don't know. That's all WWE. Oh, that's true

1336
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:48,200
You're into a lot of yeah, you're in plenty of other wrestling. Yeah. Yeah, that's all pure and there's nothing problematic

1337
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:56,200
Our stock yes, I sold my sock. Yeah

1338
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:05,080
We socket stock I tried to sell was a bunch of chicken stock

1339
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:18,180
Animation is not theme parks. They feel adjacent enough to me that I don't know why that's so

1340
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:23,700
Surprising to me that you guys haven't seen this a little odd thing that I don't like I'm so theme park

1341
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:28,080
Centric that like I there's a lot of movies. I only know about cuz they're in theme parks

1342
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:32,260
That makes sense. It is different. You're fully correct. I end up

1343
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:39,200
Actually exploring Harry Potter. It'll be because it's the park thing now. That's a Thanksgiving those movies

1344
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,640
They marathon a lot around

1345
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:42,460
holidays

1346
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,260
Is Harry Potter a Thanksgiving movie

1347
01:49:51,260 --> 01:50:03,740
Harry Potter does take place during Thanksgiving. It's kind of the emotional backdrop of it

1348
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:06,380
I think you could argue that it is so it is I guess

1349
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:11,900
Alright, we answered all we solved a lot of debates. We came up a lot of ideas any before we wrap it up

1350
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:16,980
And any any final thoughts about about three broomsticks? Oh, what's everyone's favorite entree to order?

1351
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:22,700
I only had one so the one I had fish and chips. Okay. I think I had a fish and chip a while ago

1352
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:25,900
I think I liked it better than that. What is my sandwich called again that I had

1353
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:32,180
Toasty I think back when I was still eating chicken the the lemon chicken that they had I should try that that's great

1354
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:38,900
It's very good. I I so want them to bring this out here because right now it's only Orlando. They have pasties

1355
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:45,020
Cornish pasties delicious wonderful not a not a common dish to find in America

1356
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:50,560
No, we don't do meat pies super a lot out here, which is shocking because nothing could be more

1357
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:56,300
American than the idea of like taking a bunch of ground-up meat and put it in like a good fried dough thing and

1358
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:59,720
But doing it really really well. There's a place in Scotland. I think it's a chain

1359
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:03,140
I don't know if it's outside of Scotland, but it's called pie maker and

1360
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:08,300
Anytime sorry, I'm talking about Scotland because it's like all of the Harry Potter

1361
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:13,900
Yes, and you've been to Edinburgh, yeah, and Edinburgh is where at JK

1362
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:17,400
Rowling lives when she was writing a decent amount of it

1363
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:24,720
So a lot of that city informs the books in like some ways. I mean that's right up your alley. That's perfect

1364
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:28,780
Yeah, it truly is there. I

1365
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,980
Can't get into it. It would take it would take too long. I'm saying meat pies are very good

1366
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:37,440
It's called pie maker that makes them shout out pie maker. Please open a location in the United States

1367
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:45,200
There apparently was briefly a pie shop on sunset by you see be like a few blocks from there that had like meat pies and

1368
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:51,640
Hand pies and so I don't think it lasted like very long wrong location. Where was it close to East to be sunset like heading east on?

1369
01:51:51,880 --> 01:52:05,400
The perfect place for my fancy meat pie business right next to the improv theater and the vape shops next to the the former

1370
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:06,680
methadone clinic

1371
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:13,020
Yeah, that that's such a bad location that Jason never went there

1372
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:17,260
When it was so close to a place he goes to do sketch comedy

1373
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:24,360
But and you were like such a pain in the

1374
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:30,280
Fly I mean there's a poke place. That's a block away. That's very good that I go a couple of times

1375
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:34,080
So bring me pies

1376
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:38,400
I was a location and make them full of a

1377
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,340
Fraggle meat and kung fu panda meat

1378
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:46,700
I'll say my last thought is I'd like to eat up in the sea like upstairs somewhere

1379
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:50,500
I so I know it's a trick, but I'm like I want to go up to that second

1380
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:57,860
Staircases and yeah, and stuff up there. It's it's it's designed so well the high see that's my that's my final thought of it

1381
01:52:57,860 --> 01:53:03,980
Like the physical building of it the attention to detail the ceiling is so high it makes you feel like you're in a big space

1382
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:09,140
It shuts you out from the outside world. The sound balance is great. It feels like you're walking into another world

1383
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:12,980
Which is exactly what they want and they did it good in terms of infrastructure

1384
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:19,140
I I may have mentioned this before but like operating a full capacity inside and the patio

1385
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:24,080
Holds hundreds of people patio is huge. It doesn't look like it

1386
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,940
I didn't think it looked like when I first went up there

1387
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:32,040
But when I really walked around the patio, I was like, yeah, I could see how this could hold three five hundred people

1388
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:37,960
It's real big and if you go and it's kind of almost closing which is very early if Universal Studios for reasons

1389
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,260
That still boggles my mind. Um

1390
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:42,640
it's like pretty empty and

1391
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:49,460
Sometimes you can pick your table and it's just like it feels it feels like a real wizard restaurant. Yes. Yeah

1392
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:54,300
Yeah, you can actually have like little moments of peace up there. It's pretty nice

1393
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:59,640
Well, it's a very nice note to end on Zachary and I used to five podcasts the bride

1394
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:05,720
Thanks for being here that was a bit just a pleasant for that wasn't like a hater II

1395
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:12,780
Talking shit about things that was just a that was a delight is this place is very nice and go to it if you're in

1396
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:14,940

1397

Perhaps our friend the correct the people who did the that's from Disneyland Gallery where we did our live show and we had a yeah

1408
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:16,700
We had a wonderful feast there

1409
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:20,940
Tummies are too full you wash your hands under those golden goose

1410
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:28,480
No goose where's a golden goose I saw pictures from the bathroom and apparently like the sink faucets are gold

1411
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:32,660
Maybe this is just the ladies bathroom. I saw pictures from the ladies bathroom taking my cap

1412
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:34,560
I think she went well, that's the way

1413
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,760
That's the one place you're not supposed to take picture in the club

1414
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,580
Or any bathroom it is out well
