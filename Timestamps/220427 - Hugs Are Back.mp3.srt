1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,200
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,320
We've got a couple fun things on tap today.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,680
A little bit later in the show,

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,440
I'm gonna talk about, this is Scott Garner, by the way,

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,120
joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,960
Hi, fellas.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
Hello there, good to see you.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,040
Yeah, so a little later in the show,

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,440
I'm gonna talk about my recent trip to Las Vegas

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,300
to experience Chris Angel's restaurant, Kablip,

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,840
and his new show at Planet Hollywood, A Mystica.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,920
So looking forward to that, that's coming up.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,920
But before that, hugs are back!

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,480
What?

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,360
Hugs are back!

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,200
Hugs!

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,000
Hugs!

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,080
Hugs are back, ladies and gentlemen.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,280
Gentlemen, I ask you, where my hug at?

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
Where my hug at?

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,920
It's right here, it's wherever you want it to be.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,680
And it's at, well, most importantly,

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,160
it's at the Disney resorts worldwide, maybe.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,720
I don't know, nationwide.

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,560
Nationwide, at least.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,240
Nationwide, Hong Kong back open.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,400
Hugs could potentially be there.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Okay, okay.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,440
But mainly hugs at the one that we're close to.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,440
We could drive right now and get a hug from our favorites

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,480
because there's no more ban.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,840
The hug ban is gone.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,040
The hug ban is gone.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,480
The iron curtain of the hug ban has been torn down,

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,400
torched, they burnt the curtain up.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,300
We are no longer prevented from hugging all of our pals.

38
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,200
If you don't know what we're talking about,

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,360
Disneyland, okay, obviously many elements of it.

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,440
The whole park shut down for a long time, as we know.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,640
For the pandemic. Disneyland, yes.

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,600
As did Disney World and all the Disney parks.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,840
And they've all come back in waves.

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
The rides are back, but there's plexiglass

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,920
and the shows are gone.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
But as the months have gone on,

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
we're finally restoring everything.

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,320
And the big thing was the characters are around,

49
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,480
but they are distanced.

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,380
Maybe they're standing up on the train station,

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,220
as we've seen.

52
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,620
And they wave as an opportunity to take selfies,

53
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,640
but there's no physical contact.

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,980
But one of the final elements of the Disney experience

55
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,200
to restore has been fully restored, and that's hugs.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,880
You can hug.

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,000
We're hugging again.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,100
We're hugging at the parks again, folks.

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,760
I think the interesting thing about all this,

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,520
and this is all kind of stemming from

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,920
specifically a New York Times article,

62
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,960
the headline being,

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,840
After a Two Year Ban, Hugs Are Back at Disneyland.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,320
Weird thing to see in the New York Times.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,240
It's the coverage, kind of across the board,

66
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,640
giving us the willies a little,

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,040
of everyone agreeing upon the phrase, hugs are back.

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,640
So I did see one or two more levelheaded publications go,

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
traditional character meet and greets are back.

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,480
Little clearer.

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,440
Yes, yeah.

72
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,520
I think that's the odd thing that's going on here.

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,280
Okay, all these publications, hugs are back.

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
Let me go through a couple more.

75
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,840
This is a local one, Coast FM.

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,080
It's official, we're hugging at Disneyland again.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,560
LAist, Disneyland wants your hugs again.

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,400
What?

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,540
Disneyland didn't want our hugs.

80
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,440
We wanted to give them to Disneyland,

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,160
but they wouldn't accept them.

82
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,360
That's a weird one.

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,920
Disneyland wants your hug.

84
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
Disneyland wants your hugs.

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,600
Disneyland is powered by your hugs.

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,560
Bring your energy to Disneyland.

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Just the idea that ever it was state,

88
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,880
we don't want your hug.

89
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,240
You can come into the park, but you put that mask on.

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
You cover up your filthy mouth,

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,560
and we don't want one hug out of you, okay?

92
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,520
We don't want you hugging your family, not here.

93
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
You do that at home.

94
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,200
We certainly don't want you hugging Mickey Mouse

95
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
and Donald Duck.

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,960
They're special, and if they get sick,

97
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,440
the whole company goes down.

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,560
Yeah, that is the tone of these headlines.

99
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,960
Yes, you're right.

100
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,640
There's a lot of severity

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,960
mixed with, throughout the copy of these articles,

102
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,480
this notion of the hug ban,

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,480
which this phrase I take some exception to.

104
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,240
I am not convinced that ever there was a discussion

105
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,200
at the deepest levels of the Disney company

106
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,520
where they used the phrase hug ban.

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,320
This is not, right?

108
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
I don't think so.

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,600
I don't think there was a need to do that.

110
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,280
Like I need to say that phrase.

111
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,120
Yeah, I kind of self explanatory in the distance.

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,440
Did Dr. Fauci say there was a ban on hugs?

113
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,880
Did he ever say that phrase?

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,400
I understood the distancing thing,

115
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,640
but did he ever, I'm trying to remember the Fauci impression.

116
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,480
What is it?

117
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,680
This guy, he talks like this, right?

118
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,000
Like, is a ban on hugs?

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,440
We can't hug anymore.

120
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,160
Yeah, is this in the current, you know,

121
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,800
hissy fits of like the DeSantis crew.

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,720
And it's like, and the hugs aren't even

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,600
on top of everything else.

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
There's a hug ban.

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,520
Yeah, I could see like,

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,160
what I'm trying to remember is if there was ever

127
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
one of those Jim Jordan,

128
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,120
those 10 minute back and forth that you see on Twitter,

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
him grilling Fauci, getting nowhere,

130
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,120
Fauci answering every question,

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
but him like getting all flustered.

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Is it, well, okay, well,

133
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
we're not answering that one, are we?

134
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
No, he did.

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,240
He clearly did.

136
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,080
Oh, yeah.

137
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,320
Like, was there ever that exchange?

138
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,320
And yet you say, you explicitly said,

139
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,400
no, there's a hug ban.

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,240
You put a hug ban.

141
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
Do you know what that's doing to our kids?

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,960
My son can't hug Horace Horace Collar.

143
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,040
He hugs him once a month.

144
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,520
It's for his therapy.

145
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,280
My little girl, my little, my six month old,

146
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,720
she can't go hug the rabbit.

147
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,240
What's the name of the rabbit who,

148
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,280
it was the old character before Mickey.

149
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
What's the name of the rabbit?

150
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,280
I don't know.

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,680
She, but she, look, she loves it.

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,560
She doesn't know his name.

153
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,640
I don't know his name, but she loves the rabbit.

154
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,520
Senator, Senator, you're referring to Oswald,

155
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,600
the lucky rabbit, Senator.

156
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,440
Am I?

157
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,280
I don't know.

158
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,840
Now you're, you're telling me that.

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,320
You're saying Oswald's his name.

160
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,640
He is, his name is, well, Senator, his name is Oswald.

161
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, I see, I see.

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,320
So we dictate from on high the name of the rabbit.

163
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,640
Senator, I give you an answer to the question.

164
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,160
Jim Jordan, not a man I ever want to associate

165
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,280
with the concept of a hug.

166
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,040
Don't whatever, I would recommend people

167
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,520
not let their children anywhere near him either.

168
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
A lot of these folks.

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,560
A lot of these folks.

170
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,200
Yeah, a lot of them are, I don't know about him specifically,

171
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,240
but a lot of these people are on record

172
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,560
with hug related issues, I would say.

173
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
That's true, yeah.

174
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,520
So wait, and then there's one more.

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,200
So there's the severity of the hug man.

177
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,680
What you get, like what, how did this play out at Disneyland?

178
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,160
Okay, we're starting to, we're gonna reopen the parks.

179
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
What did they actually say?

180
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,520
It must have been something closer to,

181
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
well, the character, that's tough

182
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
because we still have the social distance

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,680
so maybe there's something we can do

184
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
to, you know, they can wave from,

185
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
they're still on opportunity.

186
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,480
There is no way that any, but unless,

187
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,960
unless we have characterized Chay Peck as being a heel

188
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,000
and he has shown his evil cards in the recent past,

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,400
did he come in, I don't know if he,

190
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
I don't think he carries a cane,

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,640
but maybe just for evil purposes, he carries a cane,

192
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,160
he whacked it on the conference table and said,

193
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,600
hug ban, that's what it is.

194
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,560
We're all beating around the bush here.

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,200
Hug ban is what we're doing.

196
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,360
You mean like a madman meeting

197
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
where he just wanted to underline

198
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,440
exactly what they were getting at it.

199
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,240
Like, it would get to the core of the idea

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
of what we're selling here

201
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
and we're selling that we're banning hugs.

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,320
That's gonna be this new policy going forward.

203
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,280
Mm-hmm, yeah.

204
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
And yeah, he has a cane.

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,600
I assume it's like a diamond encrusted cane.

206
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Like whatever the,

207
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Poppins banker, head banker.

208
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,720
I was gonna say like kingpin, can't type cane.

209
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
More like kingpin, yeah.

210
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
Yeah, we brought the kingpin up recently.

211
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,160
One of our favorite characters in fiction.

212
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,280
Yeah.

213
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,600
Yeah, so yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

214
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,080
I bet he wears that big white coat too around Chay Peck,

215
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,320
that is the big white kingpin coat.

216
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,600
Oh yeah, yeah, probably.

217
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
Yeah.

218
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Well, I see, is there maybe kind of like a,

219
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,640
you know how Oswald Cobblepot

220
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,840
like cleans himself up for appearances?

221
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,400
Like when he's making his mayoral appearances

222
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,680
in Batman Returns.

223
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,520
Right.

224
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
He's a little more dressed

225
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,000
and that's the Chay Peck we see.

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,720
But Chay Peck behind closed doors

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,640
has like bile running down his chin.

228
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
That's a full, full penguin.

229
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,960
The black blood, the fish bits, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,160
He definitely has black blood, yeah.

231
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080
Like the penguin.

232
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,360
He just orders big pictures of black blood.

233
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,520
Yeah, that's, yes.

234
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,440
Scared assistants bring it in.

235
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,520
Which also is in the commissary is labeled

236
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,320
Walt's favorite black blood, like most food items.

237
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,040
It's starting to get to the point.

238
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,480
I saw someone say, there was one of the buffets,

239
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,880
it's like there are 13 items labeled Walt's blank.

240
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
Really?

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,120
Between desserts and main courses.

242
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,280
And it's just like, what?

243
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,920
Walt's poke, I don't think they had that in his time.

244
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,480
Well, it's beloved crow nut.

245
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,080
Smoothies were not popular at this time.

246
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,120
Let's add the other CEOs if we're doing this then.

247
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,080
You know, E. Card Walker's favorite cobbler or something.

248
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Favorite dip.

249
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Favorite dip.

250
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
Michael's.

251
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,480
Jell-O molds.

252
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,600
Yeah.

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
Michael's favorite.

254
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,280
Michael's favorite pudding.

255
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,560
In the 80s, Michael's favorite cocaine.

256
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,480
Cocaine, yeah.

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,080
Oh yeah, favorite Chasta, favorite Tab.

258
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
Oh yeah, there you go.

259
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Yeah.

260
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,120
Yeah.

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
So anyway, this all just strange to me.

262
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,280
The real journalists are writing about the hug ban.

263
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,640
And then the craziest one,

264
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,080
this headline goes on a little longer,

265
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,440
but the beginning of USA Today's headline about this,

266
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,080
Miss Warm Hugs.

267
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,040
Warm?

268
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,480
Who brought warm into it?

269
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,320
Hang on.

270
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,160
The warmth of hugs is not exclusive to Disney parks.

271
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,000
No.

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
I have hugged people in this time.

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,200
I have not waited to hug people

274
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,480
since the beginning of this hug ban.

275
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,240
And when I've hugged people, there's been warmth off of there,

276
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
but the human body is warm.

277
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,600
I would say a character hug is probably less likely

278
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,320
to be warm because you're hugging fabric.

279
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
That, yeah, there's a barrier

280
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
between the heat of the human body and the,

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,120
I mean, unless somebody's really overheating in that costume.

282
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
Yeah, some of those costumes, I mean,

283
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,640
might absorb the heat of the sun.

284
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,400
But I feel like they're pretty stiff.

285
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
They're pretty sturdy

286
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,920
because they gotta be used for a while and take a beating.

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,960
They've got to absorb a lot of hugs.

288
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah.

289
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,640
Have to be hug resistant.

290
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
Rough felt.

291
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,400
Rough felt.

292
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,080
And a lot of those, I guess a lot of the characters,

293
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,600
like have, the fabric is black

294
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,480
and that's absorbing a lot of heat.

295
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
That's true.

296
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,400
You could end up with some pretty extreme warm

297
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,360
because of that.

298
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,040
Here's what I'll say about the warm hug discussion

299
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
we're having here.

300
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,880
I don't believe I've hugged, oh no,

301
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,720
I've hugged Chewbacca because he forces you to hug him.

302
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,960
I've got, yeah, Chewbacca on here.

303
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,560
But I haven't hugged a character,

304
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
like Chewbacca is the only character in years

305
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,840
that I've hugged.

306
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Have I taken photos with him?

307
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,400
Of course, I still like doing that.

308
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,680
But I don't go up and hug them usually, I don't think.

309
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,960
Or maybe I, wait, hold on, maybe I hugged Mickey

310
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,040
in Orlando.

311
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,400
He wants to hug you in his magic show.

312
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
It's not conscious.

313
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,080
Like reading about all this stuff

314
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
and reading about families being excited they were back,

315
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,640
I was like, oh okay, sometimes I like to get,

316
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,000
see a couple angles on a topic or a few angles on this.

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,400
This is definitely one that until people

318
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,800
started covering it, I hadn't really considered that.

319
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,520
Oh yeah, kids can run up and grab the characters.

320
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,360
Yeah.

321
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,840
It's good, I'm for this by the way.

322
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,880
I know, I know, I know.

323
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm just trying to think of the warm.

324
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
I just, people would be more normal about it.

325
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,120
As you were saying that, I was trying to figure out

326
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,160
if I can remember the heat of the hugs from the characters.

327
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,720
And at first I said I don't think I've hugged

328
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
many characters, but as I go back through it,

329
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,920
I think I've hugged a lot of characters in the last decade

330
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,760
if I think about it.

331
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,200
Like Minnie hugs you, she's hugged me many times.

332
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,480
You're playing real cool here.

333
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,800
Have I hugged, I'm not sure.

334
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,640
That's where my mind went.

335
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,080
Who have I hugged?

336
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,920
Cause I didn't think I, but I'm like,

337
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm sure Mike hugged Minnie.

338
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,640
Like guarantee it.

339
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,920
I've hugged Minnie a couple times,

340
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,200
but it's not because I'm forcing a hug.

341
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,880
I just want, first of all, one of them was

342
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,980
a character breakfast at the Contemporary,

343
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,160
like seven years ago.

344
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
She comes over and hugs me, okay?

345
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,320
She hugged me.

346
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,800
I didn't go like, come here.

347
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,440
Like I didn't do the fingers or anything.

348
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,680
Like there's a photo and she comes over.

349
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,200
Like the natural gesture when you wanna hug,

350
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,880
your fingers all go out all spindly like a witch.

351
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,560
Yeah, I didn't do that.

352
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,440
The fingers.

353
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,680
But it depends.

354
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,960
I think certain characters invite the hug more than others.

355
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,920
So a lot of the characters,

356
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,760
I feel like if we've ever taken photos with them,

357
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,360
just give you like a little handshake

358
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,480
or a little acknowledgement.

359
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,400
Yeah, like a little pat.

360
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,760
I don't think Ruella DeVille is going in for a big one.

361
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
With an adult man.

362
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah.

363
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,440
With maybe a kid she is.

364
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,680
Maybe with a kid.

365
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,440
But I think Minnie is instructed to hug everyone.

366
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,360
It's more, it's Minnie's personality.

367
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,680
Yeah.

368
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,960
So I think it depends.

369
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,600
Can I read from this New York Times piece,

370
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,680
there was a little chunk that kinda hit me.

371
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,520
A little chunk.

372
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Hit me for a couple.

373
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,360
Little hug chunk.

374
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,200
Little hug chunk.

375
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Little hug chunk.

376
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
When it reopened last April

377
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,760
with extensive health related modifications,

378
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,080
Mickey and Minnie and their cohorts

379
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,360
were kept at a distance from guests.

380
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,280
No hugs, no autographs, no secrets whispered in little ears,

381
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,120
only waving from afar,

382
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
which bummed out some families so much

383
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,240
that they canceled or postponed their trips.

384
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
So yeah, item one.

385
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,880
Little secrets whispered?

386
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,720
Little secrets whispered.

387
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Little secrets, no secrets whispered in little ears.

388
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,840
So this is the children specifically.

389
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,040
Does that happen?

390
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,640
Don't, I'm here to say, don't.

391
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Just don't.

392
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,960
Like you cannot, I'm not,

393
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,120
I don't wanna give any credence to the psychos

394
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
in the press right now,

395
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,840
but that's weird regardless of anything.

396
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,280
But is the, what is this possibly based on?

397
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,120
What do you mean?

398
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,640
Is anyone at any interaction that you,

399
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,600
now granted our ears aren't little anymore.

400
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
No.

401
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,040
We don't have little ears, we have big ears.

402
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
But. Big ears.

403
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't, when you were a kid,

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,280
did a character whisper you a secret?

405
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,880
I can see the tableau,

406
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,200
I can see the miming that like, you know,

407
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Chippendale leaning in to whisper,

408
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,680
but not actually saying anything.

409
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,880
Minnie makes the smooch.

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Yeah, Minnie makes the smooch.

411
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
For adult men.

412
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,640
That's the closest I think that has kind of,

413
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,680
it happened to you, a secret smooch.

414
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,080
Multiple smooches, multiple minis.

415
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,160
For multiple minis.

416
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,760
On both coasts, I believe.

417
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,720
Bicoastal smooch sounds is what's happened to me.

418
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,560
Mike's mackin' with minis all over the world.

419
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,600
Yeah, that's true, but they weren't secret,

420
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,360
I didn't get a little secret.

421
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Yeah.

422
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,040
So.

423
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,480
And here's the weirdest thing,

424
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,080
is that that struck me as well, that's very bizarre.

425
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,240
Then I read the LAist article,

426
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,080
which is of course Disneyland wants your hugs again.

427
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,600
It's been more than two years since Disney characters

428
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,400
mingled with theme park guests,

429
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,640
rubbing noses, whispering secrets,

430
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,160
and most importantly, offering hugs.

431
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,640
What do you mean, two?

432
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,480
What?

433
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,560
Whispering secrets?

434
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,720
Talking about whispered secrets?

435
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,920
Is this on some sort of official Disney copy?

436
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,040
Cause Disney on their like Instagram

437
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,200
was using some of the hugs are back terminology.

438
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,400
But are they the ones being like,

439
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,440
we can whisper secrets again?

440
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,960
Secrets are back, little secrets,

441
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,560
little warm secrets are back.

442
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,880
What is, what are we,

443
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,280
I think this is all weirdly applied by these writers,

444
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,120
unless I'm crazy.

445
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,880
Do listeners out there have stories of little secrets

446
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,800
being whispered in warm ears?

447
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,160
Cause you're not, they're not allowed to talk.

448
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,680
Yes, yeah.

449
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,320
Only is that, so is the idea out there like,

450
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm not supposed to talk, but I'm talking only to you.

451
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
Cause they should be arrested if they're doing it.

452
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,960
Come on, lean in, lean in.

453
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,680
Goofy wants to tell you a secret.

454
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,000
I hit a man with my car and I drove off.

455
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,720
Don't tell your parents.

456
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
Is that a, is that a?

457
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
I have two, Goofy wants to tell you a secret.

458
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,720
I'm two children stacked on top of each other.

459
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,840
What are they saying?

460
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,240
I'm naked in here.

461
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Yeah, of course.

462
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,720
That's what, that's the nightmare of the psychos

463
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,840
Jason's talking about.

464
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,760
When you get to college,

465
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,480
you can abandon your traditional family values.

466
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,320
Yeah.

467
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
That is not, I think what those people are talking about

468
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,440
in those articles.

469
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,080
Yeah, I don't think so.

470
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
Also, are the, like, are the secrets from the character

471
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
or from the person playing the character?

472
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,840
Or like, you know, is, is like Jane Doe and actress

473
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,360
in a suit whispering Jane Doe related secrets

474
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,960
via the guys of the, of the, the Daisy suit that she's in.

475
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,800
Right.

476
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,720
Or is, yeah, Mickey like leaking Disney with secrets

477
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,160
in character, is the performer leaking in character?

478
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,720
I saw a screening of Lightyear earlier this week.

479
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,560
Not good.

480
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,640
Like, what is it?

481
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,760
The hair deck has a lot of problems.

482
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,520
It's just the shape.

483
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,000
It's the face.

484
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
I don't know.

485
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,680
Everything's off.

486
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,640
He looks like Sonic somehow.

487
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,440
The early version of Sonic.

488
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,720
Long Sonic.

489
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,720
It's like they took the teeth right out of the first one

490
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,240
and put them in the, put them in Lightyear's mouth.

491
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,520
They're reusing, we bought, Disney bought Sonic's teeth

492
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,720
and got them cheap because nobody wanted them.

493
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,400
I don't know why.

494
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Don't tell anyone kid.

495
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
This is a secret.

496
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,560
They try to make a joke in the movie about like,

497
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,000
this isn't based on the toy.

498
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,600
It's based on the man who was the toy was based on

499
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,360
and it just doesn't land.

500
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,880
Hey, where are you going?

501
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm trying to finish this secret.

502
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,240
Come on kid.

503
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,800
I got 20 minutes that I got to change

504
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,040
and get over to Universal where I'm a minion.

505
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,600
I got minion secrets to tell.

506
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,760
I don't know.

507
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,840
I don't know what this means.

508
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,720
This is strange.

509
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,640
This is journal.

510
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,920
Are we all, I don't think we like to invoke the phrase

511
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,400
fake news, but is that what's happening here?

512
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,240
I guess.

513
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
Is the dying New York Times,

514
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,360
the dying and lying New York Times making up,

515
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,280
seek whispering secrets to us

516
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,800
about secrets that don't happen?

517
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,520
Well, I mean, if you go to YouTube

518
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,240
and search hugs are back Disney,

519
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,920
you get a lot of results.

520
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,120
So again, everyone agreed on this right.

521
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,960
Just like everyone agreed on like, well, what's worth?

522
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,200
What is worth mean to you?

523
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,760
What is Star Wars worth to you?

524
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,920
A couple months rent, a couple months,

525
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,760
few months rent.

526
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,960
Strange group think that got us to hugs are back

527
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,520
and also to whispered, whispered warm little secrets.

528
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,360
Warm little secrets.

529
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,960
Now, how about this?

530
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,640
Do you get secrets if you meet Peter Pan?

531
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,320
He is a face character.

532
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,520
So he's allowed to speak.

533
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,880
Gaston is allowed to speak.

534
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,240
Face characters at a whole other level of strange.

535
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,400
Cause I sure, but couldn't,

536
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,160
but they potentially can give you little little secrets.

537
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

538
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
I choked on little don't want good.

539
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,920
You should, you should choke on all of this.

540
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,280
I don't want to know Peter Pan's little secrets.

541
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,120
I don't know.

542
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,560
You've got pretty much an open book.

543
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,120
I don't know that you hopefully have much to worry about.

544
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,040
That's maybe my issue with him is how,

545
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,080
what an open book he is.

546
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,360
I think maybe he can button it up a little more.

547
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm going to visit you tonight, Scott.

548
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,400
I know where you live.

549
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,320
The biggest secret of all is you can be a boy forever.

550
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,760
Even if you lock your doors,

551
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,840
I prefer coming in through windows.

552
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
The internet's made it easy to find everyone's address, Scott.

553
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,680
No.

554
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,520
Do do do do do do.

555
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
Peter Pan has the internet.

556
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,560
Yeah. And he knows secrets.

557
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,040
Yeah. He is the same who is lookup ability

558
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,800
that Taylor Lorenz does in the Washington Post.

559
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,560
So maybe, maybe these are the characters

560
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,000
that will tell you a little secret.

561
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,840
Is the ones that are,

562
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,280
have a human face and are allowed to freely speak

563
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,240
to the guests.

564
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,080
I don't know.

565
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,200
I haven't gotten a secret from one of them,

566
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
but I'm saying perhaps.

567
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,160
I have to think the guests are so much weirder

568
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
to the face care.

569
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,560
Like, cause I know they can spend a little more time

570
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,880
on stage cause they're not hampered.

571
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,040
A lot of them are, you know, indoor meet and greets now

572
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,840
with the princess fairy tale halls, those kinds of things.

573
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,840
So they're, they have to get out of the suits less.

574
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,320
They, so they spend like more time in front of the crowds.

575
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,600
Right. So are you saying they have more or less time

576
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,040
for giving the secrets?

577
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,920
They've got more time for giving secrets.

578
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,760
Okay.

579
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,400
But I feel like the,

580
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,320
the guests might be the ones giving them secrets.

581
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,640
Being extremely secret.

582
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,840
Oh, I'm sure there's little secrets being given

583
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,200
by the guests to the performers constantly.

584
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,040
Yeah.

585
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,880
Yeah.

586
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,240
I guess that maybe that's what they mean.

587
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,080
Maybe.

588
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,160
You go, the hugs are back.

589
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,040
You can go hug one of the rescuers.

590
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,200
And if you have a secret, it'll be safe with Bernard.

591
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,560
I don't resent them,

592
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,160
but this is a marriage of convenience now.

593
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,480
And then Bernard guy and Bernard suit just

594
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,200
left there like, uh, what do I do with this information?

595
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,920
Bernard, the love is gone.

596
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,760
Bernard, what do I do?

597
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,600
How do you and Bianca keep it fresh after so much time?

598
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,040
You're so different.

599
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,840
She's so much classier than you.

600
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,800
How does it distract?

601
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,640
Oh, I guess that's a trick.

602
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,520
They learned.

603
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
Wait, oh, I see.

604
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,120
So maybe us growing apart, maybe we need to go more apart

605
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,520
and that'll bring us more together.

606
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,600
You solved our marriage.

607
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,440
He shrugs.

608
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,480
Just like, hey, okay.

609
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,040
Tip of the hat shrug, the two things they can do.

610
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,880
Mime's hopping on that giant bird.

611
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Fly away on.

612
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,320
Falls backwards.

613
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,000
Is there a, do the characters have,

614
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,640
cause they have their handlers.

615
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,480
Do they, is there something they can do?

616
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,080
Can they tug on the arm of the handler?

617
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,360
There's, oh, there's a panic.

618
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,200
There's a panic motion.

619
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,040
Yeah.

620
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,760
I've been told too many uncomfortable secrets today.

621
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,120
I need to go freshen up backstage all of a sudden.

622
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,800
Oh yeah, Bernard is feeling, he's feeling a little warm.

623
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,360
He needs to go have a soft drink.

624
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,840
He remembered a mystery he needs to go investigate.

625
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,440
I'll be back in a few minutes.

626
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,640
To rescue his appetite.

627
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,680
This is all so strange to me.

628
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,960
Jason, also you're right.

629
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
There is some, there's a weird thing going on here.

630
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,120
I think we all, look, I would love to spend

631
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,920
as little time as possible in my life

632
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,760
and on the podcast talking about this new thing,

633
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
which is anyone who disagrees with you about anything,

634
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,560
you just call them a groomer.

635
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,880
It's the most bizarre, dark, dark.

636
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,240
Everyone stop and think about how fucking dark that is.

637
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,920
And it just happens all the time.

638
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,080
Our elected officials just throw that out there every day.

639
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,600
So it's weird that there's so much of that

640
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,200
flying in Disney's direction because of this don't say gay.

641
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,960
So all that's going, that's the point of view

642
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,320
of like hardcore conservatives is Disney are groomers.

643
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,840
And the further you go, there was just a crazy protest

644
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,840
at the Disney lot that's all the most insane Q bullshit ever.

645
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,840
They moved from Tin Horn Flats,

646
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,880
which is a bar that was run by a Q guy.

647
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
Little bit north.

648
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,280
Yeah, not far from here.

649
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,680
That was an old like kind of saloon type place.

650
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,200
And then all those people moved from that weekly thing

651
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,640
over to protest.

652
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
It feels like that.

653
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,300
It's not weekly.

654
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,140
They only did it once.

655
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,960
Yeah, yeah.

656
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,720
They did it once and there were some smaller ones

657
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,680
during the shutdown.

658
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Every now and then I'd see like a couple people around there.

659
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,440
But yeah, and also to be sure,

660
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,760
a lot of those people commuting in,

661
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,320
like not exactly local, I'm sure maybe a handful.

662
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,360
And some people just walking by going, what is this?

663
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,400
But yeah, a lot of-

664
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,200
As part of all that, whatever, it's a catch all.

665
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
I don't think they even all know what they're pro,

666
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
cause some people are just like,

667
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,240
don't get mixed up in politics, Disney, all the way to,

668
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,840
well, Disneyland has underground mines

669
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,640
where they capture children and make them,

670
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,800
whoa, whoa, what are we talking about here?

671
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,400
And it's now, they're bringing back all of the,

672
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,440
you know those stupid, like the letters spell out sex

673
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,280
and the Lion King, the things we've been talking about

674
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,360
since we were nine.

675
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,200
The rescuers.

676
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,600
They're all back and they're all proven.

677
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,080
Oh, the rescuers, there you go.

678
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah, the picture, the one second of nudity, right?

679
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,760
There's like a piece of-

680
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,240
Is that, I always get them confused.

681
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,600
That one rigid tools.

682
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
I've talked about rigid tools before.

683
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,200
I think that's from the Roger Rabbit short.

684
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,680
Yeah, that's not, no, that this is,

685
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,840
there was just like a literally,

686
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,800
like if you would have to freeze frame on one second,

687
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,040
somebody put a true like picture of like a naked somebody

688
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,240
in that movie.

689
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,080
Got you.

690
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,920
And the animators just snuck that in for fun.

691
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,040
Single frame.

692
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,880
For fun, yeah.

693
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,160
Just a little fun.

694
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,280
Anyway, all that stuff that,

695
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,920
there is not one example of it past 1994.

696
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,760
It's all back.

697
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,680
It's all proof that they are like,

698
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,880
what's the like, Adrena Chrome, all Adrena Chrome,

699
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,720
all that stuff.

700
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,560
Yeah.

701
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,380
This is mad.

702
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,320
Anyway, this all is, it's the miserable pocket of humanity

703
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,440
that's opened up.

704
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,320
But so there's all that and that's what Disney is.

705
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,520
And they're indoctrinating children and all these horrors.

706
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,520
But then also Disney stopped allowing hugs in the park.

707
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,080
And then you end up with like this horrible account,

708
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,480
Libs of TikTok.

709
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,320
Oh yeah.

710
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,680
They took a video of a girl who's running up to hug

711
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,800
Winnie the Pooh.

712
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,280
And then somebody, a Disney employee, the handler,

713
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,720
dives in front as if like, no, no, no, do not.

714
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,360
It is bizarre to watch and it's strange that we're at this

715
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,600
point in our society, but it's the disease, not the,

716
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,120
whatever they think is going on.

717
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,320
But okay, so this video is posted with the tweet,

718
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,080
pathetic, never forget what they did to the children.

719
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,800
So we want hugs.

720
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,360
We want all the hugs, but also Disney, our pedophile groomers.

721
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,240
What, how do you?

722
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,080
Scott, it's almost like you're saying that some of these

723
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,080
people are insincere in their actual beliefs and they might

724
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,360
be just saying shit to fucking flamethrow and try to win some.

725
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,200
Just making.

726
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,040
Dumb proof.

727
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,120
I'm just saying it sounds like that's what you're saying.

728
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,160
These are human beings and humans surely who would never

729
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,440
resort to this kind of will never be happy or satisfied.

730
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,360
You mean, you mean to tell me that much of American life

731
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,520
in every aspect is just based on people openly lying

732
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,160
to your face and getting away with it.

733
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
And then when you go, you're lying, you're making this up.

734
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,920
They go like, no.

735
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
What is that?

736
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,080
They duck away.

737
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,160
They have, that's the emoji with no mouth on it.

738
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't know.

739
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I mean, I, I, I saw a couple of people like, look,

740
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,440
if you step back and look at this, all the people screaming

741
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,920
about pedophile and like secret stuff about it, it's all like,

742
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,400
this is just an insane right wing.

743
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,080
Like this is the current flavor, not just of like the,

744
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,880
every five to 10 years, there's a wave of anti LGBTQ hate

745
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,440
that just bubbles up.

746
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,080
But also it's just like, oh, they're also trying to get

747
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,360
people to not watch sports.

748
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,400
They're complaining about the NBA, the NFL being too woke

749
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,760
now. So they're just trying to cut off stuff that like

750
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,160
families or middle America does like Disney organized sport,

751
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,320
like just to solely keep them in the insane, you know,

752
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,840
the insane asylum of right wing media of reactionary media.

753
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,280
You cut them off from anything where they might find a

754
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,760
community of other people who are different than them or a

755
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,840
community of shared interests outside of whatever Donald

756
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,240
Trump's toilet rant is this week, like whatever insane thing

757
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,400
is going on or isolating them from like any entertainment or

758
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,520
experience that might give joy or, or might like help them

759
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,440
step away from all of the, the, the myriad of things that make

760
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,840
them full of rage.

761
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,760
No, they need to be, it can only rage rage 24 hours a day.

762
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
About a thousand things.

763
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,320
Yeah. Yeah. So it's just, yeah, it's just, it's not, I think I

764
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,400
said on the heritage USA, it's like, we've just all given up

765
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,720
on shared realities.

766
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,600
Like you can't rationally talk to a lot of these people.

767
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Like you can't try to win them back to reality because so many

768
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,920
are so far gone.

769
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,760
Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,040
But they're God willing, hopefully not the biggest cross

771
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,400
section of the country.

772
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,720
They're just the loudest.

773
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

774
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,560
And the most irritating with the worst social media presence

775
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,880
you've ever seen.

776
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:29,400
All that darkness said, like, look, it's all the hugs are good.

777
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,720
I, as far as like that, like this is now on the table for, for

778
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,600
children. That's great.

779
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,360
That's nice.

780
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't know that I fully buy it.

781
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,440
I guess parents, you know, parents would have to say if it

782
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,960
is true that like that their kids were like crushed by the

783
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,600
inability to hug the characters, I guess, you know, that probably

784
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,600
is true in some cases.

785
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,120
Yeah.

786
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,480
I don't know if it's like, if it's fully across the board, I

787
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,120
feel like there's a lot of reasonable, like, oh, yeah,

788
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,480
sorry, we can't do that right now, but we will.

789
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,520
I don't know if that's like, that's going to be the number

790
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,160
one topic when the child turns 21 and is in therapy is that for

791
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,040
two years they couldn't.

792
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,400
That's well, that's what I'm saying about this.

793
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,920
Never forget what they did to the children.

794
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,920
That's implying is like scarred because of this one, you know,

795
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,360
how kids remember everything that happened to them before two

796
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,000
and a half.

797
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,520
Yeah.

798
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,040
This will, this is sending them on the course to like a drug

799
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,560
addiction.

800
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,400
Oh yeah.

801
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,440
Also children are disciplined all the time.

802
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,160
Like, and that the other thing,

803
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,680
Oh yes.

804
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Imagine a kid being told, don't do that.

805
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,200
Yeah.

806
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,480
Unprecedented.

807
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,120
The other thing I saw people pointing out is that like these,

808
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,280
the people most like frothing in the mouth about pedophiles,

809
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,800
they're not helicopter parents.

810
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,040
They're not raising their kids diligently.

811
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,720
They give the kids the iPad.

812
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,680
They check out.

813
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,120
The kids can find anything on the internet.

814
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,160
Like God knows what they're looking at.

815
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,240
Yeah, absolutely.

816
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,560
The yeah, I don't, I also wonder what those videos like did the

817
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,960
like conservative parent like send the child to poo to get that

818
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,600
video.

819
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,880
Oh yeah.

820
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,160
Because I bet, I bet.

821
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,520
Yeah.

822
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,560
Like that's, that's total like red meat,

823
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,840
video content for all those terrible sites.

824
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,840
So I wouldn't be shocked if that was like, they saw that that would have,

825
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,760
they knew that would happen and they sent their kid in to be a prop in their

826
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
political game.

827
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,880
Oh yeah.

828
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,760
A hundred percent.

829
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,680
Like, yeah, like the weird little, yeah, the teens that I saw wearing the like,

830
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,440
not my cunt, not my president, like 13 year old shirt.

831
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,600
What do you wait?

832
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,160
13 year old wearing like a not my president shirt at Epcot center.

833
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,440
And it's like, what are you talking about kid?

834
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,080
Like who gave you that shirt?

835
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,240
You don't care.

836
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah.

837
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah.

838
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,320
Yeah.

839
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,560
The rich future of all of the people who were like, who people who will be

840
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,640
dropping their whole lives.

841
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:50,840
Yeah.

842
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,240
I was a viral mask freak out in supermarket star in 2020.

843
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,800
That was 25 years ago.

844
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,200
Yeah.

845
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,320
Pretty sweet.

846
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,360
Pretty good.

847
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,880
Good times got picked up a lot of places.

848
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,400
Yeah.

849
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,400
My parents were pretty big into the satanic panic in the eighties.

850
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,960
Like we had a safety sign, you know, and we checked all the candy and Halloween

851
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,000
for razor blades.

852
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,960
My mom did that too.

853
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,320
Well, that's true.

854
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,920
No, the razor blade.

855
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,120
I mean, yeah, that was kind of a thing.

856
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,560
All this said, I do wonder what are the numbers of like families canceling trips

857
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,680
because you can't hug the characters.

858
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,680
I would have to say it was probably due to the, you know, novel Corona virus

859
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,720
and the societal unrest and general anxieties and increased pricing, more

860
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:50,120
pain in the ass planning, more difficult travel, being more difficult, park

861
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,080
reservations, not being able to get food reservations or park reservation.

862
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,600
Like the parks being more unpleasant these days.

863
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,200
Everything being a lot.

864
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,600
Yeah.

865
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
Your money going a lot less farther.

866
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,400
The concept of resort, the definition of resort really being stretched at how much

867
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,880
legwork you, the consumer has to do now.

868
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah.

869
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,320
I would say all of that combined might be playing a factor more than just the hug.

870
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,320
Yeah.

871
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah.

872
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,720
But now, but they are back.

873
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,400
They're back.

874
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,240
Are we, hugs are back.

875
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,240
Are we, are we going to hug?

876
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
Are we hugging now?

877
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
It's been a while.

878
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,480
Would this even have occurred to you if there weren't headlines about hugs or

879
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,080
bed, whatever?

880
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean, I guess we're not the audience for it necessarily, but now we got hugs on

881
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,280
the brain.

882
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,320
You're saying, am I excited to hug?

883
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,400
Was that, is that something that like I'm getting?

884
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:42,680
Yeah.

885
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,000
Well on the next Disneyland visit, will you sort of like, oh, you know what?

886
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,000
I can hug now.

887
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,840
Generally speaking these days, I'm only interested in taking a photo with a

888
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,560
character that's the obscure character because I'm a high, you know, I'm a

889
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,480
smarter Disney fan who really, you know, loves the obscure characters like Robin

890
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,920
Hood, the Hipper characters.

891
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,320
I'm a Hipper Disney fan as well.

892
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,520
Yeah.

893
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,320
Robin Hood, you know, he's obscure, but yeah, I don't really, I do, I do wait

894
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,800
for like a photo op like that, but I, other than that, we don't, we're not really

895
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,200
like waiting on Main Street for one of the fab five or anything.

896
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,000
No, if they come out, they're like, come out a side door.

897
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,760
So if you happen to catch them, I like, if you catch them, but they don't usually

898
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,320
like to take a photo with you in that, that spot.

899
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,720
Yeah.

900
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,560
But I would take a photo of them alone.

901
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,480
Was there walking?

902
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,080
I want to, I would examine that tiny little bugs land that he had man on the

903
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,720
last for a while.

904
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,040
Well, that's a delight.

905
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,600
I got to poke around.

906
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,440
That's a true delight.

907
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,240
Oh yeah.

908
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,080
That's fascinating.

909
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,320
Yeah.

910
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,760
Ant-Man has a shrunken bugs land, which was there before the Marvel campus.

911
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,080
Yes.

912
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,400
Yeah.

913
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,120
That's funny.

914
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,800
Walks around.

915
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,600
You can, and he'll show it to you in a little bubble.

916
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,920
Fantastic idea.

917
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,920
And that, and now canonically that's what happened to bug.

918
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,200
Yeah.

919
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,240
Really good.

920
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,680
Drunk.

921
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
I'm going to ask them about the logic problems.

922
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,040
Like, well, I thought this was an old star campus.

923
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Isn't, isn't this a manufacturing plan before this was here?

924
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,160
You should have, I mean, I would like to see you have a dialogue and try to

925
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
get one over on that.

926
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,920
Moon night just beats the shit out.

927
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,720
It just goes ham on me.

928
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,280
Drags you up to the top of the Avengers.

929
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,480
I got a little secret for you.

930
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,520
Nobody gives a shit.

931
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,960
Shut the fuck up.

932
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,840
You're a fucking tool.

933
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,200
This one's from Bob.

934
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,560
Bob tapex favorite Marvel characters, Moon Knight, cause of how violent he is.

935
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,120
Cause of how bad he beats people.

936
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,880
Can I play him?

937
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,800
I want to play him.

938
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
It's only second to only the Punisher.

939
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,920
Um, I, uh, here's a question.

940
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,880
Does anybody have this, this POV that in a way, um, well, I'll just, I'll,

941
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,880
I'll just say it for myself in a way I might slightly miss the, the, the, uh,

942
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,080
distanced waving of the characters.

943
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,600
Uh, and, or I, you know, maybe I kind of hope and wish that they will still do

944
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,120
some component of that because I like that you've had a guaranteed, oh wow.

945
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,000
It's, it's, it's the big five.

946
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,200
It's all the characters.

947
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,840
I saw them.

948
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,720
I waved at them.

949
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,840
That's kind of all I wanted to do.

950
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,080
And I'm a little bit biased in that area because as I mentioned in the live show,

951
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,360
I took my son to Disneyland for the first time.

952
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,200
Most magical part of it by far, as soon as we got in, as soon as we got

953
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,360
under the train track, uh, there's Mickey right at that end of the train track,

954
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,640
right past the bridge, big wave interaction that he lit up at.

955
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,440
It was so magical.

956
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,360
Like clearly waving right at my son.

957
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,920
It was really great.

958
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:58,040
So this notion that those, these are like hollow and, uh, cold, I can

959
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,280
attest to is not true.

960
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,720
Like, yeah, my, my son's first Mickey interaction was really magical done this

961
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,880
way and we got to have it without waiting in a goddamn line for 45 minutes.

962
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,240
You know?

963
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,840
Yeah.

964
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,440
I, my stat also picked up on it's like, I hope they keep the things where it's

965
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,280
like, you know, uh, goofy and Max are fishing off the, you know, pier in

966
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,080
California adventure.

967
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,560
Great.

968
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I really like that.

969
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,320
Or these, I mean, the very nature of these Marvel interactions are they're up

970
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,760
walking around on that Avengers building.

971
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,240
Um, and I don't know if that's like, does that stay or are they on the ground

972
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,320
more? Cause I kind of like, I think those are going to pass by that they're

973
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,280
like the Royals and they, they wave.

974
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,800
They like, with the people on the ground.

975
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,320
Yeah.

976
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,440
They're like patrolling.

977
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,120
Oh, okay.

978
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,360
Yeah.

979
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,080
They're keeping an eye on it.

980
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,320
Marvel stuff.

981
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,040
And I've said this over and over again, I get, I, I, they change characters out.

982
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,800
Moon Knight is on is there already.

983
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,880
He's on top at night.

984
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,560
He shows up at night and there's a bunch of smoke on top of Avengers, uh, the

985
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,960
Avengers, whatever it's called the building headquarters.

986
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,400
Uh, uh, and yeah, like all that stuff is all the stuff and I don't, when it's

987
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,400
not a galaxy's edge episode, but that's all the stuff we want more of a galaxy's

988
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,120
edge, but they they're packing it into Marvel land and yeah, all that distance

989
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,840
stuff is cool.

990
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,280
Like the, the, the topicality that's probably not the correct word, but the,

991
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:28,080
like the currentness side, the fact that there are so many Marvel projects that

992
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,080
maybe work with a little more frequency than the star.

993
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,800
Oh, that's not true.

994
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,640
Star Wars.

995
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,000
All the Star Wars things are very popular, but then a lot of them aren't allowed

996
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
in the universe of galaxy's edge.

997
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,320
Issue.

998
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,640
Yeah.

999
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,240
Yeah.

1000
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,400
So that what Marvel has, which is just, it's a free for all and anybody can be

1001
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:43,520
there.

1002
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,040
So when every new show comes out, characters are there with top of the line suits

1003
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,000
and they can really smart.

1004
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,320
So smart and they can have different outfits.

1005
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,720
Oh yeah.

1006
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,120
Mr.

1007
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,440
Knight.

1008
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Well, cause there was moon night and then there's the other ego.

1009
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:53,720
Yes.

1010
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:53,880
Sir.

1011
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,000
Night was in a little suit.

1012
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,320
Mr.

1013
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Night is wearing the suit and they have moon night and it's regular, like

1014
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,520
superhero outfit.

1015
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,560
And then Loki when Loki was in his like prison jumpsuit was walking around in

1016
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,440
his prison jumpsuit for like two weeks.

1017
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,440
It's great.

1018
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,160
Uh, uh, and all that stuff.

1019
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,960
Like I remember early on they were in Epcot.

1020
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,960
There was like, like Pooh Bear was just like, had like a little net and he was

1021
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,320
trying to get butterflies.

1022
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:15,800
Yeah.

1023
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,880
People were walking by going, Hey, look at that.

1024
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,840
Like that's actually more of what I thought was a little kid of like, I want

1025
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,040
the characters like hanging out, like live here, right?

1026
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,840
So they're just like hanging out here.

1027
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,080
Going about their busy.

1028
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,320
Yeah.

1029
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,400
Those little, those little scenes in a way, aren't they cooler than just, I

1030
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,200
took a staged photo with, uh, I guess.

1031
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,960
You want both.

1032
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,120
I mean, especially the little kid.

1033
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,280
Yeah.

1034
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,760
I hope it's a blend.

1035
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,440
I hope they keep some version of what they've been doing.

1036
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,880
And practically it also disperses the crowds cause that's, that's people

1037
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,200
occupied not on attractions and not at restaurants.

1038
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,360
So you're getting people around.

1039
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,960
Well, I, you know, I did, I did think about that and I do like what it does

1040
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,120
for if, if character meet and greet lines, swallow people and they're

1041
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,600
less in ride lines.

1042
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,360
I love that.

1043
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,080
That's great.

1044
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,520
If it can like, or we lost a hundred people to, uh, to, you know, to meet

1045
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,560
Daisy or whatever it is.

1046
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,240
Yeah.

1047
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,000
So I, I, yeah, hopefully, hopefully Chaypeck will let the money flow for both

1048
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,440
of these things and not just like the one that he thinks makes more money.

1049
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,280
Cause the other thing is ambiance.

1050
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,200
Yeah.

1051
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,120
You know what that, that adds to the atmosphere of the park.

1052
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,560
Yeah.

1053
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,440
I think, uh, uh, ambiance and also live entertainment in general is coming back.

1054
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,720
Uh, more and more.

1055
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,160
Um, but I think those were things that were missing early on when like a lot

1056
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,440
of the restrictions dropped and it's just like, oh my God, what are all these

1057
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,880
crap?

1058
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,840
And it's like, well, all the ancillary stuff is not eating up people like it

1059
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,520
used to.

1060
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,480
Yeah.

1061
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:56,880
Yeah.

1062
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,440
Oh yeah.

1063
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:57,720
Yeah.

1064
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,800
You don't have people who are the people who like plant and wait for a parade for

1065
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,360
two hours so they aren't in the line.

1066
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,200
Yeah.

1067
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,840
Yeah.

1068
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,200
Yeah.

1069
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,160
Less of those like, yeah, the little it's all competing for, we're all going to

1070
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,520
try to get on the ticket attractions all at the same time.

1071
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,640
So it's a little chaotic.

1072
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:17,920
Yeah.

1073
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,200
Yeah.

1074
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,600
Yeah.

1075
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,240
Is it, here's a question I have about the hug ban, the dreaded hug ban.

1076
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,200
Yeah.

1077
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,480
Yeah.

1078
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:33,000
In a way like, okay, am I crazy that there there's the, there's the, we had

1079
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,400
to stay distance for a while.

1080
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,800
Uh, and there's obviously the current virus risk, but are, are we not dealing

1081
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,400
with the most, the biggest masks ever made?

1082
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,680
Well, right now, these are not a medical gray, but like, isn't, is not a Mickey

1083
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,920
head giant mass is Mickey's head.

1084
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,040
Can 95 certified.

1085
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,720
Is that what we're at?

1086
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,080
Yeah.

1087
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,480
You would think you would be able to adapt the mask, the Mickey mask, the

1088
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:08,080
Mickey helmet to have the full and 95, at least you'd least just wear it under it.

1089
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:08,760
Yeah.

1090
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,640
You could easily wear a medical grade mask under it.

1091
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,520
I wonder if you may, but if you're, if you're doing medical grade mask and then

1092
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,160
Mickey head on top of it, maybe now the breathability is, oh, it's not great.

1093
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,520
It's terrible.

1094
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,280
No, but they were certainly doing it.

1095
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,760
Yeah.

1096
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,960
But I'm sure they, you think that, do you think those characters, do you think

1097
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,760
these characters have masks on now that there's now that hugs are back?

1098
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
I think it depends.

1099
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,160
I think it's a, it's dependent because, because most mask mandates are going away.

1100
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,120
So I would assume it might be up to the performer, but I could be wrong.

1101
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,240
It would depend.

1102
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,840
I don't know what their internal policy is with the cliques.

1103
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,960
These are close interactions, I suppose.

1104
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,760
But I don't know if you're outside, I don't know what the science even, I

1105
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,880
don't know how many seconds you really need to be in the presence of someone.

1106
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,800
I don't know how, like, can you catch a Macron just by whispering a little

1107
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,400
secret for 15 seconds?

1108
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,880
I don't know.

1109
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,960
Biggest, it was the reason to Institute the, the hug ban and the unnamed, but we

1110
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,960
know that there was a shadow, a warm secret thing as well, right?

1111
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,600
Cause that's more under the umbrella of the general hug ban.

1112
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,160
Yes, exactly.

1113
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,880
That was the, yeah.

1114
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,720
Little secret, cause there secrets are breathy, right?

1115
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,840
You're putting extra breath into it to like make the words cut through.

1116
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,120
Yeah.

1117
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,920
So there's a lot of breath going into that.

1118
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,520
And that's, yeah, that's going to spread these variants, maybe more

1119
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,760
than just regular speech.

1120
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,560
Secrets.

1121
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:29,760
Yeah.

1122
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,920
It is that is scientifically proven that secrets give off more aerosols

1123
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,640
than a regular sentence.

1124
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,800
That's for sure.

1125
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,720
So what's made us all so crazy for the last few years, nobody's getting there.

1126
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,560
We're getting our secrets out.

1127
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,000
Um, yeah.

1128
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,320
All living with all of our worst secrets.

1129
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,200
Yeah.

1130
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,520
They, the gossip, you know, the hot gas, the tea just doesn't hit over zoom as

1131
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:52,800
well.

1132
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,880
The tea doesn't hit, you know, also a good way is if you've ever seen, I don't

1133
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,160
know if we've even posted a video of it.

1134
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,840
There's of course a great Chuck E cheese instructional video on cleaning the suit

1135
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,600
that you can find online.

1136
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,160
Yeah.

1137
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,760
Uh, where they say, I think the spray Lysol inside the head to clean.

1138
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,400
I, I, someone messaged me and said they worked at a Chuck E cheese in high

1139
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,040
school and they're like, that happened maybe once a year.

1140
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,440
Of course.

1141
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,760
Oh, that best.

1142
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,040
But I don't know.

1143
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,600
I don't know.

1144
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,720
Does Lysol Lysol would probably kill.

1145
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,280
Yeah.

1146
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,520
Kind of killed her own virus.

1147
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,680
So maybe you just on each break, you go in and you Lysol the head.

1148
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,120
Although then you'd get, yeah, then you got a long, you're in a rain fog.

1149
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,400
Yeah.

1150
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah.

1151
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,040
You pass out from.

1152
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,360
All right.

1153
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,280
So the Lysol of the head is not a good idea.

1154
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,680
Maybe for a regular cleaning.

1155
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,360
I have one more question about the hug situation.

1156
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,480
Um, who do, who do we most want to hug?

1157
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,800
Now that this is what the Instagram asked as well.

1158
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,520
And I was going through the comments and I was trying to get a, get a sampling

1159
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,480
of what people, um, people want to, who want, who want people.

1160
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,120
Was the question posed to Instagram?

1161
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,520
Yes.

1162
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,440
On the Disneyland Instagram.

1163
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,280
Oh, we didn't do this.

1164
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,800
So we know he didn't do this.

1165
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,680
We will, but, uh, somebody's, these are just, I'm not going to say who, what

1166
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,320
their username, but somebody said Pinocchio at the top of my list, which I

1167
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,160
was like, really?

1168
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,640
Okay.

1169
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,560
Um, you know, people obviously Mickey Minnie, uh, obviously, uh, one of my

1170
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,360
favorite ones is, and I, I know what they meant, but they said Winnie the Pooh in

1171
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,360
July and I was thinking that might be funny cause they like have a month

1172
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,400
preference for certain characters.

1173
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,320
It's best to hug Winnie in July.

1174
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,120
It feels like it's going to be a clammy Winnie.

1175
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:43,720
Right.

1176
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:43,920
Yeah.

1177
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,240
Especially if it's the critter country.

1178
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,000
Maybe not in California, dry or heat out here.

1179
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,800
Warm hugs, not clammy hugs.

1180
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,120
Yeah.

1181
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,640
Yeah.

1182
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,560
Um, but you know, I was looking through these comments and I was like, these

1183
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,760
aren't hip Disney fans.

1184
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,240
These are just the normal characters.

1185
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,640
They're not saying anything cool.

1186
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,280
Like, uh, the great mouse detective or anything.

1187
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,360
You want a hug?

1188
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:03,760
Oh yeah.

1189
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,080
Basil from Basil.

1190
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,800
Basil and Brad again.

1191
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,200
I would, I would light up at the movie.

1192
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,920
I haven't seen in 30 years character Basil.

1193
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,320
If I saw him in the park, I would get, I would wait in line for that.

1194
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,720
You're waiting for Basil.

1195
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,080
So I guess I'm waiting for Basil.

1196
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,480
I didn't think of it until just now, but that is who I'm waiting for.

1197
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:29,600
I think, um, you know, a big character, uh, big Al, I think is probably a good

1198
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,040
one.

1199
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,160
That's a lot.

1200
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,760
He can really give him a hug.

1201
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,080
Chewbacca we mentioned.

1202
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,280
Yeah.

1203
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,880
Big Al out a lot.

1204
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,560
It's usually sometimes I see him more in Florida buildings.

1205
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,800
A lot of more Weasley bears.

1206
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,960
I still Weasley bears.

1207
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,160
Yeah.

1208
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,800
Riddell.

1209
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:44,480
Yeah.

1210
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,240
Wendell is out.

1211
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,440
I think a Groot could be interesting.

1212
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,000
That seems to actually, are you allowed to hug Groot?

1213
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,120
That's what I, yeah.

1214
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,840
If it's, if it's kind of a puppety, he's like a rigid, he's on stilts.

1215
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,640
Whoever it is, is on stilts and he's kind of a plastic.

1216
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,960
I bet you're not allowed to hug Groot.

1217
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,680
Well that full size Groot is there like a teen Groot?

1218
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,840
Cause little Groot was one of the, I think one of the robot little meat and

1219
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,560
Greek one where they fussing with that.

1220
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,600
They did that in Florida.

1221
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,840
They had a little robot baby Groot.

1222
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,840
You don't want to hug that too delicate.

1223
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,200
In California, they have full size Groot.

1224
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,240
I don't think teen Groot has been seen anywhere as a character.

1225
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,640
I don't think, but maybe you're saying maybe you could hug him.

1226
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,840
Maybe, maybe coming for Thor love and thunder.

1227
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,760
Well, cause of love in the title.

1228
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,040
You mean, you could, oh, no, just that he's probably in that movie.

1229
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,880
It would probably be walking around Avengers campus.

1230
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,040
Hugs and thunder.

1231
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,360
Hugs and thunder.

1232
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:36,720
Yeah.

1233
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,560
What about Korg?

1234
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,920
Why isn't Korg in?

1235
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,840
That's pretty good.

1236
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,560
He'd be Tycho.

1237
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,280
Like TT's character Korg.

1238
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,440
But you would want him to do like some.

1239
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,160
Rock monster.

1240
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:46,720
Yeah.

1241
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,600
You would want that mouth because some of the mouths you can move, you

1242
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,160
would want him to, you know, riff with you a little, like he could tell you a

1243
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:53,720
secret.

1244
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,840
I see a Korg could tell you a secret.

1245
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,440
Yeah.

1246
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,480
I, you gotta get like an improv performer though.

1247
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,160
Well, yeah, that's, yeah.

1248
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,600
You gotta get him doing, doing some funny prov.

1249
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,200
Yeah.

1250
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,680
I've ever heard you call it.

1251
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,160
So anyone has ever called it.

1252
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:08,360
Yeah.

1253
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,960
You just get some problems going.

1254
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,440
Yeah.

1255
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:10,760
Yeah.

1256
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,200
If you're on a tight cassette, some problems going down.

1257
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,880
That's yeah, you're right.

1258
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,840
No, you're right about that.

1259
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,600
He calls it prov.

1260
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,640
What he does is prov.

1261
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,360
This flag means prov.

1262
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:32,280
I is the, is the hug ability more about fuzziness or size, like kind of

1263
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,440
floppiness.

1264
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,240
What do you think makes a character the most huggable?

1265
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,040
Well, is it also like, like a Victor?

1266
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,920
Can you, does Kylo Ren hug?

1267
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,560
Like, can you cajole?

1268
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,480
Oh, I don't think he's supposed to.

1269
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,800
Who probably wouldn't like it.

1270
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,880
Probably wouldn't like it.

1271
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,280
You kill him with kindness.

1272
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,760
Yeah.

1273
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,080
Stormtrooper.

1274
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:53,920
Yeah.

1275
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,800
I don't know.

1276
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,200
Yeah.

1277
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,480
I'm not, I'm not as an adult man.

1278
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,600
I'm not looking to get it, get in there really and get a long warm one from

1279
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,200
anyone, any of the characters.

1280
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,520
I don't know.

1281
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,400
Secret one.

1282
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,840
I'm not looking for that.

1283
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,640
I swear to you.

1284
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,160
I don't know why it says it seems like I'm defensive about this.

1285
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,800
I'm not.

1286
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:19,800
So I'm not sure that it's, I think like, I will say this hugging Chewbacca is a

1287
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,600
little gross.

1288
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,400
Oh, interesting.

1289
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,560
The fur is like a little matted and it's kind of like, and also there's something

1290
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,920
I don't think I don't like about it is that like I see him hugging everyone else

1291
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,320
and it loses its specialness a little bit to me, even though I think it's like a

1292
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,640
kid, like the big reveal when Chewbacca comes around, if they still do that at

1293
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,760
the, at the, uh, whatever it's called.

1294
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,520
Galaxy's Edge.

1295
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,240
No, no, no.

1296
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,640
The other one, the Star Wars launch bag launch, but thank you still hanging in

1297
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:46,920
there.

1298
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,880
So, yeah, well, yeah, nothing else for it.

1299
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,520
So now we need to put, but the way they did that, they do that meet and greet is

1300
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,120
really cool and like you would see kids, kids like, cause Chewbacca basically kind

1301
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,200
of comes around the bend and he like greets you and welcomes you in.

1302
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,440
Like it's a whole thing and it is a really well done thing, but like he may

1303
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,360
Chewbacca makes you hug him before the photo op and like he's hugging like

1304
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,640
everybody and the fur is matted and I feel like there was like a weird like

1305
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,560
smell, maybe.

1306
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,800
Uh huh.

1307
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,400
No, probably a vague smell, not horrible or anything, but I was like, this is

1308
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,960
kind of not, I don't need to hug this performer kind of in it built into the

1309
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,040
character, right?

1310
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,440
He's always giving hugs and those.

1311
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,960
Yeah, sure.

1312
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,240
Right.

1313
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,560
Yeah.

1314
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,680
It's kind of grabbing everyone.

1315
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,120
Uh, so I like that.

1316
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,000
I like the idea of it, but I'm saying actually doing it isn't the best thing

1317
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,960
there was a rug made of Chewbacca's fur.

1318
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,640
It would just naturally get so filthy.

1319
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,080
Yeah.

1320
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,000
Like that level.

1321
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,560
It's just, it's, it's thick.

1322
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:54,560
Cause it's long fur, like poo bears, greasy, who bears fur is like, it's a thin,

1323
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,000
thin coat of fur.

1324
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,320
He's got, he's a bear.

1325
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,920
He's got, or he's a plush bear, I guess.

1326
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,720
That's my answer for hugs.

1327
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:10,080
And I, again, I'm not out there seeking long, warm hugs, but if I were to go back

1328
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,880
with my son who had a very nice, it was a very nice wave at Winnie the Pooh, sorry,

1329
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,520
libs of TikTok, it's possible that those can be very nice.

1330
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,800
Um, but now that hugs are back, I think I would join him.

1331
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,240
I think I would, cause there's a way.

1332
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,280
You would join him in a hug.

1333
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,120
I think I would, uh, I would show my son a hug.

1334
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:35,480
Uh, I think if, because there's the little loop you can do in Pooh corner where it's

1335
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,320
yeah, yeah, right.

1336
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,920
Where you hit, I want to say it's Eeyore and Tigger and Pooh doing that grew.

1337
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,200
I might be the most sentimental for those and I've gotten to pass them on to my son

1338
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,840
already.

1339
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,400
Yeah.

1340
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,280
He loves them.

1341
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,920
So like, you know, I'm not going to, I'm not going to make a big point of the

1342
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,240
hub, but if hugs naturally happen, that would be your probably be nice.

1343
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,240
And Eeyore, I hadn't thought about Pooh seems obvious just cause he's the most

1344
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,680
heartwarming character, but Eeyore might feel nice because the character is a

1345
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,000
character that needs a hug.

1346
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,600
That's true.

1347
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:05,880
Yeah.

1348
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,080
Yeah.

1349
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,560
You're doing a service at that point.

1350
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:08,880
Yeah.

1351
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,840
Cheering up Eeyore.

1352
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,920
What if that's nice?

1353
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,600
What if that's serious?

1354
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,080
Cause yeah, they have this perfect little, if you've not been there, they have like a

1355
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,200
kind of, yeah, a line that basically takes you around to a stage station.

1356
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,800
I think they're all kind of around the corner from each other.

1357
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,960
You don't see them all.

1358
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,520
Yes, exactly.

1359
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,240
Here's this little nook and here's the next, the next warm hug.

1360
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,440
No.

1361
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,160
So I think, look, if anyone's listening, this is going to be impossible, but

1362
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,360
anyone listening, they see Scott and his son come.

1363
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,040
It would be really funny if you got like, you hit you went and you got Winnie and

1364
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,360
you go over here and you get Tigger and then you go around the bend and he goes,

1365
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,680
hi, it's Peter.

1366
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,920
And Peter is in the third spot and you didn't know Eeyore has been replaced.

1367
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,600
The Disney people have to coordinate.

1368
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
They have to know I'm there.

1369
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,560
That's why I said it's impossible.

1370
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,240
Yeah.

1371
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,680
Like do do do.

1372
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,960
Hey, come on, Scott and son, let's go.

1373
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,760
I accidentally winged a flock of birds and I need to take a little rest here in

1374
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,440
country because I'm hurting a little before I get the rest of the way to

1375
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,160
Neverland.

1376
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,280
You are told too many secrets and he overheated.

1377
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,040
Now I'm taking his place.

1378
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,520
I'm not about travel bans and restrictions and putting up borders, but let me be,

1379
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,760
let me be clear about this.

1380
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,840
Peter Pan is not allowed in Poot Corner.

1381
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,760
Okay.

1382
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,080
All right.

1383
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,040
Pan is banned.

1384
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,160
Pan is banned in Poot Corner.

1385
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,280
I'm just thinking about this.

1386
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,920
Like the logic puzzles they jump through, you know, they put together the hoops they

1387
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,840
jump through sometimes.

1388
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,720
Peter Pan, you know, he can fly so practically go anywhere and the power of

1389
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,920
imagination and, uh, you know, youth.

1390
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,760
Imagination can get by any land and make it make sense.

1391
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,640
You know, so.

1392
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,600
The power of a big cement wall, which I will build if that's what it takes.

1393
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,320
Um, if I can, I'll do it in Florida.

1394
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:57,360
If I can convince DeSantis to build a, I'll like, uh, you know, I'll, I'll tell

1395
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,400
DeSantis that Chaypec said he is, uh, he made fun of his tie or something.

1396
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,440
Oh really?

1397
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,320
And then we get, now that they're now that the, you know, Reedy Creek is gone.

1398
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,960
I think that allows me and DeSantis to work together to build a big concrete

1399
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,200
wall to keep Peter Pan out of, uh, at a Poot Corner.

1400
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:14,760
There's.

1401
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,720
There's, you should have, there should be a video of your son running at Peter Pan.

1402
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,600
And then you enter the frame, like the, like the employee in that other video and

1403
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,880
check pan into the rivers of America.

1404
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Hell yes.

1405
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,280
Gladly.

1406
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,200
Can't fly now.

1407
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,520
Can you?

1408
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,760
Like, you're not like, there's a great, I, Jason, I think those was a crazy dog

1409
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,040
market, uh, Jason was talking about.

1410
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,480
There's a performer, a wrestler named Keith Lee, who does this move where he

1411
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,680
does a crazy, like kind of chat, like check with his shoulder to another guy.

1412
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,160
And send some flying.

1413
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,480
And there's a great jiff of him doing this to Adam Cole and he knocks him into

1414
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,320
the audience.

1415
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,800
And I just imagine that's what you were doing to pan shooting him into the

1416
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,800
rivers of America.

1417
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,160
Like just with crazy velocity.

1418
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,960
This is, this is something I'm going to have to watch out for in my parenting

1419
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:07,040
journey is that I might just like run up and rush elbow somebody who in the

1420
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,720
corner of my eye looks like Peter Pan coming from my kid, but I didn't realize

1421
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,400
it's just wearing a green shirt.

1422
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,080
Yeah, right.

1423
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,240
Were there any stores where you wear a green is the uniform green at any, at

1424
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,360
like a Friday, TGA Fridays.

1425
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:19,840
Maybe.

1426
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,360
Oh yeah.

1427
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,680
Or like whole foods.

1428
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,680
Yeah, maybe I forgot.

1429
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,960
I don't know where you wear green, but I might, yeah, some poor employee of

1430
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,200
somewhere is going to get shoved into a shelf because I know, no, no, I swear.

1431
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,360
I thought he was Peter Pan too bad.

1432
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,520
It wasn't worth a little secrets to my son.

1433
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,840
Couldn't take the chance.

1434
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,560
So Scott, uh, that's our parent pan is banned and don't.

1435
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,320
Don't come to our shows wearing green shirts and pants because it activates Scott.

1436
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,120
It's like a man, shurian candidate style, a code trigger.

1437
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,840
Ironically, it's what turns me Hulk, even though Hulk is green.

1438
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,280
Yeah.

1439
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,720
It's a whole colors make me Hulk to reduce the pan in the world.

1440
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,680
Um, okay.

1441
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:12,120
Well, I think that covers hugs and hugs being back warm hugs and, and

1442
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,480
special secrets.

1443
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,600
I did see, uh, my chat did point out and this, this is actually the

1444
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,200
thing that made me go like, Oh, well I like that.

1445
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,360
Uh, you know, the, the.

1446
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,760
Care of the areas where the characters had been distanced, you know, greeting

1447
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,880
like the car they circle fountain area and the front steps of the main street

1448
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,200
railroad station, you, the guest can now access like you can go through there.

1449
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,520
And I was like, Oh, you know what?

1450
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,280
I like both those little plays.

1451
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,080
I like going out those big steps at the main street station.

1452
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,360
I like that little fountain wooded area by the car fake circle.

1453
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,240
Okay.

1454
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,960
So by taking away the presence of the characters, now we can go to these

1455
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,040
places like, yeah, I see.

1456
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:53,640
Okay.

1457
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,200
That's nice.

1458
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,360
So we regain some liminal space, like I guess that's good.

1459
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,000
Um, okay.

1460
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,440
So, uh, stairs are back because hugs are back.

1461
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:04,720
Great.

1462
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,480
There's a back.

1463
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:10,800
Um, so, uh, with that being the section about hugs, I wanted to talk a little

1464
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,480
about, uh, what felt like a warm hug of an experience, which was my, my whirlwind

1465
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,200
trips to Las Vegas, uh, very much Chris angel fueled, um, which I haven't told

1466
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:30,480
you guys too much about, um, so kind of right after we got back from New York

1467
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,760
on a Monday night and then it ended up being, it would have had to time out to

1468
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,040
where that I would have had to be on a plane Wednesday morning to Las Vegas to

1469
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:45,960
do this whirlwind trip that was planned by our friend, Jason Waller and Eva

1470
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,800
Anderson as well, um, just suddenly, uh, basically everybody's been waiting for

1471
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,960
Chris's new show, a mystica to premiere.

1472
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,960
It was long delayed.

1473
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,760
It was supposed to happen a few months ago.

1474
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,480
Um, suddenly it's up and running and there's a little bit of a pace to it

1475
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,200
maybe, but maybe due to some concern that a mystica might not be long for this

1476
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,840
world, I think the ticket sales have been a little bit rough, so it felt like

1477
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,400
got, uh, got a strike while Aaron's hot.

1478
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,520
Uh, gotta go that.

1479
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,920
So it being so quick after the New York trip, I was like, I don't know.

1480
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,560
Look, I've been away from the family and I, I, I essentially said no.

1481
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,320
And then Jason and Eva kept needling me.

1482
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,920
And by the way, you guys were invited to this as well.

1483
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,560
Oh yeah.

1484
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,080
I was being on the text thread that is largely, it started David Copperfield

1485
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,640
oriented and has become, there's just more going on in the world of Chris angel

1486
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,080
right now.

1487
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,480
Yeah.

1488
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,080
Uh, yeah, I was, I was back visiting family.

1489
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:42,640
Oh, that's right.

1490
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,520
On the East coast.

1491
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,640
So I was stuck around and Mike is, uh, uh, sane, more sane than I was.

1492
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,320
I was like, oh, tired.

1493
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:51,840
Yeah.

1494
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,920
By the end of it, by the end of New York that I was like, I don't know.

1495
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:55,480
Yeah.

1496
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:55,960
Yeah.

1497
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,560
Oh, that's so I, I was, I was very exhausted, but then I just, I, well,

1498
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,440
here's what pushed me over the edge.

1499
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,200
I pretty much had made up my mind.

1500
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,960
Uh, too crazy.

1501
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,440
Not going to do it.

1502
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:11,680
But then it was sent a seating chart for the Chris angel writer for the, uh,

1503
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,080
it basically he does to show, he does his long running show mind freak, and then

1504
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,360
he steps down for a little bit.

1505
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,920
And then at 10, the late slot, he does his new show, which is a prequel to the

1506
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,000
old show, which is we explained when we did an episode about all this with Eva.

1507
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,760
It's strange because the mind freak doesn't really have a story.

1508
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,800
So how can you have a prequel show to a show without a story?

1509
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:39,160
Um, curious about all of this, but then I saw the Chris angel theater seats about

1510
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:43,000
a thousand, this is at the planet Hollywood hotel, uh, about a thousand,

1511
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:48,280
uh, over a thousand, uh, the seating chart for that night show, uh, about 20

1512
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,160
were filled, it was so raw.

1513
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,040
And I saw that and just like, I gotta go.

1514
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,320
I have to go.

1515
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,000
I think I think I'm going to be upset.

1516
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,160
Uh, um, much as Eva and her husband, like, look, you're good.

1517
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,320
I don't want you around here.

1518
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,920
I want you bumming around cause you didn't get to go to Kaplip.

1519
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,880
I think I arrived at that point with Aaron.

1520
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,440
Uh, all right, I'm going to do it.

1521
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:08,880
I'm going to go.

1522
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:17,080
Um, so 24 hour trip, basically we go to Burbank airport, land in Las Vegas,

1523
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,560
uh, meet up with the, uh, the, uh, Mr.

1524
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,280
Crew, um, a great group of people.

1525
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,320
Jason Walner is there.

1526
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:23,880
Eve is there.

1527
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,320
The great John Daly has been on our show is a such a fun group

1528
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,840
doing a very stupid thing.

1529
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,680
Uh, we land at the airport, a bunch of hassle to get a pass

1530
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:39,480
van to get us all on the road to immediately, um, not even going to

1531
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,400
the street, not even going to the strip straight to Moapa Valley to where,

1532
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:50,680
uh, Chris Angel's restaurant Kaplip is open, uh, land go, uh, go, go

1533
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:55,640
straight over there now, as we talked about in this episode on the website

1534
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,440
for Kaplip 45 minutes is what is said.

1535
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,800
It's only 45 minutes away from Vegas.

1536
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,200
Uh, Eva has gone.

1537
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,880
So this was not news to anybody, but experiencing this in reality.

1538
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,680
Um, w w a rushed drive, a rough drive, because we were like, we had

1539
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,280
a whole day of other stuff planned.

1540
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,680
So like, boy, we got to get out there and get out and we're calling

1541
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,800
the people who got there early.

1542
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,200
Like, can you just order our food?

1543
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:18,800
Let's get it.

1544
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:18,960
Move.

1545
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,120
There were some concerns about maybe that kitchen is going to be a little slow.

1546
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,120
Uh, so we're, we're gunning it.

1547
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,160
We're through the desert.

1548
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:32,200
Uh, and in at gunning at speed, hour 15 hour 15 from the, from the airport,

1549
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,400
which is admittedly a little south of the strip, but like, if you're anywhere

1550
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,680
with traffic, if you're anywhere where people are in Vegas getting out of

1551
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,600
there is going to be a hazard.

1552
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,360
There's no way on God's green earth.

1553
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,680
This is 45 minutes from.

1554
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:49,640
And this, if you haven't been to Las Vegas, the airport is like

1555
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,640
shockingly close to the strip.

1556
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,320
Like you can get from the airport to like the Southern most like.

1557
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,120
Massive can see the Mandalay Bay is like practically next to the airport.

1558
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:01,680
Yeah.

1559
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,280
That casino.

1560
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,160
You can get there.

1561
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:10,160
We once flew out of a weird wing of, uh, of, of that airport and walked from,

1562
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,840
uh, MGM grand, which is very south.

1563
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,360
Like there's a part of the airport that is walkable.

1564
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:21,080
It's very, it's just one of the many endless curiosities about Las Vegas.

1565
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:25,360
So if you're picturing like one of the Chicago airports or Philadelphia or

1566
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,480
JFK, where it's like far outside center city, not the case in this, it's far

1567
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,440
from like Fremont street, it's far from downtown Las Vegas.

1568
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,160
But it should do, would not add a significant amount to the trip.

1569
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,640
Our four hour 15.

1570
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,320
We took, I took a video of precisely when we were 45 minutes away from

1571
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,560
Kaplip and it's pure desert.

1572
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,240
We are, we are so far past.

1573
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,640
Landmarks.

1574
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,080
Yeah.

1575
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:49,320
Yeah.

1576
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,360
You guys saw that.

1577
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,200
And here we are.

1578
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,320
It's 45 minutes remaining.

1579
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,360
There are no building.

1580
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,960
We're so far past the buildings, but one of the buildings on the way out of there,

1581
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,520
by the way, is like a big, very cold industrial warehouse for Cisco.

1582
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,800
Cisco is the company where they get all of their food, where Chris just

1583
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,320
admitted for no reason we ran out of food at Kaplip opening weekend.

1584
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,840
Uh, we didn't order enough from Cisco, Cisco, which is they like, they do like

1585
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,560
cafeteria style food basically.

1586
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:19,800
Yeah.

1587
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,240
So we're like, our food is we passed our food.

1588
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,240
We could go into that building and get what we're going to get.

1589
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,960
We're look, John, I believe looked up like, wait, this burger is exactly

1590
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,280
the same photo on the Kaplip website and the Cisco website.

1591
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,000
They did not even dress up the burger in any way.

1592
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:44,000
Um, so a big journey, but a fun journey driving up and seeing, cause we've,

1593
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,000
there's not much there, right?

1594
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,760
It's a small building and a small building in person, but we've spent so much time.

1595
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,400
We did an episode about it and there's this text that's going about it.

1596
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:56,760
So we like, I know every nook and cranny of this building, the flag pole.

1597
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,280
They tweeted about the flag pole and the refrigeration units surrounding the

1598
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,040
corner and like, it's the pole.

1599
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:03,400
We're here.

1600
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,320
I don't think I've felt that way since my first few Disneyland trips.

1601
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,920
We're like, it's the Matterhorn off the freeway.

1602
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,120
That means we're here.

1603
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:17,120
It felt like that level of joy again, only to be a let down.

1604
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,360
Once we get in there, um, we get it.

1605
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:19,560
Yeah.

1606
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,040
Much like more claustrophobic place.

1607
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,840
I think then I realized that it's like much smaller in person.

1608
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,680
We booked the magic room by the way.

1609
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,280
So we had the magic room to ourselves, which was also about a third of the

1610
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,600
size I imagined in my head.

1611
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,160
Um, here's the shocker though.

1612
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,120
The Kaplip meal, my Kaplip meal.

1613
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,400
Not that bad.

1614
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,160
I actually, yeah, I might even say a specifically good.

1615
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,040
Wow.

1616
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:46,480
Wow.

1617
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,360
Strangely, I couldn't believe it.

1618
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,120
I don't think everybody would have that answer.

1619
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,600
I put a lot of thought into what I was going to get and Erin, my

1620
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,400
wife coached me through like, well, here's the foods I think would be most

1621
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,000
likely to at risk for food poisoning.

1622
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:01,480
Right.

1623
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:01,880
Yeah.

1624
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,120
It's like maybe lettuce.

1625
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,560
They aren't storing properly your chicken.

1626
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,080
You might want to stay away from.

1627
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,320
Yeah.

1628
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,880
You always think it's like, like it's a lot of times food

1629
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,040
poison can be unwashed produce.

1630
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,360
So yeah, yeah, sure.

1631
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,120
A place is not like, like salad is not their A game.

1632
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,560
You gotta, you gotta watch out for that.

1633
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,400
Uh, yeah, that was, there was, there was a, at one point we asked somebody who

1634
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,040
worked there, what their favorite thing on the menu is and they said, Oh, that

1635
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,000
Cobb salad, you gotta love that Cobb salad.

1636
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,960
And somebody in the group had the Cobb salad and I'm looking at the remainder

1637
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,600
of it and I'm like, this is your favorite.

1638
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,200
This is like, this looks like hospital food.

1639
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,200
That's the best.

1640
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,400
Like my thing was okay, but I, that salad seemed very suspect to me.

1641
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,760
But I think nobody got sick.

1642
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:52,280
We were all, and I, and on the way back then I was saying to Jason, boy, I

1643
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,840
can't buy, you know what I actually, maybe I kind of liked that food.

1644
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:02,520
Maybe he, maybe Chris pulled off the trick and Jason said, quote, diarrhea

1645
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,920
will be the prestige.

1646
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,200
I had to say that one out loud.

1647
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:09,920
I liked that a lot.

1648
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,480
That is good.

1649
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,440
Do you remember the name of the item you had?

1650
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,160
I had the mind freak burger, um, which I felt like, you know, that's, that's,

1651
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,840
you got the iconic name and it's also, it's got the, the onion ring.

1652
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,120
It's got onion rings on it.

1653
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,680
It's like a barbecue onion ring style burger, which I kind of miss having a

1654
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,120
Carl's Jr. so maybe it took me back to that.

1655
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:29,640
Oh, sure.

1656
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,480
Um, and with like an onion ring up, up top, like on vertically stacked on top

1657
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,240
of it, so fun presentation.

1658
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,080
What Eva said when she was on about the mind freeze, the drip, the mind

1659
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:46,920
freezes were great, Gambusa, ice crushing it, the king, he does it right.

1660
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,200
We asked around, nobody's seen Gambusa in a little while, but, uh, so not a

1661
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,760
lot of Gambusa information.

1662
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,200
Okay.

1663
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,400
Did meet somebody there who works there now who for a long time was

1664
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,600
Chris Angel's personal chef.

1665
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,200
Wow.

1666
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:07,040
Quite a figure to meet some real intimacy closeness to Chris's inner circle.

1667
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,040
So we were bugging him for secrets a little bit.

1668
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:16,040
Um, one of which that he himself said that he and Chris, what would

1669
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,760
their, like they, they eat very strictly.

1670
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,200
Uh, I think Eva looked at, even knows that Chris only eats, uh, is it just

1671
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,880
like chicken and rice for today?

1672
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,240
Yeah.

1673
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:26,480
Yeah.

1674
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,200
Something like that.

1675
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,880
And then I think I asked somebody else, Hey, is, um, uh, there are people mad

1676
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,720
that it's not sugar's home plate anymore.

1677
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,200
The restaurant that it was before.

1678
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,080
And she said, yeah, people come asking all the time is sugars coming back.

1679
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,920
And we say, no, cause Kablip's staying.

1680
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,040
Kablip's not going anywhere.

1681
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,400
And there's like a little bit of edge to that.

1682
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,840
Said it like George Costanza.

1683
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,720
Kablip's getting mad.

1684
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,040
It's getting upset.

1685
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,760
No, it felt like something you'd say if you'd like barricaded yourself into

1686
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,600
some, you're going to have to drink a blip out by the legs.

1687
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,040
I think we took quick glances at the menu for sugar's home place and, uh, not

1688
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:14,160
the biggest departure, likely also supplied by the Cisco warehouse.

1689
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,920
Possibly.

1690
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,800
But also you, I think they had a bar there and you could gamble at the bar.

1691
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,000
And they took that out.

1692
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,680
See that they've removed elements.

1693
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,720
It's not like good elements.

1694
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:28,800
A lot of bars have video poker machines built in that to them.

1695
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,400
It's weird.

1696
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,320
You would take that out, but then put in, you know, pictures of, we do have

1697
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,800
Chris hanging out with pit bull.

1698
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,200
So fantastic.

1699
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:37,840
Yeah.

1700
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:45,120
I have to think it's like both the regulations and then just like, well, if

1701
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,160
you're going to have gambling machines, you need to have cash on hand for the

1702
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,160
winnings for the payout.

1703
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,720
That's true.

1704
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,000
Yeah.

1705
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,200
Yeah.

1706
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,600
Yeah.

1707
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,400
Um, oh yeah, maybe logistically they didn't want.

1708
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:56,880
Right.

1709
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,080
Right.

1710
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,960
Um, anyways, we had a lot of questions.

1711
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,320
We were all everybody while this, while the restaurant part was fun, we were a

1712
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,080
buzz over the Knights entertainment, a mystic of what's in store for us at a

1713
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,080
mystic, so we're asking, what do you know?

1714
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,280
And, uh, the former personal chef said, well, I've, I've seen it a bunch of

1715
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,720
times, it's better than mind freak.

1716
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,560
It's incredible.

1717
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,440
Oh my God.

1718
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,000
And we asked him about something that we had heard about that.

1719
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,920
Maybe there's something not, it's not that you get wet.

1720
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,960
It's that something happens to you in the audience.

1721
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,000
Maybe you get messy, you get covered in something.

1722
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,280
We didn't know what this was going to be.

1723
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,920
And he was cagey about it.

1724
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,080
Like, oh, I can't say that's a little seek.

1725
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,880
I can't whisper you that little secret.

1726
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,160
Um, so we, but, but it was confirmed that like something's going to happen to us.

1727
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,800
And I don't know what this is going to be.

1728
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,040
Do I need to be concerned?

1729
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,520
Is it a, is it gross?

1730
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,200
Is it being slimed?

1731
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,800
Is it Gallagher watermelon gunk's style?

1732
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,360
I don't know what to anticipate here.

1733
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:54,840
Yeah.

1734
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,640
Maybe, maybe if there's a rope in your room, you wear it downstairs.

1735
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,000
Like a tarp, like as a smock, you know, pull it out right before.

1736
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:03,480
Yeah.

1737
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:03,520
Yeah.

1738
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,600
Cover the face with it.

1739
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,760
Um, but you know, we did go in with, you know, not, we not wearing maybe our

1740
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,360
finest, although in a way this, these are fine items we did buy kablip shirts.

1741
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,080
So, uh, Jason's in a kablip shirt.

1742
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,720
Eva's in a kablip shirt and I am as well.

1743
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,000
So we're, we're dressed in the night's because also because of the kind of ticket

1744
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,280
we bought and because it's in the first month of the show, meet and greet with

1745
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,160
Chris angel, we're going to meet Chris angel because we did this.

1746
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,240
Uh, so now cut to show time.

1747
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,800
Um, it's, it's, uh, the theater is more full than I thought.

1748
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:45,560
Still a pretty weak crowd, I would say for an opening week of a big Las Vegas

1749
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,760
show from a, essentially a household name or as close to a household as you could

1750
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,200
get in Las Vegas.

1751
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,000
Um, uh, but so I was disappointed that it wasn't just 20 people, but still kind

1752
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,440
of a funny, like, uh, smattering of folks.

1753
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:06,200
Um, we're, we're piling in and we're immediately confronted with what the

1754
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:11,200
thing is going to be that happens to the audience because there is just so much

1755
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:16,080
loose white confetti on the ground, huge chunks of confetti.

1756
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,400
Okay.

1757
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,000
So it's a big confetti blast.

1758
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,560
Well, that's not so crazy.

1759
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,920
That was nothing to be concerned about.

1760
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:27,480
Um, oh wait, one aspect before we got into the theater, we had a dinner at a

1761
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,080
steak house right next to the theater at planet Hollywood up on the second floor.

1762
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,360
I believe it's called the strip house.

1763
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,720
Um, nice dinner, good restaurant.

1764
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,400
Liked it on the way to the restroom.

1765
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,160
There's a little private room with a glass window that you can see into who

1766
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:47,400
should be in there, but Chris angel himself, the steak house right before the show.

1767
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,040
Wow.

1768
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:54,800
Um, so, uh, and he is basically like leaning over a table with a bunch of

1769
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,720
papers in front of him, which he's working on, he looks like he's crunching

1770
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,640
numbers and he's wearing little glasses.

1771
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,320
Yes.

1772
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,920
I've seen a little glasses, I think.

1773
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,680
I've seen a little, yeah, maybe.

1774
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,200
Um, it reminded me so much of when Homer puts on glasses to look smart.

1775
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:10,680
Yeah.

1776
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,960
He's doing like the crunching numbers in bed.

1777
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,240
Um, I liked it.

1778
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,960
I thought it was, it was cute in a way.

1779
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,280
Um, so, but he looked stressed out and it just added to like, what are

1780
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,120
we getting ourselves into?

1781
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,840
How is, how full is this place going to be?

1782
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,200
What is the show going to be?

1783
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,960
He's, uh, he's like doing his doing taxes essentially in the steakhouse,

1784
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,240
even though he's got a show.

1785
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,520
Like we've got to be in there in 10 minutes.

1786
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,840
Why is Chris still here?

1787
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:40,200
So, well, you've got to let the chicken and rice sit for a second.

1788
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,040
Let it settle.

1789
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:43,520
Yes.

1790
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
So anyways, get it.

1791
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,480
I have, sorry.

1792
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,600
This is the picture of the glass.

1793
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,040
Is it easy?

1794
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,040
Glad I need to know.

1795
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,720
Oh, let's see.

1796
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,200
Uh huh.

1797
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,320
Oh yes.

1798
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:53,520
Yeah.

1799
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,800
Was it, well, was that sent to the thread or did he post that?

1800
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,120
Oh, okay.

1801
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:57,560
Gotcha.

1802
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:03,760
Wait, he posted himself looking stressed out in the paper on, he's got a paper on

1803
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:04,640
the table.

1804
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,560
He's not, he's, I think looking at his phone, but he's in front of like, well, a

1805
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,480
bunch of wine.

1806
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,320
Oh, that's exactly what we saw.

1807
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:10,600
Yeah.

1808
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,360
A lot.

1809
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:11,880
Yeah.

1810
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,120
So I think office is de facto office.

1811
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:21,760
Like, yeah, I think I would have to think like Chris's room at the steakhouse.

1812
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,160
Yeah.

1813
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,040
I guess so.

1814
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:23,920
And it's right there.

1815
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,400
Then you just walk right over.

1816
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,600
Uh, it's very convenient.

1817
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,440
Boy, that's sharp.

1818
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:27,840
Okay.

1819
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:27,960
Okay.

1820
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,280
Yeah.

1821
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,800
So those are his old glasses.

1822
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,360
So you yourself could see Chris.

1823
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,320
Um, anyway, oh, something I forgot to say.

1824
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,800
So the theater is pretty full.

1825
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,600
Like we paid a decent amount for these tickets, but I think they're giving them

1826
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,720
away for free in some, so.

1827
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,960
Some buy one get one free deals for sure.

1828
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,160
Go.

1829
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:44,640
Yeah.

1830
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:44,920
Yeah.

1831
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,480
Or something.

1832
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,000
If you stay at planet Hollywood, maybe they're handing them out.

1833
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,360
I'm not sure how they're getting rid of these tickets, but it all, you figure out

1834
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,440
the math of it because only the people who paid end up getting the meet and

1835
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,160
greet because there weren't that many people at the meet and greet.

1836
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:04,160
So anyways, uh, show begins and, uh, here's where I don't have much to say about a

1837
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:04,840
mystica.

1838
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,440
Eva was very specific.

1839
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,840
We, we can't do an a mystica episode yet.

1840
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,280
I have to see it one more time.

1841
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:10,520
Right.

1842
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:10,680
Right.

1843
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,120
I have to analyze this a little more.

1844
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,040
That my full bearings about a mystica.

1845
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:14,960
Save that for later.

1846
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,240
So maybe full of mystica coming down the road, but what can I say about it

1847
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,920
without spoiling it?

1848
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,400
Cause I would encourage people to see it and to find a free way to see it.

1849
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:25,760
Sure.

1850
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,600
Cause I think those exist.

1851
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:39,960
Um, it is a stunning blend of not very much magic, um, the auto tune songs that

1852
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,520
I've determined since that at least one of them was written by Chris's wife.

1853
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,480
Uh, very like, you know, he's there in that Evanescence pocket for sure.

1854
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,360
You're in 2022.

1855
01:15:51,720 --> 01:16:00,960
Um, there is a lot of very nineties standup comedy magic, which involves some,

1856
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:07,480
uh, impressions of types of people that are also a little, maybe more shocking

1857
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,720
than Evanescence type music in 2022.

1858
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,440
And is Chris doing this magic?

1859
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,360
No.

1860
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,080
Uh, so yeah, so, so why is Chris stressed out in his office?

1861
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,120
Not even though he has a show.

1862
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,320
Well, because Chris, we were, there was a question with everybody.

1863
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,960
Is Chris even in the show?

1864
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:31,440
And, and like, because it's all, it was framed so confusingly, like, yeah, wait,

1865
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,520
is he like trying to pass the book and like set up something that has his

1866
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,880
branding, but he's not in it.

1867
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,960
The answer is he shows up about an hour in, you get an hour of other stuff.

1868
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,440
Wow.

1869
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,800
He's a presence in it.

1870
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,400
You hear his narration.

1871
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:48,960
Um, he's, he basically the, he's taking you through his life and telling you

1872
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,320
like, Oh, then I would got into Houdini.

1873
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,560
And then you see a guy who was being Houdini and escapes from the tank

1874
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,280
and that kind of thing, uh, but he doesn't show up till an hour.

1875
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,720
He since has said he's intending to not be in the show anymore at the end of the

1876
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:03,240
month.

1877
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,800
So if you're in the Vegas area and you want to see Chris angel, and if this show

1878
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,560
still exists, when you're hearing this, just do it soon.

1879
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,800
If somehow I'm tantalizing here to go to this somehow,

1880
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:20,600
Jane and I were talking about like, ah, can we squeeze in a Vegas trip more to

1881
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,880
see the mirage?

1882
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,840
Well, we've never seen the mirage volcano and that seems like it's only got a few

1883
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,360
more months life left in it.

1884
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,280
Oh, maybe.

1885
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:28,640
Yeah.

1886
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:28,960
Yeah.

1887
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,200
You don't know what else this weird like projection thing at the wind,

1888
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,880
I would recommend like you go, it's like an outdoor.

1889
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,240
Yeah.

1890
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:35,440
Yeah.

1891
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:35,840
The garden.

1892
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,080
Yeah.

1893
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,840
I want to see the frog.

1894
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,800
That's just read it.

1895
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,040
Some of those areas.

1896
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:40,360
Yeah.

1897
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,000
I would highly recommend that to anybody.

1898
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,120
Yeah.

1899
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,280
A floating projection or it's like a world of color, but weirder.

1900
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:52,040
So anyways, uh, yeah, he's, he's trying to get out of his own show basically as

1901
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,120
little as I can.

1902
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,600
I don't think certainly he did not perform any magic.

1903
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,200
It's a bunch of just like he, his hands are like lower and then they go, they

1904
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,680
shoot a fire and then some preplanned delusion happens in front of them.

1905
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:10,880
Um, thought we had them figured out with the confetti thing, but we had no

1906
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,880
idea what was coming for us.

1907
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,400
Um, uh, okay.

1908
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,000
So full for context, we are in the fifth row.

1909
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,600
We're very close to the stage is a big row.

1910
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,720
That's, that's this whole group.

1911
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:27,920
Um, and at some point three giant fans get pushed right up at the front of the

1912
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,600
stage aimed square at us.

1913
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:37,560
And to be honest, I have the foggiest memory of what plot wise prompted this,

1914
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,520
but I believe that it has something to do with a blizzard.

1915
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,520
I don't know why.

1916
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,200
Maybe this is something that happened to this is Chris's tragic backstory

1917
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,080
that he was in a blizzard once.

1918
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:48,480
Right.

1919
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
Um, could be that.

1920
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,720
Anyway, regardless of justification, all of a sudden you are just blasted

1921
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:01,000
bombarded with the thickest layer of white confetti.

1922
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,040
The fans are so powerful.

1923
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,120
There is so much paper flying at you.

1924
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,400
Like you cannot see, you can't like make heads or tails.

1925
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,800
If you weren't sitting in a chair and you knew which direction you were facing,

1926
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,080
you would feel like you were adrift in the ocean.

1927
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,760
It's the only thing I can compare it to.

1928
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,120
It's like if you wipe out in a wave, if you're swimming the ocean and something

1929
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,480
big surprises you and then you're trying to keep your head above water and where

1930
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,000
am I facing and where's the shore?

1931
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,320
That's how it was as chaotic as that as noisy.

1932
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,400
It's like getting your bill or like if you like crash landed in the ocean from

1933
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,000
a flight that went awry or something, it was crazy.

1934
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,080
And we're at your bend.

1935
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:44,240
It's blast, really loud fans, really loud Lincoln park kind of music.

1936
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,360
You really can't make heads or tails of what the hell is going on.

1937
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,600
Just just pure bombardment.

1938
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:54,920
And then it starts to let up a little bit enough for you to see a couple of things.

1939
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,560
One, you look down, at least in our case, even I both got like too expensive of

1940
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,800
drinks when we got in there.

1941
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,200
I believe I glugged my wine pretty fast as I want to do.

1942
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,240
Eva had about half a beer to go.

1943
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:13,880
She looks down just pure confetti, just soaking up the drink ruined, expensive

1944
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,960
drink ruined.

1945
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,240
So we're getting our bearings.

1946
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,320
Oh my God, the drink.

1947
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:18,840
Holy shit.

1948
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,280
And then I turn just to look at the aghast face of faces of this entire row.

1949
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,400
Jason's Eva's next to me.

1950
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,720
Jason next to her.

1951
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,400
I look over right in time to see a huge plastic bag.

1952
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,440
Whip Jason in the face.

1953
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:42,440
Just smack like kind of like where you're like, are you OK?

1954
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,440
Did that hurt?

1955
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,520
And then you realize, wait, that was not just confetti.

1956
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,360
There was garbage in there.

1957
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,760
There was literal garbage.

1958
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:55,280
And you look down on the ground like, wait, there's like paper towel rolls and like

1959
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,080
and really long strands of confetti and plastic bags and just like.

1960
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,200
So this is what happens to you in the show.

1961
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,160
You get pelted with garbage.

1962
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:09,040
If you go to the show, you are literally pelted with garbage.

1963
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:09,920
Wow.

1964
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,600
Wow.

1965
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,160
That's the answer of what a mystica is.

1966
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,800
Gosh, it's a magical garbage pelting.

1967
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,000
Now, I have to say, when we we did a show at Christmas time,

1968
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,360
a small theater at Lyric Hyperion Theater here in Los Angeles.

1969
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,320
And for that show,

1970
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,240
I was punching.

1971
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,600
I had a hole punch backstage and I had a bunch of printer paper.

1972
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,960
And and Erin was helping me do this, too.

1973
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,680
I was getting like a handful of like confetti, a handful of white paper

1974
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:46,000
that I could dust off when I was coming in, like I was coming in from out

1975
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,800
out in the cold. Yes.

1976
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,560
I used about five or six, less than 10 pieces of paper.

1977
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,200
Again, enough hole punchy punches that you can fit in a hand.

1978
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:03,280
I was finding those pieces of paper in my bag, in my jacket,

1979
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,840
in my sweaters that I was wearing.

1980
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,360
I was finding those four months.

1981
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,200
Yeah. After that show.

1982
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,720
So to then to be pelted with garbage.

1983
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,800
Well, the operation it takes to get all to collect all of this paper.

1984
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,760
So is it reuse garbage after each show?

1985
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,400
I feel like it's got to be right.

1986
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,680
Like what seems like it has to be going on where they just leave it all on the ground.

1987
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,520
Yeah, I think I think that's going I I don't I don't want any libel

1988
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,520
situation because there's a you got to be careful with this camp, with the angel.

1989
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,240
Can't the garbage. Yeah, the garbage budget would have to be so high.

1990
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,320
If it's all fresh garbage.

1991
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,880
Yeah, they're blasting that.

1992
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,400
I mean, maybe that's some of the financial struggle of the show.

1993
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,440
But I'm like, why did they not clean it up from the prior show?

1994
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,440
It was like, yeah, it felt like an inch thick on the ground when we walked in.

1995
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,040
So then by the time you're leaving after and then, by the way,

1996
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,760
end of the show happens again, they close with it.

1997
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,040
Really? No fans are back.

1998
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,720
And that one's worse. Wow. So crazy.

1999
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,840
Because the Blue Man Group show that I remember seeing as a kid,

2000
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,440
they blast the audience with strands, streamers, like strands of stuff.

2001
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,680
And but it all kind of ties together and you just pick it up

2002
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,720
and throw it on the ground and pretty quickly as soon as the lights came up.

2003
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,360
There's people with brooms.

2004
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,480
Oh, there it is. There is certainly not that.

2005
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,800
No, no, no. Yeah.

2006
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,120
Operational issue, I think at least opening night.

2007
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,440
Yeah, there's got to be reuse.

2008
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,840
Maybe they call it recycling.

2009
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,360
Like we're helping the earth by that.

2010
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,560
We promise our garbage is that's not hygienic.

2011
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,440
I don't think so.

2012
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,160
So I think your drinks getting in your eyes of it,

2013
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:44,200
like the force with which it hit Jason,

2014
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,360
this was truly hilarious to see.

2015
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:52,240
I never forget seeing that particular whippet getting wanged by a bag.

2016
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,840
Was it as hard as when Katy Perry, that clip that's going on,

2017
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,960
Katy Perry getting slimed from a box?

2018
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,720
Oh, getting blasted in the face by a symbol.

2019
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,640
Yeah, I like the strand of people noticing the violence of the sliming.

2020
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,960
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2021
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,680
I am just laughing at either Matt.

2022
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,120
There's one or two things happening.

2023
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,600
They shredded a bunch of stuff and industrial shredders

2024
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:17,080
and then through the wrappers and the paper towel rolls that they were using.

2025
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,400
Just all right and throw this in the bin too.

2026
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,880
Or they pre bought bags of shredded material,

2027
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,880
dump those in bins, the distribution bins, and then through the bags

2028
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,080
and after it was like, all right, clogging out.

2029
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,480
I'm out of here.

2030
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:36,120
Well, is it just are they like working with the garbage,

2031
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,640
the waste management at Planet Hollywood?

2032
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:42,840
Like, hey, we have some we have an idea that could help both of us.

2033
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,920
Everything is on the table as far as an explanation, I think.

2034
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,280
I wouldn't be shocked with any of these explanations.

2035
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,560
Follow the garbage.

2036
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,400
Where does the garbage come from?

2037
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,760
Wow. It is so fascinating.

2038
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,600
There were such long strands of it that I grabbed them and I grabbed

2039
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,360
a bunch of long white

2040
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,760
streamers and like wore them like a boa for her.

2041
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,520
For her immediately after meet and greet with Chris.

2042
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,280
I don't have much to say about this.

2043
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,760
We waited in line. We felt pretty amped and we were so excited to approach him.

2044
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,240
Three of us in shirts of his restaurant.

2045
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:21,960
Sure. Like this is this is entirely a trip devoted to him.

2046
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:25,520
We have all spent hundreds of dollars in his name.

2047
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:29,160
And so we walk up immediately, just point to the shirts.

2048
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,920
Chris, we went to Kaplip.

2049
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,400
We went to we were at Kaplip earlier today, Chris.

2050
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,880
Oh, that's as much as we got out of him.

2051
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,320
Pretty much everything is.

2052
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,200
Oh, yeah.

2053
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,200
Somebody tried to move

2054
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,720
deep into the interaction, which is pointing at Mr.

2055
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,240
Waller and saying, you know, this is the director of Borat 2.

2056
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:55,280
Oh, he maybe went up like three percent.

2057
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,840
There's a little lilt in the.

2058
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,280
Oh, that's that's all he got.

2059
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:05,280
And you're like, this this is, you know, that you want to say, like,

2060
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,160
you know, this isn't normal, right?

2061
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,600
You know, like maybe to you, but like we've been outside of Las Vegas,

2062
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,160
something I don't think you do a lot.

2063
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,840
And I'm telling you, people are not traveling to your restaurant

2064
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,280
and to your specifically your show that isn't going well.

2065
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,080
They don't know about it.

2066
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,480
How do you know the only the only people who know about it?

2067
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,880
It's it's like all a family tree that descends from Jason Waller.

2068
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,360
From us to the audience of the show. Yeah.

2069
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,120
So like, you know, you're meeting a very important person

2070
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,240
in your fandom, right?

2071
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,280
I hope you realize the fandom, I would say.

2072
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,680
Yeah, I think so.

2073
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,960
So I guess that's why he was nice enough to do that.

2074
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,440
Oh, we'll give him a little more.

2075
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,960
So so that was that.

2076
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,080
So if you want to get pelted with garbage,

2077
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:02,200
and try to find a way to do it for free, a mystic is for now still up and running.

2078
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,720
It was a truly unforgettable experience.

2079
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,400
But guess what? I come back.

2080
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,280
Oh, wow. You've been to.

2081
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,560
Generally, only one.

2082
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,400
Oh, shucks.

2083
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,400
Well, this, you know, this one egged on by Eva.

2084
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,560
Eva said you got to do it.

2085
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,160
And and she even helped pick out

2086
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,360
what she thought were most suited to your personality.

2087
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,560
The Kaplip shirts that you guys would like the most actually kind of forget

2088
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,040
what Mike's is.

2089
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,560
We'll unbox together here.

2090
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,440
What does this say?

2091
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:37,480
Wait a minute.

2092
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,520
I don't think this is this isn't this is the wrong one.

2093
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,720
Actually, no, that's not right.

2094
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,240
It's also I were guessing on sizes.

2095
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,000
This is not the one that we asked for.

2096
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,800
It says not show girlfriend just a place to eat, not show.

2097
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,000
Girl. Oh, oh, oh.

2098
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Just a place to I don't know what this means.

2099
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,840
And this isn't the one that we asked for.

2100
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,480
But anyway, but that is mine.

2101
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,880
That's yours. Thank you.

2102
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,800
Here, I'll toss it over.

2103
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:05,920
And then I really hope they didn't mess up yours, Jason, because we want to.

2104
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,680
Oh, thank God. OK.

2105
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,760
For you, Jason, American flag, Moapa Valley, proud America.

2106
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,600
Yeah, thank you.

2107
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,160
There you go.

2108
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,040
Oh, where that show your colors.

2109
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,560
What did my was my supposed to say?

2110
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,520
It's whatever was the most uncomfortably sexual.

2111
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,920
I don't know. It's not occurring.

2112
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,920
I don't know if it's the one some maybe a sexual mix sort of.

2113
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,240
I don't know. Not show.

2114
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:36,160
Girl, not your girlfriend.

2115
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,240
I think just a place to eat.

2116
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:42,000
But what is and what's the place you're sexual?

2117
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,080
Yeah, I guess.

2118
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,400
So like you're having like an affair or something.

2119
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,920
I'm not sure.

2120
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,720
It's very not clear.

2121
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:53,040
I don't know. I know. I kind of like that you ended up with a very confusing one.

2122
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,560
It's confusing, but I think it's dirty.

2123
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,680
Jason, you think it's dirty?

2124
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:02,480
I don't. I think it's trying to be a little body, but I don't understand it.

2125
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,920
Well, from what I understand, EEC has two meanings.

2126
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,240
I don't know anything about that.

2127
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,920
Girlfriend. These good boys wouldn't know.

2128
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,840
OK, I'm just saying.

2129
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,560
Well, enjoy those.

2130
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,800
And you know what?

2131
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,160
Let's why don't we wrap this up and let's go.

2132
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:23,320
Why don't we all put on our Kablip shirts and then

2133
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,760
big round of hugs?

2134
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,480
Hugs are back.

2135
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,240
Kablip is Kablip is great and hugs are back.

2136
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,800
Let's all and let's go head down to that.

2137
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,680
Let's let's go hug some characters.

2138
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:39,800
OK, see if they like our Kablip shirts more than the owner of.

2139
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,880
Do we feel comfortable enough to an upcoming Disneyland trip?

2140
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,800
The three of us have planned to wear the shirts all together.

2141
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,080
Be a tad inexplicable, wouldn't it?

2142
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,680
Like, wait, are they all wearing Disney? No, no.

2143
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:56,680
Do those three grown men want to make sure they don't get lost in the crowd?

2144
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,760
They want to make sure they can identify each other with their shirt.

2145
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,600
Maybe it's a bachelor party.

2146
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,480
Although my shirt is dirty, so I don't want them.

2147
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,400
Although, no, it's confusing. No one will think it's dirty.

2148
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,040
Yeah. Well, you have to read it for life, to stare at it for a while.

2149
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:15,120
To determine that maybe it could be if it was a little more clear.

2150
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,400
That's a good point.

2151
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,160
Yeah, you're safe. Probably safe.

2152
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,240
I think you're fine.

2153
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,560
What is yours? Does yours say something on the back?

2154
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:26,200
I did the don't wine drink beer.

2155
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:29,680
OK. All right. So confusing. Pretty.

2156
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:33,640
But yeah, I don't know if we were trying to get you the one that said like

2157
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:38,200
Kabloop is the sound a turd makes when it goes in the toilet.

2158
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,920
Which is painted in giant letters in the bathroom.

2159
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,120
Yes, it's up on the wall in the bathroom. Yeah, that is.

2160
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,600
There's last list. Poop splash humor.

2161
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,840
OK, so I recommend all of these experiences.

2162
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,560
Head to Kabloop, head to a mystic.

2163
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:56,880
And of course, go enjoy the privilege of hugs.

2164
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,360
The band is over.

2165
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:02,560
You have survived podcast the riot and we've all survived the dark time

2166
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,080
of the hug ban, the darkest eras in history.

2167
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,760
We won Moapa Valley, proud America.
