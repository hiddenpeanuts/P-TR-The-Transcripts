1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000

Dismissive Brownie remarks

6

Nameless and faceless judges

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All that plus Eva Anderson and Amy Nicholson return to talk about the LA County Fair

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
On today's podcast, The Ride!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast that always gets the blue ribbon for ignoring theme parks to talk about long-dead character actors.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm Scott Gardner, Jason Chardon. You laugh loudest, I go to you first.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I did laugh loudest. Hey, once again, rest in peace, Dabney Coleman, you know, we gotta give it up.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you don't, yeah, if you missed it, that was a second gate thing, if you missed the live reaction to the death of Dabney Coleman, which occurred only many hours earlier, and directly in the middle of a sentence I was saying from Jason.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
About your loving family.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Jason was like, whoa, whoa, we have to address something right now.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hang on, hang on.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dabney Coleman has died.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, the castle's not on fire, don't worry about it.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There's Mike Coleman.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I mean, Mike, look what you got me doing now.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm here and I respectfully, I wait.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If Larry Storch dies, I wait till a sentence is complete before I announce it.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's what I bring to the show.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm like this rude man sitting next to me here, Jason.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
People had to know many days from when we found out about it.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, same day, I had just three minutes before, gotten an LA Times alert, and Mike's like, that happened 12 hours ago, and I was like, I can't control.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The episode came out many days later, is what I'm saying.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You were breaking the news to no one, unless there were people who missed the entire thing.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I assume all of our listeners have Dabney Coleman death alerts ready to go.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They want to know.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, if they listen to this show, they also are interested in the alive status of over 90-year-old actors, so they should have an alert.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, and we do have a lot of those in play.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's that podcast you listen to?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's about theme parks and actors over the age of 90.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Cutting off a young audience at the pass.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, today we are talking about the LA County Fair.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is exciting.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is fun.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And I was thinking how the fair is all about, you know, like the crazy indulgent foods and like the here's the combo of burger with Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And that's in a way what we've got going on guest wise today is, you know, like the burger with Krispy Kreme doughnuts, both elements great on their own.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Perfect guests on their own together.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, my God.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What a treat.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Right.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Perfect.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Everyone loved it.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Great. Great.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What I'm saying is we got two great guests, great separately on the show.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Best pals together.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I'm so so glad you guys came here together to talk about this and your history with this one renowned film critic and the host of Unspooled.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The other, you know, from all the best episodes of this show, it's Amy Nicholson and Eva Anderson.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hey, we're here.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yay.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We're best friends.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You know what this makes?

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm a donut in your Krispy Kreme donut.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And these guys are the three burger patties in between us.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, because it's triple.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're right.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's triple.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wow.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wow.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, I love.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What an honor.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Jason's the middle patty.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
OK.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No further questions.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So excited about this and to talk about both of your rich history with this event.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I don't look I don't want to tangent for too long.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I want to get to the fair.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But Eva, this is your beat and I feel like it needs to be discussed.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm starting to think Copperfield's never going to get to make the moon disappear.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, you know, I heard he was still.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So somebody wrote on your subreddit that he is still advertising the moon disappearing from his show at the MGM.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
While it's while it's going.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mm hmm.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Still going for now.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's be clear.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We were all you know, if you haven't heard some things have been going on with them.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Double things have been going.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So very atrocious.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Double digit allegations.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Uh huh.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Uh huh.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You might say his good name is disappearing.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I might say.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But the question is, like, a, when will that show stop?

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because we've been discussing on a text thread how he's going to they like he will be dragged out kicking and screaming.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So the technique and do we're like, all right, what's the distance from the stage to the door?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
While the while the police are dragging me, can I get out all the rest of my lines rapid fire?

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So that technically counts as one performance.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And that still goes in the record book.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What happens to blue if he doesn't have a show to do?

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What happens to Moosha Kay?

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What happens to the monkeys that paint your face?

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What happens to the puppets and the ventriloquist dummies?

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The rooms and rooms of puppets and we just realized while we were discussing this, Mike, that Madam is in the museum.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I think David Copperfield owns a Madam puppet, maybe the Madam.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We're not sure.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He also owns like a lot of lamb chops.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You said you've gotten pile of lamb chops.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You sent a video and then you said he has more lamb chops than this.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He has a room that's mostly lamb chops, including some giant lamb chops that were in that.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think we're in Macy's Day parade.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Whoa.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No part of me wants to see a big lamb chop.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
A life-size lamb chop.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So yeah, I don't think, I still believe he will make the moon disappear, but now every day it feels like more of a threat.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh yes, we talk about that.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Then he will like, all right, we're going to go through with these allegations.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We're going to go through whatever legal process.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right, fine.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you want the moon back or not?

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I hope you liked your tides.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And then he starts to like, and then I'll make Idaho go too.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Idaho will disappear as well.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you want to keep asking questions about what I can make disappear?

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If I can make the moon, and you've seen over many specials, what else I can make disappear?

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Where does it stop?

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What about you?

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Can I make you disappear?

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, this is making me very scared about the health and safety of the women who are testifying against him.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That they'll all make it to court without disappearing.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's certainly, it's positive.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We don't know supernaturally what he can do.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Can he make the entire courtroom disappear?

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can he make the city that the court is in disappear?

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your Honor, the witness has been sawed in half.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But also, this is just in the background.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So, you know, if he, say, does leave MGM, that leaves Chris Angel as the reigning cool guy magician.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He wins.

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In Vegas, he does win.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Copperfield's nightmare.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And yet, a hero, a new, what do they say?

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A new hope?

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A new fighter has entered the arena.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Because David Blaine is now doing shows periodically in Vegas.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What can you tell us about this?

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So this is a new, he's doing it, and there's, what is the deal with the residency?

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's like three shows, three shows last month.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's doing three shows at the end of August, the best time to be in Vegas.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then he's doing three shows in December around New Year's.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So it's very limited.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Exclusive.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Exclusive, very highly exclusive.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's the win.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But I do have a friend that went and texted me immediately that I need to get there.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I need to go.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh boy.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So he said that David Blaine's disaffected, emotionless performance makes it incredible.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wow.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So we have a new, we have a new, really listless magician named David in Vegas.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wow.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Void filled immediately.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Who wants to be cool?

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Who's in the posy posy?

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The hero has risen.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Exactly.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When we need it in the most.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm not missing Copperfield at all now that I hear that.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, I know.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's fine.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That really helps.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He just needs blue.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, he should just buy blue or just, or use magic to make blue where he is.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh yeah.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Just point in the general direction of what part of town you think blue is in.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Blue should just retire to the island.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Blue.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is that okay?

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He's earned it.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Blue is in charge of the monkeys.

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
A lot of performances.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is yours now.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Blue beer.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Underwater statue's mine.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He inherits everything, I bet.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
David left everything to blue.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The only one who showed me true love.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
None of my wives, none of my parents.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I found a quote from a, like an interview.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's this dirty puppet ventriloquist, Otto and George act, called Otto and George, which

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
is where the Madame Puppet video is from.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But did you see the, where he, it's an interview where Copperfield's like, you know who told

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
me about Otto and George?

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Kevin Spacey.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And it was like, oh man, this was like 2009.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's all tying together.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Like, were you guys on a plane when you had that conversation?

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Us and Diddy, you know.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The boys.

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Wow.

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh my God.

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So somebody needs to save that Madame Puppet also.

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But I don't know.

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not going to be the one to do it.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Seven or eight lamb chops.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And a bunch of very big lamb chops.

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
A scoop of all the lamb chops you could find.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Which might only be half of them.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But just if you can get in there, grab as many lamb chops as you can and get out.

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
All right.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, I just wanted to make sure we, you know, we discussed where things were at because

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
we were wondering if by the next time you were with us, if it would have happened.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Since October, we've been having this conversation.

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And I think we'll check in every time, I think.

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No matter how worse and worse it gets.

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But to a more pleasant, Todd, let's talk about the fair.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I'm so glad you both brought this to us.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because, like, I feel like we've talked about the fair and you participating in the fair

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and in the contest for a long time.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But what is the whole history here?

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Who does it start with?

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And how do you guys end up doing it together?

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This definitely started with Eva.

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It was like 2007.

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was dating a guy.

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We went to the fair together.

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And it was a very fun day.

232
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
My first time there.

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But I witnessed, we went to the beer and wine pavilion and tasted some beer.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I ended up in a conversation with this old married couple from the Inland Empire

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
whose names were Ron and Nancy, who were competitive mead makers.

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And they got into the drama of the mead tournaments.

237
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I was like, that's interesting.

238
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And then I went to see the baked goods.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I overheard someone being snarky about some of the cakes in there,

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
like saying something mean, an old person saying something mean about something.

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And I was like, this is incredible.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So the next year I entered, I made chocolate cookies.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'd broken up with that boyfriend, but I was like, I'm all in on the fair.

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm taking the fair.

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So I made these cookies with candied bacon on them.

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I needed a date to the fair.

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I was just starting to hang out with you, Amy.

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So it was one of our first like, I feel like solo hangs was that we went

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and ran around the fair together and I totally lost.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I entered the cookies and I did not make it in the cabinet.

251
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I like belly flopped spectacularly.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And that radicalized me, to be honest.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Because I thought chocolate with candied bacon was a cut above.

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I thought chocolate with candied bacon was really like pushing the limits

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
of what bacon could do.

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was really proud of you.

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, thank you.

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And so in your failure, I then became hooked, addicted, angry,

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
emotionally caught up in the drama of the baking cabinet.

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I've been really, I've spent many years by your side rooting for you.

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The year that you added a lot of pretzels to your cookies

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and they got upset about it.

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No, I feel like we go a lot together as a team

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and have like for the last decade basically on and off.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Geez, this is beautiful.

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And like rooting for each other, supporting each other.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, yeah.

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And getting like more and more fond of this place

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and like the odds and ends and like stray corners of it.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because I would imagine, because this is like a, you know,

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
there's 2,000 things to do at this particular fair

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and like entire swaths of it you could miss very easily, I'm sure.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, yeah.

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No, and then on and off, we've gone on and off for the last 10 years.

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I entered stuff.

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sometimes you make it in the cabinet.

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Some days you get a blue ribbon.

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know, every year it's a different story.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's you making your own LA County fair story.

282
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Wow, wow.

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I have liked going, you know, when I do go without you,

284
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
like I will visit the pastry cabinet on years where you have done well or not.

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And I will send you pictures of me flipping off the winners

286
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
if it has not been your year.

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes, you always do that.

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It makes me so happy.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because I love being passionately angry about something like this.

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I always wanted, I was like, the best way to experience this seems to be

292
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to have an emotional stake.

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You just have to find what that stake is.

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And then it becomes this whole giant 2,000 thing,

295
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
thing becomes about you, about me.

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And it's my special thing.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And this is the dream is to get in the cabinet.

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't think I knew the cabinet aspect of it.

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

300
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I went to the fair yesterday as encouraged by you guys.

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I took my son and I had a great time.

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I'll factor in into the discussion.

303
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But I don't think I knew that there's the initial competition,

304
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but then you get to stay your cookies, cakes, whatever it is,

305
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
stay in that cabinet for the run of the fair.

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
For more than a month.

307
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Wow, wow.

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Just rotting?

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, yeah.

310
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There's some really moldy, disgusting stuff in the cabinet.

311
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The ones that are like buttercream and fruit, they're just not holding up.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Falling apart.

314
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If it's hot at the fair, then it's a particularly,

315
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the way it's trapped in that under the grandstands area,

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and then a case within that, that's three levels of heat.

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Three levels.

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And they have a whole category called sugar art,

319
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
where people are making delicate, filigreed sugar that just does not last ever.

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It immediately dissolves into a pile of goo.

321
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, yeah.

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There was, I cannot figure out what was going on,

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
but there was one slice of cake that was so mangled this time around

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that I think a rat got into the cabinet.

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That was the only way I could explain what had happened to it,

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
because it was like only parts that were just missing.

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, you've got to see the rats.

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You've got to see the fair.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You've got to get deep fried, or you've got to meet the fair rats.

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Eva was actually really trying to get people involved in this rat conspiracy,

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
because we were standing next to an older couple,

332
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and you were telling them that you believed there was a rat in the cabinet,

333
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and you were being really insistent about it.

334
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I mean, the best thing to do in the culinary baking area

335
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
is to engage with whoever is standing nearby.

336
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So sometimes you're like, hey, I won a prize,

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and an old lady gives you a mean girl look to her husband

338
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
like a bitch from seventh grade.

339
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Or sometimes they drag you over, and they're like,

340
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
look at these disgusting caramels.

341
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And you don't know this person, and you don't care,

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but they're just like, you're not supposed to wrap them.

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He always wraps his caramels.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There's just weird stuff always happening in that.

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But you have to talk to strangers to engage with it.

346
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We also love the culinary arts pavilion,

347
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
because it has the greatest competition of the fair, tablescaping.

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know if you admire the tablescaping.

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I found tablescaping.

350
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
As soon as I saw this area, I was like, have we talked about this before?

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And I'm also taking in this has to be an Eva thing.

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And the tablescaping and semi-relatedly doors, yeah.

353
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Doorscaping.

354
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Competitive, in that case, competitive decoration of doors.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I was really blown back by the phrase atop a QR code,

357
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
vote for your favorite door.

358
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's not a phrase I expected to see that day.

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Also the fact that all these doorscaping and tablescaping,

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you can read the judges' comments, and they can be very, very nasty.

361
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But my favorite was on one of the doors this time.

362
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think someone had stretched fabric to cover the entire door,

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and one of the comments was like,

364
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the door is no longer functioning as a door.

365
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
They got points off for making it no longer a door.

366
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm finding doorscaping fascinating, because it's new, right?

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This is only the second year that they've had doorscaping.

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, doorscaping is brand new.

369
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And when you think about it, I grew up in the Texas suburbs.

370
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There were definitely women who got into wreaths, you know,

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
door frames.

372
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But now when you watch an art develop,

373
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
which is what we're doing with doorscaping,

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
brand new second year,

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
you're watching people push the frontier of what a door is.

376
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Because I feel like last year it was a lot of holiday doors.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You know, kind of basic, like, oh, it's Christmas.

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, hi. Oh, it's Memorial Day.

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This year somebody had an indoor door

380
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
where it was like a door representing being inside a teenage girl's bedroom.

381
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And then it's just that little flip where you're like,

382
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
oh, this is a world opening up.

383
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's literally a door into a new area of competition.

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You can imagine any door now.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
In year two, they flipped the entire thing,

386
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the entire system of doors on its head.

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And honestly, a really spectacular Twilight Zone door,

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
where they made it into the door from the opening to the Twilight Zone

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
with all the stuff around.

390
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
A big stand-up Rod Serling and everything on it is black and white,

391
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
including like the big eyeball.

392
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah. Is that, but is that maybe like, it's like IP?

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Is that frowned upon?

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Or like, could you make like a Marvel Comics door?

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, yeah.

396
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They're fine with that.

397
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There's Harry Potter tables every year.

398
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah. And like we're very into competition.

399
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And we have, I would say lamented how IP has invaded the competition space.

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Like poodle grooming competitions are another thing we're really into.

401
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They're not at the fair. They may be someday.

402
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah. That would be so good to do creative dog styling at the fair.

403
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But we've watched like IP enter the poodle grooming space,

404
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
which has been kind of a bummer.

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It used to just be like, I'm a dog that looks like a carousel horse.

406
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And now it's like, I am all the characters in Moana.

407
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And it's tacky here.

408
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, yeah, sure. I went one year for that.

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And yeah, that one, the winner was like, it's Spiderman.

410
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And who's Venom?

411
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That was the coolest dog.

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But then how it was like the mouth of Venom wasn't the mouth of the dog.

413
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It was like the teeth were on his chest.

414
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Well, was it the symbiote coming off of Spiderman, the alien entity?

415
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think it was a little more traditional.

417
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The Venom symbiote tries to get off Spiderman.

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He has his own mouth sort of jutting off of a head.

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So perhaps that's what it was.

420
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
His neck was his mouth, his wide mouth, his teeth.

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But we will get in fights with judges.

422
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, yeah, we really hate the judges at the poodle grooming competition.

423
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, we'll scream at them and then we'll get mad about the wrong table winning.

424
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Because there's a lot of, you know, sucking up to your audience

425
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that I think happens in these kind of competitions.

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, condescension.

427
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, a lot of like salute the troops tablescaping.

428
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That happened this year.

429
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes, door and tablescaping.

430
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I noticed that.

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And there was one, and forgive me, I don't want to be stealing valor.

432
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But I think the one that I was, I swear when I was looking at the photo later,

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I saw like a little swirl on the forehead of the soldier pictured.

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It was like a little like, I mean, tablescape, this might be a bigger explanation required,

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
but it's like, all right, you set a table for some kind of theme

436
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and the competition is not, it's the plates that you choose

437
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and the forks and knives that you choose,

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
but then also like the menu of what's being served and the backdrop

439
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and then other decorations.

440
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So in this case, it's like welcome home.

441
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We are proud of you over red, white and blue.

442
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And then photos of the returning soldier hugging his children.

443
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But I swear I saw a little swirly on his forehead

444
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
that indicates the watermark of a stock photo website where it was not.

445
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I really think so.

446
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I know what I saw in the photo.

447
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I think I'm looking at like it's a cloud something or other.

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I've seen this swirl before.

449
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And if that's the case, then I don't know if it won or anything,

450
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but like I'd rather go give it to the fun Halloween door

451
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
than be guilted into it by a troop who is not the...

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Properly licensed.

453
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes.

454
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yes.

455
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
A troop whose image was not paid for to be part of this competition.

456
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Don't you sit with your son, though, and look at when you eat dinner,

457
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you look at framed photos of you and your son.

458
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, always. Yes, of course.

459
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That are on the table where you're eating the macaroni and cheese.

460
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If he's in it, fine, but mainly me looking sharp, handsome, doing my duty.

461
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know, it's a bonus if he's in it, but yeah, me is the main thing.

462
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And it's on the table.

463
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yes, while we eat.

464
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

465
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I know you need to look at your food to make sure that you're properly getting your food,

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
but you know, when you're not reaching for your peas, eyes on me.

467
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Jason has dinner with that photo of him in a sailor suit on the kitchen table.

468
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I tell him at ease and then we can start on the appetizers.

469
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The other aspect of that door also, you know, I'm not...

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't really come from a military tradition.

471
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm not in a military family. Maybe this is how it is.

472
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm left to assume that if you're a soldier,

473
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
then you want to eat dinner next to a framed photo of a bald eagle.

474
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Really close up, staring right down the barrel of the lens, angrily.

475
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
A mad bald eagle.

476
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
A terrifyingly powerful bird.

477
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I believe the table that won this year is like a really spectacular, nice midsummer table.

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Didn't it win?

479
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I had some objections with the nice midsummer table,

480
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
where like the whole center of the table was just a huge floral display,

481
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
you know, kind of like you just took a wedge out of Florence Pugh's costume and put it there.

482
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
To me, I felt like there wasn't any room to eat.

483
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You know, I was like expecting them to take some points off,

484
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but they did put ribbons around the table legs, which I thought was beautiful.

485
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And I like the Edward Gorey table, which was the like masterpiece mystery table.

486
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That had all the characters from the opening of mystery from PBS.

487
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I had to really like divide.

488
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Luckily, my son was eating churros during all this,

489
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but I'm like, as soon as these churros are up,

490
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
he's not going to have the patience for the table scaping contest.

491
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So I was taking in what I could, but I knew I had a ticking clock,

492
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
which was, you know, cinnamon and powdered sugar.

493
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
One giant churro.

494
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I did really enjoy getting to see this.

495
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I feel like, you know, I mean, we're looking at like theming,

496
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and if the show is about theming, you know,

497
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
this is just some good just like winnowed down theming.

498
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's take a table and just with a table.

499
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
How can we transport you into another world?

500
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And my favorite thing was that this table competition invented the idea of summer ween,

501
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
a summer Halloween.

502
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I mean, maybe that exists outside of this, but I've never heard of summer ween before.

503
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And I now want to host my own summer ween party because it was like,

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I mean, the detail I love the most was like, here's the grill with cobwebs all over it.

505
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then there's burger patties and then melted cheese on top.

506
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But they made jack-o-lantern.

507
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
They made a jack-o-lantern smile in the cheese.

508
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, OK.

509
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
See, that's great.

510
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I want to make haunted hamburgers at my summer ween party.

511
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I thought that one was wonderful and it didn't score very well.

512
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And I was really upset about it.

513
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I thought it was because it had a very kind of sexy looking Frankenstein head

514
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
taking up a lot of the table.

515
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It did, and he was really sexy.

516
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He seemed weirdly aroused.

517
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The way the head seemed aroused?

518
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah, he was a paper mache head that just had the wrong expression for a Frankenstein.

519
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
He was like, ooh, is that one?

520
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He was like, hey, ladies.

521
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
OK, it was more like...

522
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He was like Austin Butler Frankenstein.

523
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
He did look like Austin Butler.

524
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah, he looked too much like Austin Butler.

525
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Austin Butler does seem like he's always aroused.

526
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah, he does.

527
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The Jacob O'Lordy Frankenstein.

528
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Somebody who's just got too much to sauce around.

529
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Right, right, right.

530
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Subjects to these actors.

531
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Every second they're unframed, they're rock hard.

532
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That's how they get the performance.

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They just have to shoot around.

534
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Who else is going to play Elvis?

535
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But then there was a table that tried to add a specific erotic element.

536
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It added storytelling.

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
For me, I think the first time I'd seen storytelling at a tablescaping competition.

538
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The text chain?

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The text chain.

540
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
There was one, it was a couple who were sitting down at an Italian restaurant.

541
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That was the idea you were getting.

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And the front of the tablescaping had a brick wall.

543
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And on the brick wall, you could see the text of the couple arranging the meetup.

544
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You know, like, oh, we're going to go, we're going to get some spaghetti.

545
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, it's going to be great.

546
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But when you walked behind the table, which is a space that I don't think they've ever used.

547
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I've never seen theming behind the table before.

548
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
When you walk behind the table on the backside of the brick wall,

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
the guy was cheating on his girlfriend by texting somebody else

550
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and saying he can't wait to meet up with her after dinner.

551
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Did you just have a sense there was more story back there?

552
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Or did anything point the way to it?

553
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
How did you know?

554
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I just, I'm a curious person.

555
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm going to get every angle of the table.

556
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Wow.

557
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's so great.

558
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Wow. All of these, geez.

559
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
These art forms that presumably our listeners have just heard about for the first time.

560
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Tablescaping and doorscaping.

561
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Boundaries are being pushed instantly in this fledgling new art.

562
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I learned about tablescaping, I think, a few years ago from Eva's posts.

563
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh, yeah.

564
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
From Instagram stories.

565
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I kind of was able to suss out what it was.

566
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm like, there has got to be a whole subculture and competitiveness.

567
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Oh, yeah.

568
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
A whole world of this.

569
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Doorscaping, decorating doors does make me think of,

570
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
besides Christmas and Halloween,

571
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I do think of people who are really excited

572
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and doing a big Disney family vacation.

573
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If you stay at the Disney hotels,

574
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
you will often see a decorated door.

575
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Same on cruise ships.

576
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
People go all out decorating doors.

577
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Decorate their own hotel door?

578
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
At least it's like dorm rooms, right?

579
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
When I was in college, they let us paint them,

580
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and I painted giant carrots all over mine for some reason.

581
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, you're so random.

582
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh, light bulbs.

583
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's like the Simpsons' curtains.

584
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's what it seems like.

585
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't they have carrots on their curtains?

586
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I think that's right.

587
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
When you're talking about any of these contests,

588
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
how in the shit are you as far as knowing who the judges are?

589
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Not at all, very surface level.

590
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We have no idea who they are.

591
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't recognize names year to year from people that enter.

592
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We should.

593
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It'd be good to really get specific about our competition.

594
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah, because we know the dog groomers.

595
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We have favorites and most hated dog groomers.

596
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah, we love Angela Kumke.

597
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
She's the best.

598
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah, we love Angela.

599
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We're Angela stans.

600
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So you're in the shit when it comes to dog contest stuff.

601
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah.

602
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Okay, because there have been times when I'll talk to you about something,

603
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and you'll be like, I can't.

604
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You have a limit usually for like,

605
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I already have five things I'm in the shit on,

606
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and I have to cut it off there.

607
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Is this about wrestling?

608
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Wrestling happened, but it also happened when we were at breakfast club.

609
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I think of a similar thing where I asked if you were going to get involved,

610
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and you're like, I can't.

611
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I can't go deeper.

612
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah, exactly.

613
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You would put the wall up there.

614
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah, getting more into breakfast club.

615
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Right.

616
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Which is the whole thing.

617
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Which is the Los Angeles club.

618
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You go to in Burbank where Bob Gurz is there.

619
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah, Los Feliz.

620
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Los Feliz, yeah.

621
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We became members last year.

622
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
They make you put your hand in a fried egg.

623
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You get blindfolded.

624
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
They put your hand in a fried egg.

625
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You have to recite like a rhyming poem about yourself.

626
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
If you go, you will hold hands with the oldest man you've ever met

627
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and sing things or chant things.

628
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's like a goose lodge or an elk's lodge kind of thing that anyone can go to.

629
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We want Jason to be involved.

630
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
We want you to just be in it already.

631
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You should be the president.

632
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, okay.

633
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You don't want to watch the steps of him engaging with it.

634
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You just want it to have happened.

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I want to be the president tomorrow.

636
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's turning 100 next year, so I feel like it's a good time to get in.

637
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, okay.

638
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah, and you have to get up pretty early, but it's breakfast.

639
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You get sausage.

640
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You get bacon.

641
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You get some sort of croissant bread pudding usually.

642
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Well, now you're speaking my language.

643
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I love variations of bread pudding.

644
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You could probably work something out where you put a cot in the building

645
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and just sleep there the night before.

646
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Sleep there the night before.

647
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Is there any way to ...

648
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It happens every week, is that correct?

649
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's every Wednesday.

650
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Every Wednesday.

651
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
At seven in the morning.

652
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Between seven and nine.

653
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah, but is there a 10 o'clock Wednesday, third Wednesday of the month?

654
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
No.

655
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
This is one of the things that you'll try to institute.

656
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Are we not all tired of these early hours?

657
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Everyone says, no, we're old.

658
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We love it.

659
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We love it.

660
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This is perfect.

661
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Oh, man.

662
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Everyone except Eva and Amy are old.

663
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Actually, with that and the fair, do you feel like you are some of the only people

664
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
taking the torch generationally on some of these areas?

665
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Not so much with the fair, but I'm always surprised that we never run into anybody we know there.

666
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Because it's really close, and it's so fun, and I have never, ever run into any acquaintance there ever.

667
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I find that just bizarre.

668
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I love my friends, but it makes me a little mad at them.

669
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
What are you doing with your life that's better than this?

670
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I saw pictures over the weekend.

671
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Some people I went to college with were there.

672
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh, really?

673
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I think one of them had a ribbon in cross stitching.

674
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What?

675
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I got to look it up.

676
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Do you have another friend that's entering?

677
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And then last year, the other thing we're not even talking about is the entertainment possibilities.

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Last year, Amy and I went and we saw vanilla ice at the fair on top of everything else.

679
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh, this was where vanilla ice happened.

680
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I remember you talking about vanilla ice.

681
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He stands on a box.

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's the one thing in my head about it.

683
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And he sings, no woman, no cry.

684
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But he also wrapped himself in the American flag, because I think he knew his audience.

685
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
He also was just joined on stage with everybody on the planet.

686
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He had all Ninja Turtles come out.

687
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
They came out really dramatically to do the ninja rap with him.

688
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
He just brings good Ninja Turtle suits with him.

689
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah, they came out one at a time and got behind mics to dance.

690
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But there was also a giant polar bear and a clown.

691
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
A guy in a reflective silver suit.

692
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, like a disco ball guy.

693
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
He also, eight months later, was performing at Mar-a-Lago on New Year's Eve.

694
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Hopefully doing the exact same set.

695
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I was wondering, did the turtle costumes make it to the Mar-a-Lago show?

696
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't know.

697
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I would love to be able to talk to somebody that was there, but they probably...

698
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Doesn't he do unpleasant versions of all of his songs, too?

699
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Like their worst versions?

700
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
He does a Rob Van Winkle heavy metal version of some of them.

701
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
He does the hard to swallow era.

702
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He does a hard to swallow set.

703
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
He thinks that was when he was the most sexy and cool.

704
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So he definitely dresses hard to swallow.

705
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Come on.

706
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
When he was the most sexy and cool is when he had White Guy Dreads, obviously.

707
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
When he had a chronic era way after all that music was popular.

708
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Did he arouse Frankenstein of White Guy Dreads?

709
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He should have.

710
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But you can see all sorts of tribute bands.

711
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You can see Vanilla Ice.

712
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
When we saw Vanilla Ice, it was with Tone Locke and Young MC.

713
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
All for One, do you remember?

714
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
They were great.

715
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
They started with the music from Thus Spake Zarustra.

716
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Am I saying that right?

717
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

718
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like real dramatic.

719
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh man, Tone Locke was great.

720
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I loved the 90s tour.

721
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And then also because Coolio was on it for a long time, Vanilla Ice did sing Gangsta's Paradise himself.

722
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Which nobody wanted that from him.

723
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But it did sort of descend into chaos because at one point Tone Locke had started it.

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
He started inviting the sexy women of the audience on stage with him during Wild Thing.

725
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And then a lot of them just got on and never left.

726
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And were there pretty much throughout the entire rest of the show.

727
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It wasn't the end?

728
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
No.

729
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You got a second act of like seven acts.

730
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:33,000
When Vanilla Ice finally came out, I think the last 20 minutes of that show was Vanilla Ice on stage with all the Ninja Turtles, the polar bear, the clown, the DJ was dressed like Bruce Lee.

731
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And then all of his kids and then everybody else's kids and then all of these women.

732
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And it was like 50 people and they were just, he was out of songs by this point.

733
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And he was just chanting Ice, Ice, Ice.

734
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Because he was still.

735
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That was not, it wasn't the end of Ice, Ice Baby.

736
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
He's just doing it.

737
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
All right, now it's just, let's just go back to basics.

738
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
No woman, no cry.

739
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
He couldn't hit any of the good notes in that.

740
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And then he just was yelling Ice as the place slowly, quietly cleared out.

741
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Having seen, this is the seventh act, you're probably, yeah, you're worn out.

742
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If you aren't closing with the hit, don't just shout your name at me.

743
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
He was also going like, things were better in the 90s, weren't they?

744
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
People didn't have phones.

745
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Let's give it up for the cops.

746
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
He was like trying out all these like weird kind of cheer lines.

747
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Cops had their own show back then, remember?

748
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They made that go away.

749
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Everything I ever loved has been taken away from me.

750
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Whose fault is that?

751
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Not mine.

752
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I did everything right.

753
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
He had sex with Madonna.

754
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Shook night dinkled me out of a window.

755
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's PC culture that caused me to stop having sex with Madonna.

756
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
She'd be down, I know she'd be down.

757
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh man.

758
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I also went, so my previous experience, I had gone, I went in 2017.

759
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And I did some, it was somewhat to see the fair because I'd never done it.

760
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And I had a decent enough time, but it was also kind of the prelude to a concert,

761
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
which was a very like, yeah, we got nothing to do.

762
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Why not try this?

763
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Which was Boys to Men and Babyface.

764
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh, that's a good one.

765
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah, we were excited about it, but like had no particular affinity for either

766
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and just thought maybe this will be fun.

767
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Then Babyface is opening act.

768
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
This is one of the ten best concerts I've ever been to.

769
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh really?

770
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I never had any feelings about Babyface.

771
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm like producer and he's always on the Grammys.

772
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's why his 90s hits were kind of boring, like his adult contemporary kind of.

773
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Will I Like This?

774
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It was so fucking good.

775
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It was the most energetic, just juiced up set where like,

776
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
okay, I don't know any of these songs from Boomerang or whatever,

777
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
but they're the best.

778
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
They are all awesome.

779
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And he did this medley of all the songs that he wrote for other artists

780
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
that took a half hour.

781
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It was so long.

782
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And by the end, you're like, this was all you?

783
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I didn't know any of them, which I'm trying to remember.

784
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
All the Bobby Brown hits, Every Little Step,

785
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Tevin Campbell, Can We Talk, Rock Steady by The Whispers,

786
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Then I'll Make Love to You and End of the Road,

787
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Bye Boys to Men, who are coming on after this.

788
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He does them already.

789
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
He scoops them?

790
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He scoops them.

791
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And so good, like absolutely as good as they're going to do it.

793
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
By the end of that medley, he's up in the audience.

794
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
He just needs one person, not four.

795
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He's like, I'll show you guys.

796
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

797
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes.

798
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Why should I wait in here?

799
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think they're down to three.

800
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I think somebody left.

801
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So you have three boys to men?

802
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I think it's been that way for a while.

803
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't think they replaced the fourth.

804
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Is he replaceable?

805
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yes.

807
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Why bother?

808
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But by the end of it, he's up in the grandstands,

809
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
which it is like where you watch horse races also.

810
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So he's climbing stairs.

811
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He's going way the hell up there.

812
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
His shirt comes off.

813
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I really, at the end of this, I'm like, Babyface is God.

814
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And I've listened to him ever since.

815
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
He had this old group called The Deal that's fucking great.

816
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And I didn't know any of those songs.

817
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But anyway, it wore us out so much.

818
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
We were so spent.

819
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And in a good way and the best way,

820
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
it felt like Babyface had fucked us.

821
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Like we had personally been fucked by Babyface.

822
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And we felt great about it.

823
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And it was like, all right, do you want to watch boys to me?

824
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah, maybe.

825
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And we got one song in.

826
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And we're like, they don't have a Babyface ad.

827
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Babyface gave us three concerts in one.

828
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And we just filed out of there.

829
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
We're fine.

830
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That's great.

831
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So I had that coming into this that truly one of the best,

833
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
the most surprising great concert I've been to came from this.

834
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But it just had not been begged to the fair for whatever reason,

835
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I guess COVID being one of them.

836
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But now I got to do it with a kiddo, which was great,

837
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
which thank you both for inspiring that.

838
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That was wonderful.

839
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Let me say this, though, just early on, because if you're like in terms,

840
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
we definitely had a good time more than we didn't.

841
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But I did get in there, parked kind of hot on a weekend afternoon,

842
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
get into like the main midway, like the fun zone.

843
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Would I be crazy to walk in and think, oh, my God, this is very stressful

844
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and very crazy.

845
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Am I crazy?

846
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Like, if I say that, are you like, oh, Scott, you scrooge?

847
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
No, weekends are really crowded.

848
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah.

849
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And all the cool guys have big stuffed animals on their back,

850
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and it's really hard to walk.

851
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah.

852
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And people are eating like 24 inches of pork on a stick,

853
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
which is basically a weapon.

854
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
There could be a very long line for a beer.

855
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, yeah, imposing lines for everything.

856
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And I'm probably the least crowd amenable of the three of us, at least.

857
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Mike, your crowd tolerance is, it's not even tolerance.

858
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I think you prefer being in a crowd.

859
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm uncomfortable here.

860
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Only.

861
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Not enough people.

862
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah, no, I'm OK with crowds.

863
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm tall, too, though.

864
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That's probably part of it.

865
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I can see for miles, you know?

866
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Also, yeah, Jason and I both, we like lines fine.

867
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't know about crowds, but there's more of a comfortability, I would say.

868
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Sure, sure.

869
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If there's an option to go on a weekday, I would recommend a weekday fare trip.

870
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Because it usually runs Thursday through Sunday.

871
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I think so, yeah.

872
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And by the way, as you're hearing this, if you're in LA or not in LA,

873
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
you can still go to the fair, I believe, but it would have to be a weekend, right?

874
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The dates this year were May 3rd through May 27th.

875
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So you still have a little bit of time.

876
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's still worth going.

877
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We went on a Sunday, we went on Mother's Day.

878
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It was great.

879
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It was absolutely wonderful.

880
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There are people winning prizes for their moms.

881
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, yeah.

882
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Wow.

883
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Can I just confirm, are you both Blue Ribbon winners?

884
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh, yes, let's get into that.

885
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, because I wanted to get the terminology.

886
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I didn't want to insult you.

887
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I wanted to get the terminology right because I feel like I've seen pictures of your cookies.

888
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The terminology.

889
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You want a Blue Ribbon for your bunts, right?

890
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I want a Blue Ribbon for one for the lemon bundt cake and one for some chocolate chip cookies, 2019.

891
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Great.

892
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Do you change it up based on, do you ever feel like you see an opening?

893
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Did you go in a previous year and see some real shitty bundt cake and think maybe I can take it there?

894
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah, I was all buns all the time and then I got Blue Ribbon, I got third place, which is red, and then I got pink ribbon, which is fifth place.

895
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And then I was like, well, I need second place.

896
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And that's a really hard thing to aim for.

897
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And then I started just not getting in the cabinet every year.

898
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And these ugly buns did.

899
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And I was like, I'm out.

900
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm making something else.

901
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So I started making other stuff then.

902
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Wow.

903
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You did get your second place for sugar cookie last year.

904
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, so now I've completed everything.

905
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I've got all the ribbons.

906
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You got every place?

907
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't know where they are.

908
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But I did get all the places and then fifth, which is insulting, which is they just don't give me anything.

909
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Don't say I got pink ribbon.

910
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That's not real.

911
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What is the ranking of the colors of ribbons?

912
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Blue is the best.

913
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Is that right?

914
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I think actually it's blue, red, white.

915
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Isn't that it?

916
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah.

917
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's blue, red, white.

918
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I mean, they say that they judge everything based on what they call the Danish system, which is the Danish system of judging is they say that they're not judging you against your competition.

919
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
They say that they're judging you against the best execution of the effort that you are trying.

920
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay.

921
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You know, so they're judging you against your own limits, I guess, which when I read that, I was like, oh, that's basically how I'm a movie critic.

922
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You know, it's how I review a movie is to well, you know, I'm judging Garfield against Garfield and not Garfield against El Topo.

923
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But boy, that would be an article to read.

924
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But also, I don't really believe them because at the end of the day, they are doing the American thing where, like, if you really believe in Danish system of judging, everybody gets a blue ribbon.

925
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If they do a good job.

926
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah.

927
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And here there is a winner and a loser.

928
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Yes.

929
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And there's also best in class.

930
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So in order to talk about this any further, I think we need to change topics a little bit.

931
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Sure.

932
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes.

933
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Talk about.

934
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So two, two or three years ago, the first it was two years ago, first post pandemic fair.

935
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I went I did not ribbon that year.

936
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Well, you did not make it in the cabinet.

937
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It was another bundt cake, which I shouldn't have done.

938
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I knew my limits.

939
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But I do want to say really briefly, they don't tell you how you did.

940
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You have to go to the fair and look for yourself.

941
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And that's when you find out.

942
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, really?

943
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Or somebody else to go and take a picture and send it to you.

944
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah.

945
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They don't contact you.

946
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
No.

947
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And then after the fair is over, you get a check in the mail for around twenty five dollars if you got a little money.

948
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That's nice.

949
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But OK, so I was one year it was a year, Amy, that you left your tickets at home and you had to go back home.

950
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That was such a bad.

951
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And so I was waiting for like a couple hours for you and Adam to show up to be physical tickets.

952
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Well, because I like to go and get my tickets at Superior Grocers because they're cheaper.

953
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And you can get this like ride pass where instead of buying individual tickets, you can just be like, I get 12 rides for 40 bucks flat.

954
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And I prefer thinking that way.

955
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's easier for me than counting out tickets.

956
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And Amy's a rides girl.

957
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
She loves to do all the rides.

958
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
OK.

959
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah.

960
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And I'm sorry to say I have to report that I went on no rides because I have a four year old who's startled by any ride at this point.

961
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Could he go in the haunted house or anything like that?

962
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The little like we didn't try.

963
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
He's in a very not trying phase at the moment.

964
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
OK, so I'm it was like it was like five hours of like solo ride a fair time for me while you had your whole adventure.

965
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Because we basically got to the fair.

966
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
She got all the way to Pomona and then had to go back to Koreatown and then come back to Pomona.

967
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And then she couldn't find parking.

968
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So I was just wandering our areas of the fair.

969
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I had never been before.

970
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And at this point, I've been going for like 10 years on and off.

971
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And I round a corner and I spot a costume character, a walk around character I'd never seen before.

972
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah.

973
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I was like, who is this?

974
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And he's he's just waving.

975
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
He's in a little weird corner, kind of by the animal, the animal competitions.

976
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And he's in a little suit and he's a pig.

977
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And I asked his handler, like, what is who is this?

978
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And he was like, this is Thummer.

979
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Thummer.

980
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And that's how that's how we met.

981
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That's how we met Thummer.

982
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Now, I want to say Thummer, I think, has been looming for a while.

983
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I feel like you may have even pitched some kind of episode that isn't even about the fair that is about Thummer.

984
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah.

985
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So this is, I guess, is also the secret surprise Thummer episode.

986
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And I would encourage the listeners to Google Thummer, L.A. County.

987
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And to be clear, there's no B in there.

988
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It's not Thumber.

989
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
No, it's it's Thummer.

990
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And you will see a very dapper pig who I guess sometimes you'll see him in current mascot mode.

991
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But probably like the the classic version of Thummer seems to be like original kind of 40s era.

992
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Hobo.

993
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Sure.

994
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah.

995
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah.

996
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Which like what else about what's like what are the primary facets of Thummer?

997
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Thummer is yellow, weirdly, not pink.

998
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:22,000
He carries a suitcase which could contain, I don't know, money, bribes, brushes.

999
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Yeah, it's suspicious.

1000
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
What are door to door salesmen?

1001
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh, yeah.

1002
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Combs, harmonicas.

1003
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
What would you sell if you were an industrious guy in 51?

1004
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
He's dressed like Robert Mitcham from Night of the Hunter, basically.

1005
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Like a weird traveling or like.

1006
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah.

1007
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Orange vest.

1008
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah.

1009
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Kind of a case.

1010
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
He's like he's on the go.

1011
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Say, fella, I got a I got a tail for you.

1012
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And so he was originally made as the mascot for the original fair.

1013
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And he was just kind of ripped off of a pig iron mascot because the guy had already drawn this pig for a pig iron company.

1014
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And they're like, here, just take this as the mascot.

1015
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And he was hitchhiking because they didn't want too many people to come and fill up the parking lot.

1016
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So they were encouraging people to hitchhike to the fair.

1017
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This was about this was they wanted hitchhiking to happen.

1018
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Yeah, they were like, yes, share a car.

1019
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Wow.

1020
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And it's also it's hard to convey the hitchhiking when you don't have a thumb, which ironically.

1021
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And maybe we need to get into that, too.

1022
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
What does the name isn't about thumb?

1023
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Or is it?

1024
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It is. It is.

1025
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And is it about hitchhiking?

1026
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Is he thumbing a ride?

1027
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So that's why he's thumber.

1028
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Well, it wasn't what his name was originally, though, guys.

1029
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
As you saw, his original name was Porky.

1030
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
For years, he was Porky Pig.

1031
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And he looks almost like Porky, the hitchhiking pig, a pig that was modeled almost exactly the same as Porky Pig.

1032
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
They do have the same shoes.

1033
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
They both were kind of like cloven hoof slippers.

1034
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Fancy. They're both fancy pigs, professional pigs.

1035
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And they this is in the 40s.

1036
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Right. So he's Porky's around.

1037
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
They can't deny.

1038
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We know Porky.

1039
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
We know Porky more than ever.

1040
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
He was a decade in.

1041
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:26,000
They were like, we're going to call this Porky looking pig Porky Pig, which is sort of like net today.

1042
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What's your snowman, Olaf?

1043
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Like, it's a recent.

1044
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah.

1045
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So Warner Brothers lets him go for a couple of years.

1046
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And then they're just like, no, stop it.

1047
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
You can't just steal Porky Pig.

1048
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But they had made so much merchandise with him on it with the name Porky.

1049
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Oh, I saw that they they were promoting the fair with napkins that were distributed to restaurants and bars across the city.

1050
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And they'd already printed up and sent out a million napkins, even knowing that the copyright was shaky.

1051
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So what are we going to do not to have the napkins?

1052
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The napkins are gone. That ship has sailed.

1053
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But, yeah, they just had like, oh, here, I'm pulling up this article really quick.

1054
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So, yeah, they they were like, real quick, we've got to change this name.

1055
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We're in trouble with the Brothers Warner.

1056
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So they they did a quick like, name the pig contest.

1057
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So people voted and were like, Thummer, Thummer.

1058
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
This is why we live in a democracy.

1059
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You get the best results.

1060
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Has there ever been a name this thing contest where the where the good name was chosen?

1061
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Bode McVogueface.

1062
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That's your idea of the best version?

1063
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah. Bode McVogueface and the I voted sticker are the only two times like the good thing one, I think.

1064
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Oh, the grotesque I voted sticker.

1065
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
What's the story of the I voted sticker?

1066
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Just a kid is just like they were like, make it our local vote stickers for I voted.

1067
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And just one kid just drew like that screaming head that says I voted.

1068
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's like dripping color. Jason's finding it.

1069
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah, it's like a little monster head.

1070
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Okay.

1071
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Okay. So the year though, they were like, we have to change this.

1072
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
But yeah, this is from the quote from this article from the Daily Bulletin.

1073
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Some one hundred thousand decals with the character were distributed.

1074
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And so we're five hundred thousand attractive for color cocktail napkins.

1075
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So that's probably how the napkin ended up like at Warner Brothers.

1076
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
What the hell is this?

1077
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Like that's probably because they were trying to get the word out.

1078
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
They advertise so well.

1079
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
They're at the smokehouse.

1080
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Yeah, they're at the smokehouse.

1081
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So, Scott, here's the I voted.

1082
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, wow.

1083
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
They're calling it a spider crab.

1084
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
A kid drew that.

1085
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I like it.

1086
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Everyone voted on it and then it became the I voted sticker for like this for some city.

1087
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That's great. I love it.

1088
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But some.

1089
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So they changed it really quick to Thummer.

1090
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But still, for the next year, some 90,000 Thummer buttons were distributed to children.

1091
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But like Porky, but still a million napkins with Porky were still in circulation.

1092
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Come see Porky.

1093
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Porky the pig who you can only see by buying tickets to the fair.

1094
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And Jack Warner himself is staring at this.

1095
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I can give you this napkin.

1096
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I need this napkin.

1097
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I need to spill a little booze on it first so it covers up the name.

1098
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So Thummer's around.

1099
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Then in 1981, a young pig was donated to the fair CEO, Ralph Hines, who spontaneously named the pig Thummer.

1100
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He said he represents the spirit of the fair.

1101
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Soon it became clear that the pig was a she, not a he, and was pregnant.

1102
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
In response, the fair's mascot was made a female and named Mrs. Thummer.

1103
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Mrs. Thummer.

1104
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, so they just, they made her a pregnant female pig.

1105
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This is a real problem.

1106
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
This is definitely not an invented problem.

1107
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
The real pig is female.

1108
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
What else, what other choice do we have?

1109
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
We are a livestock fair where everybody coming will learn how to sex a pig pretty quickly.

1110
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We have a huge pig display.

1111
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I'm sure they're paying a lot of attention.

1112
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So then they, three years later, were like, what were we thinking?

1113
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And they just went back to original Thummer.

1114
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But then they were like, we should change, he looks too old-timey.

1115
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So they made him a farmer.

1116
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
They gave him overalls.

1117
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So he looked like Whittles.

1118
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, not very firm.

1119
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And everyone hated that too.

1120
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So they had to turn him back into a weird traveling con man.

1121
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
They did a competition of which did you like better, city Thummer or country Thummer.

1122
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And city won by a lot.

1123
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Which is weird because it's a fair and he's a pig, but vastly people preferred fancy Thummer.

1124
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I guess it makes sense.

1125
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But now he's got this kind of dumb, it's almost like bad latter day vanilla ice look.

1126
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
He's got this bucket hat.

1127
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That's what they're pushing lately.

1128
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
We've gotten away from maybe just no one's paying attention anymore.

1129
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And we're allowing base Thummer to just have this kind of dumb red bucket.

1130
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Who dresses like this?

1131
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Smash Mouth guy?

1132
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Rest in peace, Smash Mouth guy.

1133
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Who's like a current red bucket hat wearer?

1134
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Well, he looks like one of the CG chipmunks.

1135
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
When they're like cool.

1136
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, he has too much detail now.

1137
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
He's got freckles and too much shading.

1138
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I don't know how I feel about this kind of detailed Thummer.

1139
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
He's like a pet boy.

1140
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He's meant to kind of stay 40s forever.

1141
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
But Eva, I feel like when you saw Thummer for the first time that one year at the festival,

1142
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
it was kind of like that moment in Spider-Man where he sees venom.

1143
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And you're just like, that's evil me.

1144
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
This is like the creature that I will hate.

1145
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You just have hated this animal.

1146
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I hate Thummer.

1147
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I wasn't clear on this.

1148
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I didn't know the opinion.

1149
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I find him to be loathsome.

1150
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I mean, the comparison to Night of the Hunter.

1151
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
That's not a guy you want to be.

1152
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah, and the fact that he's just like a series of rip.

1153
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
He's a ripoff was was a ripoff name.

1154
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
He's just like a just a bunch of stolen.

1155
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You know what he reminds me of is like that it's that theme park that was in Shanghai

1156
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
that looked just like Disneyland and they had a Minnie Mouse that was named Girl Cat.

1157
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
That's what that's how I feel about Thummer.

1158
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Thummer is just a like a shitty like brush salesman mascot

1159
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
who was named Porky until someone was like, stop it.

1160
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
He's like, OK, whatever.

1161
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Sorry, I can't I can't even drive myself to this fucking place.

1162
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I got to get a ride.

1163
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Can you guys give me a ride?

1164
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I don't exactly have a car right now.

1165
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Could you?

1166
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I only come out and walk around an hour a day and then I just go back to wherever.

1167
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Well, that's what I didn't see if I were overall.

1168
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Make America great again.

1169
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I need new clothes. My clothes broke.

1170
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
My suit isn't nice anymore.

1171
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It's got holes.

1172
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
All this background on Thummer kind of adds a different level to this post

1173
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
on the L.A. County Instagram a few weeks ago.

1174
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
A single rider looking for a fair buddy.

1175
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
The cardboard sign he's holding.

1176
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But then the caption reads, riding solo slide into the DMs.

1177
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Oh, he's a DM slide.

1178
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
No, no, no.

1179
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The John Cusack pose.

1180
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The most romantic pose there is.

1181
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh, God.

1182
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Oh, yeah.

1183
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
This is I've caught this that on the Instagram presence gets a little bit like

1184
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
they're like someone is looking up the modern phrases and giving them to Thummer

1185
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
because one was like just kind of a basic photo of him.

1186
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And then it says that does that felt cute might delete later.

1187
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
No, that was a few years ago that phrase.

1188
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm impressed they made it that far.

1189
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Honestly, they like county fairs making vaguely modern.

1190
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Another one is similarly holding up a sign and the sign says main character energy.

1191
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Oh, trend chasing.

1192
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And also, once you see Thummer, you can never unsee him.

1193
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
He's everywhere. He's painted on the ground.

1194
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
He's he's on the walls.

1195
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
He you can take pictures with him.

1196
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
He has his own corner now in the barnyard area.

1197
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Yeah, Thummer's house, which I believe you went to.

1198
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah, I went I went to Thummer's.

1199
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
There were areas set up for not just Thummer, but also his his friends.

1200
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Lily, the sheep.

1201
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
And what I now know is Daisy the cow.

1202
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
But I swear I copy and pasted this from another article that maybe multiple times

1203
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
called her daily the cow.

1204
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And I was trying to wrap my head around that.

1205
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I was even glad I figured out it was Daisy when I saw Daisy in person

1206
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
because I was ready to start doing like now I daily the cow.

1207
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Right.

1208
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Is there a walk around Daisy?

1209
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Not a one.

1210
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
There was like kind of a standing plywood one in the area where actual cows are.

1211
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I took a picture with Daisy.

1212
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Daisy is like trying to kind of like look feminine and cool.

1213
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
But then so like using the bell around the neck as jewelry.

1214
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yes, I still wear the I'm a cow.

1215
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I wear the bell.

1216
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But I'm trying to be make it like kind of my thing, make it a little trendy.

1217
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That's nice.

1218
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, there's this kind of up your alley is in the Minnie Mouse woods like a nice set of pearls.

1219
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
They're trying to do a kind of a Mickey's house thing.

1220
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But they just it's like it's just a really shitty sign that says Thummer's house.

1221
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It's just like a porch.

1222
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's really nothing.

1223
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And when I pass by it, literally nothing.

1224
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Now, I don't know.

1225
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I maybe I should have looked up the times that Thummer would be there.

1226
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But I was sure anticipating some kind of specific Thummer interaction.

1227
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And there wasn't even a comeback later for Thummer.

1228
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
There was no Lily.

1229
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
There was no daily the cow.

1230
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
None of them were there.

1231
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So I got nothing out of that and not even a good.

1232
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah.

1233
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah.

1234
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
This photo.

1235
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That's just a that's a bad banner.

1236
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You got nothing.

1237
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And that's how they label the area where Thummer is.

1238
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I've only seen him once in 15 years, I guess.

1239
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So he's not really.

1240
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So there was no way I would show up and all those times.

1241
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You can look for him, but he doesn't.

1242
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
He's not working.

1243
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
He can't get a ride.

1244
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
He's lazy.

1245
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
He's a taker.

1246
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I'm still in Azusa.

1247
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Could somebody grab me?

1248
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I overslept.

1249
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Oh, no.

1250
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I know.

1251
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I keep doing this.

1252
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I swear it is not.

1253
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I've had I've had a lot going on.

1254
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I'm going to have to bring my briefcase to work so I can change.

1255
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I can shave.

1256
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Do we get I'm do we get comped on the food?

1257
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I mean, I work there.

1258
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So, like, could I just grab like what's the surprise?

1259
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
What's the per diem for the fair?

1260
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I here's the thing.

1261
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I was sort of I like, oh, yeah, Thummer.

1262
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I knew you had an opinion about Thummer.

1263
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Everything you've said makes me like Thummer a lot more.

1264
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Oh, really?

1265
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Because I long for the day when a mascot of a place was a big scumbag.

1266
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
We've talked about it a lot of times.

1267
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
The Chuck E.

1268
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Cheese, the original Chuck E.

1269
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Cheese was like, hey, you dimwit.

1270
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Like, he was really like an angsty asshole character who was a scumbag, who was up to no good.

1271
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
He was scamming people.

1272
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And this was a trend, I think, for a long time.

1273
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And then, of course, now corporate America's come in and smoothed all the edges off and maybe Thummer is a throwback to this old type of character I like.

1274
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I think maybe he is.

1275
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I don't think no one's got eyes on Thummer.

1276
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No one has eyes.

1277
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No one cares.

1278
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
They don't even know if it's a man or a woman.

1279
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
People don't care that Thummer might be like making children uncomfortable.

1280
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Yes.

1281
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
With his weird comments or with weird posting where he's trying to.

1282
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Like if Chuck E.

1283
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Cheese was still his old shitty character from the 70s, he would be like, hey, slide into my DMs.

1284
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Come in.

1285
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That would be happening.

1286
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So Thummer is trying to keep this going.

1287
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Keep this going.

1288
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Thummer is weaponizing therapy talk.

1289
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
You're gasolineing me.

1290
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So I should probably say, though, I entered baking for the first time this year.

1291
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yes.

1292
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I have never entered baking.

1293
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I don't know how to bake.

1294
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I've been learning how to bake in the last two years as a project to learn how to measure things.

1295
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Oh.

1296
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yeah, because I like to cook, but I don't like to bake because it involves following somebody else's recipe and believing that what they say is right and that my way isn't necessarily better.

1297
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And that's really hard for me to trust in other people's wisdom.

1298
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And you don't get to bring enough to the table, maybe.

1299
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah.

1300
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I've never been a good baker because I would just like, I'd be like, you don't really need four sticks of butter.

1301
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I would just think that they're wrong.

1302
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I come into things with a level of distrust.

1303
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So to unwire my brain and become a better person, I have to try to learn baking for this reason.

1304
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So I entered cookies for the first time this year.

1305
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I should also say that Amy got me to take a sugar cookie decorating contest.

1306
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I mean, a class like a year and a half ago.

1307
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And it was really complicated and I was like, well, I'll never use this skill.

1308
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And Amy made it just she did it all the time.

1309
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
She's been doing sugar shape decorating really fancy sugar cookies for a year and a half now constantly.

1310
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And she's gotten so good at it that she could like open a shop if she wanted.

1311
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
She was a professional film critic with a lot of other stuff going on.

1312
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
It has become my passion.

1313
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:24,000
But because of that, when I entered the cookie fair for the first time this year, when I entered the county fair with you, I was like, I don't think my ego can take losing.

1314
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, I'm not as resilient as Eva is.

1315
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So I decided I was going to just suck up, do the absolute best I could, work my ass off on these cookies, spend 14 hours on these cookies.

1316
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
She spent 14 hours on them.

1317
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
And I made thumbers because I was like, I know my audience.

1318
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm going to go all in and do thumber cookies.

1319
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm going to do a little briefcase.

1320
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I entered under like the cookie themes are kind of all over the place.

1321
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So I entered under best representation of festival theme, which was a terrible theme this year.

1322
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
But it was strangely specific.

1323
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Stars, stripes and fun.

1324
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Stars, stripes and fun.

1325
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Terrible.

1326
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Fuck off.

1327
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah.

1328
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Fuck off.

1329
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That's not like if you do like red, white and fun and then like the third is that there's no third of stars and stripes.

1330
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Stars, stripes and fun.

1331
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah, it's nothing.

1332
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So I made the most pandering ass cookies I could.

1333
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I was very proud of them.

1334
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
They're thumbers.

1335
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
He's not wearing his little suit, but he's not wearing overalls.

1336
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I put him in a series of different striped and starred mixing kind of like an old time bathing suit.

1337
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Old timey bathing suit.

1338
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It is a bathing suit that Dirtbag would wear in his time.

1339
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So Dirtbag bathing suit.

1340
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And then I made him little suitcases and I made you a special thumber that I didn't submit to the fair that kind of expressed my rage at thumber.

1341
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Where his briefcase says what I think is inside, which is dirty little secrets.

1342
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:54,000
So I made brownies and Amy and I the morning of like you have to drop off your stuff the day before the fair opens or the week before the fair opens in person.

1343
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So you drive to Pomona.

1344
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
There's a window and we did the drive together.

1345
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
You get to go into the empty fairground.

1346
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We happened to walk in and drop the stuff off at the exact time that they did the rope drop for tablescaping.

1347
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Which is intense because they get to pick their own table, which we didn't know.

1348
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Like table placement.

1349
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh, so everybody like runs to where they want it.

1350
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Because they want the corner so you can get like real views of all your table.

1351
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Right.

1352
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
We talked to the lady who got the corner table like, did you get a sign table?

1353
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
She's like, no, I picked this one.

1354
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Are they all the same table?

1355
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yes.

1356
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Okay.

1357
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I think so.

1358
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Unless there's like one wobbly one that everybody's trying to avoid.

1359
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
They're definitely the same door.

1360
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:41,000
But it was so we walked in and I handed over my brownies and the guy was like, oh, there's a lot of brownies this year.

1361
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Good luck.

1362
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like total like you're going to lose all the way there to get brownie attitude.

1363
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And then he took Amy's cookies, opened them up, looked at them.

1364
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It's like face lit up and he's like, always smart to do summer.

1365
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And I was like, God damn it.

1366
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Which is also at the same time a compliment that you don't get, Eva, but then also but still the always is like, well, you're not the first to do them.

1367
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
But he also was like, you could tell like Amy had had brought it brought it home.

1368
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
She had hit a grand slam from the look on the guy's face who was checking in.

1369
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I gave him those pandering ass thumbers.

1370
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Like one briefcase said he had cotton candy.

1371
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Another briefcase said that he had caramel apples.

1372
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
He had a ride ticket.

1373
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
He had pig race prizes.

1374
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Oh, I was like batting my eyes.

1375
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You didn't make one say counterfeit cash.

1376
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
They were so beautiful though.

1377
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
They were the most beautiful cookies she's ever made.

1378
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It was a lot of help because I was having problems with like blush placement and stuff.

1379
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Like how do I do his eyes?

1380
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So Eva served as a thumber expert.

1381
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Yeah, he looks great.

1382
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Yeah, isn't he amazing?

1383
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
To get Thummer on model.

1384
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Well, I guess we could post a picture.

1385
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But like when you're doing the any of these cookies, not just Thummer, are you drawing by hand a little designer?

1386
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Are you sort of doing it like so you just kind of on a piece of paper will draw like what the cookie is going to look like?

1387
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, like I take the cookie cutter and then I trace on a piece of paper a couple of times.

1388
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I sort of work out the proportions of where the eyes should be.

1389
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
The people who are really into the sugar cookie game and like I'm in some Facebook groups and they're just intense.

1390
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Yeah, like they all use projectors.

1391
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
That's kind of like basic cookie one on one, which I'm not ready to go there.

1392
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Trace it with a projector.

1393
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Wow.

1394
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Like if I posted my cookies in the sugar cookie group, they would be like, nice try, sweetheart.

1395
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Keep practicing.

1396
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Like they're really, really.

1397
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Then I'll kill them.

1398
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
But I should say I came in first.

1399
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
She got best of class, which is a level above.

1400
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
She gets a special rosette, which is like very few people in the cabinet.

1401
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
There's like a handful of best of class.

1402
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And it's like one step below, like best of entire baked goods division.

1403
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So Amy, Amy, absolutely.

1404
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You saw these, right?

1405
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Well, I saw them in person.

1406
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I found them.

1407
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And I knew there was something.

1408
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Either you sent a photo or you posted it.

1409
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I knew like once I figure out the cabinet system, like, OK, I think I know.

1410
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
But where are they?

1411
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And then my eyes went straight as soon as I oh, Thummer, got it.

1412
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
OK.

1413
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And then, yeah, they look great.

1414
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And they aren't rotting.

1415
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And the rats haven't gotten to them, at least as of yesterday.

1416
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Listeners, if you go this weekend, I can't, fingers crossed, no rats.

1417
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Although also it might be interesting to see what the rats do to Thummer.

1418
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
It's not what your work deserves, but it's what Thummer deserves.

1419
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Did you see what second place was?

1420
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Some girl just tried to enter some stars.

1421
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's like, good job, girl.

1422
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That's right.

1423
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
You did some stars.

1424
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Really?

1425
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Red, white, and blue.

1426
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
You're just going to enter stars?

1427
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You're not really clock the multiple ribbons first and over that.

1428
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
That's great.

1429
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Wow.

1430
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Congratulations.

1431
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So that's going to get mailed to your house and you have to frame it.

1432
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1433
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And I'm one and done.

1434
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm never entering again.

1435
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Oh, I was going to ask.

1436
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Geez.

1437
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Take it and then go home.

1438
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
She took it.

1439
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Can I suggest an idea that it would be time intensive, but would be funny.

1440
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
You do another series of Thummer cookies, but you put like one of his briefcases has

1441
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,000
loose pills or something, or yeah, like counterfeit money like Scott said.

1442
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
A real F you to the cookie contest now.

1443
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Sort of like you won and now you're asserting dominance in a different way.

1444
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I mean, I do feel like I was planning a future.

1445
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I was going to rest on my laurels of now.

1446
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Every time I go to the county fair, I can just mock all the cookies.

1447
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I can now become the main old lady.

1448
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But the idea of using this cabinet placement as a plant, like we can do it for like an

1449
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
escape room kind of thing, some sort of like living game.

1450
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
If I could put subliminal things in my cookies.

1451
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Right.

1452
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Then they would be here.

1453
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
We could gamify this.

1454
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
If I could do like a QR code.

1455
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
A QR code that takes you to a website about like how Thummer is a.

1456
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
A pedophile.

1457
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Antifa.

1458
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I've seen Thummer on the college campuses.

1459
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
He's playing those ideas.

1460
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Why would Thummer need this length of rubber hose and a syringe if he wasn't a heroin

1461
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
user?

1462
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Like if we find out what the theme is and it seems like something we can do next year

1463
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
to manipulate.

1464
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Yeah.

1465
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Like the year before it was spring into fun, which whatever.

1466
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But I think we could make a jigsaw kind of trap.

1467
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
We could also do a summer door and we could really get weird because I feel like we could

1468
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
have gotten a door very easily.

1469
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
The table scaping like fills up really fast, but we were thinking about doing door scaping

1470
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
right up until we changed our minds.

1471
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And the learning curve on door scaping I think is a lot because like with your mythical menu

1472
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
that you make up, they judge you on, you know, if you say you have a soup, but you don't

1473
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
have a soup spoon, you just absolutely lose.

1474
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Like you're tanked at that point.

1475
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
There's so many ways to lose.

1476
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
There was this fine table that was representing the coronation dinner of Nicholas and Alexandra.

1477
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It was a beautiful one.

1478
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
A feast fit for the last czar.

1479
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And then there's the actual menu.

1480
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It transports you to Russia and like and then it just said like there is extra silverware

1481
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
that is not reflected on the menu.

1482
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Actually, it said of the menu.

1483
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
They didn't even get the grammar right in their snippiness.

1484
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Who are the judges, by the way?

1485
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I don't know.

1486
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I'd love to watch the judges.

1487
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
What about a table theme of Thummer's last meal?

1488
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
He's on death row and you're making the menu for whatever he's having for his last meal.

1489
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Pork and bacon, please.

1490
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I want to eat myself.

1491
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I hate myself because I hate myself.

1492
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Or if it was like a horrifying door where on the other side it is Thummer.

1493
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And like you can see him coming at you or like trying to get a paw.

1494
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
He's got his like little hook coming around the door.

1495
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Or he's at your door trying to sell you garbage.

1496
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Here's Johnny with Thummer.

1497
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
He's like been chopping through the door and he's like.

1498
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Here's Thummer.

1499
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yeah.

1500
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And you could have like the Lily.

1501
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Is she Lily?

1502
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah.

1503
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
The one on the side.

1504
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Yeah.

1505
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Daily.

1506
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Daily.

1507
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Calling her Daily.

1508
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah, I'm going with Daily.

1509
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
She's got the Shelley Duvall like face.

1510
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yeah, that's good.

1511
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yeah.

1512
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But then you'd have to update it.

1513
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So he's not going to say here's Johnny because Johnny Carson's been off the air for so long.

1514
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So he says like here's Jimmy.

1515
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
He means Jimmy Fallon.

1516
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
He says here's Porky.

1517
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And we have to flip because since he's like absolutely.

1518
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
He's re-embracing his real, that's my real name.

1519
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The suits made me change it.

1520
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And since he doesn't work, we have to say I'll play and no work because he's just a lazy

1521
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
bastard.

1522
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah, right, right, right.

1523
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Oh yeah.

1524
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
She has no motivation.

1525
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
We do have to recreate the ballroom photo with him in the middle.

1526
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Yeah, see I'll enter the fair again if I can do it to troll the fair in some way.

1527
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah.

1528
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Do you think there's.

1529
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
There he is at the 1924 fair.

1530
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
He's always been here.

1531
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
What about a Thummer like stealing Porky Pig's clothes or something somehow?

1532
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Can you, can we visualize that?

1533
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Oh yeah, an embarrassed ashamed Porky Pig.

1534
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Like Porky Pig locked in a closet.

1535
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
He went to the YMCA to take a swim and while Thummer waited.

1536
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Hey, I live here.

1537
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I'm kind of between more stable accommodations right now.

1538
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Has anyone been kicked out of the fair permanently?

1539
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Do you think they have that ability?

1540
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Well I think something must have happened because on the on the tablescaping rules they

1541
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
do say fair reserves the right to reject any table sitting that is objectionable or unsuitable

1542
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
which makes me think somebody did try to push it further than everybody.

1543
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I mean this is the question is how are you going to know if you don't try?

1544
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Yeah.

1545
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
We don't try to get permanently ejected from our favorite place.

1546
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Why we've been there enough it's time to get thrown out forever.

1547
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
At this point we've eaten everything.

1548
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Yeah, we've tried everything.

1549
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I got a shrimp bowl that had.

1550
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Fruity Pebbles.

1551
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Fruity Pebbles on it this time.

1552
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Is that in half a pineapple?

1553
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It was in half a pineapple.

1554
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Disgusting.

1555
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Yeah.

1556
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I was going to say.

1557
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It was okay.

1558
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It was gross.

1559
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I was trying to find the grossest thing I could find.

1560
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Yeah.

1561
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
What is like the stunt food?

1562
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That's a big like the deep fried Oreos are kind of par for the course now.

1563
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yeah.

1564
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But now there is like.

1565
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Fried Kool-Aid.

1566
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Fried Kool-Aid.

1567
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah.

1568
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Every year they seem like they're getting into new trends like this year it was very

1569
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
spam heavy like spam fries, spam sliders, spam pot stickers.

1570
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Pickle has been huge for a while.

1571
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Explain the one you heard about.

1572
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Yeah.

1573
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Well a couple years ago there was one that I like had to find it took me all day to find

1574
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
it but it was a it was a giant dill pickle and I've been hollowed out and stuffed with

1575
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
nacho cheese and then also hot Cheetos and inside the nacho cheese.

1576
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So it's like a hot Cheeto pickle nacho burrito and that was not a winner and I think they've

1577
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
been like retooling it since then so now you get it more in the form of pickled nachos

1578
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
because it's hard to eat.

1579
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
You know.

1580
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Yeah.

1581
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Yeah.

1582
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
They've been really pushing hot Cheeto pot stickers which I think is a failure we tried

1583
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
it last year.

1584
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Yeah we had those last year but the pickle split.

1585
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
The pickle split I was looking for and I couldn't find it.

1586
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
They said it had it.

1587
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
But it is what is it a banana split with a pickle basically?

1588
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yeah it's a banana split but there's a giant pickle instead of the banana and they use

1589
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:05,000
pineapple dill whip in between the pickle and then they cover it with like spicy like

1590
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
tahini candy.

1591
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Like tahini.

1592
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Yeah.

1593
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
There's a lot of chamois stuff everywhere there.

1594
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And strings of sour spaghetti candy.

1595
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
The whole.

1596
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
This didn't seem.

1597
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah.

1598
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah.

1599
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I saw this on like the Eater Roundup of food.

1600
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:27,000
This is a slice of pizza but it's pickles and hot Cheetos and I guess ranch.

1601
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That looks good.

1602
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
That does look good.

1603
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Yeah.

1604
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
That looks good.

1605
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I don't think I'm I think the hot Cheeto area doesn't have any appeal to me.

1606
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I don't know.

1607
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Am I missing out?

1608
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Have you guys tried hot Cheeto stuff?

1609
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I think it's tricky because like you know in 2020 when there was a pandemic I tried to

1610
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
make my own county fair just for me and my boyfriend in the backyard because we missed

1611
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
it so much and we had to do the triple cheeseburger Krispy Kreme because that's our favorite.

1612
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
And we also tried to do like elotes covered in hot Cheeto which was really difficult.

1613
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
We couldn't get them to stick and it made me really appreciate whatever science they're

1614
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
doing to get hot Cheetos to stick to things.

1615
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
It's probably science or mayonnaise.

1616
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It's like leeches or mayonnaise.

1617
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And then I showed up.

1618
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
We also made a balloon pop and that was so hard to make your own balloon pop.

1619
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
That takes forever.

1620
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh yeah that seems I don't know where to begin.

1621
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Wait wait what do you mean by balloon pop?

1622
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Like I blew up a bunch of balloons and stapled them to cardboard and it took me like six

1623
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
hours.

1624
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Okay.

1625
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And then you were throwing darts at it?

1626
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yeah I bought a bunch of darts.

1627
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Oh that means carnival game.

1628
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I didn't know this was a snack.

1629
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Okay okay.

1630
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Oh yeah.

1631
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And I'm missing the balloon pop.

1632
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
You play you eat.

1633
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Yeah.

1634
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
The triple cheeseburger, the Krispy Kreme triple cheeseburger is mentioned at the top

1635
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
of the show.

1636
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I had been thinking about it.

1637
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Didn't end up going for it.

1638
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
But like you were describing it a little bit the other night.

1639
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I think my boyfriend and I were both attacking you trying to get you to eat it.

1640
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Yeah I know he did the hard sell and he described it almost as if he had been, that you guys

1641
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
share food typically but it like made him go feral or something.

1642
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Like no not in this case.

1643
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I am hoarding this.

1644
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah like the first year that we tried the triple cheeseburger Krispy Kreme burger.

1645
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Like I thought it sounded gross.

1646
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
He bought it.

1647
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
We usually do trade off bites and when he took his first bite and I said can I have

1648
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
some actually?

1649
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I'm curious.

1650
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
He said no.

1651
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Which has never happened before.

1652
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
But he said no like a raging wolf.

1653
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Like he kind of curled his body around the burger.

1654
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It was like you cannot have any of this burger.

1655
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Caesar's first word in Planet of the Apes.

1656
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It is the most primal bite of food you've ever had in your life.

1657
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Like I cannot explain it.

1658
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Like I've had good things.

1659
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I've eaten good food before.

1660
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm a human.

1661
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
But this it hits something in your brain stem where you're like I'm a caveman.

1662
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm supposed to eat charred meat.

1663
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I want sugar too.

1664
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And you're just boom straight there and it's all you can think about is eating this burger

1665
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
as soon as you have your first bite.

1666
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It kind of scared me.

1667
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I didn't know that you had that reaction.

1668
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
We had that giant pretzel this time that was actually the best pretzel I've ever had in

1669
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
my life.

1670
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
That was really good.

1671
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
It was really good.

1672
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It was like this big.

1673
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So we all three of us shared it.

1674
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I've learned that I can't eat gluten but I ate a bunch of that pretzel and I was sick

1675
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
all week but it was great.

1676
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
It was gorgeous.

1677
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That description kind of scared me and the one that you just did too.

1678
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
We're like what is this going to unlock?

1679
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
What if I don't come back?

1680
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Does this have like a werewolf effect?

1681
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I want it to scare you.

1682
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Like my life has been divided into before and after.

1683
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Oh god.

1684
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Well it had kind of a hold on me through the day and eventually my son too because I was

1685
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,000
thinking about it and I was doing the parent math the whole time of like when are we going

1686
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
to do dinner?

1687
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Are we going to keep him on schedule for dinner and do we do it here?

1688
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is this plenty he'll eat here because he only eats chicken fingers and burgers and stuff

1689
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
but he was kind of getting a little tired and wanted to get out of there and I was proposing

1690
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:01,000
options to him and I said like oh you know what they have is like a donut burger.

1691
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Like the bun is a donut and again I was saying he's not really trying a lot right now so

1692
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
his initial reaction like no thanks is very polite at this stage and I was like you know

1693
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I'm going to back off that too because he doesn't eat cheese on burgers and he might

1694
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
think it's weird and gross when it comes out so I kind of backed off it and then we do

1695
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
a long walk from where we're kind of close to the cheeseburgers all the way to the entrance

1696
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:37,000
of the fair and at the end of it he does the saddest um dad I do want the donut burger

1697
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and he clearly had just been like going over and over it in his head for 15 minutes and

1698
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
like I just lost my opportunity I made the wrong choice and he doesn't go back on stuff

1699
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
like that he usually decides and that is it but he clearly he just like wrestled with

1700
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
it so again something primal about this and then I thought do I go back but it was so

1701
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
far back and I didn't know if he would actually like what if he doesn't like it and then we

1702
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
do all this effort for he probably will so what if he likes it too much what if like

1703
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
what if it breaks him the way it broke me and there will never be anything as good as that

1704
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
triple cheeseburg with the two donuts and then he's going to be in his imagination of

1705
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
it is maybe better than it could ever be what would it do to a child you were at least

1706
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,000
an adult imagine if yes he's still forming where's nobody more raw than a four-year-old

1707
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:32,000
boy resets the floor he's drinking the dune water of life as a little boy he becomes the

1708
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:40,000
twilight zone kid who can control stuff with his mind sends you to the cornfield that was

1709
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,000
the true juncture point of am I a good dad or not and I made the wrong choice I know

1710
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
then I was like well I got to do something we got to do something fair and I can just

1711
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
a little exhausted not want to go all the way back I didn't like reinvent the wheel

1712
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
but I have not had fried Oreos before certainly he is not before so I did that

1713
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You had fried Oreos for dinner?

1714
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
No it ends up no no no

1715
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
You're a good dad that's a good dad thing

1716
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Okay

1717
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Fully as the dinner I don't know if I'm good dad but going for it at all but yeah we did

1718
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
we did give him a taste and like yeah this is not like as Jason was saying these have

1719
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
been around a while now this is almost like the standard of the crazy fair combo and I'm

1720
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
having it like and you guys know I'm far from the treat boy of the podcast this was just

1721
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
like there's nothing weird about it at all this is just like good primary there is no

1722
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
like bizarre or bizarre but it works it just works

1723
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Those are great

1724
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
They're just so so good they make all the sense in the world so just fully satisfying

1725
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
experience there side track then the rest of it is like I got to get out of here and

1726
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:55,000
get dinner on time and he wants burgers so what do we do and I end up like I'm then feverishly

1727
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:02,000
looking for burgers in San Dimas like not far from there and I find oh wait this is

1728
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:09,000
interesting NASCAR refuel tenders and burgers and there's three locations in San Dimas

1729
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
is this like a thing in the Inland Empire I got to figure and this is something for

1730
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
the show too a NASCAR chain and then I start my gears start turning like almost like 30

1731
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
seconds before I get into the parking lot and I was just ahead of it because I pull

1732
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
up and I go to the address and I find an IHOP this is a ghost kitchen folks there are no

1733
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
physical what a fool am I I should I would know if there were lots of NASCAR refuel

1734
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
stands everywhere this is a sub brand of but anyway now I have that to bring to the table

1735
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:49,000
that if you do want to ghost kitchen order NASCAR themed food you can get talladega

1736
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
tenders

1737
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Wow

1738
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Are they at least in a fun NASCAR box or anything

1739
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It's like checker pattern but yeah that's kind of all you get and the theming is not

1740
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
much more from there and then I start looking it up and like where are the other ones and

1741
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I find wait there's one at CityWalk no that's different that's NASCAR refuel wings so we

1742
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
got two different

1743
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Is that at Buca de Pepo

1744
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It is in fact at Buca de Pepo

1745
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Yes

1746
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah yeah

1747
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Jason how do you feel yeah and I'll let you put it in your words but how do you feel that

1748
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
there's another ghost kitchen at Buca de

1749
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
De Pepo

1750
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah got it nailed it

1751
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Fine

1752
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Yes as always you nailed it I don't know why we even made that a thing

1753
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I guess I'm just flummox like how many more ghost kitchens can they run at once

1754
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
In that one location you know because I also I'm looking at burgers in that area and I'm

1755
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
like tons of Mr. Beast burgers too

1756
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Oh yeah

1757
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I think San Dimas is ghost kitchen city

1758
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
There's this old timey I think I've talked to you guys about Billingsley's which is by

1759
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
my house which was Barbara Billingsley's primary restaurant which is where I was at

1760
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
the bar when I saw Tim Kaine had been announced as the vice president for Hillary Clinton

1761
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Does Barbara Billingsley leave it to Beaver

1762
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yes

1763
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Anyway it closed during pandemic it turned into a ghost kitchen for a thing called burger

1764
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
bitch so it's this beautiful old restaurant that then had a sign up front that just said

1765
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
burger bitch

1766
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
It feels so insulting that they kept her initials

1767
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I know

1768
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And then burger bitch collapsed and now there's just a rotting burger bitch sign on top of

1769
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
the Billingsley sign and it's falling apart too and the whole thing is like boarded over

1770
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,000
That reminds me of the chain that was a scam burger rim

1771
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Oh yes burger rim yeah

1772
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:45,000
It was everywhere for like a really short time not well reviewed and someone found out

1773
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Like they all quickly closed I think because they got sued or it turned out to be a big

1774
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Ponzi scheme

1775
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It was like an Israeli Ponzi scheme or something crazy like that yeah burger rim

1776
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
There was one by UCB I feel like

1777
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I think so

1778
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Yeah I never ate there

1779
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Did you somebody send this to me I don't know if it was from our Facebook group or some

1780
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
other Facebook group that the Ford Motor Company has a series of restaurants

1781
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I've learned about the Ford restaurant

1782
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Ford we put it in the this was in the club three whole once it was one of the worst

1783
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It was one of the worst performers worse than yours Mike

1784
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
A Ford restaurant where are they?

1785
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Is this like the Ford filling station that used to be by the Staples Center?

1786
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
No that's Harrison Ford Sons restaurant

1787
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Wait oh really?

1788
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah Benjamin Ford

1789
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
We gotta start talking celebrity too Eva

1790
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
He was on Hell's Kitchen when the season I worked on

1791
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
That had a really good marshmallow ice cream

1792
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Really yeah

1793
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
He's a good chef

1794
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I totally forgot it was even in that poll but it's a lot of Florida but it's just like

1795
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
a chain restaurant that's owned by Ford

1796
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
That's Ford where you learn about Henry

1797
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I guess

1798
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I mean that's fun

1799
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Yeah I'm not mad at it

1800
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Yeah

1801
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Ford's Garage

1802
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I feel like I would trust a chain restaurant about Levi's I wear a lot of Levi's I like

1803
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Levi's I feel like a Levi's restaurant would probably serve pretty decent food

1804
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah

1805
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Sure

1806
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
So like probably the containers and boxes and silverware are all denim

1807
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Yeah

1808
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Maybe not literally denim although I mean sure

1809
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
You could yeah

1810
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,000
During pandemic I took my stepdaughter to The Grove because they had opened a restaurant

1811
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,000
inside Brandy Melville at The Grove that just sold folded over pizza sandwiches and iced

1812
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
coffee and she just really wanted to go and I was like I can make this happen for you

1813
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So we drove to The Grove she got a little Brandy Melville food

1814
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Brandy Melville is a sexy teen girl clothing

1815
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Right

1816
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's like the gap for teenage girls

1817
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Oh I always thought Brandy Melville was like a real housewife I didn't know that

1818
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:48,000
No it's a it's like it's like cheap really cheap clothes for teenage girls and I think

1819
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
it's kind of like minimal sizing where you're supposed to just sort of only wear one

1820
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I think I might be one of those

1821
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
There's only one size

1822
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
There's only one size yeah

1823
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Isn't it that name is close to a real housewife though

1824
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I'm looking at Brandy Glanville

1825
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
There you go

1826
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Yeah you're really close

1827
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Oh that's why I've been getting confused

1828
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
For some reason they had opened a restaurant in the peak like I think it was Christmas

1829
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
2020 they had opened a restaurant inside the store

1830
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Wow

1831
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
And we went and got our little sandwiches and then ate them outside and she's like okay

1832
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
thanks

1833
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Is it kind of neither good nor bad

1834
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Is it like the clothes are stretchy or you just can only be a size

1835
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
It's the second thing

1836
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
They're encouraging a specific type shape of girl

1837
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
So it's like when they used to be five seven nine when we were kids and you could only

1838
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
be five seven or nine

1839
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Or else you don't get clothes

1840
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Or else you don't get clothes or else you go naked

1841
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yeah or else you have to go to Torrid

1842
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
At least they tried to jazz it up with a cool word

1843
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
See it's not so bad you get a cool word with it

1844
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Torrid

1845
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Yeah it's crazy

1846
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Wait what's your ranking of the how do you rate the Brandy Melville restaurant

1847
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It was better than it should have been

1848
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Oh okay

1849
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
But it shouldn't have existed at all

1850
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So it's in like existing not totally offensive

1851
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
More clothing companies should take a stab at restaurants

1852
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah

1853
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Well I'm a fan of Nordstrom's Bar Verde

1854
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Oh I know

1855
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Oh Bar Verde get out it's of course it's great

1856
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah yeah

1857
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Isn't Bar Verde like for angry like traditional husbands to drink at while their wives

1858
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Bar Verde

1859
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Buy fancy hats

1860
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Bar Verde is for everyone

1861
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Spending my paycheck on who knows what

1862
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
She'll get some disgruntled people

1863
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Brasiers and jumpsuits

1864
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
One more pour please

1865
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Three fingers of Jack Daniels

1866
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Leave the bottle

1867
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
My heart earned money

1868
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That's that's that's Thummer

1869
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I thought we were going to Ford's garage for lunch

1870
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I'm stuck on the top floor of goddamn Nordstrom's for the third Saturday in a row

1871
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Mrs. Thummer gets pregnant immediately upon her existence

1872
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I'm going to tell the fair they should discontinue her

1873
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I was flying solo everything was going great

1874
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Then they made me be here for two three years like Robert Durst

1875
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Hiding out in Louisiana

1876
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Wearing a dress so nobody notices my crimes

1877
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Is that what Robert Durst did really?

1878
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Yeah he hid out

1879
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
As a lady

1880
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And then he killed another person as the lady and got in trouble for that

1881
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
That's the guy he chopped off

1882
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I didn't watch Jinx 2 is this the this is what you learned?

1883
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That's not even what that's about

1884
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
He went on trial for that one and he got off because he was like I didn't kill him

1885
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
But I did chop him up because I got scared when he died accidentally

1886
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And they're like checks out

1887
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
A lot of people would do that

1888
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
The other day when you reminded me of the guy from Dogpatch USA

1889
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And I thought about him in a while

1890
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I looked it up there's no footprints of the guy

1891
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Was this really like backwoods theme park in Arkansas and the guy was a scam artist

1892
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Little Abner

1893
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Seemingly just fully disappeared

1894
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
He like stole all the town's money and left

1895
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And I was now I'm like I think that I think that's I think he did all this Durst stuff

1896
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Oh yeah

1897
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
He was like in disguise somewhere

1898
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And got into his next scam

1899
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
It's like end of Dark Knight Rises

1900
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Where you'll be at like a cafe

1901
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
He gives you a nod

1902
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
You'll see what's his name hair or something hair

1903
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Michael Hair maybe

1904
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
David

1905
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
David Hair thank you

1906
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Yeah there's no there isn't there are no Google results since the episode that we did

1907
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:29,000
He convinced the landowner that he was going to redo the Little Abner park as like an American American dream park

1908
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And then he just didn't do anything and he ran the place to the ground

1909
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:39,000
He just did a YouTube channel that was half songs and half apologies and explanations of why none of the stuff was happening

1910
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And all of a sudden he was chased out of town by the cops

1911
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
See I think this was Thummer's original plan

1912
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I think that Thummer wanted to start the fair and then take all the money and run away

1913
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And then Mr. Thummer got pregnant he got stuck

1914
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh yeah

1915
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Yeah

1916
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
No one's got eyes on this place

1917
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Pomona who gives a shit

1918
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I can't believe they're still doing this crap

1919
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I was going to burn this fairground to the ground

1920
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And be done with it forever

1921
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I well look you know it was it was a very good time

1922
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:18,000
You know it ended up resulting in a very fine half habit half Jersey Mike's meal for the two of us out in

1923
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Out in San Dimas that was nice

1924
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And then before that at the fair proper here's what I have to thank you two for

1925
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Is that I hatched the plan to go let's go and then realized oh my god two big train things

1926
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Which are year-round apparently and always there and maybe accessible even when the fair is not going on

1927
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
There's a train museum where you can climb up onto big giant working trains

1928
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Which they turn on turn on the motors kids can you know pull the whistle

1929
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,000
These are the most poorly guarded like there's climbing up onto real trains

1930
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Under like very steep ladders with railings that don't block little children from falling off the side

1931
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
25 feet so I'm really watching him there

1932
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
But he had the time of his life getting to go onto some real trains

1933
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And then also a model train that's been there for a hundred years

1934
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That is the side that is half a football field

1935
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I love model trains so much

1936
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I don't know why I have this like very intense reaction to them

1937
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It's just when they we create things like little drive-in movie theaters and stuff

1938
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
That's all the little dioramas

1939
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Like making the little city stuff

1940
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I like dioramas

1941
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Playmobil

1942
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Have you been in any of these stores in Burbank, the model train stores?

1943
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Yes

1944
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I've beaten, I could never do it

1945
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Can't have another thing

1946
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Guys I don't know if I've ever told this story on the podcast

1947
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
But when I was in college I met Gary Coleman and I was wearing a train conductor hat

1948
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Because I was being random like Amy was random in college

1949
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I remember you had that hat, I used to have a hat like that too

1950
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And Gary Coleman said your hat's the universal sign for I like trains

1951
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And I was like yeah and he's like do you want to come check out my model train set?

1952
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And he like gave me his phone number and he wrote on the note HO scale American trains

1953
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And so I like got back to my dorm and I like called and left a message for Gary Coleman

1954
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And then

1955
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You called? You did it? Oh my god

1956
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yeah I called him

1957
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I left a message saying yeah I'll come check out your train set

1958
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
And then I talked to someone else but they're like what are you doing don't do that

1959
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
You can't, don't do that

1960
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
He's like he beats people up and stuff he's gotten in trouble and I was like oh right

1961
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:34,000
So then but I got back home and there was like a bunch of messages in a row from Gary Coleman on my machine

1962
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Like escalating rapidly even in the messages

1963
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And then I stopped whatever dumb game I was playing and I just ended it there

1964
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Eva did you learn anything from this experience?

1965
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Obviously not

1966
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Because I'm the person I am

1967
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
You've got to have a stronger creep meter at this point

1968
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
This creeps around every bend of all the stuff that you're into

1969
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
But sometimes I look at you and I'm just so relieved you're alive

1970
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Oh you too babe

1971
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,000
You only dated Gary for like a year and a half it wasn't a big thing

1972
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
You're always in control you always had your eyes on the door

1973
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I kept the note though in my like cabinet of cursor items

1974
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Cabinet of curiosity

1975
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Your museum of the weird

1976
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
He did have a model train set though

1977
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
He was an enthusiast

1978
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Wasn't he wearing like when he was on the Simpsons didn't he have like a train conductor hat?

1979
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
There's some appearance he had like where he cameo'd somewhere where he had like a train conductor

1980
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Like him in trains was like a thing post his TV show

1981
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It's possible I could have just seen the train set and left but that's like one

1982
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It's a multiverse of possibilities

1983
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
One of the great mysteries of my relationship is my boyfriend hated my train conductor hat

1984
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Like really actively hated it in a way that he doesn't hate almost anything I own but he hated my train conductor hat

1985
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And I went missing and three years later I found it in the neighbor's yard buried under a bush

1986
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Just incidentally looking for his hat

1987
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
In the middle of the night he buried your hat

1988
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
He denied it but like I was I don't know his cat went missing I was hunting around for the cat

1989
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I was behind the neighbor's gigantic bush and my hat was there

1990
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
And I took it back and I was like can you explain this and I said no

1991
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
No and I choose not to and you have no proof

1992
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Why would he do it so close to home though that's such a mistake

1993
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
He should take that into the national forest

1994
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah

1995
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Yeah like a shallow grave for it

1996
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
He tried to convince me the cat took it back there

1997
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
If I was looking for his cat there maybe it was his cat's hiding place

1998
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So we both had a train conductor hat?

1999
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Yeah of course

2000
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
These stories are really taking a turn for the Hummer dark side

2001
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Thummer?

2002
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Thummer

2003
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Oh I was going to say is that a phrase Hummer dark side?

2004
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
No

2005
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Did you have a train conductor's hat?

2006
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah I think so

2007
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Of course you did

2008
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
But I also

2009
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I didn't have a train conductor's hat

2010
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Maybe when I was five I did

2011
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I was thinking of the name because this place closed a couple years ago called Roadside America

2012
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Oh yeah

2013
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:01,000
In Pennsylvania and it was just a giant miniature train

2014
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Like trains going every which way towns mountains like

2015
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It was a big roadside tourist attraction but yeah the pandemic kind of did the man

2016
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
San Diego in their Balboa Park has a model train museum

2017
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
We went to that

2018
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
All of our travels are train motivated

2019
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Which is why I have to thank you for that

2020
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Because like you can climb on trains and look at model trains

2021
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
He lost his shit he was so excited

2022
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And all of my dad calculations at this point are like

2023
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
How much time does it kill?

2024
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
How much does it cost?

2025
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And how much is it trains?

2026
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
So this satisfied all of that very nicely

2027
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Like probably the biggest one he's ever seen

2028
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Probably the biggest one I've ever seen

2029
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I mean I also like I'm unemployed right now and I saw the thing

2030
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I was telling you Scott that said be a volunteer at the model train

2031
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And I was like am I gonna do this?

2032
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Even if you did it this could be our way to troll the fair next year

2033
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
If I'm there every weekend just like painting and dusting little guys

2034
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
If you made miniatures of us and you put them in tiny cars

2035
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And we're flipping off Thummer?

2036
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Yes

2037
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
If we put like a tiny Thummer on the side of the road trying to hitchhike

2038
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
We murdered him and he's in the trunk

2039
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Or Thummer tied to the tracks like Dudley Doode right?

2040
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Smiley whiplash

2041
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I was gonna say like a double indemnity sort of thing

2042
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Or if you were a cultured person a double indemnity

2043
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We're in fake crutches and we're on the back of the train

2044
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
We're gonna throw Thummer off

2045
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Fucking Mrs. Thummer

2046
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Yeah

2047
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:40,000
If you're flipping him off in the process and they call you out on it

2048
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
You could always just say no we're giving thumbs

2049
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Yeah we're hitching a ride

2050
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
That's on theme and Amy's a prize winner for being on theme

2051
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Oh my god his thumbs are flipping us off

2052
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
He's not thumbing a ride

2053
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Wait you're right

2054
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
He's been thumbing all the time

2055
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
And thumb being in the name is a way to throw you off the trail

2056
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
He's either like flipping you off or he's gonna drag that hoof across his throat

2057
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
That thing's razor sharp if you get close to it

2058
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
One false move and you're gone

2059
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
The loathsome Thummer

2060
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Just have a little some characters and someone's having an affair with Thummer's wife and he doesn't know

2061
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Yeah we do like shadows like in the window of a motel and Thummer's outside with a gun in his mouth

2062
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Or Mrs. Thummer's pushing a stroller but it's like two pigs and a cow

2063
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Oh yeah that's good too

2064
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
She says it's recessed DNA

2065
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I still have to pay for it it doesn't make sense

2066
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Once in every sixth generation you end up with a cow

2067
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
She says

2068
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Thummer also has a pile of lamb chops

2069
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Back in the recesses of his neighborhood

2070
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
One of the rooms in my house has a bunch of lamb chops

2071
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
One of them's really big

2072
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Shut up I'll make the fucking moon disappear

2073
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
All these cows and sheep coming after me

2074
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
They'll never take down Thummer

2075
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Until his SWAT team's at the door of my neighborhood

2076
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Top of the world

2077
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,000
They don't know it's just a plywood flat with nothing behind it

2078
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
I got nothing

2079
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I've been alive

2080
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
For 65 years and I got nothing

2081
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I found an interview with Thummer

2082
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
In which they ask

2083
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Last question how did you get your name

2084
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
A long time ago a local TV station put on a name the pig contest

2085
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Thummer was the entry I liked the most so that's where it came from

2086
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So he got to pick

2087
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
He existed before the name

2088
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I mean we know he was porky but that's a weird way to answer it

2089
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I watch television

2090
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
He probably stole it from another contest

2091
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Thummer won a different name the pig contest and he took it

2092
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I like Jim and Pam

2093
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So many great characters and you know what it has heart

2094
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And that's why the office still works to this day

2095
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Lecturing you about the American office

2096
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I like TV

2097
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I need to tell you something

2098
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
The real Thummer died in Korea and I took his dog tag

2099
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Living his life but I don't feel much

2100
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
That's why I drink don't you see

2101
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I do have to volunteer to go to Pomona and work at the Tremies

2102
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I think so

2103
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
What else am I worth

2104
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Isn't it disheartening to find out that train work is volunteer based seemingly

2105
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Because you're probably thinking maybe I can make a little scratch becoming a train person

2106
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's probably competitive and there's clicky like everything else at the fair

2107
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Everyone you're against has been doing it for 70 years

2108
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
You will never get seniority

2109
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
No I won't

2110
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I'll die I'll be dead first

2111
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Leave anything you'd like to plug

2112
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Upcoming very sad train volunteering career

2113
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
A freshly dusted train set that I want you to all come and see

2114
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I've only had time to dust one they take forever

2115
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
We've got a new tunnel you can take a look at

2116
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
It's bigger than the other tunnels

2117
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
The lights work again

2118
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Ronald is angry with me again

2119
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I don't know what I did but I think I remind him of his niece or something

2120
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I guess let's make our way to the door

2121
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Any closing I mean there's boy like you know tales of horror with Thummer

2122
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Tales of victory with Amy

2123
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Going all the way from not baking in two years to winning two ribbons at once

2124
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Incredible

2125
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Clearly yes

2126
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
And inspiration from me

2127
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:20,000
This seems like a microcosm of the friendship and of the support and the inspiration that's there

2128
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And that you both are glad the other isn't dead

2129
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So it's really nice to see

2130
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Despite taking the other person to places where they'll probably die and then we both end up surviving

2131
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Yeah

2132
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Cuba

2133
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Chernobyl

2134
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Parting thoughts on the fair though

2135
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Anything you're looking forward to next year or something that you haven't done fair wise that's on the list

2136
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I mean if you're just not at the fair what are you doing?

2137
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It's mostly just the threat to all the people listening go to the fair

2138
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
If there's a fair in your county go to that fair

2139
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I was going to say any thoughts on the Orange County Fair

2140
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I love the Orange County Fair

2141
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
The Orange County Fair has the most tribute bands

2142
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Like every weekend they have a different tribute band

2143
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,000
So if you look even on their website it's like fake Abba, fake Pink Floyd, fake Fleetwood Mac

2144
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Like you could just really live a whole fake dream

2145
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
They had fake Alice Cooper but then he disappeared

2146
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Like he was on this calendar and then they took him off

2147
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
So I don't know what happened with fake Alice Cooper

2148
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I recently stayed at the Lawrence Welk Resort in Escondido, California

2149
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Where I was delighted to find

2150
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
They have a little, it's like a little shopping center and a little theater

2151
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Where they have entirely tributes also

2152
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
We got a fake Huey Lewis on our hand

2153
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I'm kind of amazed that there's enough tributes out there that you can be a full time Huey Lewis

2154
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Oh yeah there's like a fake no doubt

2155
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
They're really serious about it

2156
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
You would think in Orange County like a fake no doubt

2157
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
They're chased out of town like they're not being authentic

2158
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
But I don't know maybe they want it because no doubt it's not gone besides your schedule

2159
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I will say that the competition in sugar cookies in Orange County is a lot more intense

2160
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Like when I looked at their cabinet last year I'm not up to snuff there

2161
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Oh really?

2162
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
You are, stop comparing yourself to other sugar cookies

2163
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Their floral work is like intense

2164
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
But that said, I made a new batch of cookies this weekend

2165
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
And I only had two left, I know there's three of you guys here being the burger guys

2166
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
But you can like break them in half if you want

2167
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
As much as I want

2168
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
They're very small

2169
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
We made Hoda Rao's cookies because we went to go see El Topo

2170
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
El Topo cookies

2171
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
But they're the same recipe of the Thumbra Cookies

2172
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
They're chocolate

2173
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Yeah the chocolate cookies are bangers

2174
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
The vanilla is very good too

2175
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
She makes them for this book club, the smut book club we're in

2176
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
She makes themed cookies to the book every month

2177
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I bought like a six inch dick shaped cooker cookie that I haven't had a chance to make yet for any smut club ones

2178
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Because we've had different themes

2179
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Jason shoved the cookie in his mouth already

2180
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
They're delicious

2181
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
They're genuinely good cookies on top of being beautiful

2182
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Wow, wow, geez wonderful

2183
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Amy, you can keep adding things, I don't know how you keep adding things

2184
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I'm done, I'm quitting

2185
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I'm a retired baker now

2186
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
You just bought a dehydrator though so you could make the frosting

2187
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
That is true, I bought a dehydrator to keep my icing puffy

2188
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Like a month ago

2189
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,000
The icing is very aesthetically pleasing on this

2190
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
It's got a nice poof

2191
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Take a bylar before he grabs yours

2192
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And I saved my Thumbra, I didn't eat it

2193
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I'm keeping it forever

2194
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I will say for people going the ride to ride, there's two rides that are just the best

2195
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Alien Abduction is one of the ones where you're just in the dark and spiraling around really fast

2196
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And it's like crazy and your feet lift off the ground

2197
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:55,000
But the other one, Joker, is at the county fair and that one's amazing

2198
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It's like there's 12 people on kind of a long tall spoke

2199
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And you swing back and forth and then finally just start swinging all the way upside down and around and around and around

2200
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And you get completely head scrambled

2201
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Like you're taller than palm trees and upside down and it is probably the best ride there

2202
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Also beer and wine pavilion where you can taste the award winning beers and wines

2203
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And behind it is a nature walk where we learned about bees and they had a lot of other original characters teaching you about camping

2204
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And you could take home a tiny palm tree if you wanted

2205
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
No, a tiny pine tree

2206
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
They had little trees that you could take home and plant

2207
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Yeah, the nature walk area is really underrated, I just got into that in the last year

2208
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Oh jeez, wow, wow

2209
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
You missed it, you haven't even seen the train area that's there

2210
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Oh, I don't know, the train museum

2211
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
There's full corners of it

2212
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
It's so cool

2213
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Do they still have kind of a weird dinosaur zone called Jurassic Planet?

2214
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I didn't see that

2215
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I remember that though

2216
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Because every year they kind of do a different theme sometimes at the back

2217
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Like one year is all light up paper insects

2218
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
They have some year round Halloween stuff

2219
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Like a Halloween maze area

2220
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Which is fun

2221
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
This year they added a roller rink

2222
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Oh yeah, which I saw

2223
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Which is included with admission

2224
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And skates, you don't have to rent skates separately

2225
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Yeah, my boyfriend did it

2226
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Because he loves to roller skate

2227
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
We watched him skate around

2228
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Amy ate a four foot long stick of pork

2229
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Two foot long

2230
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Half is like, yeah

2231
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I've really mainlined that thing

2232
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
More than half your height

2233
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I usually get the two pound pork chop

2234
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
But I thought it would go a little different this year

2235
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Yeah, it was

2236
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Two pounds of a different meat

2237
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Same meat, but different formation

2238
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Fair enough, excuse me

2239
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Does eating a ton of pork get out some aggression against Thummer?

2240
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I think it is why I do it

2241
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I want him to know that he's not the boss of me

2242
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
But Thummer gave you the gold this year

2243
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
We can give Thummer a year

2244
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
I feel dirty

2245
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
To pander to that level and have it win

2246
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Makes me a little disgusted with myself

2247
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I'm not disgusted

2248
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Oh, it's me

2249
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
You're kidding, you did me

2250
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
That's so sweet

2251
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Here's the prize

2252
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
No, I think

2253
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Accept your full congratulations

2254
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And

2255
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Not just for your victory

2256
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
But for a great episode of the show

2257
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Thank you, Eva and Amy, you survived Podcast The Ride

2258
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Wow, wow

2259
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
What a fun time

2260
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So happy to have you both

2261
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Let's exit through the gift shop

2262
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Amy?

2263
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Not much, I'm still doing Unspooled with Paul Scheer

2264
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
We just are Mad Max

2265
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
The original

2266
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
1979 one, we just did that one this week

2267
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Which was honestly when I went back and watched it

2268
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And you see just the through line

2269
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Of all of the little visual pole vaulting

2270
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
And tough old women

2271
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
How he just has been building on that

2272
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I remembered Mad Max

2273
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
People being like, the original one's boring

2274
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And it doesn't get cool till two, but they are actually completely wrong

2275
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I've like now turned around

2276
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I very much love Mad Max one, I think it's scarier

2277
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
To watch the civilization

2278
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Slide into disrepair

2279
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
That's cool

2280
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I don't have anything to plug, but I did discover this website

2281
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Yesterday morning

2282
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
For this company called

2283
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Brave Books

2284
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Which is owned by Kirk Cameron

2285
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And it's children's books

2286
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Written by like

2287
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Important cultural figures

2288
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Like Kirk Cameron?

2289
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Well, this one I'm just plugging is called The Night The Snow Monster Attacks

2290
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Written by General Michael Flynn

2291
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
What?

2292
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Oh man

2293
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Michael Flynn

2294
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
You can get a signed copy of it for $50

2295
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
$49.99

2296
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Michael Flynn, is he the most famous author they have?

2297
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
No, I mean it's a lot

2298
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Kimberly

2299
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Guilfoyle posted a picture of herself holding

2300
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
A children's book called The Princess and Her Pup

2301
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And I was like, this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen

2302
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And I looked into it

2303
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
They're all written by like

2304
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Your morning check in with

2305
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Guilfoyle accounts

2306
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Dinesh D'Souza has one

2307
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Of course

2308
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Wow, the cookie's very good, I'm eating it

2309
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Oh, I'm so glad

2310
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
It's marshmallow flavored icing

2311
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Oh, okay, I actually didn't even identify it

2312
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
You might also

2313
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Once I learned a recipe I tripled the salt, that's my own little flavor

2314
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Oh, nice

2315
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Is another potential plug

2316
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Like, you know, if we're kind of

2317
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You know, if we're given the finger

2318
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
To thummer a little bit

2319
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Would you be mad if people

2320
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Went to the fair this weekend

2321
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Punched through the cabinet and took your cookies

2322
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And ate them

2323
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
No, in fact I hope they send me pictures of them flipping off my thummer

2324
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Do you want to eat a six week old cookie?

2325
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000

You will find all of that at Patreon.com slash Podcast The Ride

2330
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I think now we're going to do a Memorial Day break

2331
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I said we're going to do one

2332
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
We did this instead so people could

2333
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
We could tell people to go find

2334
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Thummer and give the finger

2335
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
To your thummers

2336
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So now we'll take a break, but I hope this gives everyone

2337
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
The lead time to

2338
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Flip off thummers

2339
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Yeah, you're flipping off the character of thummer, not Amy's cookies

2340
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Not Amy's, it's what Amy wants us to do

2341
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Well, you can also go and take a detour

2342
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And just flip off the brownie winners

2343
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Because I had Eva's brownies on the way up and they should have placed

2344
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I was pretty mad, they didn't

2345
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
They were malted milk flavor, they're incredible

2346
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
They're very kind of you, but like I said

2347
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
A lot of brownies this year

2348
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Shouldn't have done it

2349
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
It's political, I'm sure

2350
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Someday I'll be the mean old lady

2351
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
We should figure out how to be judges

2352
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Yeah, we will have to probably kill someone

2353
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
That's the only way, yeah

2354
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
It's a supreme court appointment basically

2355
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I need a lot of enemies

2356
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I need you to parry down

2357
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
The list

2358
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I mean an easy way potentially is

2359
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
To plant some poison brownies

2360
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Yeah, they eat them that night

2361
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
They eat one of your

2362
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Things that night

2363
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
We suddenly need two new judges

2364
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Something terrible has happened

2365
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
We're ready, we'll do it

2366
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Do you think anybody has ever spiked their cookies

2367
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Out of revenge?

2368
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I mean, that's kind of fun

2369
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
With like, what, ketamine?

2370
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
What?

2371
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Probably ketamine

2372
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Probably

2373
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It would be so easy to put liquid LSD

2374
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
In oral icing

2375
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
It would even make it pay

2376
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
You just lick the cookie, it's like a big stamp

2377
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I'm not saying if this ever happens we have anything to do with it

2378
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
And I'm sure you can retroactively

2379
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Delete all this

2380
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And also, like, you know

2381
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
There's hundreds of competitors in that cabinet

2382
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
How are they to know that you are the one?

2383
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That's a great idea

2384
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
How do they know it was somebody else's?

2385
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
There's so many names out there

2386
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Yeah, you planted the idea on the podcast

2387
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
And somebody else took and ran with it

2388
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
A lot of brownies this year

2389
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
There's a fungus that naturally occurs

2390
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
In some grains that actually can cause

2391
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Solicitation, so it could just be naturally

2392
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
It could be natural

2393
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
That's great, you had a natural answer

2394
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Go for what happened

2395
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
No, it was a fungus

2396
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
We're covered, great

2397
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
