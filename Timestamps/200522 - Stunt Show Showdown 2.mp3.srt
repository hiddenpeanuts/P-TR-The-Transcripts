1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Warning, the following podcast contains a thorough dissection of three theme park stunt

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
shows.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,560
One will make you say, what a feeling.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,840
One is possibly too old for this shit.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,680
And one stands in the darkness, afraid to step into the light.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,120
Hey, those are great hints.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,360
It's podcast the ride.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,040
Welcome to podcast the ride, the theme park podcast whose famous stunts aren't physical,

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,600
but actually weeks long themed shows about outdoor shopping malls.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,360
My name is Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,000
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah, that's accurate.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
That's a good assessment.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,680
I would say so.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,760
I would like to do more physical stunts, but there really doesn't seem to be an opportunity

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,680
unless we're doing some sort of live show.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,320
So I guess if we do more live shows, I would not mind being set on fire.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,240
Let me bring Scott Garner in here as always as well to weigh in on being set on fire.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
I suppose.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,640
Well, the demonstrations make it seem pretty simple as long as you got a good team on your

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
side.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,160
Yeah, the team is very important from what I understand about stunt shows.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,080
I'm not saying I need to do the full like man on fire thing where he like lurches forward

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,520
and then falls into the water.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,840
Maybe just sort of like my arms set on fire where they put something thick around your

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,760
arm, maybe like a wrap.

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,160
And then they set that on fire.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,280
And then a person comes with a fire extinguisher and puts it out real quick.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
That's more what I'm saying.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
No max some no max involved.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
I believe that's the you know, stuff that doesn't catch on fire that protects you.

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Oh, I didn't.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
I guess.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Yeah, please.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
No max, please.

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,840
I know there's a gel as well.

39
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,480
Which we can just do on our own, right?

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,240
We can just if we just buy some no max and like watch a YouTube tutorial or two and then

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,600
we don't need like a fire marshal around.

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Yeah, I think that's probably OK.

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
I think we try it at home.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,680
I would like to pledge next time we do a live show, whenever this social distancing is over,

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,600
there will at least be one stunt in the show.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
I don't know what it is.

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm not going to say it's fire.

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm just going to say I want to stunt some kind of stunt in the show.

49
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
So that's my place.

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,760
Well, so I mean, most of the stuff, most of the shows that we're going to talk about

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,440
today have a warning about only trained professionals should do this.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Do we consider ourselves trained professionals because we've watched so many stunt shows?

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Like, does that count?

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,440
Yes, I think that actually does count.

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,760
I think sometimes people discount people that aren't trained formally and they think that

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,560
they can't do something well.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,120
But I know there's many many professional wrestlers I've read about who just started out

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,920
doing their backyard wrestling and they self-trained and they're real good.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,400
So I think there's a lot of examples, also like piano and guitar.

60
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,120
People don't necessarily take lessons and they can become sort of virtuosos.

61
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,240
So I think we have watched enough YouTube clips of people doing stunts for us to

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,600
comfortably be able to pull off a stunt in a live show.

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,720
Yeah, so our next live show is going to be playing piano and guitar on wires.

64
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,480
We got to connect a piano to wires also, and it has to fly around concurrently.

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Synced up with us like Tommy Lee or what was the other Astroworld, the tour,

66
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,400
Astroworld tour.

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,240
And I think Kiss is flying around typically also.

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,920
I saw a recent Kiss live video and they were there on wires.

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,880
OK, they're in real slow, real slow freights at their age.

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
They're on wires.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah, but it's not quite zipping around like, you know, it's not Peter Pan style.

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
No, no, no. Yes.

73
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,080
And there's no there's no flips or anything.

74
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,520
Right. It's it's it's kind of moving at the speed of like the

75
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,960
the handicapped seat on the stairwell moving up real slow.

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,720
So they're essentially taking an elevator on its last legs up.

77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,840
Like, well, it works, but the inspection date is in two weeks.

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,800
So it might not be working after that.

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,200
You know, is it just a practical reason they're using it?

80
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,240
Maybe like they're having a hard time getting from backstage to the front of the stage.

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,400
And it's just easier on their hips if wires lift them and bring them

82
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
to the front of the stage like they need ramps.

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,320
But instead, they're using wires in their concerts.

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,600
Yeah, maybe some old folks, too, in their homes.

85
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,600
Maybe if there were wire space systems, they could get up

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
and down the stairs easier than with that slow moving chair.

87
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,680
Oh, yeah. I is this a is this potentially an episode?

88
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,680
I do this count as themed entertainment, just doing a history of musicians

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,680
performing on wires in their shows.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,440
Sounds good to me.

91
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,360
I that that seems like a lot of fun because we just named a couple of kids.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,760
I know Garth Brooks, a big wire guy.

93
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
Oh, yeah.

94
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,120
What? Yep. Yep.

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,360
Yeah, I think you may be the first country wire guy.

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,360
He might have brought wires to the country fold for the first time.

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,040
I've seen a really good performance from I forget which award show

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,760
maybe the American Music Awards.

99
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,960
That is a performance of Yart Rock Classic Sailing

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,320
with Nsync and Real Christopher Cross.

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,600
And when the chorus strikes and they sing about sailing,

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,360
they go flying.

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
All of Nsync leaves the ground and Christopher Cross does not.

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,760
He stays grounded because he's not doing wires at his age.

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,600
So I just if we just all looked up who's done wire flying,

106
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,040
I think that'd be a lot of fun.

107
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,240
I think we haven't really.

108
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,080
I mean, we've talked a little bit about this on the show, but I do think

109
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,800
I don't know, Jason, you chime in.

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
I think we all have an affection for wire flying.

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,080
Absolutely. I know Pink had some very elaborate

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,360
wire work in her shows for a while, and then she got fucked up doing.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,840
Oh, my. A few years ago. Yeah.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Because like wires in general, I mean, there's a great

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,480
Little Mermaid show in Tokyo, Disney Sea, where you're basically.

116
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,080
Scott, you didn't see this, right?

117
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,760
I did see it. Oh, yeah. OK.

118
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Yeah, it's fantastic. Shockingly great.

119
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,360
It's so basically, yeah, you're the idea is like you're on the sea floor

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,240
and you're looking above and watching Ariel and her sisters.

121
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,840
And I guess I forget is King Triton involved.

122
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
He's a is he a puppet?

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,160
How do they represent him?

124
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,640
Yeah, I think I think it's an animatronic.

125
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,200
But yeah, you're you're watching like the whole Little Mermaid show

126
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
above you on wires in a very like kind of intimate theater.

127
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,040
With some cool effects.

128
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,560
So I think there's a lot of like different pivot and spin points on those wire.

129
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,360
That's like, you know,

130
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,600
there's like 16 wires involved in that.

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,640
That's just not like the two picking you up. Right. Yes.

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,000
And there's I mean, there's a great history of wire work,

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,600
obviously Tinkerbell at Disney.

134
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,760
So just the episode wires exclamation point.

135
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,560
I think that's kind of what we've hit on here is that there's just going to be

136
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,160
an episode called Wires in the future of podcast the ride.

137
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,720
Sounds good to me. Yeah, it sounds great.

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,520
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,200
Hopefully we don't land upon too many like grisly accidents

140
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,240
as we look up wires.

141
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,640
I should say Pink was OK.

142
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Pink was OK.

143
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,080
And it looked very cool what she was doing.

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,360
Hmm. Well, yeah, she did wires on some award show I saw.

145
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,520
Yeah, she's yeah, she's good.

146
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
Well, she's in wires, a lot of fun folks in wires

147
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,520
for right now.

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,960
We are here at Stunt Show Showdown

149
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,800
to a sequel to an episode from our first month.

150
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Yeah, it was forever ago.

151
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,880
Yeah, it's like Son of the Mask coming out all those years later.

152
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,880
It's a real Viva Rock Vegas.

153
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
It took a lot.

154
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,880
Just a lot of issues pulling it together.

155
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,960
We were able to reassemble the original cast, unlike Viva

156
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,480
Rock Vegas and Son of the Mask back to back draft to back draft.

157
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,680
You got some of the cast.

158
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
Yes, yeah.

159
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,840
And so they're to be commended for that.

160
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,800
But we this is more than just quick little cameos.

161
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,880
This is the full original cast of Stunt Show Showdown

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,920
from 2017 reunited here in 2020.

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,080
I don't know what took us so long.

164
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,440
I I liked the first one.

165
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,080
And I'm excited to see what you guys have in store.

166
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,560
There were just so many good, you know, there were so many good other episodes.

167
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,280
We forgot.

168
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,440
Yeah, it showed how naive we were because I mean,

169
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,520
Sindbad and the Spider-Man musical, not the Broadway musical,

170
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,120
but the Universal Hollywood musical.

171
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,760
We could easily get full episodes out of both of those now.

172
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,280
What was the third was the third of Batman show?

173
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,400
From Six Flags. Yeah.

175
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,480
Yeah. Oh, those would all be their own thing easily at this point.

176
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,880
We even I don't know the timeline that this is coming out,

177
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
but either soon or it's already come out.

178
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,680
We did a second gate about a quote unquote stunt show that

179
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,800
like I think barely even qualifies to be in this episode.

180
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,520
And yet it's its own episode on the second gate.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, that's true.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,840
I I will say what the one I'm going to present today.

183
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,360
You'll probably say that I should be taken out of this showdown,

184
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,320
that I that mine doesn't really qualify as a stunt show.

185
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,440
But I'm not even sure where we would put it.

186
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,880
I guess it's sort of in the same vein as what you're talking about,

187
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,720
like a street type show.

188
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,840
But anyway, we'll get there.

189
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,400
We'll figure it out. Yeah.

190
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,600
Well, that might be a good cause to discuss.

191
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,560
What is a stunt show? What makes something a stunt show?

192
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,200
And if it does not qualify,

193
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,760
then perhaps we'll have to give it the the negative rating.

194
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,480
Do you guys have I had to go back into the episode and remember that we did?

195
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,240
First of all, I had to remember, did we in the first one all

196
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
where the stunt shows all competing against each other?

197
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,920
And apparently the answer was no.

198
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,320
So there is no winner in this.

199
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,880
OK, the winner is all of us for gleaning and sharing information.

200
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,960
It was that we judged each one that we all presented on a scale

201
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,000
of that it's either a perfect aerial flip or a miss aimed kick in the dick.

202
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,640
That is right. Right.

203
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,040
That is what we did.

204
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
I had to go back and brave an old episode.

205
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,920
I listened to as little of it as possible.

206
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,560
I listen to episodes now.

207
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,720
I didn't used to, but I don't.

208
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,760
I haven't heard anything we did in the for the first 10 or so.

209
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,040
And I don't have any interest in it.

210
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,440
I hear I agree.

211
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,640
I listen to the some of the I listen to these if I added to the episode.

212
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,680
But I forgot that you have to.

213
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
It's a long time ago.

215
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,120
It was the it was the the the feral era.

216
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,400
In fact, I don't even that name doesn't even sound familiar.

217
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,200
It's like the gene domain in era of SNL.

218
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,480
It's rarely discussed.

219
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,280
I don't even remember. That's a different that feels like a different lifetime.

220
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,120
Kind of does. Well, for one, it's when we used to be able to go outside.

221
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,520
Oh, that must be true.

222
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,800
Remember, you're I forget when that was.

223
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,720
That feels yes.

224
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,160
It feels like a dream.

225
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,000
It feels like we've been inside for a year, I think.

226
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
But it's been so days.

227
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,240
It's been days.

228
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,840
We might have heard.

229
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,040
What if we already did this entire episode word for word and don't even remember it?

230
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,240
That's how hazed we are.

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,160
That's that. Yeah, I could believe that I could.

232
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,560
There's been times recently when we're doing the show and I go,

233
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,520
have I said this a million times before or never?

234
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,960
Or is it all happening at once?

235
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,720
Is it sort of now has this all driven us mad?

236
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,200
And we're all realizing now that like time doesn't isn't really linear.

237
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,480
And we've all like it's just an infinite loop.

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,400
And we're all repeating the same thing over and over again.

239
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,640
I know for sure I have texted, did we talk about this in conversation?

240
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,920
Did I talk about this in conversation with someone else?

241
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,520
Or did we talk about this on air while recording?

242
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,920
Yes. And a lot of the times, we're not quite sure.

243
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,480
I was going to say the answer is I don't know.

244
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,960
The answer to all three is usually maybe.

245
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,880
Mm hmm. I just listened to something from one of our

246
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,320
quarantined episodes where I like repeated information

247
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,880
that I had said in the previous sentence.

248
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,040
And I and I'm and I'm worried about listening to episodes from the first month.

249
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,880
I think there I think the biggest problems are happening right now.

250
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,240
Yeah, that's probably right.

251
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah. So.

252
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,160
Anyway, we're losing our minds is what we're saying.

253
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Yeah, we are. We are.

254
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,800
But, you know, I'm happy to be revisiting this old format

255
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,920
and to talk about three different stunt shows.

256
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,800
I think you guys know what mine is because I threw it out there,

257
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,240
but I don't know what your guys are.

258
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
So I'm really excited to learn.

259
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
How do we begin? How do we get into this?

260
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,560
Well, I can start because one of my discoveries about mine

261
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,760
is that you'd think this stunt show had entered the witness protection program.

262
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,520
There's so little paper trail on mine.

263
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,600
But I this is why like now, yeah, to qualify for being in this

264
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,400
three topic episode, it has to there has to only be like

265
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,840
five available sentences about it.

266
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,320
That's the only way we can make it fit.

267
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
Of course. Well, should should I kick it off?

268
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
Because I might.

269
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,040
Mike has me so intrigued.

270
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,680
I don't I feel like I feel like we need to build to Mike's mystery topic.

271
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm fine with that. Yeah. Kick it off.

272
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,840
Yeah. I think I think Scott's honestly I think Scott should be the main event.

273
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,360
Mine's a little shorter.

274
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Oh, OK. Yeah, I do a little bit anyway.

275
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,280
Well, yeah. Kick it off.

276
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,080
Slam it off, Jason.

277
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,080
OK, well, that's an appropriate attitude to go into,

278
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,600
because I want to take you back to the go go mid 90s.

279
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,800
Six Flags Great Adventure, a park that sits on a lake.

280
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,120
And when you have a lake, what are you doing?

281
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,040
You're doing a water stunt spectacular, specifically

282
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,520
the movie we were all thinking about in 1996,

283
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,760
the lethal weapon water stunt spectacular.

284
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,240
Oh, I don't know about this. Have I?

285
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,920
OK, so this, I think, has been mentioned very briefly on the show,

286
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,360
because for me, well, one, I had to research this topic

287
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,720
just to make sure I didn't imagine this happening.

288
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,160
But two, the reason I know I didn't imagine it

289
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,240
is because like Inception, I have did they call them totems in that movie?

290
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,320
What do they call the top and stuff?

291
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,320
The top? Yeah, I think I think so.

292
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,360
I saw the lethal weapon water stunt spectacular at some point in the mid 90s.

293
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,800
It ran at the park from 1996 until September 2001.

294
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Make of it adventure is the one in New Jersey with Kingda Ka that we talked about.

295
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,480
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of been in the air recently on the show.

296
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,400
Yeah, great adventure. Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey.

297
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,520
It's kind of equidistant between New York City and Philadelphia.

298
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,960
So kind of a big regional park for the area I grew up in.

299
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,880
And we would go a lot for I mean, it's it's a day park.

300
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,600
You know, people just go for the day.

301
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,080
I think there's one or two hotels close by, but

302
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,280
it has the drive through safari or used to.

303
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,240
Now they've kind of modified that a little. But

304
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,720
we would go, especially like the years we didn't go to Disney.

305
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,840
We had a tendency to go to like Six Flags Great Adventure or Dorney Park,

306
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,200
which Cedar Fair owns now.

307
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
That's in Pennsylvania and Allentown.

308
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,240
But anyway, the the Lethal Weapons Show, I remember seeing.

309
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,680
And so 1996 is right smack dab in between Lethal Weapon

310
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,960
three and Lethal Weapon four, which I remember the promotion.

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,160
They really promoted Lethal Weapon four, which also added

312
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,640
in addition to Riggs and Myrtle and then

313
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,120
Joe Pesci, Lethal Weapon four added Renee Russo and Chris Rock to the cast.

314
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,360
And this the Lethal Weapons

315
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,480
show features lookalikes for Mel Gibson and.

316
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,120
Oh, God, I'm blanking on his name.

317
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,040
Who was Murtagh and Danny Glover? Danny Glover. Right.

318
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,320
And then and it features a lookalike for a bleach blonde Joe Pesci,

319
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,320
because if you recall those movies, which I really do not recall much of them,

320
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,680
Joe Pesci is in them with bleach blonde hair.

321
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,240
I'm going to send you guys one of the few Leo gets Leo gets.

322
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,320
Yes, that was his character.

323
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,160
You can see this is the YouTube preview image

324
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,920
for what little video is of this show.

325
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,200
And you can find video.

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,280
I can send you this link to there's video on YouTube.

327
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,360
And what it is is not B roll.

328
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,960
It says it's the A roll camera for a commercial shoot

329
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,800
for this stunt show.

330
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,600
So it's like a lot of slow motion footage of jet skis and speed boats.

331
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,520
There's a moment where Murtagh does a somersault in front of a tank

332
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,920
firing a gun that the tank explodes.

333
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,480
Hell, yeah. It's kind of awesome.

334
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,000
But yeah, this ran for like five years or so

335
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,000
at six, great adventure on the water.

336
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:54,720
It had a big sequence where a speedboat jumps through a houseboat set.

337
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,840
And it I remember thinking it was awesome.

338
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,600
And famously, the why I remember it is because after the show,

339
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,560
we got to go up and meet the cast and they gave out spent bullet casings.

340
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,520
Oh, you mentioned this before.

341
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,840
That sounds familiar.

342
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,880
So next time I go back to my mom's house,

343
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,520
I have to try and find this bullet casing.

344
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm sure they love it when you bring spent bullet casings on airplanes.

345
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,000
But yeah, they were just giving out bullet casings to children.

346
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,960
Did you I mean, do you like, oh, this was awesome when you got the casing?

347
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh, I was psyched.

348
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,680
I was so excited to go up and get like a blank.

349
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,240
The bullet casing for a blank.

350
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,200
So this this takes place on this took place on the lake.

351
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,840
There was a lot of barges.

352
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,120
And it was you would sit in these bleachers for the Great Lake Grandstand,

353
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
which was built with the park opening

354
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,280
and eventually demolished and replaced by a rollercoaster,

355
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,600
briefly named Total Mayhem and then renamed to the Joker.

356
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,320
Oh, it got jokerfied.

357
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,240
It got jokerfied. That's right.

358
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,480
Now, if you're talking total mayhem,

359
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,120
the Joker, you know, he is total mayhem.

360
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,520
He is total mayhem.

361
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,160
Which which joker do you know was it like model after just the comic book Joker?

362
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Or was there a specific?

363
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,280
Yeah, I believe it's modeled after the comic book Joker, like the 80s, 90s one.

364
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,880
So there there is like I said, there's very little record of this stunt

365
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,840
show online. What I a lot of what I found, I found on the website.

366
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,040
Great Adventure History dot com.

367
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,600
And they place this in context on their website.

368
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,120
They they talk about season 23, the 1996 year

369
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,040
on the heels of Six Flags Great Adventures record breaking season in 1995

370
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,240
when attendance surpassed four million guests for the first time.

371
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,160
The park was at an all time high heading into 1996.

372
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,440
And this was a new attraction for 1996.

373
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,800
The other thing that opened up that was really big was an indoor

374
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,040
roller coaster called Skull Mountain and then a Birds of Prey

375
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,320
wildlife show or not pretty based on the movie.

376
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,200
No, no, not not based on the not not based on birds of prey.

377
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,560
Yeah, not birds of prey.

378
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,080
Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus. Right.

379
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,840
And I, Jason, I don't want to get too into the weeds here,

380
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,800
but I assume it was Birds of Prey based on the hero group, Birds of Prey.

381
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,600
Because Harley, because they took the turn, the name Birds of Prey,

382
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,320
and they've they've made it with different characters.

383
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,080
But it used to be like with Oracle, a.k.a. Barbara Gordon. Am I correct?

384
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,160
Well, that is the original birds.

385
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,680
I meant like hawks and eagles.

386
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,040
I meant the literal birds of prey.

387
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,920
You did not mean the DC comic heroine characters.

388
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,080
No, I did not. I did not mean that.

389
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,520
Well, I got excited. Sorry.

390
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,440
So here you can get excited by some poor theme park journalism,

391
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,680
because that is another piece of this show.

392
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,000
I found found an article in the New York Daily News

393
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,080
that is 20 facts about the three new experiences

394
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,160
coming to Six Flags Great Adventure.

395
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,400
And this article is insane because it is a numbered list of one through 20.

396
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,760
But they alternate which ride they're talking about.

397
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So they'll talk about explosions for a couple of facts

398
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,400
and then just talk about, you know, a Griffin vulture has a wingspan of seven feet.

399
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,960
They don't tell you if you're talking about a coast, a stunt show or birds.

400
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,200
And yeah, that's right.

401
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,160
Like, here's number two.

402
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,600
The dock explosion in the lethal weapon show is ignited by a propane line.

403
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,720
And the billowing flames reach a scorching 2000 F.

404
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,920
So they didn't spell check 2000 F, 2000 F.

405
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,400
There's no degrees. They missed the word degrees.

406
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,760
Over 2000 F's.

407
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,040
Also, I joined you on New York Daily News dot com.

408
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,520
I looked up this article.

409
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
It is a disaster. It's crazy.

410
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,880
This is the this is my my side of the episode might stop recording

411
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,400
because of a virus by the end of this.

412
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,920
There's so much shit popping up.

413
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,440
And I just to make sure when you mentioned inception a little bit ago,

414
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,720
I Googled inception totems and it was totems.

415
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,200
That's right. And now I have a pop up ad for a fucking totem

416
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,720
on daily news dot com. Whoa.

417
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,840
This sucks. That is too much listening to me.

418
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
Too much spyware.

419
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,240
I'm so mad at this website. Anyway, continue.

420
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,880
You mean to tell me the New York Daily News, Jared Kushner joint?

421
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,680
Oh, wait. No, is that the New York Observer?

422
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
That'd be too perfect.

423
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,560
I don't know. I'm sure it's owned by someone terrible.

424
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,360
Yeah. OK. My favorite fact in this is a number five.

425
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,480
Once Riggs's trailer home blows up, look for a toilet

426
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,360
and a box of milk bone dog biscuits in the rumble.

427
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,320
Lethal weapon fans will remember the tense moment

428
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,720
when a ready to detonate bomb trapped Murtaugh on the toilet and lethal weapon, too.

429
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,160
And dog biscuits are the favorite snack of the ever self destructive rigs.

430
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,560
Which I forgot in the movie that Mel Gibson stomps around eating dog biscuits.

431
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Yeah, I'll be honest, I did, too. That's.

432
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,240
That honestly, I would be surprised if real Mel Gibson did that, too.

433
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
I wouldn't either.

434
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,960
Richard Donner, the director, also, I believe, came back for all four of these movies.

435
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,960
He did. Yes. And he's coming back for lethal weapon five.

436
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I read he's 90 years old. Is that happening?

437
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,160
Yes, it's happening. Original cast.

438
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,240
They didn't say he Richard Donner would be directing,

439
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,600
but they did say and Richard Donner will be back.

440
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,760
And he I believe he just turned 90 years turning 90.

441
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,000
So wow, wow.

442
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,120
Once they're making movies again, buckle up.

443
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,960
He the last thing he did was the movie 16 blocks starring Bruce Willis.

444
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,560
And before that, it was lethal weapon four.

445
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,920
Yeah, he's he's had an interesting career.

446
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,560
I mean, he he's been around forever.

447
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,080
I mean, he made Superman when he was like 50, I think.

448
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,600
Yeah, I think I believe that's right.

449
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,640
So what else can I say about this show?

450
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
I mean, there's some other facts.

451
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
There's a big motorboat in a daredevil stone.

452
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,080
A motorboat crashes through a yacht flying 10 feet in the air.

453
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,560
That is in the you can find that in the a roll, b roll footage.

454
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,400
I sent you guys, which has no sound.

455
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,320
It's just very it's like cool slow motion explosions and boat jumps.

456
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,280
Yeah, I mean, the show looks cool.

457
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,960
And you can also see in the comments on the video,

458
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,000
people who were in the show go like, man, this was a hell of a time.

459
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,880
I always liked pink team, but I didn't trust white team.

460
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,960
Like people just talking about their their co-worker memories from working on it.

461
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Wow. I mean, I assume.

462
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,720
Yeah, it was like it's it's we've said many times before.

463
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,120
It's like a theater company.

464
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,280
Yeah. Where you get very bonded, you know, jumping on the back of a water

465
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,360
ski and pretending to punch someone in the back,

466
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,440
which is a clip I'm watching right now of this stunt show, which I really,

467
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,880
I really enjoy that like fake punches to like the person's shoulder

468
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,640
while they've like they're behind them on a jet ski.

469
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,840
Yes, there's some good stuff.

470
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,040
The Murtaugh actor crawling out of the lake.

471
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,000
The other thing about this lake is from the pictures from the 90s,

472
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,360
it looks like you could pretty much just walk into the lake.

473
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,760
Like there was a tiny fence that I think even I could have stepped over

474
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,400
and just walked into the lake.

475
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,160
Well, that's something you often have said that you're looking to walk into a lake.

476
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,320
Oh, sure. The ocean lake.

477
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Yeah.

478
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Yeah.

479
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,920
Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess you're right.

480
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,600
You say I'm going to walk into the ocean.

481
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,360
That's something you say often.

482
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,000
So this would be perfect for that.

483
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,280
There's a couple different and I'm not sure.

484
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,080
Is this I'm sure there was a Batman show

485
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,840
here, too, because I've seen a different Batman water show.

486
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,800
And it's interesting because it looks like it just opens up into a swamp.

487
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,960
It looks like a

488
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,400
there's swamps and marshes.

489
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,040
Yeah. And some nature trails back there.

490
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,800
I had the 1996 the front of the map.

491
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,800
I think I sent you guys the back of the map that features the lethal weapon,

492
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,360
which, of course, features a boat jumping in front of an explosion.

493
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,840
And the the Batman Forever show was running in 96.

494
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,320
And that had its own like amphitheater.

495
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,360
So they had two stunt shows going at one time.

496
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,400
Wow.

497
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,840
So maybe it wasn't this one.

498
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,200
I will. We'll get into that eventually, I'm sure.

499
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,800
But yeah, that's I see the picture now.

500
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,080
And they have the classic Batman Forever

501
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Batmobile with like the weird, I don't know what you would call it, slats

502
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,520
in the Batmobile. Yes.

503
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,600
Very, very distinctive to Batman Forever.

504
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,720
Yeah. All the Batmobiles are good.

505
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,800
That's sort of a stance I have.

506
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,440
All that mobiles are good.

507
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,400
I don't think there's been a bad Batmobile.

508
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,880
That's right. You can have people have qualms about specific bat Batman.

509
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,880
But the cars are always good.

510
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah, the cars always.

511
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,440
You know, just a quick side note.

512
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,320
What's everyone's favorite Batmobile?

513
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,480
Batman animated series, maybe.

514
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,320
That's a good one. I have a toy of that sitting right here.

515
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,080
Scott,

516
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,400
maybe predictable, but it's hard to say no to the original Batman.

517
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,320
And I live pretty close to the Chuck Baris facility, which is a big mural of it

519
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,760
in the valley and so makes me happy when I pass by that.

520
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,320
Sometimes there is a Batmobile, the adult Batmobile in the original.

521
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
And one time, and I still don't know why,

522
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,080
I was at my high school and the old Batmobile was there.

523
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,680
Oh, someone had it and I still don't know why.

524
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,840
And it shot flames in my high school parking lot.

525
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,680
Whoa. The real day.

526
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
It was wonderful.

527
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,440
So I might have to go there.

528
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,280
Although even this you only said mobiles, but I'm also I love the 60s helicopter.

529
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,280
Oh, yeah.

530
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,640
That bubble helicopter that

531
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,440
he flies over the city and everyone waves at him.

532
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,080
That's my favorite part of that movie.

533
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,080
And just like everyone waves at Batman for five minutes.

534
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Well, that's and that's the one he hangs off and he gets the shark on his leg.

535
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,080
That's the shark repellent sequence.

536
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

537
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,080
I think I am I have a toy of that as well.

538
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,720
I do I have some affection for the Batman and Robin Batmobile, though.

539
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,360
I think that was kind of cool.

540
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,720
Yeah.

541
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,840
So I like the one that you're currently

542
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,600
showing me here because it reminds me of the music video for Kiss from a Rose.

543
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,120
Yeah, I see this taking off real fast.

544
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,120
Set to

545
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,880
makes me makes me happy to look at.

546
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,040
Sure.

547
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,840
Well, we'll get we'll get to the full dissection of all the Batmobiles eventually.

548
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,520
Well, that meant stuff coming.

549
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,920
Yeah. You know, you know, it doesn't make me happy to look at.

550
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,520
Sorry to go back to this after the ad for the inception totem went away.

551
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,640
I got a new ad for a face mask, perhaps

552
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,840
because of the virus, a face mask with the V for Vendetta face on it.

553
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,760
That's awesome.

554
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,040
The guy walks mask.

555
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,000
Um, I don't care.

556
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I don't know whatever.

557
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,000
This is some dystopian shit looking at a V for Vendetta face mask so I can go

558
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,720
outside and virus times on New York Daily News dot com.

559
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,760
This is garbage.

560
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,840
I'm not going back to this website ever again.

561
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,520
Yeah, you may need to completely erase your hard drive and reinstall your operating system.

562
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,560
I'm throwing the whole computer away as soon as soon as we're done.

563
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,840
Yeah, I don't know when the new one's going to come.

564
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,200
We're not going to be able to record for like six months, but it's why you got to do

565
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,480
what I got to do is record it into your phone and send it or text it over and I'll

566
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,720
piece it together.

567
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
This be memo quality.

568
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
Sure.

569
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,680
I found so I think the last artifact I found, I mean, I think you guys some screen grabs,

570
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,280
the screen grab of the YouTube window is the rotting barges that were just left

571
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,520
from this show left in the lake.

572
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,440
I don't know the current state of them,

573
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,200
but they demolish this grandstand, I said a few years ago.

574
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,200
But the other artifact I found of lethal

575
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,840
weapon is a again poorly formatted because it's so old.

576
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,360
It is from Backstage magazine.

577
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,720
It's a casting notice for theme park roles from February 2001.

578
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,160
And at Great Adventure, they were staffing up for walk around Looney Tunes

579
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,160
characters, dancers who can sing, technicians and stunt performers for

580
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,480
the Batman Forever show and the lethal weapon stunt show.

581
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,760
They didn't list a rate, but the Six Flags Fiesta Texas casting

582
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:39,000
notice list, stunt performers make more than five hundred dollars per week.

583
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,680
So pretty good, I guess, in 2001 numbers.

584
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,640
You know, I think at a certain point,

585
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,680
this all just becomes the same routines you kind of step through.

586
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,880
A lot of these parks, of course, are seasonal because of the weather.

587
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,520
So the season usually runs like

588
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,680
May to October, depending on Halloween stuff and when they open up in the spring.

589
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,040
Right. So when it's summer in the late 90s in New Jersey,

590
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,480
it's a hell of a time to be a stunt performer.

591
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,800
It. Oh, man, I can't even imagine like the the Riggs and Myrtle actors are probably

592
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,400
partying, partying so hard in central New Jersey.

593
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Yep. Different girl every time they wake up, perhaps more than one.

594
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,840
And I bet I mean, the Leo gets the Joe Pesci act like stand in.

595
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,400
I mean, he had he probably had to be a funny guy.

596
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,280
So he's probably doing all right with the ladies, too.

597
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,840
So the photo you sent of him, he looks a lot like John Daly, not our friend,

598
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,680
the comedian, but golfer John Daly. Yes.

599
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,080
Leech blonde hair,

600
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,920
goofy shirts, goofy attitude.

601
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Oh, the other thing you can notice,

602
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,440
the bad guys in this are very clearly the nondescript 80s, 90s,

603
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,160
bad guys of like green and black fatigues and red berets.

604
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:15,160
This is before this is before every movie made the bad guy of Middle Eastern descent.

605
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,960
This was like generic baddies.

606
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,520
And that's how you just filled out Steven Seagal and John Claude Van Damme movies.

607
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,480
Yeah. Air Force One is kind of the Air Force One.

608
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,840
Con Air, I think.

609
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,720
A little the rock, certainly.

610
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,960
I yeah, I miss generic terrorists,

611
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,240
generic genererists.

612
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,120
I think I grew up thinking that was the worst thing that I would have to face as

613
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,560
an adult is like, you know, maybe if you're unlucky, there's some

614
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,080
beret guys on a plane that you're on or someone you know.

615
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,840
Beret guy. I like beret guys.

616
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,200
Yeah, right.

617
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,240
Oh, no, this guy on the plane.

618
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,920
Oh, no. A second and a third and one beret girl.

619
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,520
Yes, there was one one beret girl.

620
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,760
Well, if it was a black beret,

621
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,520
it was probably a Frenchman that was going to walk into an open manhole.

622
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,920
But if it's a red beret, watch out.

623
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,400
Now I know why you didn't have such a great time at Disneyland Paris,

624
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,560
because there must have been so many berets there.

625
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,480
You were in France.

626
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,760
I was suspicious you were nervous every single one of them.

627
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,640
Yeah, I was I was raised to fear beret wearers.

628
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,240
Yeah, that's all it makes so much sense.

629
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,240
I really I've never been able to handle watching that movie about the I've never

630
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,080
seen it, but I that movie about the terrorist Rushmore.

631
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,400
Right. I have the right on that.

632
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,840
Yes, I think yes.

633
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,680
The cover has always scared me with you.

634
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,000
It's Hellraiser with me.

635
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,160
It's Rushmore.

636
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,800
I mean, you're not Max Fisher is kind of a terror.

637
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,560
He's definitely a terror.

638
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,040
He does. Yeah, he blows a lot of shit up.

639
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,360
Yeah, true.

640
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,520
Well, I guess it makes a lot of sense.

641
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,360
Yeah, but then the Street Fighter live action movie paved new way because I

642
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,160
believe Jean Claude Van Damme as the good guy in that wears a blue beret as Guile.

643
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,200
Oh, right. Yeah.

644
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,480
Jean Claude Van Damme is Guile.

645
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,320
Oh, so it depends on the beret color.

646
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,160
Yeah, red and burgundy.

647
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,520
Always a problem.

648
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,800
Right.

649
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes. Darker.

650
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,560
Yeah, I guess red is the more sinister color than blue.

651
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,840
Mm hmm. Yeah.

652
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,960
So so just check that color.

653
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,920
Don't be blindly afraid of all beret wearers.

654
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,440
Right. That's a good PSE.

655
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,200
Nice lesson. It's a lesson that with the lethal weapons,

656
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,240
the stuntship teaches you.

657
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,840
Well, that's a lot of fun.

658
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,000
I wish there was there was more on this.

659
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,320
That footage you sent is wonderful looking

660
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,200
like the sunlight beaming 35 millimeter film.

661
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,920
It looks like great.

662
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
It looks like you could.

663
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,040
I was going to say it looks like footage from like a better Thunder in Paradise or

664
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,080
something. Yeah, like it looks like you could put it into a syndicated action

665
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,920
adventure show.

666
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,200
Yeah, it feels very syndicated opening.

667
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,480
Yeah, absolutely. I don't know why somebody didn't buy this footage and cut it

668
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,840
into footage of a much more boring show that rarely has jet skiing in it.

669
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,800
Well, I'm sure at this point, no TV shows are in production.

670
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,440
So I think we should throw it out to the universe that this footage is still

671
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,040
available to be used as a TV show.

672
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,960
Yeah.

673
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:44,000
I also sent along one of the rare one of the 90s, that classic 80s, 90s

674
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,280
illustrations, park map illustration style.

675
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,040
And that does list the lethal weapon show on the grandstand.

676
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,480
As you can see, they built their log flume on the water, too.

677
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,480
So that looks very cool.

678
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,560
I did not remember that.

679
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,360
Right. Yeah.

680
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,240
That's that kinetic energy we're talking about.

681
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,760
Yeah, kinetic energy.

682
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,040
And then they have rapids and that's all the way on the other side of the park.

683
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,400
So great adventure.

684
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Yeah, great adventure, much more like

685
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,080
nature wise, aesthetically pleasing than than Magic Mountain, I'll say.

686
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,560
Yeah, that makes sense.

687
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,920
Most things are

688
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,440
Magic Mountain

689
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,240
the aesthetic of no many no aesthetics or too many aesthetics.

690
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,760
I cannot wait to go back to Magic Mountain.

691
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,120
And this is all that's the first thing you're going to do.

692
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,280
That's the first thing I'm going to go.

693
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,200
And I'm going to say, oh, they must not have painted things in a while because of

694
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,760
the virus.

695
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,640
It's got a lot of slick.

696
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,440
Wow. Yeah.

697
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,640
A lot of stuff that seemed like it's decayed here because of the virus.

698
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,240
Everything's look, things are back to normal.

699
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,680
Every every building is being hosed down for some reason.

700
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,280
First thing in the morning, get the hose on, spray the building, spray the walkways.

701
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,560
Yeah, it'll happen.

702
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
It'll happen, at least hopefully.

703
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,280
Hopefully in the next decade.

704
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,520
Yeah, that's the dream.

705
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,280
That's wonderful.

706
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,440
What do we what do we call this?

707
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,240
Is this a perfect aerial flip or a miss aimed kick in the dick?

708
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,240
I'll say it seems like perfect aerial flip to me.

709
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,840
Seems like perfect aerial flip.

710
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,520
But what we can tell. Great.

711
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,280
I love it. Good show.

712
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,800
Good show.

713
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,280
Yeah. Mike, what do we got?

714
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,120
All right. So here's the thing.

715
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,240
Like when we say stunt show, when we break down what it means to be

716
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,600
a stunt show, like we think stunt show means guns and fire

717
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,320
and either like ATVs or jet skis, like that seems to be the thing

718
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,080
when you consider something a stunt show.

719
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,480
But is what is what would you like a stunt?

720
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,200
Does that mean like it's dangerous or does

721
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,320
that mean somebody's just showing off a skill that would be considered a stunt

722
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,600
to a normal person? I'm getting nervous here.

723
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,600
You know, is dance is dancing in an area on high like construction equipment?

724
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,680
Is that a stunt show?

725
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,680
Because I would argue it's more dangerous than a normal dance performance.

726
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,400
Well, it's definitely intriguing.

727
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,320
I'll say that.

728
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,880
All right. Let me see if I can actually just screen share and show you what I'm

729
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,560
talking about here, I believe I can.

730
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,360
Hopefully it'll work and I won't have to edit this out.

731
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,200
All right. How are you doing here?

732
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,760
I'm seeing. Yep.

733
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,840
All right.

734
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,200
This is flash dance in a tell.

735
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,720
This is in an Italian movieland theme park.

736
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,440
And it is a show,

737
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,120
as you can see,

738
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,240
where

739
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,960
on a little tiny set that's a construction area, a man in a nice suit comes out and

740
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,760
explains from what I assume because I don't speak Italian.

741
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,120
He explains that we're about to see essentially the main character from

742
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,920
flash dance, dance and do a routine on all this scaffolding and construction

743
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,960
equipment. So I from Flashdance, who is the main character in Flashdance?

744
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,440
I have all this written down because I have not seen the film Flashdance.

745
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,760
Hold on. Let me grab this

746
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,080
flash dance. I know she's an 18 year old welder.

747
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
It's Jennifer Beals.

748
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,760
And she's Alex Owens.

749
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,880
That's the character.

750
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,680
And this is a very short show, but it's on a tiny stage.

751
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,160
So here, let me just fast forward a little bit.

752
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,240
So two of the songs appear.

753
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,000
What a feeling happens later.

754
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,760
And then this is, hold on, let me find it.

755
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,000
It says it on the bottom here.

756
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,920
It's He's a Dream from Flashdance.

757
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,320
That's one of the famous scenes of Flashdance.

758
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,080
It's probably the one you've seen where she dumps the water on herself on the stage.

759
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,840
So that should be to maniac, shouldn't it?

760
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,200
At least that's in the video.

761
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,000
That is the video with the clip I watched from the movie.

762
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,520
It's this song.

763
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,840
So as you can see, there is just one single performer

764
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,320
scaling a construction site in a big curly wig.

765
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,920
Like it's a Halloween costume of real Pearlman on Cheers.

766
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,760
Yes. And she's got like construction clothes on and she's slowly taking them off

767
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,840
in a seductive way.

768
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,280
I see the bucket.

769
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,440
I see Chekhov's bucket.

770
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,720
There is a bucket on this construction site.

771
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,000
So she is like holding onto poles.

772
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,560
She is like doing what I would call like

773
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,440
she's doing like mild acrobatics.

774
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,400
She's hanging.

775
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,840
She's got good upper arm strength.

776
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,960
He's hanging.

777
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,400
I see the chair.

778
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,480
I see the rope.

779
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,320
Something's coming.

780
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,920
I see the bucket.

781
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,320
There's the bucket.

782
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,640
The moment's happening.

783
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,760
Is it going to take her wig off?

784
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,920
She's good. She took her pants off.

785
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,360
So now she's wearing a leotard.

786
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,440
Oh, this is European.

787
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,800
She is spinning around and she's like doing that kind of like dancer

788
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,920
pounding on the ground with her like she stepped on a bucket that might have like

789
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,040
concrete in it.

790
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,040
It could have any sort of material for building or renovating.

791
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,760
It seems very sturdy.

792
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,760
Yeah, that bucket definitely wobbled.

793
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,640
So now here's here's another

794
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,280
another song, another music.

795
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,520
Now she's trying to get the audience, which is just a little group of people.

796
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,760
It reminds me of the Muppets.

797
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,920
Great moments in history where there'd be like a small group gathered around.

798
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,760
And I find maybe I'm wrong, but I find this bizarre.

799
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,560
I find this whole thing bizarre.

800
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,040
It's pretty weird.

801
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,840
Yeah, I'm definitely not something I've heard of.

802
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,520
You really went dumpster diving here.

803
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,440
Yeah, this is the one.

804
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,280
Here we go.

805
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,800
Now we're getting to the

806
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,280
what you want.

807
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,040
It feels like it feels like and this is no offense to the performer.

808
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,000
It feels like she watched a couple of clips of the movie was like, all right,

809
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,880
got it, I'll just improvise my way around this.

810
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,560
I kicks high kicks.

811
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,640
Well, I saw post a video of this.

812
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,680
I can probably it's almost over.

813
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,960
This is one of the weirdest things I think we've ever run into.

814
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,200
Good job building to the bucket.

815
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,200
Yeah, so.

816
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,600
So here we go.

817
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,520
And then the bucket drop.

818
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,400
Yeah.

819
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,600
Wow. Live bucket drops.

820
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,680
So she drops water on herself, like in the movie, but it's not on a stage like

821
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,520
in the movie, it is on a construction site.

822
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,680
And then this very like

823
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,160
well-dressed Italian announcer, I think, assumes like tells you to go on your way.

824
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,440
Did we see the audience?

825
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,480
Let me zoom back here.

826
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,360
You can see this is where the audience, this is like there's no like it's not an

827
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,720
arena or anything, it's just like kind of you gather on the street.

828
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,200
It's like, you know, a not sort of like cowboy show.

829
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,480
You want to children sitting on the floor.

830
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Yeah.

831
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,520
So Flashdance, this is this clip is from 2014.

832
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,400
I believe I found a clip from twenty eighteen.

833
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,960
So but I don't believe the show is still happening.

834
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,600
That being said, it's still strange to me

835
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,200
that they went with Flashdance in 2014.

836
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,800
This feels like when someone does like a cartoony European like, yeah, we got the

837
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,040
Hollywood, you know, kiss, kiss, bang, bang, sexy, late, oh, Flashdance,

838
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,600
sexy lady bucket drop. Oh, yeah.

839
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,120
You know.

840
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,120
Yeah, baby.

841
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,520
I mean, I guess maybe it's got sort of like, you know,

842
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,600
Europe, from what I understand, is a little more comfortable with a little

843
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,080
sexuality and they were like, oh, Flashdance.

844
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,840
Yes, this is the perfect street Miss fear type show to give families when they come

845
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:02,520
to movieland park, it does feel a little sexier than what would be in an American

846
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,080
park. Yeah.

847
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,840
So I don't know if we consider this technically a stunt show.

848
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,680
If you want to disqualify me, I'm comfortable with it.

849
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,840
But she is on elevation.

850
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,760
She's not just dancing.

851
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,080
Yeah. Yeah, there's heights at play.

852
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,440
Yeah.

853
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,480
Ah, I, hmm, I don't I'm not in the mood to disqualify it.

854
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,840
That's fine. I really enjoyed it.

855
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:32,000
And the answer, by the way, is that she aimed the the bucket kind of at her torso

856
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,040
and not at the wig, because I do think the wig would have come off great.

857
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,200
Her hair is not.

858
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,480
And she's got to do this a lot of different times a day, I imagine.

859
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,000
So, yeah, you can't soak a wig because they probably only have one wig.

860
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,800
I think so. Or maybe.

861
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,840
A lot of big lice risk at this park.

862
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,600
Two wigs, perhaps.

863
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,040
So, Mac, you take the wig.

864
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,160
You're doing two o'clock.

865
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,000
I'm going to lunch and have a smoke.

866
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,240
I was so I looked and I was looking and it first of all, I got it was very

867
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,000
confusing because there's a movie park in Germany and it's not this.

868
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,920
This is movie land.

869
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,640
And it is I don't know if either of you looked into any of this.

870
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,160
It's like there's a place called Gardaland and that has many different things.

871
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,080
It has a water park.

872
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,280
It has movie land and it has a medieval times, apparently.

873
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,080
Whoa.

874
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,240
So it's this big sort of a piece of property in Italy.

875
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,920
Gardaland, Gardaland, it's G-A-R-D-A-L-A-N-D.

876
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,800
Next to Lake Garda, that's why.

877
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,080
Right, right, right.

878
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,840
So I was looking through movie land and I

879
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,480
believe the Flashdance show is gone.

880
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,960
So I was, yes, I was looking through and this might open up a whole other can of

881
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,000
worms that we will end up getting into in another episode because they have a lot

882
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,120
of different shows, they have Medusa and it says Medusa epic show.

883
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,120
They have something called Choice of New

884
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,680
Generation, which is new 80s films and spot symbols of pop culture.

885
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,080
And it's pretty clear in there that Doc Brown is in the show.

886
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,680
There's a young man.

887
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,080
There's a young man in a Doc Brown outfit at the front of the show.

888
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,680
And I think if you look around, there's like a guy dressed as Terminator.

889
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,360
This seems to be more of a dance show, so I didn't want to put it in the stunt show,

890
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,400
although to be fair, I also didn't watch it.

891
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,240
I just think that this is we're going to have to get into Choice of New Generation.

892
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,720
There is also an actual stunt show at

893
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,720
movie land called US Army Stunt Show.

894
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,640
That's very good.

895
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,280
Cool.

896
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,680
Which I think we can for sure pencil that in for Stunt Show Showdown three.

897
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,880
There's man. Yeah, absolutely.

898
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,360
They have there's somewhere they have something called Time Voyagers.

899
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,080
Yes, I saw.

900
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,080
Oh, my God.

901
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,840
It's like a really chintzy Mount Rushmore with a like a pirate and a conquistador

902
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,240
and a Native American in a headdress and an astronaut.

903
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,520
Yes, there is something called Sweet Nightmare Opera Rock.

904
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,280
All right.

905
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,560
Let's be real here.

906
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,840
Forty percent of European theme parks are just the fronts for laundering plundered

907
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,360
World War Two riches that they still haven't.

908
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,920
They laundered it long ago and then they

909
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:31,000
just kept running the park as everyone forgot why they first opened like US Army Stunt Show.

910
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Well,

911
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,800
movie land, I will say, movie land is doing a hell of a job doing it.

912
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,480
They have something called Bandito Live

913
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,680
that says help the sheriff to capture the infamous Bandito.

914
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,920
Will you make it?

915
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,360
There is something called Voices Magic.

916
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,800
The Thousand Voice Man arrives in movie land.

917
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,320
Oh, yes, and voice man, the thousand voice man.

918
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:05,880
And what I believe has replaced Flashdance is something called Full Candy Jacket.

919
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,560
What a phrase.

920
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,560
And let me show you a picture from Full Candy Jacket.

921
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,080
I'm texting it to you right now.

922
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,760
It is a like Marilyn Monroe,

923
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,440
USO style show on the same stage that Flashdance happened.

924
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:32,760
Peanut butter filled chocolate covered full candy jacket.

925
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,080
It's a yes.

926
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,120
Marilyn is kind of swooning, surrounded by USO guys.

927
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,680
And Marilyn has a very visible tattoo that says never stop dreaming.

928
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,200
Yes.

929
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,200
And I'll let you I'll send you I have the link to the show here.

930
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,120
We don't have to watch it like this, but I'll you'll get to see that it's very

931
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,320
much the same set, but it says Full Candy Jacket and it's painted on the bricks

932
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,000
behind the performers and they've reconfigured it to, I guess, look a little

933
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,640
bit, I don't know, more like the turn of the century, not turn of the century,

934
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,560
but like around, I guess this is World War Two.

935
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,440
Century. Yeah.

936
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,280
Mid-century is really what I meant.

937
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,760
They painted the cans to say gasoline.

938
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,320
Right.

939
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,600
So anyway, I guess really this is sort of

940
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,280
a backdoor pilot for a movie land episode.

941
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,280
I think it's coming to me.

942
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,280
And if you'll let me just pitch you here on the show, because we have done very

943
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,600
little in the way of strange European theme parks.

944
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,760
Yes. And I think it's time this really gets me in the mood.

945
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,200
And I'm going to propose a month or a series, however long we want to make it,

946
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,680
a series called Podcast the Rides European Vacation.

947
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,920
Oh, that's great.

948
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,160
Where we just do it.

949
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,400
We try to hop all like maybe don't try to not repeat a country.

950
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,640
Try to do like a rail trip.

951
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,920
This is our studying abroad month.

952
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,440
And we do it.

953
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,360
You know, it's a we're cooped up right now.

954
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,920
We can't travel. We're not going to be in Europe for a while.

955
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,680
Let's yeah, let's take a little European adventure with the podcast.

956
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,360
That's fun. Yeah, I love that.

957
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,080
Before the summer's through, I think that could be really fun.

958
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,840
Doing virtual a lot of blogs are doing virtual tours or virtual vacations like,

959
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,240
yeah, let's get on that bandwagon, you know.

960
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,880
Yeah, I would.

961
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,320
I want to talk about Diablo Leak in Vertigo.

962
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:36,000
Which is a thrill ride at Movieland, and they also I said Bandido had a live show.

963
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,520
He also has a CGI 3D adventure.

964
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,480
The character appears in two.

965
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,960
The character appears in two different rides or performances.

966
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,920
Cool.

967
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,600
So Movieland is on on the docket.

968
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,520
That's definitely maybe we kick it off there.

969
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,000
We'll figure out the best itinerary to cover the most ground.

970
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,320
But I yeah, let's have it.

971
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,560
Let's have a European adventure.

972
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,000
Ciao Bella.

973
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,480
So

974
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:11,240
so we will post links to all of this, obviously, but then Flashdance.

975
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,920
So you can enjoy what Italian children have been enjoying for years.

976
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,560
I don't know if this is a good idea, but I was when I when I studied abroad,

977
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,160
I went to Interlaken, Switzerland, and there was a theme park that I walked

978
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,320
up to and was too cheap to go into, and I'm looking it up now.

979
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,000
And it was called Young Frow Park.

980
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,520
It was only open for like three years.

981
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,280
And that apparently was the time that I walked outside of it.

982
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,080
And it is all about, like, extraterrestrial theories.

983
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,920
Like, it's like it's a theme park.

984
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,800
As I'm going through it, it's about like

985
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,760
the Mayan calendar and cargo cults.

986
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,560
And much like you're a Disneyland,

987
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,000
some article called this place a cultural Chernobyl.

988
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,120
Well, I think we found our first port of call.

989
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,120
Young Frow Park, we're coming.

990
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,560
Frow Park.

991
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,520
Here, it's like about crop circles and it's a theme park about

992
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,160
alien conspiracy theories.

993
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,080
Jesus, I mean, why didn't I go in there?

994
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,960
Yeah, I mean, that's I'm upset.

995
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,560
I'm upset at you.

996
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,280
I was right there.

997
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,120
Oh, well, and I was there literally several

998
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,880
months after they opened the crop circle area.

999
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,840
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

1000
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,760
I was an idiot. Oh, I'm so mad at you.

1001
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,480
All right. Well, I'll figure this out.

1002
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,400
Yeah, we'll figure out our Europe itinerary.

1003
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,800
But oh, my God, this is a great idea.

1004
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:46,120
So if we have to judge my pick for a show, the Flashdance.

1005
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,920
Stunt show, I'll call it.

1006
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,160
I can't see not calling this a perfect aerial flip.

1007
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,880
OK, Jason, what do you think?

1008
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,320
I'll give it the same.

1009
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:02,400
You know, she had to sign some waivers, had the train of like, OK,

1010
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,720
make sure to climb this this way.

1011
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,040
You know, there's some risk there.

1012
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,640
Yeah. OK, great.

1013
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,600
Well, last it'll for a long time.

1014
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,840
We'll see if your candy jacket has the staying power.

1015
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,000
Well, and you can't you know,

1016
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,840
you can't grade down something that led to our upcoming vacation together.

1017
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,360
That's true. Yeah, that's true.

1018
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,320
Really excited.

1019
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:30,680
OK, well, that brings us to my stunt show, the third and final stunt show.

1020
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,920
And you know what?

1021
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,560
Why introduce it myself when I could let

1022
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,320
one of my favorite actors tell a tale?

1023
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,160
I am David Hasselhoff.

1024
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,360
You know, if they watch, we make it all look so easy.

1025
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,520
Now, come watch the Sea World pros

1026
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,560
and see for yourself how wild it really is.

1027
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,880
The new live Baywatch Sea World Adventure show, all the life saving,

1028
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,000
wave breaking, pulse pounding drama of Baywatch in the third shattering,

1029
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,280
sun splashing, high soaring splendor of Sea World.

1030
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,480
New Baywatch Sea World.

1031
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,400
It's making quite a splash.

1032
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,280
It's making quite a splash.

1033
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,920
Yeah, we're talking Baywatch.

1034
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:25,080
If you listen to the show a lot, you know that I become a big Baywatch fan thanks

1035
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,840
to Baywatch Remastered, which recently went up on Amazon and Hulu.

1036
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,240
Beautiful film transfers mixed with very

1037
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,280
awful new music created to replace the Unclearable 90s pop songs

1038
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,520
originally in the show.

1039
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:47,440
Does that add gives me a lot of feels here in words like wave breaking and

1040
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:54,280
sort of shattering, which I don't know what that means, but it all sounds cool.

1041
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,040
Yeah, this was at Sea World and it was at.

1042
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,600
I don't know if this is all the Sea World's, but it was at four Sea World's,

1043
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:10,200
those being San Antonio, San Diego, Orlando and Cleveland.

1044
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,400
I know why it's like all Orlando makes sense.

1045
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,480
San Diego makes sense.

1046
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,680
And Cleveland, I don't know, I guess,

1047
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,800
I think maybe also on a lake, probably much like the

1048
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,600
New Jersey one you mentioned, Jason.

1049
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,520
Yeah, so it's we're in some similar territory.

1050
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,800
You and I, Jason, it's a beloved 90s action property.

1051
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,320
It is a show involving jet skis.

1052
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,000
I'm sure you can imagine,

1053
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,960
you know,

1054
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,360
my my recent love of Baywatch, it's been so much fun diving into Baywatch.

1055
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,320
And I was trying to meditate on why and try to make the sell on Baywatch a little

1056
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,560
more. And I realized it shares so much in common with the full house.

1057
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,120
It's kind of like all the same stuff I like about full house where it's it's

1058
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,840
it's a lot of big swings and really ludicrous stories and extremely incorrect

1059
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,800
takes on pop culture, like they're making stabs like this is what the kids like.

1060
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,080
Right. And they are completely wrong at every turn.

1061
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:20,240
A lot of magic and amnesia and flashbacks and things that it shouldn't have.

1062
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,840
Beach Boys and Little Richard, both on on Baywatch and Full House.

1063
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,680
And

1064
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:35,040
I think the the stunt show carries some of the Baywatch spirit with it.

1065
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,480
You know, it's not always super affiliated and there's no characters.

1066
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,880
That's the thing that I will say.

1067
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:46,080
I think you're watching essentially a separate branch of Baywatch at each

1068
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,440
SeaWorld Park that you're attending the show,

1069
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:55,280
all united by an opening message from Mitch Buchanan is played by David Hasselhoff.

1070
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,920
But it you know, I think it has the Baywatch spirit in that the plot is is

1071
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,320
pretty bizarre and could drive them insane.

1072
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,080
So let me share the screen one more time.

1073
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,640
And once again, let's Mr.

1074
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,760
Hasselhoff do the talking.

1075
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,080
So if you're ready, let me say.

1076
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,920
The Beach and the Boardwalk before you has been closed since 1942.

1077
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,120
It was voluntarily donated by the owners to help in the war effort.

1078
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,800
No one knows exactly what went on here, but we do know that before it can be reopened,

1079
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,400
Baywatch needs to complete a thorough safety inspection.

1080
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:40,280
So unless you know exactly what you're doing, these waters are off the loose.

1081
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,600
And now,

1082
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:49,720
so it's strange that just a few moments ago, Jason, you mentioned that

1083
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,760
this European park was a front for World War Two.

1084
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,840
Yeah, because that's kind of the plot of the show.

1085
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:02,040
This beach has been closed since the war was used in the war effort.

1086
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,800
So like used to fire bombs from I don't know.

1087
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,600
Is it just like loaded front to back with weaponry?

1088
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,720
I don't know what happened here.

1089
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,640
Like Mitch didn't go into detail.

1090
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,840
Keep up morale on the home front.

1091
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,720
Like, well, people need a little little bit of entertainment.

1092
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:25,400
You know, oh, maybe there was a lot of USO type shows at this play, a lot of full

1093
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,400
candy jacket. Yeah.

1094
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,520
So it all ties together.

1095
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,000
As it goes on, there's kind of the implication that this

1096
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:39,680
Mitch kind of says that it's it's unsafe and, you know, there there might be some

1097
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,360
World War Two remnants on this beach. Now, I don't know why we're there.

1098
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,480
They shouldn't have allowed us to be in the stands at this beach.

1099
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,200
But nonetheless, we're there.

1100
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,960
But they can't really do anything on the beach until Baywatch has done a proper

1101
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:03,160
inspection. And that is kind of the central conflict of the show because Baywatch says

1102
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,400
nobody can be here, but somebody else has a different idea.

1103
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,200
And that's DJ Johnny Jam.

1104
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:16,480
DJ DJ Johnny Jam is determined that this exact beach, World War Two artillery beach,

1105
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:21,560
is the perfect place to have Beach Fest 96.

1106
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:27,640
I don't have the clip queued up, but it is described as the biggest, the baddest,

1107
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,760
the coolest event of the year.

1108
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:36,680
And then, oh, yeah, by Yellow Plays, as well as an original song, which goes

1109
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,720
something like Beach First, Beach First, Kick Some Spray, Beach First.

1110
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,760
Come on, let's jam.

1111
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,840
Kick Some Spray.

1112
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,000
Kick Some Spray.

1113
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,560
Once something has been sprayed, it's kind of dissipated and it's not really able to kick it.

1114
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,480
Kick Some Spray.

1115
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,760
Kick Some Spray seems like it traded back and forth between languages a couple of times before.

1116
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,720
Yeah, that started as Let's Rock.

1117
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,320
And then it got translated and translated back four times.

1118
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,600
And now it's Kick Some Spray.

1119
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:19,320
Kick Some Spray seems like it would be like Ocean Spray's tagline, like the juice.

1120
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,160
Ocean Spray.

1121
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,200
Kick Some Spray.

1122
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,280
Drink Grapefruit Juice.

1123
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,120
And then it's just like, yeah, really,

1124
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,720
really fake, flat prune juice.

1125
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,440
You don't understand why you're kicking spray by drinking this.

1126
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,200
But they saw like the Sunny D commercial

1127
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,720
and they're like, we need attitude in the 90s like this.

1128
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was mostly Sunny D influenced.

1129
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,440
We got to get the Sunny D crowd in.

1130
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,680
Kick Some Spray.

1131
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,240
The Pog crowd in.

1132
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,600
Yeah.

1133
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,840
This was a regular occurrence in Baywatch episodes, right?

1134
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,520
Like the antagonist would be some suburban

1135
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,920
nightmare fan, death wish style.

1136
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:09,160
Like these teens, they've got a new they've got a new drug called like the itchy.

1137
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,360
Like, and it's like you do the drug by scratching.

1138
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,440
That's how it gets into your bloodstream.

1139
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:22,440
I have found the tagline for Ocean Spray products from the 90s.

1140
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,040
Oh, yes. Crave the wave.

1141
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,520
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

1142
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,840
And wait, there's another one, too.

1143
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,520
It's your zing.

1144
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,080
Crave the way, crave the wave, and it's your zing.

1145
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,680
Slay the Bay.

1146
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,680
The beaches have been overrun by teens ODing on zing.

1147
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,760
We've got to do something about it.

1148
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,120
It's a powerful new drug that's also a juice.

1149
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,000
There is a pretty crazy overlap, honestly,

1150
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:05,200
between this and an earlier episode of Baywatch in that it's about the tension

1151
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:11,080
between the Baywatch lifeguards and a very callous, cocky DJ who thinks he can do

1152
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,720
whatever he wants on the beach.

1153
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:17,120
And in the episode of the show that I'm talking about, that DJ is not DJ

1154
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:22,880
Johnny Jam, but DJ Larry Lumen Large as played by Jeff Garland.

1155
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,240
That's right. Oh, yeah.

1156
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:30,920
Yeah. So he might not be aware that his story may have been sort of the inspiration

1157
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,760
for a stunt show that ran for several years.

1158
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,040
I would bet he is not aware of that.

1159
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,120
And if we made him aware,

1160
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,280
he would say, oh, OK, wow.

1161
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,720
Living the dream.

1162
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,000
Yeah.

1163
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,960
So I will tell I will tell him.

1164
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,480
Yeah, yeah, let him know they didn't carry on the Larry Lumen Large moniker.

1165
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,640
I got curious about that episode, and

1166
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,200
he's on record in some interviews saying that it happened because he was at a

1167
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,400
wedding and met a guy who was a producer of Baywatch.

1168
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,840
He was like, I love Baywatch.

1169
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,680
And he said, the guy said, all right, you're going in the show.

1170
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,520
And then he was, wow.

1171
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,400
It's just a little casual.

1172
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,360
But they wrote it for him.

1173
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,800
Wow, that's great.

1174
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,360
And the luxury of being that was pre-curved to hear he had enough cloud even then to

1175
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,480
get a whole Baywatch devoted to him.

1176
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,480
Damn Lumen Large, Larry Lumen Large.

1177
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,240
But this is DJ Johnny Jam.

1178
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,600
He shows up, starts leading Beachfest 96.

1179
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:44,800
And that consists of that's kind of the excuse to just do like a bunch of water

1180
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,600
tricks that might be in any show.

1181
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,720
There's just like a lot of good, you know, just just really good

1182
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:58,680
basic, you know, like barefoot water skiing and ramp jumps.

1183
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,960
There's you know, there's danger along the way.

1184
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:06,240
At some point, there's a there's a runaway boat, just a boat without a driver.

1185
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:11,080
I don't know how they're doing that, if that's remote controlled or if, you know,

1186
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,320
there there's somebody that just like ducking low.

1187
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,520
But somebody has to do a jump from a piloted boat onto the runaway boat to take

1188
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,800
control of it. So that's pretty cool.

1189
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,440
It's not all water stunts.

1190
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,160
There's also a at least the Orlando one had a huge inflatable pink boombox.

1191
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,760
That's pretty great.

1192
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,360
Once the end is T-shirt cannons, you can't have a beach fest for that T-shirt cannons.

1193
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,640
Sure.

1194
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:44,040
You know, in fact, the lyric of the song

1195
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,040
states a pretty logical sense.

1196
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,680
If you're going to if you're going to have a beach fest, then you got to have fun.

1197
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,760
I wouldn't I can't dispute that.

1198
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,280
No, that's true.

1199
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:02,200
So then there's a there's a race of souped up bathtubs like a bunch of bunch of beach

1200
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,040
kook locals all drive around like here's a here's a bathtub that looks like a big

1201
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:11,320
rubber duck or something. Well, kind of predicted the Red Bull

1202
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,240
Fluke dog, if you know, yes, yes.

1203
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,760
You have to remember this is a pre fluke dog time.

1204
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,720
Each has 96 is the original fluke dog

1205
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,160
in the before times P.F. pre fluke dog.

1206
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:33,000
I'm Mike, you say you're making a beeline to to Magic Mountain.

1207
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,240
I'm going I'm hitting the next fluke dog.

1208
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,560
It's like dance over.

1209
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,160
We've all got our spots.

1210
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,840
Not that I did it before, but now, you know, I'm doing that.

1211
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,600
And like the Coney Island hot dog contest.

1212
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,440
Oh, Jason will see you there.

1213
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,760
Yeah, we should.

1214
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,320
That would be a pretty good because that's at Coney Island, right?

1215
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,600
Yeah.

1216
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,800
By going to the hot dog contest.

1217
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,320
America, you know, go, Jason.

1218
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,920
America is open.

1219
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,360
No, I've never been to the hot dog eating contest.

1220
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,440
I have to say, I mean, every every

1221
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,760
East Coast beach is just a shit show on Fourth of July.

1222
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,680
I have to imagine Coney Island is disgusting

1223
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,120
at the hot dog.

1224
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,280
Yeah. When you when you add the crowds

1225
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:22,200
in the insane heat to a bunch of water soaked hot dog buns.

1226
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,200
Yes. Yeah.

1227
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:28,120
Competitive Eaters, very normal, normal lifestyle culture.

1228
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,760
You know,

1229
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,360
the documentary, the 30 for 30 about it is genuinely wonderful.

1230
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,760
Oh, yeah.

1231
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,880
Extremely, extremely moving.

1232
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,720
If you can imagine that.

1233
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,880
But so anyway, all this nonsense is going on.

1234
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,040
They think they're just having fun, souped up, bathed as they kind of announced

1235
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,120
they implied they're going to light off some fireworks.

1236
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:56,680
And that's when they've crossed the line and the Baywatch team shows up and they say,

1237
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,640
shut it down, they're they're shutting down the beach.

1238
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:05,640
They're the Jaws mayor, not the mayor, the Jaws, everyone but the mayor.

1239
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:13,840
And so in this, like, it's kind of weird because Baywatch are the heroes.

1240
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,800
But by telling everybody, just showing up

1241
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,640
and shutting down the fun and telling everyone to play it safe,

1242
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,720
they're sort of the villains in a way because we're having fun with bathtubs

1243
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,280
and then they end all the fun.

1244
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,040
Hmm. Hmm. Interesting.

1245
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,320
So I don't end up really on their side.

1246
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,400
And then obviously also they're missing the you know, they can't be as sexy as that

1247
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,600
flash dance show.

1248
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:45,880
So you're missing the, you know, the horrible 90s term, the jiggle

1249
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,080
appeal of Baywatch.

1250
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,280
It's definitely not as sexy as the show.

1251
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,880
You don't have the, you know, you don't have big curves on the one pieces.

1252
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,440
I think everybody might be in shorts, even you might.

1253
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,040
It might not even be full swimsuit attire.

1254
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:03,280
So it's not giving you the full Baywatch experience.

1255
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,120
Is it more suggestive than the flash dance?

1256
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,480
I would say it is not.

1257
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,640
I think she is.

1258
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:13,120
I think that flash dance woman is just skimpier than the family.

1259
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,320
So it's a family, family friendly Baywatch.

1260
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,240
Yeah, yeah.

1261
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:23,680
That's it really ups the safety component above the sexy component.

1262
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,880
Right. Sure.

1263
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,920
Which puts it sort of at a at a detriment.

1264
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:33,600
That's not to say that the Baywatch team doesn't have fun as well.

1265
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,880
I think they even say, well, they say unsafe is uncool.

1266
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,440
And then that gets an applause from the audience.

1267
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,640
Yeah.

1268
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,680
Hell, yeah.

1269
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,760
And then they say, we'll show you how to have fun without hurting anybody.

1270
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,640
Oh, my God.

1271
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,720
Oh, cool.

1272
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,200
Let's sort of alarm things.

1273
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,840
Yeah, I mean, that is good.

1274
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,360
Yeah, I don't believe it.

1275
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,880
Someone has to be hurt somewhere for fun to be.

1276
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,760
Scott, can you clarify something about Baywatch for me?

1277
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:10,440
Baywatch operated on MacGyver and Batman rules and that they were good guys,

1278
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,920
but they didn't use a gun like they could get in fights,

1279
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,200
but they would have to hit people with like oars and buoys.

1280
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,560
Is that correct?

1281
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,840
Yeah, I think you can you can knock people into the water.

1282
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:28,280
But yeah, it always ends up at that very Batman point where somebody is, you know,

1283
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:34,440
about to drown or fell off the boat or is dangling for their life off a cliff.

1284
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,400
And then they will save them.

1285
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,880
Yeah. But they watch nights.

1286
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,200
They watch nights had gone.

1287
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,400
I got David Hasselhoff had a gun.

1288
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
Most likely.

1289
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:52,360
I mean, what's more distracting is that it had, you know, like ghosts and possessions.

1290
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,840
I mean, it has the coolest weapon in the

1291
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,800
entire Baywatch reverse, which is that when a Viking comes back to life

1292
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,160
and then perishes, that Mitch is insistent on giving him a Viking funeral and perfectly

1293
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:15,960
fires a flaming arrow out of a bow into a lake and yells Valhalla as he does so.

1294
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:23,120
Which is like, why is Mitch is a perfect flaming bow and arrow

1295
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,080
fire on top of being a detective and a lifeguard?

1296
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,560
Was he shooting those at the same time, those shows?

1297
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,240
He was. And not only that,

1298
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,000
there's the first couple of seasons Baywatch are a little dull.

1299
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,960
It was originally on NBC and it was just more of kind of a state drama.

1300
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,440
And there was a pretty boring character

1301
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:48,200
played by Parker Stevenson, who is a lawyer and a lifeguard both.

1302
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,040
And you just lose him.

1303
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,560
He's no good. You got to wait for, you know,

1304
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,400
Sam Anderson and Yasmine Bleefe, I feel like, is the the sleeper, like best character

1305
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,640
in the show. So when they show up, it's really operating,

1306
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,200
you know, on all cylinders.

1307
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,880
And I was I got curious, like, you know, there's this sweet spot like The Simpsons.

1308
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,280
It has like here's the seasons where it was absolutely the best.

1309
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,120
And I was like, is it the same seasons they were also making Baywatch nights?

1310
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,160
And absolutely, it lines up.

1311
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,640
I forget it's like 95 to 97 or something.

1312
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,520
Like they were so exhausted that logic went out the window.

1313
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,040
It's like these are full.

1314
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,960
These are not only like, you know, it's not like Netflix size 10 episode.

1315
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,560
These are like 24 episode seasons for both series.

1316
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,240
So Hasselhoff is like making 100 episodes a year.

1317
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,240
They're all really involved, like stunts and water work.

1318
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,200
It's such complicated shows.

1319
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,680
And he's in every like he's in he's in so many scenes, right?

1320
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,640
He's certainly not in every scene, but he's in every episode.

1321
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,080
Right. Yeah.

1322
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,680
And doing a lot punching and diving and kicking and arrow throwing.

1323
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,840
And were they prime time or syndicated?

1324
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:08,760
All syndicated. OK, it was only prime time in season one for NBC.

1325
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,960
They canceled it and then they were able to parlay

1326
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:18,080
Hasselhoff's European popularity into getting it on syndication.

1327
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,400
And it became just the biggest cash cow ever.

1328
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,880
Wow. Wow.

1329
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,360
Yeah, yeah.

1330
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,720
They live the dream.

1331
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,640
Much respects to Team Baywatch.

1332
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,320
So anyway, they show they have fun without hurting anybody.

1333
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:40,320
They they all dance a lot like all the lifeguards to a dance somehow imparts safety.

1334
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:45,800
I think at some point they danced to the song Come on, Baby and Rescue Me.

1335
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,440
So that's fun. Songs tie in.

1336
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,560
I'm trying to think what I'm what I'm missing here.

1337
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,200
Well, so that tension that I was describing,

1338
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,800
you know, the beach fest people are all dancing.

1339
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,000
Then the lifeguards are all dancing.

1340
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:06,560
But then it comes to Ed because they discover a World War Two torpedo in the sand.

1341
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,280
And I might have gotten a little fuzzy if you can imagine that watching the single

1342
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:16,280
camcorder feed that went for 50 minutes that I went in and out of paying attention.

1343
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,200
But the torpedo gets fired.

1344
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:25,560
And I'm not sure what like did the DJ somehow commandeer the torpedo and say launch it?

1345
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:32,520
I think they want to like launch the fire, like start the fireworks with a torpedo.

1346
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,520
Hmm.

1347
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,440
And you're thinking DJ what would Jimmy Jams?

1348
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,080
What is his name?

1349
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,360
So not Jimmy Jam, but Johnny Jam.

1350
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,520
Johnny Jam. I'm sorry.

1351
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:41,800
That's his brother, Jimmy.

1352
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,520
Yeah, related to the Janet Jackson producer.

1353
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,040
Yes.

1354
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,440
So you're thinking maybe the DJ set off the bomb, but it's not clear.

1355
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:55,400
I think it might be like as part of the show or that or Baywatch did it.

1356
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,480
But like, how are they qualified?

1357
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,960
They aren't explosives experts.

1358
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,520
No, I'm not sure.

1359
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:06,600
I don't know how this plays out, but a torpedo is fired.

1360
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,360
And then the DJ says,

1361
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,480
like, OK, well, we had nothing to worry about.

1362
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,440
That was a dud.

1363
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,520
And then a bunch of explosives and pyro go off.

1364
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,720
So it was not a dud.

1365
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,720
This whole thing happened on top of an active World War Two torpedo.

1366
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,520
There's so much crossover, honestly, between our three stunt shows.

1367
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,720
Yeah.

1368
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,280
The war looms large.

1369
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,480
Yes.

1370
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,680
Yeah.

1371
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,280
Lethal weapons such as torpedoes.

1372
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,400
Mm hmm.

1373
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,440
What would you say?

1374
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,960
So if you were assessed, like if you were to take the stunt show and put it in TV

1375
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,120
show form, do you think this would be one of your...

1376
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,440
How would you assess it as maybe just a show?

1377
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,920
If you were to adapt to this, I know it's been adapted before,

1378
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,120
but do you think like that's...

1379
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,800
Has there been something like that?

1380
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,520
Has a DJ set off a World War Two bomb?

1381
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,960
I mean, it seems like something they would do.

1382
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:13,000
And with the nods to the past, it feels like very, very Baywatch nights.

1383
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,920
The only way I think it could be better is if like a ghost of an old soldier came

1384
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,320
back, who's like a World War Two general, who's like one of the major...

1385
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,840
MacArthur?

1386
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:27,120
Yeah, OK, ghost of MacArthur comes back.

1387
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,320
Rommel, the Desert Fox.

1388
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,280
Oh, sure.

1389
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,480
That was that was Conan's nickname for me at the show.

1390
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,440
I'm not sure why.

1391
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,680
The Desert Fox.

1392
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:42,360
I think he thought my name sounded Germanic.

1393
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,720
I don't know. OK, that's not as Germanic as Hasselhoff.

1394
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,720
But yeah, yeah.

1395
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,120
Anyway, oh wait, no, is the Desert Rat?

1396
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,040
I had that wrong.

1397
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,040
It was Rommel's something...

1398
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,600
I was related to Rommel.

1399
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,800
I didn't understand because he knows about history and I don't.

1400
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,880
Anyway, yeah,

1401
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,480
I even got the name wrong just now.

1402
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,560
Yeah, as far as it being a show, I mean,

1403
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,600
I think it could easily be an episode of Baywatch because so much time is killed

1404
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,920
with dancing definitely seems like something they would do.

1405
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,960
Also similar to Full House in that, like,

1406
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,200
if they can think of a reason to have a band come by,

1407
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,200
that's half an hour of the show right there.

1408
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,080
Right, right, right. That would kill so much time.

1409
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,360
Yeah, they have a ton of things where like

1410
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,800
like a magazine is begging Hasselhoff to put him on the cover.

1411
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,960
Like we're profiling local heroes and you're one of the biggest local heroes of all.

1412
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,080
No, no, no, I'm just in it for the work.

1413
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,280
I'm in it to save lives.

1414
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,160
And then he relents and they do do a sexy

1415
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,960
photo shoot with him and that montage takes like seven minutes.

1416
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,600
If it's all slow motion,

1417
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,240
perfect excuse to kill a bunch of time.

1418
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,680
So anyway, but

1419
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,600
you know, funny, you mentioned that

1420
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:03,320
there there was a crossover between the show and this stunt show.

1421
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:09,240
And it's why I became aware of this, because in the episode Baywatch at SeaWorld,

1422
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,360
they killed a bunch of time by just showing the show for a while.

1423
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,480
Oh, my God.

1424
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:20,840
So just all of the beats of it, all of the Beachfest 96 shit.

1425
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,840
DJ Johnny Jam is there.

1426
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,040
It's they work it into the plot.

1427
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:30,600
And I should say, by the way, this is the second SeaWorld episode of Baywatch.

1428
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,320
They've already been to SeaWorld.

1429
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,240
They're doing it again.

1430
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,200
They did Universal Studios, too.

1431
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,080
So I also love it for that reason.

1432
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,440
It's a show that'll kill tons of time at a theme park.

1433
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:46,560
And the idea is that there's a stunt show at SeaWorld that's struggling and they're

1434
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,280
looking for a sponsor, and meanwhile, Baywatch is looking for a way

1435
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,240
to get the word out about the work that they do.

1436
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,080
So they decide to sponsor the stunt show.

1437
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:01,560
So in this world, a local lifeguard team

1438
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:07,720
in from L.A. has decided to sponsor a San Diego SeaWorld stunt show.

1439
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,800
Hmm. Huh?

1440
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,200
I don't understand.

1441
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,560
I don't know why in this universe, why would you go to this?

1442
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,800
Like you would have no way we'd be so confused as theme park fans.

1443
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,400
Like this is a stunt show based on like a

1444
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:27,920
a team of like seven lifeguards in Santa Monica that have the discretionary funds

1445
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,200
to fund a stunt show two and a half hours away.

1446
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:38,040
By all means, let's not let's not give raises to the people who work here,

1447
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:44,320
to the seasonal employees who have nothing to do from September till

1448
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,720
till April.

1449
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,400
No, no, no. Let's sponsor a SeaWorld show.

1450
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,440
Also, they play the Baywatch theme song within the show.

1451
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,000
And you got to ask what what is that to them?

1452
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,920
Just like if the Simpsons song plays

1453
01:20:56,920 --> 01:21:00,000
in the Simpsons, what if they they don't know what that song is?

1454
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,400
Right.

1455
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,880
That's they would become like self-aware

1456
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,760
at that point and their brain might be destroyed.

1457
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,240
Yeah, that might be that might be my note for the episode.

1458
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,320
Like they they all the lifeguards should have started asking these questions.

1459
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,320
CJ should have asked all these questions and then all their brains should have

1460
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,800
blown up.

1461
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,920
Anyway, they bring this up like what if we sponsored a stunt show collectively

1462
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,240
and then it's like, all right, well, we'll go pitch it.

1463
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,280
And then another scene happens.

1464
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,360
And then when you come back, there's you're just looking at the outside

1465
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,560
of Baywatch Lagoon Stadium and and there's a giant merchandise cart

1466
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,320
with the Baywatch logo all over it.

1467
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:44,000
They're like, well, I guess the pitch went fine then.

1468
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,800
And a Baywatch lifeguard is directing the show.

1469
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,800
So they've not only allowed Baywatch to brand their show,

1470
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,720
but they're letting a lifeguard do the theme park directing work.

1471
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,920
Wow.

1472
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:01,040
I think it's so funny, the idea of like just the like Baywatch writers just being

1473
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,400
like, all right, I don't know.

1474
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,440
And then one of them says, like, you know, we can just use that stunt show to kill

1475
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:09,480
30 minutes and they get so excited or like, yeah, like what?

1476
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,760
Like maybe they're like, oh, I got to have 20 pages in the script.

1477
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,120
And they're like, oh, just maybe a stunt show.

1478
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,360
Maybe just put a stunt show in.

1479
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,080
Like they must it must have been it would be like me trying to fill a paper in high

1480
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,960
school. It's like, well, it's supposed to be five pages long.

1481
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,080
And I'm like, I only wrote two and now I'm bored.

1482
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,200
It is the writing equivalent of triple spacing.

1483
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,280
Yeah, exactly.

1484
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:40,800
Get some more quotes in there, maybe a chart, maybe photocopy a chart and paste it in.

1485
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,760
Footnotes are good if you can make the footnotes really long and that really,

1486
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,360
yeah, that gives you a lot of the but footnotes also make you seem really smart, too.

1487
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,840
Yeah, yeah, you know, well, that's this.

1488
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,240
Yeah, they're they're they're pulling out all the stops, but they do add a twist,

1489
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,720
which is that once the show is open, yeah, as I said, they just show it all.

1490
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,080
And like the characters from the show,

1491
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:06,880
like Mitch and CJ just sit and watch it for a while.

1492
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,120
You just watch them clap and then

1493
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,880
but then something happens off on the outskirts because like the Lethal Weapon

1494
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:22,720
show, this is on a real lake and a boat of drunkards rides up and watches the show

1495
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,560
from as close as they can get to the show.

1496
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,000
And because they are drunkards, they knock a beer into some kerosene

1497
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:34,320
that's there for the onboard barbecue and the boat is lit on fire.

1498
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:39,800
So the Baywatch crew that thought that they were just going to enjoy watching a

1499
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,000
stunt show based on them, asked to dive into the water and go do

1500
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,560
what they do in front of an entire stadium at Sea World.

1501
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,720
Wow. Very self-aware.

1502
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,200
Yeah, pretty huge.

1503
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,040
Somebody else that's not part of the show.

1504
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,680
And then they they do it.

1505
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,080
They save the people despite being drunkards.

1506
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:02,600
They decide that they deserve to live and and they get a standing ovation

1507
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,360
from the entire SeaWorld audience, so it's it's it's wonderful.

1508
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:06,960
It's very beautiful.

1509
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,800
I don't know that beer or kerosene are that unstable that they would immediately

1510
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,800
ignite, you know, at a mild.

1511
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,080
It's not even like a visible puddle.

1512
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,920
It's like a couple of drips and then the entire boat is on fire.

1513
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:25,760
You don't you don't really see a lot of like action movies where it's like,

1514
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,920
I need to make a Molotov cocktail.

1515
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,920
Someone hand me that beer.

1516
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,720
Might be too much.

1517
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,000
It's not the best starter.

1518
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,200
No, I wouldn't think so.

1519
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:39,800
This sounds like the perfect plot of like the 60s Batman show

1520
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,320
where like they went to see a stunt show based on Batman and like Batman's just

1521
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,280
going to watch and then he has to get involved.

1522
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,680
Oh, yes.

1523
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,400
And then it's like kind of unclear who's the real Batman and who's the stunt Batman.

1524
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,720
Right. But like, yeah, Batman and Robin are

1525
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,840
just going to like support the effort, the creative effort of the stunt show.

1526
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1527
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,680
And then they're they're come in, they get a prize at the end and like, well,

1528
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,960
we're not here for the spotlight.

1529
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:09,240
That's what the hardworking theme park performers.

1530
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:09,680
Right.

1531
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,320
Struggle valiantly every day.

1532
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,520
That's what they deserve.

1533
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,800
The spotlight. They're the heroes.

1534
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,240
It's quiet, humble crime fighters.

1535
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,680
That's all. But anyway, thanks for the metal.

1536
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,160
So, you know, it's a lot of fun.

1537
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:25,960
It's all made.

1538
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:30,680
It's all elevated for me by the fact that it was part of the

1539
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,600
part of the real show.

1540
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,080
Now, if there was ever anything that would

1541
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,840
knock one of these three that we're profiling from Perfect Aerial Flip to

1542
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:44,400
Miss Same Kick in the Dick, it may be that there was a horrible accident

1543
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:49,680
in the Cleveland version of the show and this footage of it on YouTube that I

1544
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:55,120
don't recommend watching where a boat just like is plowing towards the audience

1545
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,600
and then does plow into the audience.

1546
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,080
It's horrible. It's really, really bad.

1547
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,200
Nobody died, which makes it a little more

1548
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,960
acceptable to laugh about slightly.

1549
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,920
But it's bad. The video is bad.

1550
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,440
They warn you in the video.

1551
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,880
It's bad.

1552
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,720
Yeah, yeah.

1553
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:17,720
And let me add crashed after a mechanical failure.

1554
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,640
So I,

1555
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,920
you know, fun that everybody dances to come on Baby in Rescue Beat.

1556
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,400
Not so fun that it grisly accident happened.

1557
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,480
SeaWorld Cleveland was not long for this world.

1558
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,920
And it actually became a six flags in 2001.

1559
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,800
And now I think is nothing.

1560
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,160
I think it may not be there at all, perhaps.

1561
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:42,080
And Ohayan listening can let us know.

1562
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:46,080
But I wonder if that kind of portended the end of

1563
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,200
the Baywatch stunt show and SeaWorld Cleveland in general.

1564
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:55,440
I guess you could say the minds behind the Baywatch show at SeaWorld Cleveland

1565
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:01,760
were not always ready, and they did indeed let that boat out of their sight.

1566
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:10,560
I'm looking, Scott, I'm looking at a clip here from the show that says

1567
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,160
Baywatch at SeaWorld and it says Baywatch at SeaWorld.

1568
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,760
This is the description in Cleveland, Ohio, with Rose.

1569
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,120
Some I'm not sure this woman's name in the beginning.

1570
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:24,400
And then it says Typhoon Tommy is at the fifty five second mark.

1571
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,280
Typhoon Tommy, Typhoon Tommy.

1572
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,440
I don't recall what Typhoon Tommy is all bad.

1573
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,000
Could that been a I don't have any other information.

1574
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,480
Could that just be maybe a performer that went by that moniker?

1575
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,520
Yeah, possibly.

1576
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:41,280
Maybe that was a specific person doing a trick or a flip because at fifty five it

1577
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,400
looks like he's just hanging off of a boat.

1578
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,000
Oh, maybe so.

1579
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,800
Tommy was hanging off of a boat.

1580
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:53,440
It all culminates in a jump off of a ramp where there's four guys all on skis doing

1581
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,480
a jump at the same time.

1582
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,840
That's kind of what the thing builds to.

1583
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:57,920
And it's pretty impressive.

1584
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,480
There's also a part where all the Baywatch

1585
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,480
lifeguards all do a pyramid together, which I don't know why they would.

1586
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,920
I don't know why a bunch of lifeguards are doing a pyramid, but it's cool.

1587
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,400
I should also say something I like, which is that

1588
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:18,280
Pamela Anderson, her character CJ, spends the episode caring for animals at SeaWorlds,

1589
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,120
including an injured sea lion.

1590
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,560
That's what a lot of the episode is about.

1591
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:27,240
In real life, Pamela Anderson is a huge anti SeaWorld activist.

1592
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:27,800
Right.

1593
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
She may like, yeah, major animal rights

1594
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,000
person and campaign against them.

1595
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,960
So it's very it's weird to watch her in this now,

1596
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:39,600
you know, like reciting gunpoint lines about this place is really good to the

1597
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,160
animals. And if this wasn't here, a lot of animals could get a lot more hurt.

1598
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,360
It's I want I assume I wonder if.

1599
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,760
I mean, does she she denounce this episode?

1600
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,840
I don't know if she's had to publicly address it.

1601
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,040
Maybe after we bring it up, she will.

1602
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,160
I'm not asking her to.

1603
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,840
I think it's pretty cool that she was, you know, she was being fed the party line

1604
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,280
in the 90s and today is like, fuck that noise.

1605
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:11,600
Yeah, I also think she's cool because she married producer John Peters to pay off

1606
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,360
her debts and then divorced him 12 days later.

1607
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,640
Oh, that's the greatest story I've ever heard.

1608
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,760
Isn't that insane? Yeah.

1609
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,960
And what a delight.

1610
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,800
I would like to talk about that for an hour, but we're almost at the end of this

1611
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,240
episode. Yeah, yeah, we're pretty close.

1612
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:30,360
This year, married and divorced as he divorced.

1613
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,720
He was about to marry a woman and broke up with her.

1614
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,680
Oh, to do so that he could achieve the dream of marrying Pam Anderson.

1615
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:41,520
Yes. And then they were married for a couple of weeks.

1616
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,560
He had paid off her bills and then she divorced him.

1617
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,560
Wow. Wow.

1618
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:52,360
Cool. John Peters is the guy who Kevin Smith has that story about producing Superman

1619
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,600
that never happened with the spider, with the spider.

1620
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,320
Yeah. Mechanical spider in there that ended up in Wild Wild West because John Peters

1621
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,640
was obsessed with the idea of a giant spider in a movie.

1622
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:08,000
And a former hairdresser, Barbara Streisand.

1623
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,160
Barbara married to Barbara Streisand.

1624
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,480
Yeah, yes.

1625
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,600
Extensively, yes.

1626
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,200
Until I do a quick Google search here.

1627
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,160
No, no, dated.

1628
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,480
Maybe just dated. Sorry.

1629
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,120
He was made to Leslie and Warren, though.

1630
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,840
Geez. Oh, wow.

1631
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,400
Oh, so good and clue, which I just watched.

1632
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,440
Wow. Yeah.

1633
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,280
What a dating lineup.

1634
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,560
Scott, that SeaWorld in Cleveland, I realized it sounded familiar to me.

1635
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:38,360
And it got roped into the

1636
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,840
G Geauga, Gigauga Lake

1637
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,040
story.

1638
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:47,360
It's the whole thing where like

1639
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:53,440
a theme park kept changing hands and then it got roped into the Six Flags World of

1640
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,040
Adventure, which the SeaWorld got molded into.

1641
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,040
And then it became a wild water kingdom,

1642
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:05,240
which is also the name of a Cedar Fair Water Park at Doherty Park in Pennsylvania.

1643
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,480
It's a whole thing.

1644
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:11,720
I believe a listener who is working for a Cleveland media outlet had made a video

1645
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,760
about the history of Geauga Lake, Geauga Lake.

1646
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,320
I do not know how to pronounce it.

1647
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,960
But yeah, there's a whole massive larger story about this area,

1648
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,240
this entertainment complex.

1649
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,200
Oh, weird.

1650
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:31,880
Oh, so just like traded hands at times and pretty much owned by anyone who can own

1651
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,120
a theme park of this size.

1652
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,000
She's now now been demolished, it seems like.

1653
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:41,880
I think Wildwater Kingdom, it looks like it closed in 2016.

1654
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,760
She's

1655
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:49,720
well, happier times when Mitch and the gang were imparting the important lesson

1656
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:56,320
of keeping it safe on World War Two artillery strewn beaches.

1657
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,600
What do we think?

1658
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,920
What's what's our what's our another winner?

1659
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,320
Wow. Wow.

1660
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,560
Despite the despite the accidents, despite the accidents.

1661
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,120
Yes, this is another winner.

1662
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,360
It's a great IP.

1663
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,280
It's a great IP.

1664
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,440
Yeah, yeah.

1665
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,720
Oh, and I think, boy, and it's a winner without even me

1666
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,360
me forgetting the detail that it's full of something called an air chair.

1667
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,320
Oh, my God.

1668
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:22,120
Like a guy's like on a chair that's also a water ski.

1669
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,920
And in the boy in the episode so many times, DJ Johnny Jan says, and there he is

1670
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:31,080
on the air chair like the fan man.

1671
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,680
I yeah, that's kind of a kind of a new generation fan man,

1672
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,880
tired fan man, wired air chair.

1673
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:41,600
Yeah.

1674
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:48,840
Well, congrats to Baywatch and to all three of these for being perfect aerial flips.

1675
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:49,800
You all did it.

1676
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,720
Yeah. The trifecta.

1677
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:52,880
Wow. Wow.

1678
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:56,040
And and a little vacation has been inspired.

1679
01:32:56,240 --> 01:33:00,280
This was very fun, very positive, very productive.

1680
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:01,760
Yeah.

1681
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,120
We really did it.

1682
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,600
We really did it.

1683
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,720
Congrats, guys.

1684
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,720
I don't know.

1685
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,440
I need a stunt to your way to.

1686
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,840
Yeah.

1687
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,400
I ran out of energy five minutes ago.

1688
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,080
Enjoy.

1689
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:14,880
We don't have energy.

1690
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:18,360
Enjoy the rest of your day in your podcast.

1691
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:18,840
Yeah.

1692
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,600
Crave, crave the wave, crave the wave.

1693
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,800
What was the other one?

1694
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,440
Kick the spray, kick the kick, the spray.

1695
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,200
Yeah, the spray.

1696
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,080
Kick some spray, kick some spray.

1697
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,040
Yeah. OK.

1698
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:37,720
Well, that's the way to do it then with a little DJ Johnny Jam attitude.

1699
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,000
And since we've temporarily retired, our typical episode ender, let's say thanks

1700
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:47,280

1701
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,560
The ride. Oh, yeah.

1702
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,480

And now, gentlemen, as we end every episode, let's all reach up, grab the rope

1717
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:34,600
above us and douse ourselves with water.

1718
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,640
We were.

1719
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,960
We were.

1720
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:43,320
Oh, great cats were sounding like cats now.

1721
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,240
There's a thin line between shredding and mewing and mewing.

1722
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,160
All right.

1723
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,080
Well, great.

1724
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,760
Let's let's go out on that here.

1725
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,640
Maybe one more in mass and goodbye.

1726
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:06,400
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1727
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,800
