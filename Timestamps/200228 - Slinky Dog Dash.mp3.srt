1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Warning! The following podcast may be hosted by sound-a-likes instead of the real Mike, Scott, and Jason.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It may also contain Buzz Lightyear's right-wing leanings and a harrowing cookie naming controversy.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's Disney World's Slinky Dog Dash on Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show hosted by three men who, in order to record, rig up a Slinky and a Dash and Dodge Mega Podcast Kit every week to record.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined by Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, I'm here and we do exactly what you just said.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Every week.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It was a kit of a sentence.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Some assembly required.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, I didn't write anything down.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I just looked at the detail of the kit name and kind of did it on the fly.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Wow, wow. Good work.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It went much better than I expected.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, yeah. No kidding. Yeah. Wow, wow. Complex.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Much like this ride.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Much like I think people were thinking about that we're a little skeptical of this ride.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're talking about Slinky Dog Dash today.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But I have a couple pieces of business to get to.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, OK.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
One of which is a very quick Podcast The Ride.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oopsie.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
On the Hagrid's episode, I said the Hagrid and Scroot animatronic were done by Garner Holt.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In fact, we were told because they told us it was done by Animax Robotics.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Animax Robotics out of Nashville, Tennessee.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Beautiful Nashville, Tennessee.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OK.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So they, I love it that someone from the United States,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I love it that someone from that company listens.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, no kidding.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So the ultimate, the ultimate insult was given out to the doled out to them when they were not given proper credit, which is fascinating.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We mainly don't credit who makes a lot of things.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Fair, yes, absolutely.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I do, it's like usually we get told by a smarter than us listener.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I'm just a person who knows more than we do.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Like, oh, this is you guys screwed this up or this is what it is.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Specifically, Animax Designs, animaxdesigns.com to view more of their work.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And you can follow them on Instagram.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They've got really cool pictures and stuff on Instagram.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But I love the idea that that someone who like was listening and they're like, hey, I worked on that Hagrid face for for three years and Garner Holt's getting the credit.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is egg on our face.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's all of when we need to know who makes robots or not mention it.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or not mention it.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Maybe not mention it is the better way.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So keeping that in mind, the second piece of business, a little bit of news to talk about on this episode is coming from Blue Loop dot com, which is kind of the like a little off the beaten path.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's the trade magazine for themed entertainment and also for some reason museums.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So but this is a universal has filed a new patent.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And this is a lot of places you know you can kind of read the tea leaves of where theme park developments are going based off patents that are filed.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We talked about universal was filed like a moving room like a moving room sort of thing a while back.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is an augmented reality augmented right system and method for to develop a riding game control system with heads up mounted displays hoods.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So here you can see it's kind of like a glasses looking sort of more intense 3D glasses looking thing.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The idea being it would display stuff on the screen that would interact with like physical sets you would watch along a ride system.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, well, this is clearly this is where Mario is the Mario stuff.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I is a patent for these glasses.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There's a patent for this whole system and it would be like give you an individual experience.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You would be seeing something. Other people might also be seeing something, but not necessarily.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The other thing about it is you see this one diagram with everyone looking at one object like that could affect if everyone's attention is on it.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Everyone doing it could affect something.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So to me that read like well, if you're all shooting lasers and there's a big boss and you all need to aim your lasers in the one place sort of like how we did the Avengers damage control and you all have to fire on the big boss at the end.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sure. Sure. So.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, so if you're all throwing turtle shells at something.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, I mean souped up like 3D glasses is an interesting way to get sort of a VR AR experience in that like to scale because that's probably VR.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's hard to put helmets and backpacks on a ton of people.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Slimmer glasses.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So yeah, they're real quick.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The word from Nintendo land.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At least there was some news that came out a couple of weeks ago where it's like there's going to be a little wristband.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I think we've talked about this a little bit.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This can be like your magic band, but at Nintendo you can keep track of point or coins, I guess not points and it'll keep track of other data.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So yeah, I wonder if you're like wearing glasses in the land or it's just on Mario Kart.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But if it's in the land, like then you can have like I know there are practical question mark blocks in the land.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But like, can you see like fire flowers popping out of them with your glasses like how do these work everywhere?

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, interesting.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, it would be cool if they worked everywhere.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That seems kind of hard to like everyone has to wear their own glasses.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But like hypothetically, at least you could augment the ride like that.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I mean, this, you know, the very basic like sketches and stuff with the patent show people in a ride vehicle.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And for some reason, the picture of a Ferris wheel, I don't know if that's just to communicate the idea of ride.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But like they show physical stuff and then they show floating stuff that I would assume be the thing displayed dynamically adjusting.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ride perspective is the phrase that's used.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Wow.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I cannot picture how this will work day to day, but I'm sure they'll pull it off.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I it's really cool.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, I mean, I was going to say the application in Mario Kart that makes the most sense would be throwing stuff at the other car at the other cart.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So you would see the cart because you said that you're not driving the Mario Kart.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't believe so.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's what I've rumors I've read at least that like it's you're not actually I think it's only going to be like two big carts and then robot carts of other Mario characters.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, yes.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So I think it's like two human full of like two human vehicles and maybe there's eight seats in each of them or probably not 12, but at least eight, I think.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then as you're going along, Wario full size Wario all of a sudden comes up on your right.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Boy, I get my issue with big things in small rooms.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wario and Waluigi, I think will scare the shit out of you.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Really?

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, how big is Wario is big.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But he's just like a larger man.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're even scared of like larger men.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I guess so, yes.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He's not like a giant.

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Like your dog, Edwin.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Larger man walks in the room.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I bark.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I guess I don't know if it's like I guess the size if it's the size of a Hagrid built by Animax.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Animax.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If it were the size of Animax Hagrid, then that's just a regular bigger man.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But if it were I think the cartoon proportions are and I imagine the Waluigi is like nine feet tall.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I think he's an avatar.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He's more.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Waluigi is a Navi size.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I feel like in my mind, we'll all give our opinions of what we think height wise the differences between Mario and Wario.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I feel like Wario is maybe two and a half Mario's tall.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think so.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So well, that's I mean, we can scale that within scenes.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But how tall do they determine Mario is compared to us?

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's a good question.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mario, obviously, because from the movie Mario, he's Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So like five two or something.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So like five two.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Mario is Jason's size.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
One and a half.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And Luigi probably is like I feel like five ten.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And then you think Wario is that much bigger than Mario?

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think it's just okay.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, now.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Now you're right.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In cartoon land, he's two and a half Mario's tall.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If we're doing if you were to put first of all, who would have played Wario in an early 90s Mario movie?

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, if he'd been around in that era.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Who do we think?

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Davido.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Danny Davido.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But you'd have to do a thing to make him bigger.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
John Goodman.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
John Goodman.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's good.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Bad.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So Wario in if he's a human, Wario is probably six, six, one or six, two.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And Waluigi is like six, six.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So Wario is supposed to be that much bigger than Mario.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I thought it was just huskier.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He's taller.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He's taller.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Somebody's gonna be really mad because they know the exact heights of all these characters.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But Waluigi is like Slenderman proportions.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like he's got the I should play Waluigi in something.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
OK.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I feel like sure if I lose a little weight.

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Mario Mario height.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's good.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I mean, you'll be on a chart.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Were they ever arrested at the same time?

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They're going to I'm sure there's going to be a giant bullet, which is Scott's fear is having so many of these.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The big plants is when, you know, there's a giant bullet bill.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Now, regular bullet, because I'm looking, I actually now have a height chart of all of them and standard issue bullet bill is OK.

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Right.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But one the size of the full room.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Really scare me.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So if we're if it's like Bowser's Castle, I'm trying to think where he would be, which section of the Mario Kart ride, maybe the Bowser's Castle area.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And then, yeah.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So if there's a giant bullet bill, that's going to be too much for you.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But yeah, you get the bullets in America where we're all insane about guns.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Does that just mean where there's so big and he's so divorced from he looks like a big shark fin?

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He's so big.

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, I don't think well, who knows who knows what they can maybe that's augmented.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Honestly, that's a perfect use of augmented reality because then you can have them coming straight at you.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And you don't have to deal on this is Scott's nightmare.

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, no, no.

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You have a giant bullet bill and he can be as big as the room.

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Constantly doing like a heart like, like taking off the glasses.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I hadn't thought of you guys cover my eyes.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I said before I said before that was like the only thing I could think of is throwing shells.

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But no, you could do that.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You could have the giant piranha plants.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You could do all of that and really make it feel like Back to the Future 2 when the shark, when Jaws goes and tries to go.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Goes and tries to know.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't want any booze.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't give me a boo.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't want to be in a castle and I don't want a big boo.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Small boo is fine.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A big boo is not OK.

200
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And but if I'm looking at him, he shouldn't be if I'm looking at him, he shouldn't be going anywhere near his eyes should be closed.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He's the one who closes his eyes, not me.

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is I am taking a little delight in this in this bit we're doing, which is rooted in reality.

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But I am also legit excited by the idea that you could do that in augmented reality.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, I've never thought about it.

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But you most of the things, but not the Giants.

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm with you 80 percent of the way.

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The bigger they go, the more Scott is out.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You could take the glasses off, though.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I could. Yes.

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So unless well, look at that pattern carefully, though, there isn't a way that they, you know, staple it to your eyes.

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is it drilled into your?

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Figure nine's note here just says.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Just for Scott.

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
OK, did you guys find this drawing?

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There's a drawing. Yeah, I'm looking at it, too.

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There's a drawing of Scott in the pattern.

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, I've got a screen grab from that very fun Charlie XCX music video commercial.

219
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And she says, Hi, Scott.

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What? She says, Hi, Scott.

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Big time's coming.

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Big time's coming.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We haven't really talked about that.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is it a giant Charlie XCX?

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
A 10 foot tall augmented reality.

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm not I'm not a vor guy.

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
OK, I don't want my giant women.

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No, no.

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Stay away from me.

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No, we hadn't really talked about that either.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The Charlie XCX promotional video for Super Nintendo World.

232
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It was a lot of fun.

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It was it was a lot.

234
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was a lot of barrage of things.

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Tons of people wearing Mario hats, which I'm assuming will be sold and will be an immediate smash hit.

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The preponderance of the hats.

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You know, actually interesting in this speaking of hats in this height chart that I'm looking at, you have to take hats into account because with hat Wario is approaching Yoshi levels of tall.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Not that tall.

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, it actually is not.

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We're maybe we're maybe talking like less than a foot.

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're very far away.

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Maybe you can see that.

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think also his hat is taller than Mario's hat.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So he might only be like six inches taller than Mario potentially.

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All right.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Waluigi, however, very tall, probably the tallest of all the characters.

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, I think Peach and Bowser's Bowser is taller.

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, Peach and Daisy are probably taller than Wario than.

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes, that is correct.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And do you know who's taller between the two of them?

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I want to say Daisy, but I could be wrong.

254
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It is barely Peach.

255
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Interesting.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Also crown, but I'm not taking I'm reducing crown in my head.

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay.

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And then Bowser is bigger than all of those.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There's much bigger than all of them.

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's very big.

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And he's a lot bigger than Donkey Kong, though in cart when you're select he Donkey Kong and Bowser are essentially the same in original Mario Kart.

262
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They are the very tiny Smash Brothers to I feel like they're comparable.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So right now they're a little bit more out there.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They're like maybe initially they weren't in the Caterpillar.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Caterpillar who you bop and he turns red and runs back and forth.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Also a little tall, but you have to take the flower into account.

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The famous flower atop his head.

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You are going to get eaten by that flower on this ride.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No, I am sure of it because you know why I'm sure of it because it happens in the Mario Kart VR I did in Japan.

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You get eaten by the.

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well, like it's coming at you.

273
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Not by the Caterpillar's flower.

274
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No, no, no.

275
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I thought you were pointing at the.

276
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, no, apparently the little yellow Caterpillar has a little like.

277
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I see.

278
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I know what you're talking about.

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah, Mario World.

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The big chomping plant, though.

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, the big chomping.

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What's it called?

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Chomping plant, whatever.

284
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Not the piranha in the pipe, but the other one in like polka dot shorts.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He looks like he's wearing a male briefs based on Minnie's dress.

286
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Huh?

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Just to confirm an earlier speculation, the heads up mounted display has to interconnect to the ride vehicle.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And the ride and game system are integrated with the ride vehicle.

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So it communicates with your vehicle.

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, a kind of like the the ride system and the vehicle and the heads up display are all communicating with each other.

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So I don't think out and about wandering in the land is possible yet because you'd have to get it all right in the glasses.

292
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But for like, I mean, the Google Glass was kind of a, you know, for big, big dorks.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But like for a three minute ride, you already wear ridiculous looking three three.

294
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This is a yeah, this is real.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It is hardcore speculation.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I guess then you also if it's all integrated into the ride, you could be throwing shells at the unmanned like Wario and sending it like like twirling off course or something.

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, potentially.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't know how cool that'll like.

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sure maybe at the very least it would spin around or something.

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But like all of that sounds very exciting and then like maybe fulfilling like the promise of Galaxy's Edge where it's like you could collect coins on the ride and then you have that correspond to your whatever wristband.

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The ability to leap up and hit the box.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, my God.

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's very that's like cooler than any ride.

304
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah.

305
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Going through the warp tunnel because that's like how you're going to get in.

306
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You go through a warp tunnel into the Mario land.

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I didn't know that.

308
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, it's like the sideways one.

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Obviously not the up and down because that would be crazy.

310
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This episode isn't about Mario speculation.

311
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But do you guys is there a Mario Kart memory from any of the many Mario Kart games something you would really want in it or really not want in it something you I don't want this course anywhere near the ride Mario Kart very important to me.

312
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I'm not saying that facetiously.

313
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I mean, I just was playing from the Switch.

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You have the virtual console and you can play old games, Nintendo and Super Nintendo right now, at least not 64.

315
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I think it's coming.

316
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And I was playing Mario Kart with my sister, the original Super Nintendo.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And it's so burned into my brain because we used to do this.

318
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
30 years ago in my grandmother's house.

319
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So it's like that all of that is like and then we'd always I would get first you again second always and I would always be Koopa Troopa and she would be toad.

320
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I'm trying to think of something like a classic thing from that.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I would love I'd be sorry.

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I would be disappointed if the ride was mainly one of the chocolate level.

323
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The worst level.

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The worst level.

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, the ride is just moving slowly through chocolate moss or whatever.

326
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Choco. What is it called?

327
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Vibrating slowly off course in a chocolate world.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Very unpleasant.

329
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Terrible.

330
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Koopa Beach.

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I love and Super Nintendo.

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Now, that's the opposite.

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's as smooth as Rise of the Resistance.

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It has. I'm sure this ride ends in Rainbow Road.

335
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It has.

336
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But as a kid, Rainbow Road, I couldn't have been more obsessed with.

337
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, all the Rainbow Roads, I think have been very strong universally through every they've never soiled the Rainbow Road property.

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No. Yeah.

339
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And then 64 Rainbow Road, I have a lot of affection for and there's secret jump where you jump off of one area and you land on it's very hard to do.

340
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, yes. Yeah.

341
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think a lot of my first semester of college was spent trying to pull that off.

342
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah.

343
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh, it's very hard.

344
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know.

345
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We could do more a whole Mario Kart podcast here.

346
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There's plenty to talk about there.

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I love Double Dash where you switch around.

348
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I was a big Double Dash fan.

349
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

350
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah.

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's a battle in that where you steal a sun.

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh, that's good.

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You have to hold on to the sun for a certain amount of time.

354
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There was a rumor that we should get to Toy Story in a second.

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There is a rumor that Mario Kart was going to use a system, sort of a roller coaster system, like on the bones of it, where you could do sort of simulated jumps.

356
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Essentially, you could make it look like it was going off a cliff and because of the kind of narrowness of the track, you wouldn't necessarily be able to see where you were going.

357
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So it would feel kind of like you shot off of a cliff and you landed again.

358
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So I feel like a Double Dash or and then the newer one has a two where you have a little hang glider on the back of your car.

359
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, yeah.

360
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So like you could also in addition to racing, you're like flying through the air.

361
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So if that would be something I would want, that's a lot to ask.

362
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I think we had a very interesting console progression from like we had Nintendo and then Genesis and then a 64.

363
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm trying to remember if I ever owned a Mario Kart or just played it at friend's houses.

364
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think of it as a very social game, but I feel like I didn't have it at home that much.

365
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I feel like we would borrow it sometimes and would play the 64 one.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I think jumping and invincibility I would be interested in.

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I hated the banana peels when playing the game because I would always get hit by one.

368
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But in a ride, that sounds fun.

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, sure.

370
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Spin it around.

371
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You spin out. Yes.

372
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But you know what would not be fun is if either that or the guy having to pick you up with the fishing pole.

373
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If you were your literal money had to be handed over like a toll.

374
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, you mean like you went off cash out of your pocket and you had to hand just a coin.

375
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah.

376
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Just like whatever change you got.

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If your personal monetary positions were asked for by the man riding what I've always called the big tooth.

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I know it's probably a cloud.

379
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's a cloud. Yeah.

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's interesting.

381
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I've never thought of it as a tooth.

382
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's kind of toothy.

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Huh.

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The man in the tooth stole my money.

385
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The man in the tooth.

386
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, what if it's AR and you see him through the AR goggles and he just digitally steals.

387
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So if he gets to you and you don't throw a shell at him, he comes to you and then there's like an Apple Pay system where he just automatically deducts $20 from everyone's phone.

388
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Oh, no.

389
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And you have to just say, OK, that before the ride.

390
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah. Wait, check that patent again.

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Is it hooked up to our Apple Pay?

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh, it is. Yeah, I see it here.

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, no.

394
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's hooked up to Apple Pay and you got the Lakitu, I believe.

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's been looking.

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Wait, the glasses I wear on the Mario Kart ride have been listening to all my Amazon purchases and Google search history.

397
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

398
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And it knows like Google email, it knows when you wake up and it knows your shopping patterns, which is what I've been told is what Gmail does.

399
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh, rad.

400
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Is that Google is just collecting data on you and they know so much about you just from all of it.

401
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
They just know what you buy.

402
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
They know when you buy it.

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They know when you wake up.

404
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's yeah, it's really dystopian.

405
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This is awful.

406
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Let's move over to Disney World and they're with their wonderful magic bands, which control entry to your hotel rooms and you can keep lots of money on.

407
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And it tells you it tells you what they buy, what people buy and when they wake up and when they're moving.

408
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And you can use it to open your door, your locked door.

409
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Your phone can open your locked door.

410
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes, and if a button is pressed, it can shock you and incapacitate you.

411
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They can just take people out.

412
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
If you're wearing a magic band and you're like reaching for pirate treasure on Pirates of the Caribbean, it is like then you just fall into and they can say, I don't know what happened.

413
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You just sudden seizure fell into the water.

414
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We don't have that at Disneyland yet because we were riding Casey Jr.

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
the other day and the poor conductor had to keep looking back and telling the kid, please keep your arms in the big cage.

416
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Pink car.

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was going to say that car because I thought it was me.

418
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I always think it's me.

419
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If I hear honk on the road.

420
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, yeah.

421
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Must be something I'm doing.

422
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, to Disney World we go, I suppose.

423
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah.

424
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
For Slinky Dog Dash, another thing in the series of topics we can talk about now that we've all been on it.

425
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We've sort of recently been to Orlando.

426
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Fun stuff.

427
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's a fun one.

428
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I mean, probably our ticket to talk about Toy Story land in general.

429
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And we've talked a ton about Galaxy's Edge, but in Florida, this is really the last piece of the puzzle of revamping all of Disney's Hollywood studios.

430
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They're sort of right next to each other, in fact.

431
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And I don't know.

432
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Good job.

433
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's all fun.

434
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
RIP, the costume department.

435
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:59,000
RIP where Wayne Zalinski's van was parked or where that plane, Walt, spotted the Florida property in was parked.

436
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
A lot of parked vehicles had to go to make this roller coaster.

437
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The Flight of the Navigator thing was gone, which is cool.

438
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That is too bad.

439
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That's got to be somewhere else, though.

440
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They didn't just burn it in a fire.

441
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I hope.

442
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah.

443
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Now that it's on Disney+, it's getting a whole new lease on life.

444
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah.

445
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Actually, in looking at the actual footprint, I realized that part of the territory of this roller coaster is where the Earful Tower used to be.

446
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh, right.

447
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This is the spot.

448
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, the former icon of the park, the water tower with the big mouse ears.

449
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Did they put it somewhere else?

450
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No, it's just gone.

451
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's just gone?

452
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And the Tower of Terror just means this park?

453
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
In the app, you see little Tower of Terror characters.

454
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh, that's how they represent the icing.

455
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's cute.

456
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They also got rid of the Pixar Studios, was it called?

457
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Okay, so I have something with that.

458
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What you're referring to is Pixar Place.

459
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That's right, sorry.

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Pixar Place now exists still next to Toy Story Land.

461
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And I walked through it when we were down there.

462
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And it is a dead-end alley.

463
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
A dead-end alley?

464
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Like, it is a dead-end alley where you can meet the Incredibles.

465
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then there is a stand called Neighborhood Bakery.

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I need to talk about Neighborhood Bakery.

467
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Now, this is adjacent.

468
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
This is not into Toy Story Land.

469
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Neighborhood Bakery falls in the purview of Pixar Place.

470
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We have no Sector Keeper.

471
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Nobody's coming down on us.

472
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, we can do whatever we want.

473
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Just clarifying.

474
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We've earned a bunch of Mario time.

475
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Neighborhood Bakery is the Florida home of the deep dish cookie

476
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
that we know as Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num.

477
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh my gosh, really?

478
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
However, I looked at the menu on the app,

479
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and there they just call it Num Num Cookie.

480
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And that sucks.

481
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That made me so mad.

482
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That's like when you go to a different region,

483
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
they're like, oh, here we call soda pop bubble juice.

484
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And it's like, no, that's not what you call.

485
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Come on.

486
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll accept pop.

487
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'll take pop.

488
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But Num Num Cookie was such a bummer to discover,

489
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and also a bummer to discover Pixar Place,

490
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
which originally felt like it was retrofitted

491
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
to justify a meet and greet in Toy Story Midway Media.

492
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But they've reconfigured the entrance to Toy Story Midway

493
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Media into Toy Story Land.

494
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah.

495
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's like the other side of the building.

496
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That's confusing.

497
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I didn't know any of that had happened,

498
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
as opposed to because Pixar Place kind of looks like the miniature version

499
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
of the Pixar Studios in Emeryville,

500
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
where apparently a Heimlich car is sitting now.

501
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh, right.

502
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Heimlich's Jujutsu Train.

503
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So that's very nice.

504
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So this area, yeah, I didn't know it was still there.

505
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Now it's just there.

506
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So there's still dead zones in this park.

507
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because they took away.

508
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So I didn't know it was still kind of there,

509
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
because I know they took away fun props from it.

510
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah.

511
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Like the C and spell used to be hanging in there in that stretch.

512
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And now it's on the ride.

513
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Mr. Mike.

514
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Now it's on Slinky Dog.

515
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Am I thinking of Mr. Mike?

516
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The white one?

517
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That's on there too.

518
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But I think there's a C and spell as well.

519
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I think there's a C and spell somewhere.

520
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah.

521
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I had to check.

522
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But they took some fun props out of Pixar Place

523
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and put it in Toy Story Land.

524
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And now this is my kind of big thing about current Hollywood studios

525
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
going through it.

526
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Especially once Runaway Railway opens,

527
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
this park will once again be packed with attractions.

528
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yeah.

529
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
People like Runaway Railway,

530
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Galaxy's Edge, including Rise of the Resistance,

531
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Slinky Dog, Tower of Terror,

532
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and Rockin' Rollercoaster.

533
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But when it was all kind of fake film sets,

534
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
it kind of made sense for one disparate thing to be next to each other.

535
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Here, I cannot...

536
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The chaotic nature of this park is a little...

537
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
What threw me a little for like,

538
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Toy Story Land just kind of becomes Galaxy's Edge.

539
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Grand Avenue, where the brewery is,

540
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
just kind of becomes the other side of Galaxy's Edge.

541
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And then there's Muppets, and then there's Mama Melrose,

542
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and the stunt show.

543
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then more Star Wars.

544
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
More Star Wars.

545
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And then Deanna Jones.

546
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It could use a little bit of place-making,

547
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
because I still like Echo Late.

548
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I still like Gertie and the boat and stuff.

549
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And the entrance.

550
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The entrance is nice.

551
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But yeah, I think they...

552
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And why is it a Chinese theater now?

553
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I mean, I'm not an advocate for taking that down,

554
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
but it's not really justified.

555
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But I think it will be like when Runaway Railway...

556
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yes.

557
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I think it's a new short that is showing there

558
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that you enter the world of.

559
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I see.

560
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You go into, sure.

561
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I think that works.

562
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But it is a little chaotic,

563
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and especially the fact that they kept Pixar Place

564
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and didn't just wrap Toy Story Land around.

565
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Erin, my wife, completely agrees with you.

566
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
She finds this park disjointed and borderline unpleasant.

567
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Now, even though some of the greatest...

568
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Clearly, that line of rides is unbelievable.

569
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Unbelievable.

570
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And still probably my...

571
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Maybe the best rides in Disney World now, all of a sudden,

572
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
when they had almost nothing.

573
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Now they're back up to that could be all the best ones.

574
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
My family's favorite park over the years.

575
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And I think then whenever we get down there next,

576
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
there will be all of these giant attractions open.

577
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And it will once again be a full day park.

578
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And there's a couple good restaurants

579
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you can make a reservation for lunch at.

580
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But yeah, it felt a little chaotic to me,

581
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
maybe partially because I was going off

582
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
of the beautiful transitional elements

583
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
from critter country and frontier land into Galaxy's Edge.

584
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Yes.

585
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We might have made this point that there has been talk of,

586
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
oh, it's actually a better transition

587
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
to Galaxy's Edge in Florida.

588
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And that is not true.

589
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's definitely not true.

590
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Especially, we ended up approaching

591
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
when we went from the Toy Story side,

592
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and that just makes no sense.

593
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No sense.

594
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
They don't, yeah.

595
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The whole part...

596
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
How do they frame it?

597
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's sort of like it's where your favorite stories come to life.

598
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, kind of.

599
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But that's a weird jumpy...

600
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't know.

601
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That one doesn't make sense, but just more so,

602
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
it's just like, just make the transitions somewhat better.

603
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But it's kind of impossible now.

604
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Like Disneyland, I think they care the most about Disneyland,

605
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Disneyland's flow and transitions.

606
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
They are so careful with it,

607
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
especially when it comes to Galaxy's Edge.

608
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Galaxy's Edge was designed for Disneyland,

609
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
specifically for Disneyland,

610
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to fit in with Big Thunder and the rocks

611
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
when you're looking, and to fit in with the green

612
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and along the lake.

613
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's like perfect for Disneyland,

614
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and then they just dumped it into Hollywood Studios

615
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
with some modifications.

616
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Although the footprint, I've noticed, it's weird.

617
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
They didn't really expand the boundaries

618
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
of Disney's Hollywood Studios.

619
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's still this corner.

620
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
If you look at it from above,

621
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
it actually seems geographically like it was built

622
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
for Hollywood Studios.

623
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean, you're probably right.

624
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I probably am overstating that because...

625
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Thematically more so.

626
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Thematically designed,

627
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
and they probably...

628
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm trying to think.

629
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'd have to look at the overhead map

630
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
because they cleared out part of Big Thunder Ranch

631
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and then a bunch of buildings back there.

632
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I guess maybe they took both things into consideration.

633
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I guess, yeah, maybe thematically and flow-wise

634
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
it was designed for Disneyland,

635
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and then also they made sure it was the exact right amount

636
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
of space for Hollywood Studios.

637
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Well, one less entrance in Hollywood Studios.

638
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That's a big physical difference.

639
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Right.

640
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
But as far as just, yeah, space is what...

641
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah, Scott's probably right.

642
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I was wondering how they figured that out,

643
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
how they could make it work for both,

644
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
how they negotiated it.

645
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I guess they probably were like,

646
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
well, we can keep demolishing stuff

647
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and make it as big as the space we have in Hollywood Studios,

648
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
but we have to make sure.

649
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We're very careful with Disneyland

650
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and not to break sight lines

651
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and not to make it stick out

652
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and make it really feel like it's a piece behind Disneyland

653
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
as opposed to what it's intruding on.

654
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's real high wire ends to carve up Disneyland.

655
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It never had to be.

656
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Even Toontown was kind of an addition.

657
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
They didn't have to wait.

658
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That's tucked away.

659
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It didn't have to, and it's a dead end,

661
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
they didn't have to make it flow from the classic thing

662
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
to the classic thing in the same way.

663
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But Hollywood Studios, they don't give a shit about the flow.

664
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah, not really. No, it's there.

665
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's fine.

666
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's fine.

667
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
That's a, dad doesn't go, an average dad doesn't go in

668
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
and go, the flow here doesn't make sense.

669
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm confused.

670
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah, nobody.

671
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And again, so many popular attractions.

672
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah, so as long as everyone likes the rides,

673
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
this is a real nerd critique.

674
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah, to have.

675
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Now, Toy Story Land itself,

676
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I mean, I think that everything's very Technicolor.

677
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It looks beautiful at night.

678
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The lighting is great.

679
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

680
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It feels like the better version of like Bug's Life.

681
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I know Bug's Land, like Bug's Land's a little more even little kid,

682
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
but this feels like a bigger budget version of that,

683
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
where it's like kids are gonna really enjoy this

684
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
and the vibe is fun.

685
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Well, so it's this kind of a cousin to,

686
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I mean, it's called Toy Story Land,

687
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and Toy Story Land exists in other parks.

688
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Right.

689
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It's in Disney Studios Paris, it's in Hong Kong,

690
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Main Disneyland, and then Shanghai Disneyland.

691
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So this is in Magic Kingdom style parks,

692
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
but all of those don't have Slinky Dog Dash.

693
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They have like pretty inessential rides,

694
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
like RC Racer kind of like going up and down in a big curve,

695
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
or they have a Slinky Dog thing that's like a very carnival style.

696
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's like an endless loop that kind of drifts up and down.

697
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You know what I'm talking about?

698
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yeah.

699
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's like a, what are they called?

700
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Slinky Dog Zig Zag Spin is what it's called there.

701
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And either Hong Kong or Shanghai has this alien thing.

702
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The swirling saucers.

703
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Swirling saucers, but there it's called Woody's Roundup,

704
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and it's critters, but it's that same thing

705
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
where there's a front car and then you pivot along the back

706
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and slide back and forth.

707
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And then they're doing that with Baymax in Tokyo.

708
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Is that right?

709
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And it's made here.

710
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's made here, yeah.

711
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I like this genre of ride.

712
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That later ride is a sleeper.

713
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It is really fun.

714
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And a lot of fun.

715
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But it's, I bring all this up to say the previous Toy Story lands

716
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
are kind of garbage.

717
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
They're sort of just thrown in a little hat,

718
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
like pretty inessential rides.

719
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Good job on the art and everything.

720
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And like it has some of the same things,

721
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
like the same Woody leaning up on the side.

722
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Like you're in Woody's backyard, it's the same premise.

723
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Great job art direction-wise, but like the rides are nothing.

724
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So it's nice to see it go into an American park

725
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
with a good solid ride as the fundamental.

726
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah.

727
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And good, kind of fulfilling a need,

728
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
because another thing about Hollywood Studios,

729
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm sure people with kids would say,

730
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
is there is a lot of stuff that everyone can do as a family,

731
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and then there's the thrill rides for the adults and the teens.

732
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But there weren't a ton of kitty, kitty rides,

733
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and you get that.

734
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I never have been in that park, yeah.

735
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah, with the swirling saucers and Toy Story mania.

736
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And if they're a little bigger, the slinky dog.

737
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Very popular still.

738
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Like all this opened in, this expansion opened in 2018.

739
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Obviously Toy Story mania has been open for a little while longer.

740
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I checked, looking right now, I checked this morning.

741
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So slinky dog was down this morning,

742
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
which caused Toy Story mania to go up to a two hour wait.

743
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Flying, swirling saucers was 45 earlier today and 25 now.

744
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Now slinky dog is kind of down to 90 minutes,

745
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and mania is at 45 minutes.

746
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But 90 minutes for a smaller coaster, that is a substantial wait.

747
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yeah, I think you'd still then get on and do it,

748
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and feel like it was worth the wait.

749
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I think it did an hour.

750
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
What did you guys end up at?

751
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
We was the last thing we did.

752
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
This was the, we told a little bit of this story when we were in Florida.

753
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It was Lindsay and I and Jason, and we decided,

754
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
we were going to be able to do two rides.

755
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Slinky was one of them because we were going to get there right before close,

756
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and then Jason and Lindsay did Tower of Terror, and I chose Aerosmith.

757
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I had the rock one last time before we left Orlando.

758
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And then I remember you guys got done very fast.

759
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, we got on that so quick.

760
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And Aerosmith was taking forever.

761
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And I was looking at my phone like, am I not going to get to do the ride?

762
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
This is going to suck.

763
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You told us to just go.

764
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, yeah, I told you to go.

765
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Don't worry about it.

766
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Don't worry.

767
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Don't wait for me.

768
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And then I was racing through Hollywood Studios and I got in line.

769
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I caught up to you.

770
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You caught up.

771
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Well, we might have been winded from walking through just a wall of smoke from that Star Wars

772
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
firework show, just the fireworks were set off so close, just like a wall of carcinogens in the air.

773
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes.

774
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So I think that we got, maybe we didn't do more than 30 minutes.

775
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
No, it was pretty quick.

776
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The only thing that happened for me was that I, by the time we were off the ride and exiting the park,

777
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
it was 1030, just half hour after the park closed.

778
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And exactly when the Skyliner closed at a hard 1030 and I walked up to it at like 1033 and they were turned.

779
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
They turned away a guy with like a double wide stroller.

780
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And so of course they're going to turn me away.

781
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So yeah, hopefully that Skyliners run a little later because those buses run for two hours.

782
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So yeah, we didn't wait very long and the line is very fun and pleasant and outside.

783
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And it's a nice, yeah, I don't know.

784
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Big Jesse, big T Rex.

785
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Big Rex.

786
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah.

787
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Rex is yells like, I'm so high up.

788
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Wall of Sean.

789
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He's very excited.

790
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah, Wall of Sean.

791
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Rex is Wall of Sean.

792
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Very high up yelling.

793
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So you got Wall of Sean.

794
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
It sounded like Wall of Sean.

795
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I think some of these people have sound-alikes for various things,

796
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
but like it's always them for the official shorts that air on ABC and obviously the movies.

797
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
There's an A team and a B team with some of these people.

798
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And Tom Hanks' brother does Woody.

799
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yep.

800
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I think probably does Woody in this land.

801
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I think so.

802
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I think still not Tom Hanks, although they had Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do a lot of Toy Story press from the new land.

803
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes.

804
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Like Toy Story 4, that lined up for them.

805
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I watched some videos of Tim Allen going on the rides, going on mania,

806
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and then trying to explain what it's like to be in the land, but very incoherently.

807
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Just like the level of you reach it, you can then you can give it a touch.

808
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You reach and it's there.

809
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And it's why we, it feels like how we were in the movie of when Buzz went into it.

810
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It feels like when Buzz was on it.

811
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And that's how you touch it.

812
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It was just a real odd rant.

813
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And it's funny how it doesn't make you think about the odd standing of Tim Allen today.

814
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
How in the beginning of this franchise, he's America's favorite.

815
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And now as this ride opens, it's like he's the uncle you have to invite.

816
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah.

817
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You know, I was watching a Jimmy Kimmel interview with Tim Allen a couple of days ago, unrelated to this episode.

818
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And I was like, he's doing some of a stand up and he's like, you're like, yeah, this was like America's sweetheart.

819
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah.

820
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
20 years ago.

821
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And I have some affection for him.

822
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't want to put the guy down.

823
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's very funny.

824
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
ABC canceled his TV show, but then he's still got to be around the family because he's Buzz Lightyear.

825
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And it's back on Fox.

826
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's back on Fox.

827
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Disney doesn't own Fox, the broadcast channel.

828
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
No, Disney doesn't own Fox, the broadcast channel, but they bought the company 20th Century Fox,

829
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
which now is not going to be called 20th Century Fox.

830
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
20th Century Television and Films.

831
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes.

832
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
20th Century Studios, which very everything very confusing.

833
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Dr. Augustine?

834
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Dr. Augustine.

835
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Dr. Augustine, I believe.

836
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Got it.

837
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

838
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
But Tim Allen, I was going to say like, Tim Allen's got that thing where like his biggest gripe is that like he can't say he can't say something inappropriate once in a while.

839
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Needing to say these words.

840
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
What do you need to say?

841
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
What do you think?

842
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
What are you upset about?

843
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The buzz in this land does say some weird stuff, some weird comments.

844
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, I just don't think everything Trump says is so bad.

845
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I just think once in a while, that makes sense.

846
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Just give him a chance.

847
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's only year three.

848
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Respect the office is all I'm saying.

849
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The biggest enemy in the galaxy is the PC police.

850
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Emperor's are emperors or emperors or in comparison to emperors or headwaters.

851
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah.

852
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
College campuses.

853
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I do battle with social justice warriors.

854
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Enemy number one, Greta Thunberg.

855
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Just let me use whatever light bulbs I want.

856
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
She's not as good as Andy or what's the other girl's name?

857
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I hope Andy isn't getting any ideas in college.

858
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What do you ever wonder what Andy's getting up to?

859
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We can't even do a stand up show for Andy at his college.

860
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I'm not chance in it.

861
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm not chance.

862
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Andy's going to be too upset with the language.

863
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm kind of relieved he gave us away.

864
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I don't want to hear that he kissed a boy or something.

865
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Well, now, funny you bring that up because this is one of those theme park lands that exists kind of in a timeless out of time, out of continuity, because Andy, the idea of slinky dog is that

866
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Andy has set up a roller coaster kit in his backyard, a roller coaster kit and then hunt somehow also retrofitted slinky to be the vehicle, which is outrageous.

867
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I had a really good, some people might have had this or you guys might have had it.

868
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
There was a Kinects roller coaster set that was killer.

869
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Oh, yeah.

870
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Great Christmas present.

871
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And there's some Kinects esque pieces in this lot.

872
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Like the turnstiles feel very, those spokes that fan out.

873
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And so this, so as you describe that, I'm very, it flashes me back to my childhood.

874
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah.

875
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So Andy is not off at college yet, or he is.

876
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And like Walt Disney has just developed a quote eccentric hobbies while he was away.

877
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
He comes home every week.

878
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
He's on break.

879
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He's home every week.

880
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
He's one of those.

881
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm building my ideal world in the backyard.

882
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Not like me.

883
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I only came home from college every three weekends.

884
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You got to do that.

885
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I totally left the nest.

886
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You're saying, sorry, I didn't know Andy is maybe Andy is still around in Toy Story land here for sure.

887
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Because it says Andy.

888
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah, it says like Andy built, built this in his backyard.

889
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So he's not given the characters have not been given away yet.

890
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Huh?

891
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Interesting.

892
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But was Forky present when we were there?

893
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
He has been at some point.

894
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
He's kind of it's the entire thing.

895
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Forky.

896
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's what you're talking about on Rise of the Resistance of like, just put a baby Yoda in there somewhere.

897
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah, ultimately nobody really.

898
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Honestly, I don't think I'm so I'm as shocked as I am is because of Star Wars being so rigid and where it is in the timeline.

899
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So now I'm like, well, this doesn't make sense.

900
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Like now I'm upset.

901
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
This is what's the new what's the what's the new who does he give it to?

902
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
What's the girl's name?

903
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Andy, his toys.

904
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
He gives what's her name?

905
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
She's seen three and so long and I haven't seen.

906
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I can't think of her name.

907
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
She goes with Forky to the I've seen the movie.

908
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The movies are great.

909
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I can't think of her name.

910
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh, this is I'm sorry.

911
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
He hands it to her.

912
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
He hands her.

913
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I also like her.

914
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I like the kid.

915
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, she's fun.

916
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And then he gives her the toys and you just start weeping uncontrollably because Jesus Christ.

917
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Still Bonnie.

918
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Bonnie.

919
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Of course.

920
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Still three more powerful to me than four.

921
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
There was the talk that four was going to be more emotional somehow.

922
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And it's not.

923
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
No way.

924
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I don't I'm fine with it existing.

925
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
There's the thought of does it need to?

926
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Is it essential?

927
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I still enjoyed it very much.

928
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
However, if it had stopped at three, I assumed it was stopping at three.

929
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Well, clearly that was the cash.

930
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The cash can't be stopped rolling in, Jason.

931
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah.

932
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Three is unbelievable.

933
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah.

934
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Three is a couple of things that are just devastating.

935
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Four is fine.

936
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It's enjoyable.

937
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I also think four is designed to break it free from the mind.

938
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
To break it free from a pattern to continue it.

939
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Because like you're you're especially the four you're like everyone's like they have to start out in a kid's room.

940
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
They have to like there's a reason that they go somewhere.

941
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
They're confined to like a sort of a set of rules for these movies.

942
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So this is spoiler alert for four.

943
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You call.

944
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I would.

945
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Is that true?

946
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah.

947
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I mean, I don't want to spoil this.

948
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I know you can spoil it.

949
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It's been you shouldn't.

950
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You should enjoy it.

951
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You should see the.

952
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Do you want to put your hands in your fingers?

953
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Sure.

954
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'll put my fingers in my ears.

955
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
All right.

956
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
All right.

957
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And you want to hum like a little bit or something?

958
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Hum a song while so you don't hear any of it.

959
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Well, like in the trailer, I just want that to be a big hum.

960
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
God only knows which plays in the trailer for Toy Story 4 while I tell and I explain what my philosophy is.

961
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Just wave when you're done.

962
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
OK.

963
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Are you ready to sing?

964
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm good.

965
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
How far that he gets?

966
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Not if he's pitchy.

967
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
He's going to be pitchy.

968
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
No offense.

969
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I would be pitchy.

970
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's hard song sing.

971
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
OK.

972
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
All right.

973
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So my philosophy is go for it.

974
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You don't want to sing, do you?

975
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Sing any song you want.

976
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Camp town races.

977
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I thought you were done.

978
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I can't hear.

979
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
No.

980
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Oh, you can't.

981
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
We don't have to sing.

982
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
OK.

983
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Never mind.

984
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
OK.

985
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I've been doing this bit and Jason has been thinking that he hasn't even heard what I've

986
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
been saying about singing.

987
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I don't know the bit.

988
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Take it out of your take your.

989
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I was saying in order to get to the point where you're not going to sing.

990
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm going to sing.

991
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I thought you were talking.

992
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I heard the phrase.

993
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
You covered your ears really well.

994
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah.

995
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
That's the phrase.

996
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
God only knows.

997
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And I didn't know if you meant a song or the aphorism.

998
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
All right.

999
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Man, God knows it's sad to what he does.

1000
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So OK, what he gets thrown into a woodshed.

1001
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
All right.

1002
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
OK.

1003
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Do it fast.

1004
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I just say so that what he leaves the whole group.

1005
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And I'm like, OK, I'm going to sing.

1006
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm going to sing.

1007
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I'm going to sing.

1008
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm going to sing.

1009
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm going to sing.

1010
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm going to sing.

1011
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm going to sing.

1012
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm going to sing.

1013
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm going to sing.

1014
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm going to sing.

1015
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'm going to sing.

1016
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
All right.

1017
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
OK.

1018
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Here.

1019
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Do it fast.

1020
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I just say so that what he leaves the whole group and then he goes off on an adventure

1021
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,600
with a Bo Peep.

1022
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,680
And I think that's the sign to be like now it's going to we can he's in the world.

1023
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,000
He can do a bunch of different stuff.

1024
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,640
We're not just tied down to say I'm happy for him.

1025
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
I'm happy.

1026
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
He's on his own.

1027
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
He found a good girl.

1028
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
And it's I think it's that's great thing.

1029
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,120
That being said, Buzz acts very strangely and for and I don't care for it.

1030
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
Oh, really?

1031
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,120
He does.

1032
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,000
He like deserts Woody when he goes back into the antique shop.

1033
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
We should unfreeze.

1034
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
OK.

1035
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
All right.

1036
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I was pushing too hard.

1037
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I'm really impressed.

1038
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah.

1039
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And I'm glad you didn't lose your oxygen.

1040
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,040
I was also actively not like concentrate concentrate on what you're seeing.

1041
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,640
So you're not not not lip reading.

1042
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,640
Yeah.

1043
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,640
Well, I'm impressed by those abilities.

1044
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,640
I mean, that's like playing dead when Andy comes in.

1045
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,680
Oh, it's only Disney Plus now.

1046
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,440
They should do something to like rile Tim Allen up like with Buzz Lightyear.

1047
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,840
Like Buzz should be gay or he should have to transition or something like just to rile

1048
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
Tim.

1049
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
You don't have to go that far.

1050
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
He can like you're right.

1051
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
You can hold a person.

1052
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
You're right.

1053
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,440
And like he probably was like, now this whole.

1054
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Yeah.

1055
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,440
When they make me drink tea.

1056
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Yeah.

1057
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
Yeah.

1058
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
I don't care.

1059
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Snip that.

1060
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
Can you get a sound alike?

1061
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,640
Or when he becomes a senior buzz and freeze like, yeah, yeah.

1062
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,040
But these these guys know we also include some dialogue about how the senior buzz types

1063
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,280
are hurting the ones who came here the correct way.

1064
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,400
The senior buzzes that earn a living.

1065
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,880
His lazy opinions is bad, lazy opinions that he for sure has.

1066
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,360
When we were Mike, when you and I got on, I feel like your first thing that you clocked

1067
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,480
like in terms of like, oh, that's off was the Jim Varney sound alike.

1068
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,840
Oh, well, he's and he's been doing that for it's the brother.

1069
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,640
Is that right? I think no.

1070
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,200
He's a guy. He's the guy who plays

1071
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,480
Sean Hunter's dad on Boy Meets World.

1072
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,640
Kind of like a guy, a very character actor guy.

1073
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,680
His name is Blake. I don't remember his last name, but a similar type, just like a big,

1074
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,160
you know, a big bear of a guy.

1075
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Oh, yeah. Who I think knew Jim Varney and took over for it.

1076
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,280
And like was I think had a lot of emotion about taking over for him.

1077
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,280
And that was after that.

1078
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,520
That happened in Toy Story 2.

1079
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,800
Yeah. I think.

1080
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,000
No, Varney's still around in two.

1081
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,920
Is it three then when he takes away, I guess?

1082
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,640
OK. I mean, I think I did think it sounded better in the movies.

1083
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,720
And then Sean Kennan is the actor impersonating Robert Goulet at the end.

1084
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,080
OK, because Goulet did Wheezy.

1085
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,040
Wheezy singing voice.

1086
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,960
OK, yeah, the crooner, the surprisingly good crooner voice.

1087
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,560
Blake Clark is the man's name.

1088
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,960
Blake Clark. I think he does a good job.

1089
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,360
I like that they made that decision to try to like instead of just like

1090
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,640
they killed Slinky Dog.

1091
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,240
You've got a lot of this craziness with this cast now where like there's some

1092
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,680
the last one had pre-recorded Rickles lines.

1093
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,720
They like had to find generic

1094
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,080
because they didn't want to deal with, you know, the shoe leather of

1095
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,280
we have to get potato head out.

1096
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,160
Yeah. I mean, there's so many care by four.

1097
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,280
There are so many characters.

1098
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,360
It feels like there are 40 characters in these movies. Yeah.

1099
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,720
And we don't get a lot of time.

1100
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,440
That's a gripe I have with the classics, but they want to like represent everyone.

1101
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,480
So they may have like eight Rickles alts.

1102
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,920
And then they should just after at this point, they'll just start diving

1103
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,320
into his act, I guess.

1104
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,160
Yeah.

1105
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,280
He'll he'll be insulting different races.

1106
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,120
Tim Allen's back in. He's excited now.

1107
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,200
Yeah. But Rickles does it in a way that's, you know, it's with love.

1108
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,280
It's not with.

1109
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,440
And they're all big people here tonight.

1110
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,600
And then, yeah, potato head makes a big speech at the end, how like, you know,

1111
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,320
he makes fun of all people, you know, all different types.

1112
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,760
11 fun.

1113
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,960
Maybe pair up a pair of Bows and Potato Head a little more next time.

1114
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,760
Would you?

1115
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,840
I yeah.

1116
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,280
I think the guy I think I think this linky guy does an admirable job.

1117
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,240
And I you're reminding me of something that I'm amazed I was able to get on this ride

1118
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,880
because there are two major fear spots at play for me.

1119
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,040
One, it is a launch coaster.

1120
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,440
I'll be at a tame one.

1121
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,680
And two, it involves a Jim Varney-esque voice.

1122
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,960
And Jim Varney factors into my most frightening childhood memory.

1123
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,240
Ernest goes to Splash Mountain.

1124
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,480
Of course, we have two big triggers for me.

1125
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,800
Sure. Sorry, Tim.

1126
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,040
I feel very triggered, but I managed to still go classical sense.

1127
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,360
Yes, that's like psychology.

1128
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,840
The actual I don't. Yeah, I think Tim's OK if you're like scared by a ghost or something.

1129
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,560
Yeah, you're that kind of.

1130
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,840
Yeah, he's fine with that.

1131
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,000
Two launches on this, right?

1132
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1133
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,880
Launches top speed, though only 40 miles an hour.

1134
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,280
So like by roller coaster standards, pretty.

1135
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,040
I think if you were a kid and this was your first roller coaster, you'd be like,

1136
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,480
Jack, you would love it.

1137
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,240
It's a great kid's great.

1138
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,600
Yeah, probably a perfect one.

1139
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,200
Yeah. Less rickety than Big Thunder.

1140
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,400
So smooth. You just glide.

1141
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,840
And it's it's really fun.

1142
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,040
Yeah, this is one where I think if you were like the age for it,

1143
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,640
like whatever it is, you know, you're 10 years old and you've never been on one before.

1144
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,400
You would feel so brave to because it like isn't so scary,

1145
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,640
but it still like goes up pretty high and like it's a big like it's got a big footprint,

1146
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,760
like even more so than Big Thunder, which is a good first coaster as well.

1147
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,960
But like you can see this would have scared me as a kid because I could see the track.

1148
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,800
But I would I would have felt so brave.

1149
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,560
Yeah, I'll be honest. I felt so brave doing it, too.

1150
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,800
So that still is in my head.

1151
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1152
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,760
Do you think I feel I'm still my yeah, I still feel brave for launches.

1153
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,680
Yeah, it's really not.

1154
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,400
I and I like that you sort of it's like a miniature story coaster.

1155
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,400
It's like a mini Hagrid's or what it sounds like Guardians is going to be.

1156
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,280
Well, it's not like story throughout, but you have that little like step down.

1157
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,960
It's a little like Big Thunder in that regard, too, that like you have this middle section.

1158
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,880
You have you have a beat in it where you go down, stop and then go through that tunnel

1159
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,480
and get your what are those little fans supposed to be that give you power?

1160
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,600
Oh, yeah. I don't know what you would call that.

1161
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,000
I mean, like on old matchbox tracks like it all looks supposed to be like

1162
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,080
you set up an elaborate old I mean, it says roller coaster kit,

1163
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,920
but it reminds me of like a matchbox or like slot car races.

1164
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,000
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1165
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,520
Yeah. I don't know what you would call those.

1166
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,400
But it's yeah, it's very I guess I didn't I had some hot wheels.

1167
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,720
I was not a big Hot Wheels kid.

1168
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,800
I was not that into cars.

1169
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,760
I was into like Ninja Turtle vehicles that had wheels.

1170
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,440
I had some cars like the toilet taxi.

1171
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,200
It was a vehicle. What?

1172
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,680
There was a there was a vehicle.

1173
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,920
I mean, a turtle toy, I think was for the villains called the toilet taxi.

1174
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,040
And it was just a tiny little like kind of ATV ish kind of thing.

1175
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,200
But the seat was a toilet.

1176
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,440
And now that I'm saying it out loud, I don't really know why it was called like other.

1177
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,720
They just maybe were putting it together with pieces of stuff.

1178
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,480
Well, I don't know that you would like shit into it.

1179
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,880
And that was the fuel for the toilet taxi.

1180
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,000
But now that I've said it, it's canon, I guess.

1181
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,880
Hmm. But neither of you had the toilet tax.

1182
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,400
Now that I see it, I remember the toilet taxi.

1183
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,280
But the toilet is like a secondary like component.

1184
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,040
It also looks more like a dune buggy.

1185
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,240
There was also a talking toilet ghostbusters toy, too, I believe, like a ghost.

1186
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,560
That I remember more.

1187
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,640
Do you remember the ghost toilet, Scott? No.

1188
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,360
Here's the toilet taxi.

1189
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,920
It's a little small, but Leonardo is sitting on a toilet.

1190
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,200
I guess so. The Leonardo guy.

1191
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,080
Oh, it is the good guys. I was wrong. It's not villains.

1192
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,560
It's the good guy.

1193
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,760
So Leonardo would take a.

1194
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,880
That makes a little more sense because they're scrounging.

1195
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,400
You know, right.

1196
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,720
Scrapping. That's what it is.

1197
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,960
Yes. Well, what else?

1198
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,920
What are the also they going to find a seat?

1199
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,720
Mm hmm. The toilet is, I guess, just in the sewer flushed a toilet down the toilet.

1200
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,840
Someone flushed a toilet down a toilet

1201
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,280
and Donatello used it for a vehicle.

1202
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,880
I was low on turtle vehicles, I think.

1203
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,040
But did you have like the blimp or the party wagon?

1204
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,400
I don't know that I had anything.

1205
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,240
I think I had just individual characters and weapons.

1206
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,800
I'm sorry. Yeah.

1207
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,600
Jason, the van party version of the party wagon.

1208
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,080
It's a simple. But that was it.

1209
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,480
I think so. No, I never had the blimp.

1210
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,040
I saw a Batmobile and saw a Batplane and that did it for me.

1211
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
That's good. Was it the Keaton Batman

1212
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,160
bat plane? I had that the batwing.

1213
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,520
And the Batman Returns playset that is his mansion and

1214
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,520
how and Slayer.

1215
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,640
That was you still have that.

1216
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,080
I do. Yes.

1217
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,000
You should display that on a mantle.

1218
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,040
Yeah, maybe I should.

1219
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,560
Yeah, that's that's just resting in my my parents closet.

1220
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,280
The nightmare of a toy and Toy Story.

1221
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,720
Oh, yeah. Nobody's played with it in quite a while.

1222
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,760
Can you imagine what they're saying about you since you've abandoned them?

1223
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,080
Oh, yeah. They must be really bitter. Yeah.

1224
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,160
My toilet taxi is under us in the storage in our garage.

1225
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,000
Oh, so it's around.

1226
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
They feel your presence sometimes.

1227
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,640
They know you're they know you're close.

1228
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,680
You sometimes park it in your parking spot.

1229
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,600
I take the toilet taxi to like taking around.

1230
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,080
Yeah, I will drive up and audition.

1231
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,400
I have a taxi.

1232
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,600
I had a biplane like the Ghostbusters.

1233
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,320
That's a very weird, elaborate stuff.

1234
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,040
And it was like a biplane that Egon rode in.

1235
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,880
I know you're talking about.

1236
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,960
Yeah, it was a big like biplane.

1237
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,400
Like it's wild.

1238
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,600
They had to reach for these because they had to just keep selling stuff.

1239
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,920
So they were just making up whatever.

1240
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,040
Every Batman either came with a catapult or a gun.

1241
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,880
Like that, you know, the famous character who loves projectile weapons.

1242
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,720
Well, yeah. And then there would be like neon purple Batman from a Batman Forever.

1243
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,080
And you'd be like, he didn't wear this costume in the movie.

1244
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,520
And there were like 15 versions of it.

1245
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,120
There's a really funny joke in the Batman Brave and the Bold cartoon

1246
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,720
where it's like he goes into like it's like crazy.

1247
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,520
It's like something loose Batman.

1248
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,840
And he like has a loose like in the Olympics.

1249
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,200
And it's just it's making fun of like all these weird toys

1250
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,240
they've made over the years with him and like weird vehicles.

1251
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,080
So we like uses a luge to get somewhere very fast.

1252
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,240
OK, like that shark repellent, you know, some fine history of that.

1253
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,240
Yes. Slinky Dog.

1254
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,720
I looked up the the manufacturer is a company named Mac Rides.

1255
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,840
It's got a shout out to them. Shout out to them.

1256
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,240
They're out of Germany.

1257
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,200
Their full name has a bunch of German abbreviations.

1258
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,040
I couldn't say, but colloquially called Mac Rides.

1259
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:11,680
They have a very interesting track record of stuff.

1260
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,480
They've made a lot of rides for international parks.

1261
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,720
OK, and they they hear domestically Goofy Skyschool.

1262
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,560
OK, all the dreaded Coast Rider at Nott's.

1263
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,440
It seems like wild mouses are their specialty.

1264
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,280
And Coast Rider, not Coast Rider. Yes, that's right. OK.

1265
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,120
And then Dudley Do-Rites Rips All Falls.

1266
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,800
Storm Force Accelerator. OK.

1267
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,480
So and then like, yeah, a lot of coasters,

1268
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,920
many of them at like Alton Towers or parks in Asia.

1269
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,520
I think we do under acknowledge these kinds of companies

1270
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,240
that actually build the things in a lot of cases.

1271
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,720
Yeah. Yeah. Dudley Do-Rites, I'm impressed.

1272
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,880
Yeah. Yeah. Good lineup, guys.

1273
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,320
Yeah, this is it feels like I'm always curious.

1274
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,800
Like with that, we were talking about that RC car thing,

1275
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,280
which is kind of like a riff on like these bad.

1276
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,040
I don't even know what you call those back and forth carnival rides.

1277
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,120
Yeah. I'm always wondering like what that company is.

1278
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,160
And it's just like off the shelf.

1279
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,520
And then they go, yeah, but can you just build the RC car from Toy Story?

1280
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,160
Around it, I guess that is sort of what it is.

1281
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,960
So yeah, like we'll bring our design elements, but like the engine is.

1282
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,320
Yeah. Yeah.

1283
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,160
Which if you're not if you're doing a ride that isn't reinventing the wheel,

1284
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,880
if it's not a rise to the resistance that has to be built from scratch,

1285
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,200
I guess, why not?

1286
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,440
I mean, that is what they did with Rock and Rollercoaster.

1287
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,440
I assume they weren't just standard limo cars.

1288
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,280
Probably not limos already.

1289
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,960
No, I think there's a level of customization.

1290
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,240
It's interesting with Disney, because when it first opened,

1291
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,640
they had to really get a lot of help.

1292
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,840
They made some stuff themselves, and then they got some like

1293
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,920
amusement park manufacturing third parties.

1294
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,560
And then with Mapo, that was a machine show.

1295
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,080
They would make so much of themselves.

1296
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,320
But eventually it just made more sense

1297
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,360
as the industry grew to also use some third party companies to like,

1298
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,920
all right, we'll design the rollercoaster and then you build the track

1299
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
and all this stuff.

1300
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,840
You're Howard Garner Holt, who did not do Hagrid's.

1301
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,640
They like they did the vehicle like

1302
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,560
nightmares them and cars is them that

1303
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,960
they're like amending rides where like it's probably too much workload

1304
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,000
for Disney to do it all from scratch. Yeah.

1305
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,240
So they can take some of the weight off.

1306
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,320
Here's talking about that RC thing.

1307
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,080
I was thinking about this how I don't think there is a franchise,

1308
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,960
probably in Disney, probably anywhere that has more rides based on it

1309
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,160
than Toy Story. Yeah, for sure.

1310
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,960
There's the major ones.

1311
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,800
It is such a in Ogden Augustine world.

1312
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,880
There is so much convolutedness with this.

1313
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,800
So the Slinky Dog Dash, which is different than Slinky Dog Zig Zag Spin.

1314
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,640
There's Toy Story Midway Mania, but that is often called Toy Story Mania.

1315
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,520
So Jack Jack's Cookie Num Num versus Num Num Cookie.

1316
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,080
Sometimes it's a plain num num. Yeah.

1317
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:05,400
Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters is also elsewhere called Buzz Lightyear's

1318
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,920
Space Rangers Spin and is also elsewhere called Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast.

1319
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,400
Then there's Jesse's Critter Carousel,

1320
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,160
RC Racer in one of the other ones is Rex's Racer.

1321
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,880
And then Toy Story Parachute Drop is a parachute.

1322
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,880
I'm sorry, Toy Soldier Parachute Drop, not Toy Story Parachute Drop.

1323
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,000
And as I said, Woody's Roundup and Alien

1324
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,640
Swirling Saucers are the same ride mechanism, but they have different themes

1325
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,480
and names. There are so many.

1326
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:39,520
It is a very spread out convoluted ride franchise.

1327
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,680
How many are how many are those?

1328
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,560
That is one to if I'm not counting renames, one, two, three, four, five, six,

1329
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,200
seven, eight, nine, nine. OK.

1330
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,040
Would you count Woody's Roundup and Alien Swirling Saucers as the same ride?

1331
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,600
Mate? No. OK.

1332
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,560
Then it's like 10. I think.

1333
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,280
How many I'm trying to think how many Batman related

1334
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,600
coasters are there? That's too tough.

1335
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,360
But that has to that might be that might be at least maybe there are

1336
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:15,560
have been more Batman rides than Toy Story, but all so spread out everywhere.

1337
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,360
All over the place. We do have to hit that topic one day.

1338
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,520
That's a lot to tackle.

1339
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,440
But Batman, the rides, the episode, not Batman, the ride, but all of the ride.

1340
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,600
And then the rides is a very fun.

1341
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,160
That's that's how I've had it in my head for a while. Yeah.

1342
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,960
And yet are any of them good?

1343
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,880
Is one of them good?

1344
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,680
Well, by 1992 standards, that queue and the coaster.

1345
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,480
We're very good.

1346
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,960
I think it's pretty solid, solid, suspended

1347
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,120
or like your feet hanging kind of coaster.

1348
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,680
Although I don't know if they're all that.

1349
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,400
You know, I liked Ridler's revenge, which you would.

1350
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,520
Are we counting Ridler in Batman?

1351
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,120
Yeah. Right. Because it's one of his. Yeah.

1352
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,280
Yeah. So I liked Ridler's revenge.

1353
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,200
I thought that was fun. Mm hmm.

1354
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,280
So, you know, they're fine.

1355
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,040
There's nothing there's nothing.

1356
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,240
And you count Justice League in there.

1357
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,040
I would. Well, yeah, I would count that.

1358
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,680
I and I like that funhouse they just put in where the Jared Leto

1359
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,920
Joker throws used condoms at you.

1360
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,760
You have to avoid them.

1361
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,000
That was actually getting served for that.

1362
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,640
He self produced that on his own.

1363
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,000
It was him in there. Oh, yeah, it was him on his cult.

1364
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,880
His weird like 30 Seconds to Mars cult island.

1365
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,480
And if you go up to guest services and you complain, they just.

1366
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,000
Well, it's part of his process.

1367
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,680
You know, it's just what he has to do.

1368
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,040
Did you not see the way for her?

1369
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,080
Did you know that you passed by on the way in?

1370
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,520
That's just that's how he works.

1371
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,800
Acknowledge that any semen on your person is part of a process.

1372
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,520
There should be a funhouse with all the different jokers

1373
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,040
and all of their different processes for getting into character.

1374
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,000
Don't let don't let Joaquin kick you.

1375
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,160
Joaquin will kick and punch and yeah.

1376
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,160
Jared, the condoms and rats like a dead rat he gave to Margot Robbie, I think.

1377
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,320
That was a thing he did.

1378
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,120
And then Jack will just like do a bunch of cocaine and watch a Lakers game.

1379
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,000
And then that's how he gets in character for the Joker.

1380
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,000
Cesar Ramirez process, painting his mustache, painting the mustache

1381
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,040
as a cocktail while he's doing it.

1382
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,280
Very relaxed.

1383
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,880
Just remember to have fun.

1384
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,920
It's so much fun, he says.

1385
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,520
There's a great interview with him.

1386
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,760
It's on Twitter where he's in like a white undershirt and he's got the makeup on.

1387
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,640
And there's just like a very old like a lady like that.

1388
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,080
She's not old, but like an old time reporter and like, oh, you're in this Batman.

1389
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,880
And he's like, yes, it's a wonderful time.

1390
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,560
We enjoy it. It's fun to play the Joker.

1391
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,080
That's great.

1392
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,160
And she's like, oh, that's so you look like you're having so much.

1393
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,640
We're having so much fun.

1394
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,080
Everything's wonderful.

1395
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,080
And you cut to the rap in a condom on the set of.

1396
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,240
I know Suicide Squad.

1397
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,680
Well, also you cut to a different room at these Batman 66 set

1398
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,560
where you had sent me the article of like producers tried to get Burt Ward

1399
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,600
to take penis shrinking pills.

1400
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,680
I did not. Anthony Geo sent that to you.

1401
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,200
Sorry, Anthony Geo sent it to us.

1402
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,600
They tried to wait.

1403
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,240
Why don't they just I heard they like tried to tape him down.

1404
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,960
They tried to shrink his dick.

1405
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,960
There's also Burt Ward.

1406
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,440
He has a book that did with Grayson's dick.

1407
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,440
Yeah, he has a book about his exploits as Robin.

1408
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,400
And I've read all of it.

1409
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,680
But I remember like it was in our house growing up for some reason.

1410
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,560
And it's a picture of his dick on the cover, essentially.

1411
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,040
And I was like, I like knew I knew was wrong.

1412
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,880
What does that mean?

1413
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,120
Well, like picture of the underwear.

1414
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,760
It wasn't as naked. Yes, that's not.

1415
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,240
Yeah, that's essentially that's what I'm saying.

1416
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,840
Like it's a close up of like the underwear.

1417
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,040
It's a photograph.

1418
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,720
Yeah, on him.

1419
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,120
I'm saying that's not so far from the way I described it.

1420
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,680
I'm just saying like you're just you're as offended by a bulge

1421
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,480
as you would be by a well, a close up bulge.

1422
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,960
Yes. If that's what the what they're directing my eye line to.

1423
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,360
What you're saying is Batman 66 land would be multiple different levels

1424
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,080
of disturbing. Yeah.

1425
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,440
But he talks about in that book about like,

1426
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,320
I feel like he's bragging about how much like sex he had.

1427
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,640
And then he's like talking about how his balls swelled up

1428
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,720
to the size of like grapefruits like because of being restricted.

1429
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,440
No, because of like too much activity, because of two,

1430
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,200
because he was having too much sex.

1431
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,480
He's all I'm saying is that like once in a while he just starts

1432
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,800
talking about like his dick and balls on the set of Batman in bizarre ways.

1433
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,760
And he's at it again.

1434
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,200
Chris O'Donnell doesn't do the stuff like this.

1435
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,760
He's a respectable.

1436
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,520
Yes. You know, he shows up, gets the work done, goes home, you know.

1437
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,120
So there's certain episodes where they had to like strategically

1438
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:42,560
place thugs to block the two hulking grapefruits.

1439
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,760
Right. Coming out of those tights.

1440
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,200
They well, and Adam West talked about stuffing.

1441
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,680
He put a sock in there.

1442
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,120
He had to build up. Yeah.

1443
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,720
Oh, no. Poor Adam.

1444
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,640
So but Bert, I purple word.

1445
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,720
Maybe he's just he's weaving a tale.

1446
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,640
I don't know. I'm suspicious is all I'm saying.

1447
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,160
But then there's that great story of Adam West and Frank Gorshin going to an orgy.

1448
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,760
Well, there's a look that up.

1449
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,880
Oh, my God.

1450
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,960
They they're the version like Adam West or Frank Gorshin tells is just like,

1451
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,640
and we went in when we were being silly and we left.

1452
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,840
I mean, of course, that's not the way that ends.

1453
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,280
It's like, oh, my God, we're in an orgy with Batman and the Riddler.

1454
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,360
And they're participating. That's what I'm assuming.

1455
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,880
In costume.

1456
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,400
I don't believe they were in costume, but I'd like to imagine they were.

1457
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,320
Now he's somebody's going down on

1458
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,320
John Hannibal that he's doing the

1459
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,320
that's easy.

1460
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,280
Yeah. Yep. Yep.

1461
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,800
Anyway, oh, my.

1462
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
This episode is not staying on track.

1463
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,160
Yeah. For this being about a children's ride, it's had a lot of Batman sex in it.

1464
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,880
And funny that you say that.

1465
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,640
So there's one restaurant back in Toy Story Land, Woody's Lunchbox.

1466
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,120
And they sell a couple of different kinds of essentially like grilled cheese,

1467
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,600
tater tots, tomato soup.

1468
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,480
They also have three different beers on tap.

1469
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,720
Like everything is lunch, like as if Woody was getting it for lunch,

1470
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,000
including they sell a snack that's like a package of three of those little

1471
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,720
Babel cheese wheels.

1472
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,480
And then also you can get Blue Moon or Angry Orchard.

1473
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,760
Something for dad.

1474
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,560
I see no issue here.

1475
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,240
Something for dad.

1476
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,600
I just think it's very funny that they're like.

1477
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,560
Well, what's funny, I think about it is just that it's called like Woody.

1478
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,000
It's Woody's Lunchbox, right?

1479
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,280
It is Woody's Lunchbox.

1480
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,760
But it's oh, I guess Woody is kind of.

1481
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,720
Because Woody, if it was Andy's lunchbox and Andy was.

1482
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,080
Is it Andy's lunch?

1483
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:32,480
I don't know.

1484
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,000
Now that I got to double check this.

1485
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,320
Because if you know, if Andy is sneaking on Angry Orchard, that's funny.

1486
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:43,560
Because you can get I get a vodka, like a vodka drink at the Cozy Cone.

1487
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,760
And Cars is a children's movie.

1488
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,000
And I think you can get a beer at Flo's.

1489
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,080
But the difference is if it's like tied to a character,

1490
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,560
if it's like a Mater Scotch, it is Woody's lunchbox.

1491
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,560
That's the funny thing.

1492
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,320
If it's like have a have a little shot with Mater.

1493
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,240
This is what Mater likes to drink.

1494
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,000
Or it's like called this like motor oil or is carburetor fluid.

1495
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,720
There have to be places you can get alcohol that are named after.

1496
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,480
Yeah, I'm trying to think of other kids.

1497
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,800
And the cars and the and Woody are grown ups.

1498
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,360
Woody is what he could be.

1499
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,560
I think Woody is like 70 years old.

1500
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,080
Woody is very old. That's true.

1501
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,280
And the cars are adult cars.

1502
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,600
So you're right. They can have alcohol.

1503
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,960
I mean, there's an implication that Bonnie Hunt's character in Cars

1504
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,400
has had a bit of an adventurous youth because they cut to her tramp stamp.

1505
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,600
It's a point. Oh, I didn't know that.

1506
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,680
A gag where she has like, oh, is that Holly Shiftwell?

1507
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,960
No, no, that's a different character.

1508
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,840
That's the spy.

1509
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,080
Now, she's probably done some unspeakable things

1510
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,120
because what required in the world of espionage.

1511
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,760
Right. Holly Shiftwell is in Cars two.

1512
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,240
And then who is who is Bonnie Hunt in Cars one?

1513
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,840
Is she I want to say Sally. Is that wrong?

1514
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,240
I can't think of Bonnie Hunt's character's name.

1515
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,040
She doesn't have a pun.

1516
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,800
If she has Sally, that feels like a Helen to me.

1517
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,480
But I don't know that to be the fact.

1518
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,080
Yeah. Yeah, I think you're right.

1519
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,040
Given that all of the cars have that it's Lightning McQueen.

1520
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,320
It is Sally. But Sally Carrera.

1521
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,920
She does have a last name. Oh, Carrera.

1522
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,720
OK. All right.

1523
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,840
That was such genuine delight.

1524
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,200
You giggled like for a good solid three seconds.

1525
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,960
I just read it.

1526
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,640
Oh, and poor George Carlin is film or George Carlin.

1527
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,840
Oh, well, that's you know, he didn't choose that name.

1528
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,920
That's true. He didn't.

1529
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,280
So Carlson, the light bulb.

1530
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,080
Never thought about that.

1531
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,280
I have not thought about the fact that I could be a Cars character.

1532
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,560
You're a pun. Yeah.

1533
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,080
Or or if like, or if they like Flintstone to people's names,

1534
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,680
I wouldn't have to even like if they cars, if cars in people's names

1535
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,360
was just like Flintstone in people's name, was you but rock or stone?

1536
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,680
They wouldn't have to do that for me. Yeah. Yeah.

1537
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,560
You're already like Carl. Car Olson.

1538
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,560
Olson. They really backed themselves in a corner with that Flintstones rock thing.

1539
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,520
Rock and stone, you mean? Yeah.

1540
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,880
Like Sylvester Stallone stone, which they say in one of like

1541
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,760
the Hollywood one. Yeah.

1542
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,960
They call him Sylvester Stallone stone.

1543
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,760
They just they just added one.

1544
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,040
Not Sylvester Stone Lone.

1545
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,000
Stone. I guess not Stoll Stone.

1546
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,760
Yeah. Yeah. Stoll Stone Lone.

1547
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,680
Stone Lone.

1548
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,640
I mean, yeah, like it kind of hit the ears weird at first, but now I'm coming around.

1549
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,160
I don't know. It's hard. It's hard.

1550
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,480
Stone Lone. Yeah.

1551
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,120
It seems like a fun puzzle, but it could get infuriating at a certain point.

1552
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,600
That's well. It was tough days in the Flintstones writers room. Sure.

1553
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,000
Long hours. A lot of sketch for them.

1554
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,560
Yeah. Pack a day. Pack a day writers room.

1555
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,240
Yeah. There was no alcohol in Bugsland, obviously.

1556
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,360
That was for children.

1557
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,840
There wasn't really a restaurant there, though.

1558
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,800
So I bet if there was a restaurant, you could have gotten a little

1559
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,520
you know, something. Tons in Pixar Pier.

1560
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,080
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

1561
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,400
And Paradise Gardens Pier.

1562
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,240
Paradise Gardens.

1563
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,640
No, Paradise Gardens Park next to Pixar.

1564
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,000
Pixar Place. The Paradise Pier Hotel. Yeah.

1565
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,160
They had a thing.

1566
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,640
Uh huh. Yeah.

1567
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,440
Slinky dog. What else?

1568
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:25,000
What else? I like the sound cues, the slinky sounds like when you're going.

1569
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,240
Sure. Yeah.

1570
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,960
And you're sitting in the body like you see the rings of it.

1571
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,480
You're sitting in the middle of his body.

1572
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,840
I yeah, that's great.

1573
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,760
I do like all the big boxes.

1574
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,760
They really they went.

1575
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,800
They got a very like authentic looking boxes, like and they made like facsimiles

1576
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,400
of like other companies and like games, a lot like board game stuff.

1577
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,800
And then right when you get on the start, I think is where you see

1578
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,400
Rex's box, which I really enjoy.

1579
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,840
Oh, where Rex came from?

1580
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,640
It's and it's Tyrannosaurus Rex.

1581
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,560
And it's like he's great.

1582
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,120
It's very painterly and he looks like scary.

1583
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:01,960
Oh, yeah.

1584
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,840
And there's an Al's Toy Barn tag.

1585
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,400
That's nice, which is real fun, which has the date of the movie

1586
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,440
when it came out, I believe on it.

1587
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,920
Like that.

1588
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,640
And then like there's a little there's a nod to like they call it's a fake company

1589
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,520
called like Borealis who made him.

1590
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,800
And then it's also available from Borealis Triceratops.

1591
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,640
And one of the videos I was watching was like, is that mean that's Trixie

1592
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,160
also made by the same company?

1593
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,480
Probably. Probably.

1594
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,680
I really like that idea that she's part of the same line.

1595
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,160
Line of dinosaur toys.

1596
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,960
That was clever, I thought.

1597
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,920
And then I did not know this on the box.

1598
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,520
Tyrannosaurus means tyrant lizard in ancient Greek and Rex means king in Latin.

1599
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,200
You didn't know those things?

1600
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,240
I did not know those dinosaur facts from like age six.

1601
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,120
No.

1602
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:54,400
Jason, you know, I knew I knew the king part because of Oedipus Rex.

1603
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,360
Of course.

1604
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,720
I love the story of Oedipus.

1605
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,720
This is where I just really into Oedipus.

1606
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,640
Uh oh.

1607
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,480
A Freudian slip about Oedipus.

1608
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:14,680
There's a great little nod to the dog they adopt at the end of Toy Story 1.

1609
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,520
His little tag is hanging.

1610
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,240
Oh, that's good. Buster.

1611
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,320
And it has their address on it.

1612
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,520
Which is very cute.

1613
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,000
Oh, I like a lot of the boxes provide shade for much of the queue.

1614
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,120
That's a good practical thing because you're going to be waiting a while.

1615
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,280
You know, it's been a complaint around there is shade.

1616
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1617
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,840
I mean, they could have enclosed it a little more, but.

1618
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,840
I like the boxes.

1619
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,560
A thing I'll say about the land itself is that it does remind me of the

1620
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,000
Honey I Shrunk the Kids land.

1621
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah.

1622
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,360
Because it's got big stuff.

1623
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,000
Big things, big toys.

1624
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So, but there's no.

1625
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
You're in a yard.

1626
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,480
You're in a yard, but there's no like big thing to slide down or anything.

1627
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,480
No.

1628
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,480
A playground would be fun.

1629
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,480
Like a playground.

1630
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,880
I wonder if they're like not doing that anymore for legal purposes.

1631
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,880
Probably right.

1632
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,880
Good point.

1633
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,880
Yeah.

1634
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,880
Because yeah.

1635
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:11,320
Although they still have the like Grizzly Challenge trail up in California Adventure.

1636
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,480
You think that's just a twisted ankle waiting to happen.

1637
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,480
Yeah.

1638
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,480
Yeah.

1639
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,480
There's like a slide thing.

1640
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,520
I think if it's already there, it's grandfathered in.

1641
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,480
They wouldn't build one now.

1642
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:29,880
I like I tend to not want to do the topic microparsing, but if you would have me, seven-year-old

1643
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:36,600
as a guest on the show, I would have demanded to do Honey, I Shrunk the Kids playground

1644
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,080
separate from the Kodak slide.

1645
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,200
I would have said that's its own episode.

1646
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:46,520
Because to me at that time, maybe my favorite attraction in Disney World.

1647
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,080
I loved the Kodak slide.

1648
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,080
I like that.

1649
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,320
I yeah.

1650
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,560
The Kodak slide is very, it looms large.

1651
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,560
Yeah.

1652
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,160
And there were big bugs that I did not care for.

1653
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,160
That's gross.

1654
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,560
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids scared the shit out of me.

1655
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,560
I never saw it.

1656
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,560
The idea of a big bee.

1657
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,560
The big bee.

1658
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,400
I have never seen the first one.

1659
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,400
Whoa.

1660
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,920
Oh, we talk about plus this up.

1661
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,320
We'll figure out what we're doing for that soon.

1662
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,960
But the yeah, that they throw it on.

1663
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,960
It's fun.

1664
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,960
I'm sure it is.

1665
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,960
I saw the second one.

1666
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,040
I've seen the kid theaters.

1667
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:23,200
I remember the first one I liked and I liked all the tricks, but I also found the idea

1668
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,800
of like being trapped in somewhere familiar.

1669
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,160
We're trapped in the yard and we're so little like I was like, oh, I don't know.

1670
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,160
Disturbing.

1671
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,160
Oh yeah, I was disturbed by it.

1672
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,160
Disturbing.

1673
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,160
Yeah.

1674
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,960
But yeah, my point with Toy Story Land is like it does feel like a place you would want

1675
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,200
to play in that way in the way that they had it with the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids land.

1676
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,800
And this one even is, you know, it's less scary for me.

1677
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,080
So I bet kids are loving this thing.

1678
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,400
I really like just the texture.

1679
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,040
I think the slinky car is pretty instantly classic.

1680
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,000
I think it's as sharp as Dumbo.

1681
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,200
I don't know.

1682
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:01,680
Disney just has like good shine and good polish and Slinky is just such an appealing character

1683
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:07,080
to see and big and shiny and yes, I really nice.

1684
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:13,360
I like that they've gone deeper with the characters like RC gets his own ride.

1685
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:17,040
Like it does feel like you generally like you get.

1686
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,960
I'm trying to think of an example with like it seems like Woody and Buzz.

1687
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,160
That's the standard.

1688
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,240
But like Slinky, what is he?

1689
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,240
The seventh character?

1690
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,680
Like what would you say?

1691
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,440
Seventh build character.

1692
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,600
So you would think like, like, so I like, I like that in addition, like where it's like,

1693
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,520
yeah, let's get these other characters in here.

1694
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Yeah.

1695
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:40,840
They have a slinky ride that Rickles Mr. Potato Head is such a major part, like such a neat

1696
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:46,280
part of Toy Story mania that there's a Jesse carousel now that there's a there's been a

1697
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,480
buzz ride for a very long time.

1698
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,200
I like that it's it's a testament to the franchise that there's so many different kind of sets

1699
01:16:53,200 --> 01:17:00,800
sectors of it, just areas of the of the movies that like there's no overlap almost between

1700
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,840
Space Rangers spin and Toy Story mania and Slinky Dog Dish.

1701
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,480
And of course, there is one character that I do believe deserves his own ride.

1702
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,480
Friend of the show.

1703
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,320
Buttercup.

1704
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,560
The unicorn.

1705
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,600
Mr. Jeff Garland should have his own ride somewhere in one of these parks.

1706
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,600
We're doing it.

1707
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,760
We're pitching it. You and me, Mike.

1708
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,400
That's true. I'm calling Iger right now.

1709
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,000
And he does from what you've said.

1710
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
That's kind of the spirit.

1711
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,720
Yes, that is I could see that happening.

1712
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,600
And then, you know, then it wouldn't happen.

1713
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,480
Then it would go. You'd be like, hey, what are we going to pitch, right?

1714
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,080
Yes. Captain. And then you're just weird.

1715
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,920
You're like, wait, we met Iger or whatever.

1716
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,400
OK, I think whatever happened.

1717
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,840
And you never call me back.

1718
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,240
I just got asked about the picture with a little girl running away.

1719
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,640
He wasn't wild about it.

1720
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,160
Yeah, I hear if you get the Disney dining plan because it's just so much food,

1721
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,520
it fills you up.

1722
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,040
That's kind of like the Captain from Wally, right?

1723
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,120
Right. That was Jeff too, right?

1724
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,920
That was Jeff too. Yeah, OK.

1725
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,400
That is kind of like that.

1726
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,120
Too much food. I hear it's too much.

1727
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:18,920
I've never done it.

1728
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,200
Too many family dinners.

1729
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,720
It's not branded that way, though.

1730
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:25,880
It's not brand. They probably immediately get flack for it.

1731
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,040
I would assume the Wally ride is tough to tackle.

1732
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1733
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,640
It's either you're in a landfill or you're on a ship full of people in chairs.

1734
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,080
Yeah. But I always had it pegged as something to do in

1735
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,720
carousel progress, people mover.

1736
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,040
I don't think that's what it would be now, but I think I had hopes at the time.

1737
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,360
Maybe there's some Wally attraction to plug in there.

1738
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,920
Sure. I think there's a better Incredibles attraction, too.

1739
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:57,080
Like a more like the more than I like in Credit Coaster,

1740
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,240
but obviously retrofitted and.

1741
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,640
Yeah. Oh, my gosh. There is a crazy.

1742
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,280
I mean, there have been rumors.

1743
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,560
There was rumors of like a Kuka arm style Incredibles ride.

1744
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,880
With like I assume it's like superhero training.

1745
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:15,520
The way you would the way I would do it is I would rip off like X-Men Danger Room

1746
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,840
and put like, you know, the Danger Room is basically like the holodeck on Star

1747
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:25,000
Trek and you would they'd go through, you know, real robots and holograms to train.

1748
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,520
And you would like to do something like that with Incredibles.

1749
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,400
When like you could do a bunch of crazy stuff. Sure.

1750
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,280
But yeah, of course, Incredibles is so yeah, ripe for a crazy.

1751
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,640
The first islands that you go to are super cool.

1752
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:43,840
I think I think finding Nemo honestly deserves something better.

1753
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,560
I've heard that that that crush coaster in Paris seems kind of neat.

1754
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,040
But, you know, subs and sea cabs.

1755
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,160
These are not the finest attractions that ever were.

1756
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,240
Yeah, I have to give Igor credit because like he he says, like

1757
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,000
when he was like in Hong Kong and watching all the parades

1758
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,720
and when he took over the company, like he's like, oh, a lot of these characters

1759
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:10,120
are Pixar and the people are really getting excited for Pixar movies

1760
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,040
as opposed to our old movies.

1761
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,720
So that kind of like really dominated the early 2000s and late 90s.

1762
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,680
I think the Toy Story characters too popular internationally

1763
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:23,040
because everywhere plays with toys and it's very bright and colorful.

1764
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,400
And they should do like a Tokyo Disney

1765
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,040
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea type ride.

1766
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,680
Yes, because 20,000.

1767
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,480
I'm not truly underwater.

1768
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:39,200
Yeah, because the difference of 20,000 Leagues in Tokyo is that

1769
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,600
it's not actually under the water.

1770
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,800
It's just like on a it's kind of like Peter Pan, but it makes it look

1771
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,200
like you're underwater and there's like a like there's a thing like a layer,

1772
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,880
like a a little layer with water in the screen.

1773
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,400
Some bubbles that shoot up.

1774
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,760
Bubbles. Yes, that fully.

1775
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,120
And then, yeah, you just have stuff looking like it's floating

1776
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,040
and you could do a real cool Nemo thing that way.

1777
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,080
Well, the other the Disney Sea one, Nemo Sea Rider, and that one.

1778
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,840
That's it's all right.

1779
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,160
It's fine. Didn't make didn't make my top 10.

1780
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,480
No, but it's also it's Tokyo Disney.

1781
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,840
There's it's very crowded.

1782
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,440
It was better than I thought it would be, though.

1783
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,880
I was like, well, no one's talked about this.

1784
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,040
So must be kind of a minor one.

1785
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,000
I was like, oh, that's fun. Yeah. Yeah.

1786
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,280
Like that's still pretty good.

1787
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,640
Yeah. Like in the bottom 20.

1788
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,000
And it's still pretty good. Yeah.

1789
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,240
This twice or land in Florida is also getting a restaurant.

1790
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,040
It's getting the roundup rodeo barbecue restaurant. Oh, yeah.

1791
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:37,760
I really only has that lunch and a Woody's lunchbox stand.

1792
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,640
So it's like it's filthy beer.

1793
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,360
This is a table service barbecue.

1794
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,120
I think it's very funny, the timing of like they're going to open this

1795
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,000
as well as the Regal Eagle barbecue at Epcot.

1796
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Disney, I think, discovering like, well, if you make meat in bulk

1797
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
and you can make all the sides in bulk and, you know, per portion,

1798
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,840
it's very cheap and you can sell it.

1799
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,200
You know, we have not talked about the same, the eagle regal eagle,

1800
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:10,240
which is Sam Eagle's barbecue restaurant, apparently in the America area of Epcot.

1801
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,320
Yeah, there's a new, yeah, themed after Sam,

1802
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,240
the patriotic eagle character from the Muppets,

1803
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,480
which this was announced and most people were pretty psyched on it

1804
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:25,000
because any more Muppet presence is great.

1805
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,400
Yeah. And then other people were like, oh, OK, so we're jamming more IP

1806
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,360
into the parks, huh?

1807
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,520
So what? It's guardians over here and Muppets over here.

1808
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,720
This doesn't make any sense.

1809
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,640
It's against the spirit of old Epcot.

1810
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,960
And I'd just like to say, if you were mad about

1811
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:42,560
Sam the Eagle vaguely themed barbecue restaurant,

1812
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,400
you're not allowed to listen to the show anymore.

1813
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,640
Oh, my gosh. You're gone.

1814
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,720
Get in the bag. You're out.

1815
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:49,960
Jason is in the head.

1816
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,280
Is the patron is drained?

1817
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,680
Oh, no, no, no.

1818
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,760
That was the linchpin.

1819
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,040
How will I pay for this delicious looking?

1820
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:00,120
Actually, this looks really like grilled sourdough sandwiches.

1821
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:04,800
Jason is swirling the toilet taxi in his like fan is dreaded.

1822
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,480
I just bought a toilet taxi.

1823
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,920
That statement would topple the Jenga tower of the entire Patria.

1824
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,400
I don't know. I just I don't think it is because I think our audience is nice

1825
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,040
and fun. I know I saw people I don't know.

1826
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,320
You know, there's the there's the Disney fan.

1827
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,960
Oh, dark web.

1828
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,120
It's not the dark web because it's easy to find.

1829
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:27,080
It's the dark web in that they are all very unhappy all the time.

1830
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,640
And I definitely noticed some people.

1831
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:35,200
There's some like there's there's some Epcot purism that's really nutty to me.

1832
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:35,960
I don't know how.

1833
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:40,920
How is it the future park if you don't ever change it in any way ever, ever?

1834
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,880
Or anything? Well, I mean, look, there's groups, Facebook groups,

1835
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,160
other groups, message boards with a lot of people.

1836
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,280
We still are.

1837
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,560
We have a lot of listeners, but these places have been around for decades

1838
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,880
and a lot of people frequent them.

1839
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,640
So you're going to get some people that literally wanted exactly

1840
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,160
how it was when they went 30 years ago.

1841
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,920
But there's videos and pictures to enjoy.

1842
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,880
Big thing.

1843
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,480
Thinking about the context of it, though, is that Epcot will like World Showcase.

1844
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,160
Everyone likes the food.

1845
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,480
There's something for everyone.

1846
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,520
Everyone goes to Epcot to eat, except the American Pavilion.

1847
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,800
They've had a few different concepts there.

1848
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,400
Famously, like everyone's like, I don't need the American Pavilion.

1849
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,800
I mean, they just a few years ago tried like food from around America.

1850
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,400
But trying to make regional staples like Philly

1851
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,720
cheesesteaks or Maryland style crab cakes,

1852
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:41,040
notoriously difficult that you stick the landing on a couple of them,

1853
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,600
let alone all of them.

1854
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,680
Barbecue uniquely American.

1855
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,840
I think they're even going to try like a vinegar based sauce, mustard sauce,

1856
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,600
ketchup based, like, you know, all the different kinds of barbecue.

1857
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,880
That's still like I feel like their chances of success is higher.

1858
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:00,200
And Sam the Eagle is a very funny character.

1859
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:05,720
That's a very having a restaurant, a restaurant in a very like kind of stodgy

1860
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,720
pavilion as it is kind of serious.

1861
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,320
And I'm sure it's not going to they're not going to have the budget to theme it

1862
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:15,120
like crazy. It's going to be the ultimate idea of what that could be.

1863
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,320
I looked at it. I found it.

1864
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,120
I found the tweet.

1865
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:21,560
Somebody said, you can't hate frozen in Norway and love Muppets in American Adventure.

1866
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,160
Get absolutely bent.

1867
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,560
This is stupid as shit.

1868
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:27,440
Wow. I don't think.

1869
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:32,120
Why would an eagle on a crest of a barbecue restaurant in an amusement park

1870
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,080
make you that mad?

1871
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,680
That is that is a strong take. Yeah.

1872
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,440
Love that passion, brother.

1873
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,240
Love that for you.

1874
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:43,480
Put it into our politics or the election.

1875
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,880
Yeah, I'd be afraid where it would lead in our politics.

1876
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,720
Maybe so.

1877
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,480
The that's it.

1878
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,120
I'm reeling from that.

1879
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,840
Right. That's what I'm talking about.

1880
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,360
Yeah, I was going to say it's going to be as lightly themed as pizza riso.

1881
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,640
I mean, let's be honest.

1882
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,040
Yeah, it's not going to be I've just opened up another can of worms.

1883
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,720
Uh oh.

1884
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,640
Maybe I read it to something.

1885
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,800
I don't want to go. I don't want to go back.

1886
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,760
I don't want to go to bed pizza.

1887
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,720
I don't want to.

1888
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,960
You know what? I will quote the sector keeper.

1889
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,160
Sometimes it feels good to be.

1890
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,560
But yeah, it's going to be lightly themed, whatever.

1891
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,080
Come on.

1892
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:24,600
You know what I like the motto, the post about the regal eagle smokehouse.

1893
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,320
Sam Centennial cook off colon a salute to all cook offs, but mostly barbecue.

1894
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,680
A great, great reference to Muffin Vision.

1895
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,880
That's plenty of fun.

1896
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,400
Here's a here's a take.

1897
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,760
I texted our friend Justin and he said,

1898
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:46,240
what upsets me about this is that Disney has an underused Sam Eagle.

1899
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,840
From America Sings.

1900
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,920
His character, that character, the Bing Crosby one.

1901
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,520
He was upset that Sam Eagle was being not being used.

1902
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,400
That's a little confusing.

1903
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,000
All the Eagles are named Sam.

1904
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,080
There's those two and the Olympics mascot from 84.

1905
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,600
Is that Sam? Yeah.

1906
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,160
Eagles are all Sam.

1907
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,640
Really? So that's the Sam test.

1908
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,160
Yes. Yeah.

1909
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:10,920
Now, it's itself.

1910
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,560
I don't want to be too harsh with that test because I like all three of these characters.

1911
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,400
Those are good eagles.

1912
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:20,360
But if you can point out any eagle in fiction not named Sam,

1913
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,120
and I'm sure there are no counterexamples to this.

1914
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,520
I'm sure we won't get 10 immediately.

1915
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,320
Nope. They're all Sam.

1916
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,960
They're all Sam.

1917
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,880
Um, the barbecue restaurant will also be using cardboard boxes

1918
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,040
like the will look like cardboard boxes put together.

1919
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,440
And Andy is building a rodeo.

1920
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,000
So he's in a rodeo now.

1921
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,520
He's into roller coasters.

1922
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,240
He really has developed some eccentric hobbies.

1923
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,680
So you think this is Andy, like in his 30s?

1924
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:55,320
He's watched Chef's Table, Chef's Tour, and he's got a lot of thoughts about

1925
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,400
Lowcountry versus other parts of Carolina barbecue.

1926
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,080
He's got middle aged man hobbies.

1927
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,960
Yeah. We're like, you know, I bought a slow cooker.

1928
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,360
Because you know they're going to have craft brews.

1929
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,600
Make my own beer.

1930
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,240
I'm making my own beer in the garage.

1931
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,000
It is Andy's beer. Yeah.

1932
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,480
He said in this, this is not Andy's backyard when he was a kid.

1933
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,280
It's Andy's backyard now.

1934
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,480
He has no wife or family.

1935
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,800
And he had to rebuy Woody and Buzz and all of his friends

1936
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,720
from auction sites and like going to physical auctions.

1937
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,040
He spent like 60 grand reassembling the gang.

1938
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,800
This is called, this is called, wait, Pulla Carlson?

1939
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,320
I was going to say this is like what I do or what Zach Ryder is doing

1940
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,240
every week of his life.

1941
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I'm really assailing you.

1942
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,760
Yeah, you're assailing me and him who are reassembling our childhood.

1943
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,600
Hundreds of dollars at a time.

1944
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,080
I would assail one of those two, but not the, I would be worried about doing it.

1945
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,480
Me? You mean me? You're absolutely worried about me.

1946
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,160
I guess I'd less rather upset you than Zach Ryder. Yes.

1947
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,280
Well, we'll see. I mean, he's listening.

1948
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,520
He's listening. I guess he is.

1949
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,800
Oh, yeah. He might be.

1950
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,800
Zach Ryder's, when Zach Ryder's toys come to life, when he leaves,

1951
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,080
they're like, really more?

1952
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,360
So many of us. Jesus.

1953
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,160
It is crowded. It's like they're very unhappy.

1954
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,880
There's no room for anyone.

1955
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,960
Fine. 15 more.

1956
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,040
Nothing but shelf space. Sure. Pile them on.

1957
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,200
It's like a subway in a company or a subway in a country that's just very overpopulated.

1958
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,680
Like shoulder to shoulder at his house.

1959
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,760
Yeah. Third World Train.

1960
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,120
You know, I have a pitch, actually.

1961
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:44,480
If they don't like Sam Eagle, let's make it just Tim Allen's American barbecue.

1962
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,720
Oh, wow. And get Tim over there and just have his face.

1963
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,040
I guess put like a tricorder hat on his head.

1964
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,680
Yeah, it's just regular American stuff.

1965
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,680
It's not, you know, with no pad Thai or Tai Chi or whatever they call it.

1966
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:00,160
It's just like regular beer.

1967
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,760
Yeah. Regular style. Regular style.

1968
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:06,520
I had to twist his arm to get Bud Light and Miller Light.

1969
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,960
All right. Light beer. All right.

1970
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,480
All right. I know what that says about you.

1971
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:16,200
Well, calorie count with the beer because the entrees are fully loaded.

1972
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:19,240
Everything is fully loaded.

1973
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,160
No weird grapefruit in there.

1974
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,640
You know, nothing weird.

1975
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,520
Who gives a shit about grapefruit?

1976
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:27,560
All right. OK. Well, now there's no need.

1977
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,040
That's the that's that's the end of that, Harold, I think.

1978
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,000
I think you survived.

1979
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,360
Fodcast. OK.

1980
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,480
Hey, what a delight.

1981
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,960
I like when I wish I wish I could have ended more improv shows

1982
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,440
with just going, OK, that's the end of that.

1983
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,760
All right. That's enough.

1984
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,320
Making the Tim Allen like dog noise. Yeah.

1985
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,720
Oh, if only. Yeah.

1986
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,040
Well, the the the Harold team, the UCB team that

1987
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:00,200
peppers in Tim Allen sound effects and they wipe with BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM.

1988
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,440
We are tool time.

1989
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:08,960
Though improvement themed when from team when UCB team or tool team.

1990
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:14,880
When UCB also falls victim to the IP mania that we're experiencing

1991
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,600
and every Harold team has a different IP attached to it.

1992
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,800
Then we really know we're in hell.

1993
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,760
We really know that the bottom is falling out.

1994
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,960
It's just it's less inventing from.

1995
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,280
You don't invent a whole new like her improv show from scratch.

1996
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,040
You just kind of like in make up a home improvement episode on the fly.

1997
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,280
Yes, exactly.

1998
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,920
Honestly, sounds like a pretty good show.

1999
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,360
Not thinking about it.

2000
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,440
What are the kids names?

2001
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,720
Do we know anything?

2002
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,680
Shit. I mean, I know their actors names.

2003
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,200
Yeah. Randy is one of them. Yeah, there you go.

2004
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:45,960
OK, can I get a suggestion for a problem that Randy's dealing with at school?

2005
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,760
What is Jill upset with Tim about?

2006
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,960
Can I have a suggestion what Jill is upset with Tim about?

2007
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,880
We get a suggestion for what the tool time girl is wearing.

2008
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,400
All right. Short denim shorts. All right.

2009
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,720
And has Tim taken the garbage out or has he not?

2010
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,160
OK, he's not. Great. Thank you so much.

2011
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,560
Can I get a suggestion for how much of Wilson's face you can see?

2012
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,240
About half. OK, very good.

2013
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,880
I like I heard about half.

2014
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,400
How can Tim humiliate Al?

2015
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,240
I need a suggestion of something that Tim can say about Al

2016
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,600
that would humiliate him on TV.

2017
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,200
Real quick, tool time girls.

2018
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,640
Obviously, one is Pamela Anderson, the other I forget the actress's name.

2019
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,880
Lisa was Pamela Anderson.

2020
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,120
What is the other character's name?

2021
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:33,480
I want to keep saying it's Wendy, but that can't be right.

2022
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,480
Either Sam or Helen.

2023
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,240
Sadly, can we look it up here while I do the plugs?

2024
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,520
Yeah, do it quick for more podcasts.

2025
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,520
The ride follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2026
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,160
And please let us know if you could think of any Eagles not named Sam.

2027
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,560
I'm sure there are zero.

2028
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,880
If you're Zach Ryder, feel free.

2029
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,160
Feel free to threaten me for making fun of your toys.

2030
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,320
And also, everyone feel free.

2031
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,320
Everyone, Sam, the Eagle barbecue haters included.

2032
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:01,880
Please follow us at the second gate at Patreon.com slash podcast, the ride.

2033
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,440
And the verdict is Heidi.

2034
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,000
Heidi. Heidi.

2035
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,360
Hmm. Interesting. Heidi Keppert.

2036
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,400
Heidi Keppert.

2037
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,960
Pretty interesting name, but not a car pun.

2038
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,160
So no giggles from Jason.

2039
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,360
I was just hoping it was Wendy and Lisa.

2040
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,760
Hmm. Oh, that'd be nice.

2041
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,920
Yeah, it's Heidi and Lisa. Hmm.

2042
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,720
Oh, well, keep dreaming.

2043
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,920
And folks, keep listening.

2044
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,600
We'll be back with something else next week.

2045
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,120
Sure. So long.

2046
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,000
But.

2047
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
But. But. But. But.

2048
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:37,840
