1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Forever.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,160
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, where today we are discussing yellow submarines, which puts

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,100
us perilously at risk of a Ringo tangent.

5
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,460
I'm Scott Gardner, this is Jason Sheridan.

6
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,300
Yeah, sure.

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,460
Well, yellow submarines designates them as research subs.

8
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,080
That's true.

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,460
Oh, wow.

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,260
Now you know.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,120
So that's what the Beatles were singing about.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,520
They were curious about oceanographic research.

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,540
Mike Carlson, hi.

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,020
Hello, peace and love, peace and love.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,000
Peace and love.

16
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,800
Mike Carlson here.

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,380
Yellow is actually the color you can see the most at the depths.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,100
I love your Ringo.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,760
Is that a Ringo?

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,360
The Ringo is second to your.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,400
I got to tell you.

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,360
Peace and love, peace and I will not.

23
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,440
Ringo stop, baby.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,340
I will not be signing any more autographs, baby, after this date.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,520
Wow.

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,260
Jason's the first one with the impression out of the gate here.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,280
I didn't expect that either.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,980
For the perfect ring.

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,800
For those of you, if you don't, you know, if you aren't super versed in it and you

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,500
don't know how Ringo talks, perfect right on the money.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,940
I don't I don't want to cause the tangent, but I thought of that joke.

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
And then I thought about how we you and I saw Ringo in the All-Star band years ago.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
And I chose Yellow Submarine to take a bathroom break.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,060
And you were upset about it.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,140
Or maybe not upset, but it was kind of like, what?

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:14,820
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,700
Are you are you sure you did?

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,420
You did hear what they're playing, right?

39
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:18,860
Right.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,660
Well, it was, you know, he plays a couple of his Beatles songs,

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,480
a few of them.

42
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,520
And that's the boy when the boy gets a girl.

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,800
I love boys.

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,100
We've talked about how you do not like boys.

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,080
I don't really care.

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,400
And I love boys.

47
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,180
Boys is fine.

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,780
It's a cover.

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,840
Also, that's not one of the originals, but that is a Ringo.

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,900
I love when they love girls talking about boys.

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:37,740
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,920
Now I'm veering into criticizing impressions,

53
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,440
but I'm veering into Eddie Vedder.

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,960
Oh, boy.

55
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,380
I bet Eddie Vedder loves the song Boys.

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,740
I bet he does.

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,440
He might.

58
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,200
You should do it with it.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,080
That seems like if that hasn't happened at a rock and roll hall.

60
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,540
Yeah.

61
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,880
And what are we doing?

62
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,640
Seriously?

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,320
Do I think?

64
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,180
Oh, shit.

65
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
You really you you've ruined the episode.

66
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
I hate to tell you this, but you've ruined the episode immediately.

67
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,000
I believe Ringo does Boys with Green Day at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

68
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,840
Oh, no.

69
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,680
I believe they back up.

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,220
No, I was stepping in a Green Day shaped pile of shit.

71
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,060
For sure.

72
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,320
They did Boys with Ringo.

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,380
At least there was a different song.

74
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,920
They for sure were with Ringo because I believe they all got in at the same year.

75
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,840
I don't remember a couple of years ago.

76
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,440
That's right.

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,100
They're in.

78
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah, they're in.

79
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,180
They got in like first year.

80
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,100
Their first first year ballot, I think.

81
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,640
It's a band of all Ringo's and Ringo and Ringo had to get in

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,120
because Paul McCartney had to go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and be like,

83
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,500
you know, Ringo should be in.

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,300
What do we do?

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,340
Ringo is a big star.

86
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,480
The other three men we should put Ringo in.

87
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:37,900
I'll come.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,980
And like he had to make a deal like I'm coming.

89
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,360
I will induct him.

90
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,200
And they were like, like, I think the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

91
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,140
must have been very resistant to induct another man over 70.

92
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,860
Yeah.

93
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,140
Yeah.

94
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,000
Is that really something they want to do?

95
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,220
No, they hate doing that.

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,620
But yeah.

97
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,720
So

98
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,700
real quick, Paul wrote a book, a second book in his

99
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,520
great hey, Grand Dude series.

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,160
Yes.

101
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,760
Called Grand Dude's Green Submarine.

102
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,520
What is it?

103
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,180
Children's book?

104
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,100
It's a children's book.

105
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,380
And my daughter has this book.

106
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,460
Hey, Grand Dude is now Grand Dude is the name of his old man character.

107
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,660
So it's not Grandpa.

108
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,780
It's Grand Dude.

109
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,680
And that is now a Paul McCartney original IP.

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,100
Character?

111
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,840
Where does he play the character?

112
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,840
Well, he doesn't play it.

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,760
He writes it.

114
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,600
Oh, it's credited as written by Paul McCartney.

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,580
He's never dressed up as Grand Dude anywhere.

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,660
As far as I know, not yet.

117
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,320
I hope one day we get a Grand Dude movie, because obviously Paul was in one of the

118
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,000
Pirates movies.

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,380
Jason is over there carefully checking his list of submarine names.

120
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,940
Yeah.

121
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Fine.

122
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,300
That's you guys go.

123
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll get this ready.

124
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,340
I've got a lot of Cold War paraphernalia to brush up on.

125
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,380
He's he's chomping at the bit to do it.

126
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,180
But I was like, so Paul now has another submarine in the Beatles can't

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,040
earn a green submarine now to the green submarines.

128
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,960
Paul and John wrote purple.

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,880
Well, better not be if he lives long enough.

130
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,440
I think we're going to get all the colors

131
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,700
because John and Paul wrote Yellow Submarine for Ringo.

132
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,560
That's not a Ringo penned original.

133
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,840
So Paul now has written two different color submarine.

134
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,600
I think I knew that till this morning, till I knew knowing this was coming.

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
I didn't know that was a Lennon McCartney.

136
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,960
And then it was kind of the verse is kind of like actually kind of a tender Lennon

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,620
folky.

138
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,860
I listened to his demo of just the verse.

139
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,000
Right.

140
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,240
Right.

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,440
It's not sing songy and silly at all.

142
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,880
Yeah.

143
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,040
What John seriousness.

144
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,380
Right.

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,020
When you got Ringo in there, you got to make it sing songy

146
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,740
and a little silly.

147
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,340
We agree.

148
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,840
We have different Beatles opinions here and there, but we do agree that

149
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,680
and we both have this policy in our homes that our children

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,200
only read books by celebrity authors.

151
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,200
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,440
My son has a stacked line of everything Jimmy Fallon's ever written.

153
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,980
Hey, there, Moo Moo or whatever.

154
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,680
Celebrity books are certainly are not ghost written.

155
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,260
No, they couldn't do that.

156
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,780
You would have to lock up if I don't know, if Sofia Vergara

157
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,020
wasn't the author of her book, she could go to jail for that.

158
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,680
Yeah, right.

159
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,180
That's true.

160
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,840
None of these guys want to, you know, do that dance.

161
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,680
I've got all the books ready for when she gets older, too.

162
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,420
I mean, I have the whole William Shatner Tech War collection ready to go.

163
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,220
All of his Star Trek expanded universe novels as well.

164
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,780
Again, not ghost written.

165
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,620
Definitely William Shatner sat down and wrote them.

166
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,420
I'm just waiting for like, what is the right age for my teenage son

167
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,700
to start reading the Chelsea Handler body of work?

168
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,780
I mean, it's a little because he should probably be of drinking age

169
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,660
because it's all like, oh, it's very hey there, Martini.

170
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,020
Right.

171
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,100
I believe we've met.

172
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,280
I'm Chelsea.

173
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,000
Jason, does Jay Leno have any children's books?

174
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,420
He does.

175
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:41,980
He does.

176
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,680
OK, Scott knows.

177
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,440
I think it's called If Roast Beef Could Fly.

178
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,040
Oh, yeah, I know that.

179
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,840
Add it to the pile.

180
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,540
Jay Leno's acting career.

181
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,060
Jay Leno's wrestling career.

182
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,220
Jay Leno's children's book career.

183
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,960
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,740
Now, we've been told about if roast beef.

185
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,080
I believe listeners have said, like, thought of you and saw it at a good will.

186
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,200
That's probably right.

187
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,420
That's why I thought it.

188
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,060
If roast beef could fly.

189
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Yeah.

190
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,920
Well, roast beef is that's an important topic to Jay

191
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,580
because he eats roast beef probably 12 times a week.

192
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,960
And in his in his rotation, as far as he stretches his diet.

193
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,920
Yeah, that's as weird as he gets.

194
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,300
Right.

195
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,440
Well, yeah, 12 times.

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,420
So seven days a week for breakfast.

197
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,060
And then like the hobbits, he also has elevens these in second breakfast.

198
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,100
So he squeezes it in.

199
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,420
Sure.

200
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,020
Yeah.

201
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,420
Mike, of course, I got your daughter

202
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,660
the Krasenstein book, how the people trumped Ronald Plump.

203
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,320
What the one did those those Kukon man on the on Twitter,

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,840
Ed and Brian Krasenstein were always doing like, vote.

205
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh, yeah.

206
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Vote.

207
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,860
And then they they made the book with like shirtless Robert Mueller,

208
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,640
like jacked Robert Mueller.

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,560
My God.

210
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,040
You're considering these guys celebrities.

211
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,600
Oh, these are sure internet.

212
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,660
Micros celebrities.

213
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,120
Celebrities only going to grow.

214
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,640
That's true.

215
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,920
In the next couple of years.

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,940
How people Trump Ronald

217
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,710
but we're going to have to read that book so that we know how to how to

218
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,860
how to Trump him, how to vote him out, how to vote him.

219
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,200
All right.

220
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,800
That's fair.

221
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,160
OK.

222
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,980
I don't know if you know this, but Ronald Plump is based on a real man

223
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,840
and a real and a real threat.

224
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,060
Oh, my goodness.

225
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,760
Well, thank you for buying those books.

226
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,340
I assume you'll give them to me one day.

227
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,540
Oh, yeah.

228
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,120
Yeah.

229
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,200
Well, you want them.

230
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,920
You get them.

231
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,020
You're reading them and enjoying them yourself.

232
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,840
I understand the first printing, but you guys can have the second and third.

233
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,220
You already pre purchased the second and third printing.

234
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,320
Oh, yeah.

235
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,040
Yeah, they're already ever since they did that debate

236
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,540
with Glenn Glenn Greenwald and whatever destiny is.

237
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,460
I think he's a streamer.

238
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,520
No one's making you know about any of no one's making you watch any of this.

239
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,980
No, but I do know this.

240
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,820
Glenn Greenwald is not sorry, you know,

241
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,000
and Greenwald's not always fun to talk about is Shatner or Leno.

242
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,180
No, that's true.

243
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,100
More unpleasant.

244
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,080
That's true.

245
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,140
Oh, the positive endorphins everyone got when they heard tech war.

246
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,540
Yeah.

247
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,680
Tech war is fun.

248
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,320
Bill Shatner is fun.

249
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,080
I think we can all agree the complete works of tech war is fun.

250
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,880
Friend a friend of the show, Andrew Grissom, texted me a photo of William

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,960
Shatner with Coco the gorilla last night, and I was delighted.

252
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,280
And you guys refer to it as tech sting.

253
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,860
That's your threat.

254
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,960
Your thread is called Mike and Andrew text.

255
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
Tech Sting.

256
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Yeah.

257
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,180
T.

258
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
All right.

259
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,680
The tangent has been cleared out.

260
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,540
I promise no more Green Day references, because I'll personally bleep them out.

261
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,440
So now we can get down to the business, the off to delayed business

262
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,160
of our Tomorrowland series, the slowest moving series, much like Disney.

263
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
We have found a lot of other things to do.

264
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,880
Oh, yeah.

265
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,700
Instead of deal with Tomorrowland.

266
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,500
But we're here.

267
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,800
We're doing it now.

268
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,040
And we're dealing with, I think, a crucial piece of Tomorrowland,

269
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,020
part of Tomorrowland's first big expansion, part of Disneyland's first big expansion.

270
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,520
And that's the submarine voyage later and currently

271
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,160
finding Nemo submarine voyage.

272
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,420
I think it's an important part of the story of Disneyland.

273
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,980
Been there forever, a stalwart.

274
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
So I think that we should honor it.

275
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,500
We should say what's great about it.

276
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,900
And then we should talk about what we're going to do when we get that sweet,

277
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,180
sweet land back when these when these suckers are

278
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,620
kicked out of the park forever.

279
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,940
There's a great big, beautiful tomorrow.

280
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,660
The cement trucks are pulling up to it

281
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,640
to fill that nine nine million gallon water sink.

282
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,140
Fill it up.

283
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,160
No more.

284
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,760
Yeah.

285
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
Drain the chlorine.

286
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,500
Yeah.

287
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,980
But you know what?

288
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,960
You know, let's we'll try to say some nice things.

289
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,780
Although, how about this before we do any any history of it?

290
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Just knee jerk current feelings about finding Nemo submarine voyage.

291
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,400
How about that?

292
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,660
How how much do we do it?

293
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
I've done it, I think, once.

294
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,040
Yeah.

295
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,900
Since it's reopened, since reopened as the finding Nemo.

296
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,760
So it might be it might be a choice.

297
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,440
It might be a choice.

298
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:02,620
Yeah.

299
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,540
I am twice.

300
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
I've done it a handful of times.

301
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,140
It's really slow loading.

302
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,120
Yeah.

303
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,040
It is fun.

304
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,100
I have a lot of warm feelings, I think, towards

305
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,920
20,000 leagues under the sea at Disney World, which

306
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,760
which we covered that is done with Stony Sharp years ago.

307
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Yeah.

308
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Yeah.

309
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Yeah.

310
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,520
Discussing that here.

311
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,440
That is off the table.

312
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,880
That clears up time for more if roast beef could fly.

313
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,680
Oh, thank God.

314
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,220
But that did answer.

315
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,620
I watched the the defunct land about it.

316
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,280
And that did answer a long running question of mine,

317
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,500
which was like

318
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,320
20,000 leagues, the movie with Kurt Douglas and James Mason

319
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,640
comes out in the mid fifties.

320
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,420
And then this opens in 59, the submarine voyage.

321
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,420
And I was like, why didn't they just make it 20,000 leagues?

322
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,940
And then I'm like, oh, submarines were still very futurey.

323
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,820
And as Kevin points out in the defunct land video,

324
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,100
they the Tomorrowland of Florida didn't quite make sense for 20

325
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,080
for a submarine voyage, but 20,000 leagues under the sea

326
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,720
is a little more fantasy based.

327
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,980
So that's how it ended up.

328
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
Oh, it was fantastic.

329
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:23,860
Oh, right.

330
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,340
Yeah.

331
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,560
Uh huh.

332
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,780
Yes.

333
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,040
Whereas it's a little more started, a little more clinical

334
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,920
here in Disneyland.

335
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,600
And submarines were all the rage at the time.

336
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,680
It was submarine fever.

337
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,020
Yeah.

338
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,220
Well, the journey through liquid space, you know, we're going through

339
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,240
through space space and now the unexplored part of planet Earth.

340
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,500
Liquid space.

341
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,020
Sure.

342
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,600
That's right.

343
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Deep.

344
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:51,820
Yeah.

345
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,380
And what could be down there?

346
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,360
Some barnacles and mollusks and then and then one goofy

347
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,260
sea serpent with crossed eyes.

348
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,840
That's right.

349
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,100
What might be down there?

350
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,460
Yeah.

351
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,280
Can someone just refresh my memory and confirm

352
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,940
was that goofy sea serpent at that?

353
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,880
That's from Disneyland exhibit.

354
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,440
That might have been a Richard Kraft owned item.

355
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,820
I think it was like right when you first walked in,

356
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,220
ran into the sea serpent.

357
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,580
Yeah.

358
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,920
Yeah, I believe so.

359
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,200
Yeah.

360
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,280
That does sound familiar.

361
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,080
One thing.

362
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,260
Well, I'll say that, you know, we're sort of in history.

363
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,320
When it when I go into it a little bit.

364
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,060
So this is not opening day Disneyland,

365
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,500
but there was a lagoon pretty early on in that spot at Disneyland.

366
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,420
There was something called the Phantom Boats over there.

367
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,920
This is one of the most disastrous attractions of all time.

368
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,120
We might have touched on a little bit when we did our Tomorrowland

369
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,300
was weird episode.

370
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,020
They they broke all the time.

371
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,160
Guests piloted them on their own and that didn't work.

372
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,400
And then they started putting like, here's the you got a navigator in the back.

373
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,880
Yeah.

374
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,500
And and so therefore, I mean,

375
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,520
a ride where there's a person in every single car.

376
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,200
That gets tough to run.

377
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,860
You run low staffing wise, and I think they still broke a lot.

378
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,720
So this was only open for a year.

379
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,700
Left him with a lagoon.

380
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,940
And I guess Walt had a hunch that Phantom Boats aren't the future.

381
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
We will not be piloting Phantom Boats around.

382
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,520
Yeah.

383
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,160
Our local canals and oceans.

384
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,520
They did look cool, though.

385
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,700
I did like those fins.

386
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,920
Meanwhile, as I said, submarine fever.

387
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,180
Why the real submarine, the Nautilus in 1958, right before this ride opened,

388
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,480
became the first submarine to travel under the polar ice cap.

389
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,880
I could say many more real submarine facts.

390
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm quite versed, but I know there's no need.

391
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,680
I don't think you could sprinkle them in as we go.

392
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,160
Oh, sure.

393
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,940
Oh, I'd love to.

394
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,000
And I and I will.

395
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,320
Yeah.

396
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,340
And definitely remember that I said that I would.

397
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:53,780
Yeah.

398
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,200
But no, it's like I don't think I realize this, how how current they were.

399
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,420
And which makes it a little interesting

400
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,980
in that I can't think of an example of like now Disney does an attraction

401
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,320
that's like based on something that everybody's obsessed with.

402
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,940
I don't know what that is, like like segues.

403
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,180
Yeah, you mean, they open to segue experience and technology and not a movie,

404
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,280
not a property.

405
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

406
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,360
Yeah.

407
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,940
Just like everyone's excited about.

408
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,760
I mean, there was a self-driving car time.

409
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,080
We've talked about how there was a minute where like, take that Autopia

410
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,240
and all its stinky diesel and turn it into.

411
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,040
Jason said this.

412
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,220
Why don't you give it to Elon Musk?

413
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,620
I think he said it in 2018.

414
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,780
Why doesn't Elon Musk just do a bunch of tells you?

415
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,620
You say that before we knew that?

416
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,680
Well, yes, that's I think a lot of people are saying that.

417
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,860
I think we all agreed at the time.

418
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,580
I'm actually not.

419
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,200
I don't think we knew a lot about the man at the time,

420
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,220
like at least in the public consciousness.

421
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,520
Real life Iron Man, we knew that.

422
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,560
We knew he was really like Tony Stark.

423
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,320
That's what we knew.

424
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,020
Uh huh.

425
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,180
And we could project anything onto that.

426
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,600
Tony Stark good at quipping funny.

427
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,380
So probably Elon Musk, it stands to reason, is extremely funny.

428
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,840
Recovering alcoholic Tony Stark, famously,

429
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,640
usually dealing with the demon of alcoholism.

430
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,200
But as MCU Tony Stark, they kind of in two, they touched on it,

431
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,260
but they don't really, they don't really go there.

432
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,920
Like, you know, get into the real life like stimulants.

433
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,600
Sure.

434
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,340
There's not a lot of people are wild about, you know, stimulant.

435
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
They don't.

436
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Iron Man three.

437
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,580
Did Iron Man take Adderall?

438
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:39,100
No, no, I was saying Iron Man three does not deal with the Adderall shortage.

439
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,300
That was going around.

440
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,740
That's true.

441
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,160
You're right.

442
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,120
That's true.

443
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,340
Oh, a while back.

444
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,520
What drugs does Tony did Tony Stark do?

445
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
I mean, are you showing that in children's comics?

446
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,660
Well, in the seventies, Demon in the Bottle?

447
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,360
Eighties.

448
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:52,880
Eighties.

449
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,660
Demon in the Bottle is a very famous Iron Man.

450
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,500
And it's like a big like Tony with like dark circles under his eyes

451
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,440
with the helmet off and looking in the mirror in a bottle there.

452
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
Oh, that was a big story.

453
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,460
Green Lantern, Green Arrow both dealt with like racism.

454
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,200
Speedy Green Arrow sidekick got addicted to heroin.

455
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:11,860
Really?

456
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,280
Yeah, there's like a cover where like Speedy, his like

457
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,620
Green Arrow's young ward is like tying his arm off.

458
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,840
Is that to like look, I've you might be surprised I've never done heroin.

459
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Doesn't heroin kind of slow things down?

460
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,420
Was he sick of all the speed?

461
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,500
Well, Green Arrow.

462
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,580
Oh, so Green Arrow is just the guy with the bow and arrow.

463
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:28,960
Yes.

464
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,840
But wait, but Speedy, you said that was his name.

465
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,480
But he didn't run fast, right?

466
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,160
No, he didn't run fast.

467
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,560
Yeah.

468
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,840
And how did he get this name?

469
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,020
He's changed to Arsenal, I think, at the 90s.

470
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,000
I know they fixed it.

471
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,400
They fixed it.

472
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,640
Yeah, good.

473
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,480
It should not be.

474
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,340
I go right to if I'm reading a comic and somebody named

475
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,620
Speedy is in it, I have one expectation.

476
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
It's not that he does heroin.

477
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,220
There are a lot of Flash characters and none of them are named Speedy.

478
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,400
There's Kid Flash, there's Impulse.

479
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,220
There's Max Mercury, Jesse Quick.

480
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,840
Well, Jesse Quick's pretty good.

481
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,760
Jesse Quick is Quick?

482
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,460
Yeah, he is Quick.

483
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,380
I should hope so.

484
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,540
She.

485
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,500
Well, but it's not she.

486
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,080
Oh, right, right.

487
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
But it's not an accidental last name.

488
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,820
Jesse Quick doesn't shoot arrows.

489
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,080
Anyway, Walt starts dreaming of what to do with that big, big plot of land.

490
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,380
The Disneyland's first big expansion.

491
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,420
Do I say the full list?

492
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,440
That in 59, what comes?

493
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,140
I mean, this is so significant.

494
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,340
They call it the second opening of Disneyland, even its monorail,

495
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,900
its Matterhorn, its subs.

496
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,820
What a transformative time.

497
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,680
I mean, that's truly the announcement.

498
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,920
Disneyland's here to stay.

499
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,200
Disneyland is going to do stuff like this, like big, ambitious expansions.

500
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,520
So it's it's very important.

501
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,200
And I feel like something that had never been tried before either.

502
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
This is one of the things where I'm trying to give it credit

503
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,360
before we start salivating.

504
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,980
Oh, yeah.

505
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:56,480
I believe this is also the e-ticket started for these attractions.

506
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,140
Uh huh.

507
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,660
This was one of the first e-tickets.

508
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,700
There were no e-tickets.

509
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,120
Again, it's one of those things.

510
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,940
Now there are online tickets.

511
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,240
People say when, yeah,

512
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,420
A's were you bought individual ride tickets at that time.

513
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,260
A's were the trash cans, the water fountains.

514
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,220
You had to use an A ticket to throw something away.

515
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:19,840
Yeah.

516
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,360
So most sidewalks were free,

517
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,160
but if you wanted to step up on some of the nicer brickwork,

518
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,880
that'll cost you an A and then they'll kick it like,

519
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,260
no, that only gets you 20 feet.

520
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,660
You're out.

521
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,760
The free sidewalks were the ones that lady shoes

522
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,180
kept getting stuck in in that opening day.

523
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,740
Yeah, that's why they were free.

524
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,120
Yeah.

525
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,120
That's why you can walk in that.

526
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,400
Oh, you want the hard walkable surfaces.

527
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,120
That's going to cost you.

528
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,600
No, but this is like this seems like kind of it's one of those like

529
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,440
crazy dreams that Walt had threw it at the guys and said,

530
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,460
you figure it out.

531
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,120
And they did figure it out.

532
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,240
There were a lot of things to figure out.

533
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,800
If we're going to do a submarine ride, does that imply

534
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,320
and you want to see fish and aquatic life and stuff?

535
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,560
OK, maybe we can put some of those in there.

536
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,540
Like it's a big tank.

537
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,380
Well, most types of water, you will not see any fish that live in there.

538
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,080
So it's going to have to be chlorine.

539
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,280
And if it's chlorine, then certainly we cannot have fish swimming around.

540
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,380
That won't work.

541
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,760
Yeah, they need chlorine for maintenance.

542
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,380
They say the logistics of rotating vehicles and the need for consistent

543
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,000
visitor experiences.

544
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,100
So it's we end up with this is like underwater jungle cruise.

545
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,080
Yes, they don't do real animals because you can't depend on those.

546
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Right.

547
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:39,840
Yeah.

548
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,620
And it's like to me and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself

549
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,720
or getting ahead of the conversation.

550
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,200
But like to me, the big thing is just like,

551
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,320
make sure it looks like it's going underwater.

552
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,780
Like ultimately, yes, without the realism was not able to be achieved, really,

553
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,680
as far as what you're seeing outside.

554
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,080
So literally, I think the big magic trick of it is just like,

555
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,160
it's got to look like a kid like you're going underwater.

556
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,540
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

557
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,280
Yeah.

558
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,760
And I feel like it was oddly late in my knowledge of this ride,

559
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,180
which, again, I think all alliterations put together.

560
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,720
I know you're going to say.

561
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,080
I don't think I think I've only been on it four times in my life,

562
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,240
but I'm sure I went on it once or twice without knowing that you don't actually dive.

563
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:20,940
Yes.

564
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,360
Yeah.

565
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,060
I didn't know that until a couple of years ago.

566
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,880
Well, I think I mean, I recently feel stupid if you feel the same way.

567
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,180
Yeah.

568
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,360
Yeah.

569
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,200
I was fooled.

570
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,020
And the kid, I was freaked, too.

571
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,920
Yeah, sure.

572
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,880
I said that in my.

573
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,860
Take their word for it.

574
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,380
And you don't you don't realize what that effect is and what's that.

575
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,480
Basically, there's just moments where they say dive, they say the word dive

576
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,740
and then bubbles are released and kind of cover your your porthole window.

577
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,540
Because that's that's the thing about the ride.

578
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,120
If you've never been on it, it's this very narrow space as some might say,

579
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,280
a claustrophobic space.

580
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,280
And yes, everybody's got an individual porthole.

581
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,180
And and you put your head inside it pretty much.

582
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,760
Basically, and everybody's got their own little personal porthole view

583
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,600
of a bunch of scenes in aquatic life and stuff.

584
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,600
But yeah, I because you only see the beginning.

585
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I mean, you can.

586
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,060
That's another nice thing I'll say about this attraction

587
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,140
that I think the lagoon looks very nice.

588
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,680
And I like it in its current form.

589
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,560
I like it with the seagulls.

590
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah.

591
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,760
Mine, mine, mine.

592
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,220
It's fun.

593
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,340
And you watch the submarines do a pass from the loading area.

594
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,220
They kind of do a full loop and then they disappear behind the waterfall.

595
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,040
They move through a waterfall unless that doesn't operate anymore.

596
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,700
I don't remember.

597
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,400
I think it does.

598
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,400
But it moves into a show building.

599
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,120
That's kind of a thing.

600
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,040
You forget about this.

601
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,360
There is a show building and a big show building.

602
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,900
And by the time you're in there, you can really control it and light it.

603
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,620
And it starts feeling like you're really in the depths

604
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,020
more than when you've got natural sunlight and you can look up

605
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,160
and see the water line.

606
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Yeah.

607
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,540
No, it's it's great.

608
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,220
Again, yeah.

609
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,400
Couple of years ago, probably right before this box.

610
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,980
Maybe I did.

611
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,340
I learned it on the 20,000 Leagues episode.

612
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,840
I remember.

613
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,060
Maybe if they remember that episode can tell me when I.

614
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,980
When did I learn it?

615
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,040
You tell me listeners when I learned it,

616
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,240
much like Jason didn't tell me how I got to Manhattan from the airport.

617
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,700
This was a second gate thing.

618
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:16,980
Yeah.

619
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,820
You demanded to know what routes you took.

620
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,420
Many, many listeners, I will say, did tell me how I did it.

621
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,600
They knew they did know.

622
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes.

623
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,520
From New York.

624
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,440
How did you end up on the Long Island?

625
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,060
Long Island Railroad Railroad.

626
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,980
I had to take like an air train or something.

627
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,480
OK.

628
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,920
Yeah.

629
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,220
I took an air train and get to the Long Island Railroad.

630
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,600
But now listeners tell me when did I learn

631
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,040
that there was a show building for these subs?

632
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,520
I don't know.

633
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,620
They're going to tell me, you know, like

634
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,760
look at transcripts or something.

635
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Find the phrase.

636
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
I didn't know that.

637
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,400
Mary Lou Henner is an listener to podcast the ride.

638
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,720
You probably remember it perfectly because she, of course, has a perfectly

639
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,960
perfect recall in her memory.

640
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,060
So what?

641
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,660
Mary Lou Henner really from taxi.

642
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,900
Mary Lou Henner from taxi.

643
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,460
Has this never come up on the show before?

644
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,620
Well, there's no I didn't know that before.

645
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,100
Wow.

646
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,440
OK.

647
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,640
Now you now listeners know when I learned that.

648
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,320
Mary Lou Henner from taxi has what she claims is a perfect memory.

649
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,940
She recalls every moment in her life from like the minute to minute.

650
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,760
So she can tell you like what days things happened.

651
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,860
Does she like is that horrible?

652
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,680
Is that a burden?

653
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,540
Doesn't seem like it.

654
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,820
She seems like a nice lady who's having a nice time.

655
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,420
I always like seeing her on things.

656
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah.

657
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,590
So if she's a listener to podcast the ride, she could probably tell me.

658
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,200
Mary Lou would love to hear her thoughts on the submarine voyage.

659
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,800
Of course.

660
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,180
Sure.

661
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,600
We'll repeat it again.

662
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,020
We didn't know you were listening.

663
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,120
We, of course, would have given this to you as a guest.

664
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,080
We just didn't know you were listening.

665
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,620
Of course.

666
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,800
We'll never forget now, much like you, Mary Lou.

667
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,900
But so, yeah, dives are all simulated, which I think they do a good job.

668
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
But that's pretty good.

669
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,420
If you know, we're into this stuff more than others.

670
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:01,900
Yeah.

671
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,640
Fooled us.

672
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,020
Yeah.

673
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,180
And that's the whole thing.

674
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,420
Like to me, I think that's that's the magic with it.

675
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:07,900
Yeah.

676
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,020
Like that's that's especially for kids.

677
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,420
If you were going to make an argument for this thing sticking around,

678
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,600
that's like maybe the only thing that I think is still kind of special about it

679
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,380
is the actual idea that the kids going under like you're getting going under.

680
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,740
Yes.

681
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,820
And you are.

682
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,080
You do go under water.

683
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,840
You go under, but not very far.

684
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,780
And if you hear your head really at the beginning of the ride,

685
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,280
if you put your head all the way, stick it all the way up that porthole.

686
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,580
And you can see the the water line.

687
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:33,820
Right.

688
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,480
Yes.

689
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,020
Sun or moonlight poking through.

690
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,040
And these are technically boats.

691
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,700
I saw these are not technically submarines.

692
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,340
Really?

693
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,700
They wouldn't be classified.

694
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,820
It wouldn't be classified.

695
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,740
Interesting.

696
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,840
Well, why is that?

697
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,380
What is that?

698
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,860
Because they don't dive.

699
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,620
Oh, they maintain the same level.

700
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,680
And the whole time, I think the diving is the big is it on a track?

701
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
It's on track.

702
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,120
Yes, for sure.

703
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,500
Yeah.

704
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,560
Then maybe you wouldn't call it a yeah.

705
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
I mean, they're probably not.

706
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,200
I guess they are.

707
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,600
It would be a waste of a sub if it wasn't diving.

708
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,960
I mean, I believe the outside was fabricated by like.

709
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,420
A place that makes yeah, by like a sub maker.

710
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,240
Yeah, but yeah, so by the people who make made the real ones for the military.

711
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,440
The General Dynamics is the company.

712
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,320
Yes, actually built the actual ones

713
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,300
and then these as well.

714
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,700
That's kind of a that's sort of an air that I mean, they shook this off.

715
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,280
I would say at some point when they painted them yellow instead of gray,

716
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,120
because these were like steely gray.

717
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,080
Very, very cold war.

718
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,840
You know, yes, that's what I was.

719
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,440
All aboard.

720
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
It's extremely cold war.

721
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,400
And even and I just right before we started,

722
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,660
saw a photo of the load platform before it opened.

723
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,880
And there are there's like people are in military uniforms.

724
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,860
There are American flags draped all over.

725
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,940
So it is.

726
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,720
Yeah, I guess the implication is that you're going on.

727
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,880
You're going to go on a fun little submarine trip.

728
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,600
But this could be used to nuke Russia blow up the enemy.

729
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,160
Yeah.

730
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,960
The anecdote.

731
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,940
There's a lot of stories about these, a lot of anecdotes.

732
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,980
The one big one I kept coming across was,

733
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,960
you know, Nikita Khrushchev, when it when he was visiting America,

734
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,400
he wanted to see Disneyland.

735
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,560
And they're like, it's too complex.

736
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,360
It's too much security risk.

737
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,400
And what was disappointed because he's he really wanted to go like,

738
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,180
well, I've got a fleet of submarines as well.

739
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,840
Like, he really wanted to show off his submarine.

740
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,700
Got my Disneyland submarine fleet.

741
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,280
Got my submarines.

742
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,500
So the shit ever hits the fan.

743
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,980
You might have to watch out from a launch from southern California.

744
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,220
You might beat America, but you won't beat Disneyland.

745
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,100
Also, I'm going to secede one day.

746
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,320
Look, the nuclear, the cloud, the cloud of radiation

747
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,280
will just kind of float anywhere.

748
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,800
But, you know, could be coming from Disneyland.

749
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,580
You won't know what if Walt really one of the subs shot a missile,

750
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,800
but not all of them.

751
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,540
One of them was equipped with weapons.

752
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,400
Oh, sure.

753
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,880
Yeah.

754
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,720
Just in case.

755
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,280
Uh huh.

756
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,580
Expensive to put one on.

757
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:32,900
Yeah.

758
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,380
Yeah.

759
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,580
Yeah.

760
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,240
But if you know, if not, I was going to say if not,

761
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,760
if there was a river from not to Disney, they could just they could.

762
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,720
And they had to go to war together or go to war against each other.

763
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,080
Then who knows?

764
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,060
They could send it through.

765
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,480
Yeah.

766
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,120
Just through the sewers.

767
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,560
Yeah.

768
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,960
Matterhorn was a missile silo.

769
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,260
We didn't know.

770
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,220
No one ever knew that.

771
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,380
Turned it into a basketball court eventually.

772
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,640
But yeah, he had he was ready.

773
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,540
He had the matter and was only built to keep an eye on him.

774
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,220
Yeah.

775
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,320
And opens up building two big dreams.

776
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,220
Yeah.

777
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,460
Let's keep those rides dinky, shall we not?

778
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,840
It's frozen.

779
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,620
Everyone's I was frozen heads under the castle.

780
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,960
It's like, well, no.

781
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,260
But there was a missile underneath the matter.

782
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,920
Let's talk about what this ride experience actually was.

783
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,280
Yeah.

784
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,300
And one thing I'm not totally clear on is was there ever really a shift

785
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,640
in the big, the long era of when it was

786
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,860
or initially open before the the Nemo switch, which is 59 to 98?

787
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't know if that if the experience ever changed there,

788
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,640
but there's some videos you can watch from somewhere in there.

789
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,060
Yeah.

790
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,980
Um, I don't know.

791
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,640
You dive, you see bubbles, you see it's a psychological trick.

792
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,720
The trick you were underwater.

793
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,680
That's what I'm saying.

794
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
It's like more underwater than you thought.

795
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,820
Special necessarily about what you're seeing in the tiny windows to me.

796
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,920
So it's just the idea that, oh, my God, I can't believe it.

797
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,820
This thing could blow up at any moment.

798
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,740
We could just sink to the bottom of the sea.

799
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,360
Like, that's the whole thing.

800
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,180
I mean, and maybe I'm just projecting my fears when I was little.

801
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,780
I don't know, which I am often on this show, I suppose.

802
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,160
Yeah.

803
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,180
You told your mom, what if this whole thing just imploded instantly,

804
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,320
hellishly trapping us and any other very rich people in this?

805
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:23,700
Right.

806
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,040
You predicted an entire thing that happened.

807
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,440
Right.

808
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,400
And look, this is an anecdote I did tell on the other sub story,

809
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,420
but I will tell it again because many years later that I think I lied

810
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,960
and said I had to pee to get out of going on this

811
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,540
as we got to the front of the line and the Disney World version.

812
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,680
So made it all the way through.

813
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,660
I believe we waited like an hour in line.

814
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,480
And then I was like, Mommy, I have to pee.

815
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,840
And I think, though, I'm probably had to pee to some degree.

816
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
But I think I was scared.

817
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,760
I think I was scared of the briny deep.

818
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,000
Now that I've done some theme park with a child, how angry I would be,

819
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,560
how much this would wear me down on the other side of it.

820
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,360
Like, oh, my God.

821
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,980
After the slowest load weight, my mom was like arguing, like bargaining with me.

822
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,540
Come on, we just we waited.

823
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,240
Can we do?

824
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,360
No, I have to go.

825
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,840
I think I have to go.

826
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,820
I have to pee.

827
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh, I have to do it.

828
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,560
As soon as my son develops the ability to lie better.

829
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,020
That is a weapon that I'm sure is what parenting is, I'm sure.

830
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,100
Is then then that weapon is used every day.

831
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,220
Yeah, the invention when he invents it.

832
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,620
The invention of lying.

833
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,340
Yes.

834
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,360
But if you don't check it out and pretend you have to pee,

835
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,420
you know, it starts pretty gentle.

836
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,200
It's kind of more realistic sea life.

837
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,520
And there's some fish swimming around.

838
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,400
And then big, big parts of it is a graveyard of lost ships.

839
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,520
You go to the North Pole like the real ship did.

840
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,220
There are the real Nautilus.

841
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,360
And then they start because it's supposed to be like realistic and militaristic.

842
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,000
They have to, but they want to do goofy stuff.

843
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,400
They don't want you don't want to just look at fish and sunken ships.

844
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:05,940
Right.

845
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,960
So you see mermaids, you see Atlantis.

846
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,560
Oh, yeah.

847
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,940
This is a very active volcano.

848
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,940
That's why I was going to say a volcano.

849
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,860
It's a very active submarine trip where you see a volcano as well.

850
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:22,520
You see giant squids and a big goofy sea serpent, as we said.

851
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,680
And then they have to justify all this as that the pilot is hallucinating,

852
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,560
that he's losing his mind.

853
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,260
Yes.

854
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,720
Yeah.

855
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,400
Doesn't inspire a lot of faith

856
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,740
when your submarine captain is starting to crack.

857
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,540
Bad cat.

858
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,040
Is this the first like debut of the bad captain?

859
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,320
And I don't mean to insult Rex on Star Tours.

860
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:43,680
Yeah.

861
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,180
But is this the first is that a trope started here, perhaps?

862
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,260
Like of this?

863
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,480
I guess you could say, I mean, a bad captain is someone

864
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,200
who is tripping during captaining.

865
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,480
That is a bad captain.

866
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:54,900
No offense.

867
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,480
If it's on purpose, but if it's just, well, he should get his head together

868
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,520
and not be like.

869
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,920
Because the voyage just started.

870
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,420
Yeah.

871
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,060
So I like he should have known somebody should have known

872
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,060
to not let him take the wheel of the sub if he's going to hallucinate

873
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,160
literally a minute into the rants and raves.

874
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,620
However, wait, we said all this, but you see it too.

875
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,960
Is it that maybe he's not bad if we're seeing it?

876
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,880
But he and it is real.

877
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,680
It's just so silly that he can only justify a cross-eyed sea serpent.

878
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,960
This must be sea madness.

879
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,000
I need to check myself in somewhere as soon as this trip is over.

880
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,120
And then he's wrongfully institutionalized.

881
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,760
So he's not you're saying we're all seeing the same thing

882
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,380
and we're all kind of going through it together.

883
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,140
If we're seeing it, then yes.

884
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Yeah.

885
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,500
I think he's somebody released like there's a gas in the sub, maybe.

886
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,620
And we're all sort of on the same page with its hallucinogenic effects.

887
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,840
Or or just imagine him going home that day.

888
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,620
And it all did happen.

889
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,340
And like, how was your day at work, sweetie?

890
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,180
You're not going to believe this shit.

891
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,300
This was the most interesting day.

892
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,820
So much goddamn stuff in that sub happened.

893
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,420
And sorry, and you sorry you were only out for nine minutes.

894
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

895
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,340
Yeah.

896
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,980
Yeah, I know.

897
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,120
That's what I'm saying.

898
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,840
I saw Atlantis.

899
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,380
I saw Mermaids.

900
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:23,020
I had to do everything in my power to not get seduced by them

901
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,700
and to end up back here with you, honey.

902
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,240
Yeah.

903
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,080
So I would imagine like the it depends.

904
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,400
In the narrative of the ride, is it clear where we're supposed to be?

905
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,840
Because obviously it's not Disneyland.

906
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,040
Or is it Disneyland?

907
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,540
Is Disneyland is Atlantis contained in Disneyland?

908
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,600
I guess so.

909
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,580
So, you know, five minutes away.

910
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,680
Right.

911
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,920
It's in whatever rivers in Orange County.

912
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,760
OK, so that's interesting, too, because maybe if you're if the sub driver

913
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,300
or what you sub captain is his daily routine is going to work at Disneyland,

914
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,140
then that's a different thing than just like we're supposed to believe

915
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,380
this is a journey we're taking and it's starting in the middle of whatever.

916
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,720
Pacific Ocean or something.

917
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,660
Sure, sure.

918
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,440
So I like to think that Atlantis is actually hidden in Disneyland.

919
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,200
That's fun.

920
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:14,820
Uh huh.

921
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,200
And we should be able to.

922
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,320
It's like there was something about the air.

923
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,960
You know, Walt had a feeling he picked it seemingly at random.

924
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,940
But maybe it was it was really as many mermaids calling to him

925
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,660
from the helicopter where he was pointing at land and saying, why don't I own that?

926
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,020
Yeah.

927
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,160
The little island of Disneyland should be like a golden book.

928
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,860
You know, and then you look for the little island because of course,

929
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,280
I'm talking about the little man of Disneyland,

930
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,940
which was an old golden book where you would go.

931
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,060
You would learn about the little like leprechaun.

932
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,780
Was he leprechaun?

933
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,020
Pretty much a leprechaun.

934
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,980
Pretty much a leprechaun.

935
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,020
He lived in the land that Disneyland was built on.

936
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,940
They skirted the copyright.

937
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,300
Whoever actually owns the concept of leprechauns.

938
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:53,580
Right.

939
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:53,840
Yeah.

940
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, didn't want to pay the owner of the IP, the IP of leprechauns.

941
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,040
I what you be wanting.

942
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,560
That's that is a pirate voice.

943
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,040
Not look.

944
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,600
Irish is not something I can do.

945
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,080
No.

946
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,740
Oh, it's hard.

947
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,240
Yeah.

948
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,520
Shiver me timbers.

949
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,640
Happy St.

950
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,340
Patrick's Day.

951
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,180
I can only I'm Irish.

952
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,060
Hello, peace and love.

953
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,560
Hello.

954
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,600
Hello, from Ireland.

955
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,020
Peace and love, baby.

956
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm the little man of Disneyland.

957
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,280
When an Irish boy kisses an Irish girl.

958
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,780
So masters of voices.

959
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,220
Oh, yeah.

960
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,760
It's a three.

961
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,520
Theater of the mind.

962
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,360
So lucky you get to do theater of the mind with us.

963
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,340
There's so many voices in here.

964
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,640
You think we had the whole cover of Sergeant Pepper in the room with us.

965
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,540
We can do all the different characters from the cover of the peppers,

966
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,840
which I can only name Mae Weston, WSA Farrell.

967
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,000
Did we look up there?

968
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,020
They have the names, but are they named because of the Bee Gees movie?

969
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,680
Do they have character names or were those character names actually?

970
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,740
Well, there's Billy Shears.

971
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,380
But then the other the other ones, one of them, them is Billy Shears.

972
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,940
But I forget who the other I don't know.

973
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,240
They're all but they're all named in the Bee Gees.

974
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,000
Sergeant Pepper.

975
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,900
Yeah, I don't remember if that's from Beatles mythology or if that's something

976
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,540
the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton brought to the table.

977
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,760
That's something we have to look at.

978
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,000
Please, you know, hey, nudge us if you want us to do the Sergeant Pepper movie

979
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,020
on the second date.

980
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,460
Stop us if you don't want us to do it.

981
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,740
Stop way in either way.

982
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,380
Yeah, yeah, because, you know, when we get our sights on something.

983
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,280
I love the Sergeant Pepper.

984
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,000
I've watched it many a time willingly.

985
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,460
OK, but so there's all that stuff.

986
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,040
And, you know, something you got to give us credit for is there's two sides

987
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,980
to the submarine, two sets of windows.

988
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,880
They had to build everything twice.

989
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,680
Yeah, yeah.

990
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,060
Yeah.

991
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,620
So you built they built two rides.

992
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Yeah.

993
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,260
Good job, everybody.

994
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:41,860
Yes.

995
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,220
Most rides are only one ride.

996
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,180
Most rides are only one ride, except for this, which, yeah, that's a thing.

997
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,060
I also just never thought about.

998
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,380
Mm hmm.

999
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,300
I assumed.

1000
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:49,980
I don't know.

1001
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,760
I don't know what you're saying.

1002
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,400
You are getting a great show.

1003
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,180
And the other side are a bunch of saps.

1004
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,620
Yeah.

1005
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,840
Just look at who just see dark water.

1006
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,240
Right.

1007
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,780
And dead mermaids.

1008
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,740
Oh, no.

1009
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,360
Just floating there.

1010
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,460
We suck corpses.

1011
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,160
Oh, no.

1012
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,080
I don't want to ride on the dead side.

1013
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,180
Oh, that's true.

1014
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,880
The sea is unforgiving, son.

1015
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,820
The sooner you learn the better.

1016
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,840
Yeah.

1017
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,060
Why don't marry a mermaid?

1018
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,140
Because of course, they did have the real people playing mermaids in this lagoon.

1019
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,460
Yes.

1020
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:20,860
Yeah.

1021
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,120
Let's talk about that.

1022
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,700
Yeah.

1023
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,380
That's some odd Disney

1024
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,080
arcania that like mid 60s in the in the summer,

1025
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,500
you know, right around when Yellow Submarine was released.

1026
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,960
Of course.

1027
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,240
Yeah.

1028
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,020
There were live mermaids on the rocks who waved to visitors from the lagoon

1029
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,360
for longer than I thought.

1030
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,240
Like they were doing this for years.

1031
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,320
You have it summers.

1032
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:45,740
I think.

1033
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,620
I think there were there was some presence of mermaids around when it opened,

1034
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,380
but then it became a regular thing.

1035
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,620
Mid 60s.

1036
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,840
Do we know how do you do?

1037
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,940
You have a year that it lasted or are.

1038
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,680
I think it ended in 67.

1039
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,540
That's right.

1040
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,960
That's not like 65, 67.

1041
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:00,560
Yeah.

1042
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,520
They held auditions in the Disneyland Hotel Pool.

1043
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,420
They had a height requirement.

1044
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,080
Able bodied girls from four of four

1045
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,200
from like five, four to five, seven, I think.

1046
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,740
I'm sure everyone, the judges were very respectful.

1047
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,640
Oh, yes.

1048
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:18,780
Yes.

1049
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,180
This entire affair must have been.

1050
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,200
This must have been a delight to go through.

1051
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,720
OK, well, string your legs up.

1052
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,180
But on this but on this star bra,

1053
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,520
I would say it's pointy.

1054
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:30,980
Yeah.

1055
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,520
You'll get used to it.

1056
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:32,920
Was it?

1057
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,180
Wait, what were the words?

1058
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
Was everyone's midriff showing?

1059
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,280
Do we believe they were?

1060
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,020
Yeah.

1061
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,700
So, yeah.

1062
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,520
Oh, oh.

1063
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,200
And I was I was told many times by my mother over the years

1064
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,300
that Annette Funicello was told by Mr.

1065
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,720
Disney not to show her navel in certain movies.

1066
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,360
So if Walt was very like a prudish about seeing a lady's belly.

1067
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,520
But I wonder about in this instance,

1068
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,380
the mermaids he was not so worried about

1069
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,800
because it was accurate to the lore of mermaids.

1070
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,460
Yes, the lore of scientifically, mermaids had shell bras.

1071
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,520
So you have to go with science.

1072
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,800
So what was like, well, all right.

1073
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,420
And then he was like, oh, and there'll be a far enough way from the visitors.

1074
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,000
And they won't have to be.

1075
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,340
See the belly up close.

1076
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,860
And I'm just happy that because of their the fin

1077
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,120
that covers their second half that you don't you don't see any butt.

1078
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,720
Well, I think leg.

1079
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,680
I think but they couldn't even say leg.

1080
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,340
No, no, no, no.

1081
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,340
Gams, disgusting, sinful legs.

1082
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,080
Yeah, yeah.

1083
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,600
So but yeah.

1084
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,820
So I'm interested that Walt would allow this.

1085
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,880
I would think he should have put them in like a full mermaid, like body suit.

1086
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,000
A mermaid gown.

1087
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,400
Yes.

1088
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,000
Yes.

1089
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,280
And then they'd be in the water.

1090
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,820
The reasons they gave, you know, there there's always the anecdote of like

1091
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,560
guy, oh, there was a couple of guys who jumped in and swam out to them.

1092
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,360
And it was weird.

1093
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,400
But the reasons I saw given of like why they stopped doing this

1094
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,380
were much more like practical.

1095
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,600
Like people would stand on the walkway by the Matterhorn to take pictures.

1096
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,540
And that would cause crowding.

1097
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,440
And then the mermaids were like, we're concerned for our health.

1098
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,520
Being around this much chlorine and diesel exhaust.

1099
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,680
Yeah.

1100
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,960
Yeah, it sounds awful.

1101
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,600
Yes.

1102
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,340
Those are two bad things to be near.

1103
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,080
It turned their hair green, which is something I remember

1104
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,340
about the happening to my sister growing up.

1105
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,480
What a disturbing thing.

1106
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,300
That is weird.

1107
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,040
Just your full body goes into very chlorinated.

1108
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,500
It is weird.

1109
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,300
Yeah, yeah.

1110
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Yeah.

1111
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,420
Well, I remember specifically a girl in my neighborhood,

1112
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,920
like dyed her hair blonde over the summer and then swam in a pool a bunch.

1113
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,780
And then it was a little green.

1114
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,520
And you think like there had been a terrorist attack on her.

1115
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,940
Like she the parents were so like, and this is the green hair.

1116
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,400
I like they were just so bewildered by this.

1117
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,740
Like shell shock.

1118
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,220
Like they were like shell shock.

1119
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,480
That's a good way to put it.

1120
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,060
And a tragedy had happened to the family.

1121
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,760
Looking back, it's like this girl was 11 years old.

1122
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,220
Well, wait, are you saying that they were like upset

1123
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,540
that like something might be dangerous in the water and turn their daughters

1124
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,040
hair green, or are you saying like they didn't like the idea that she had such

1125
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,140
a wild hair color?

1126
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,080
It was a wild hair color.

1127
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,760
And it's like the grief of like when your mom would take you to get a haircut

1128
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,040
and they would do not a great job and they would just be stewing about it

1129
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,620
for days like your mom would be.

1130
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,720
I might be a Sheridan specific situation.

1131
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,280
Yeah, I'd like to hear more about this.

1132
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,020
There are Sheridan's and other mothers in the neighborhood.

1133
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,320
You just over here.

1134
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,000
And then it's like, well, and then the hair.

1135
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,640
We're not going there anymore because it's like, who gives a shit

1136
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,720
about your kids nasty hair?

1137
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,800
Like, who cares?

1138
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,200
It's going to grow back.

1139
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,740
You know, there are 10.

1140
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
It's going to grow in instantly.

1141
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,620
So this is from a direct memory of when you got a shitty little boy haircut

1142
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,980
and your mom was upset about it.

1143
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,100
Well, you see the Sheridan boy.

1144
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,540
Oh, it's a little hard to fuck up a bowl cut.

1145
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,640
Michael, you know, I agree with you.

1146
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,100
I'm just saying it sounds like this is from personal experience.

1147
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,640
I just remember so much.

1148
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,480
And it's like, and they're going to think I'm like hearing adults

1149
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,180
lament and it's like, oh, they're going to think I'm a bad mother.

1150
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,360
And it's like, who's going to think what?

1151
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,380
But then they are.

1152
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,640
This does seem like a gossipy situation.

1153
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,320
Everyone is.

1154
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,980
Everyone does.

1155
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,780
There was definitely some gossip of like, and did you see your green hair?

1156
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,180
Well, she, you know, you dye it.

1157
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:47,020
And if you go swimming too quick and it's just like, what does it matter?

1158
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,380
Yeah.

1159
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,760
What are you concerned about her health?

1160
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,140
It was just they were like, now we have a wild green hair daughter.

1161
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,300
Yeah.

1162
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:01,020
And it too, when you would swim in like friends pools in the neighborhood,

1163
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,140
it would be you would have the thought I would have the thought, at least of like,

1164
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,420
feels like there is either too much chlorine in this pool or not enough chlorine.

1165
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,540
Oh, yeah.

1166
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,920
The same token, though, you're saying that.

1167
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,300
Oh, and then my daughter's hair ended up getting dyed gray.

1168
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,460
Get over it.

1169
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,140
It's going to go back.

1170
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,200
Yeah, I am saying get over it.

1171
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,140
I am saying.

1172
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,100
Well, I just it depends on what the reasoning is, because if it's just

1173
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,780
they were worried about the color, who cares?

1174
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,620
I agree with you.

1175
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,000
But if they're saying like, you know, Mr.

1176
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,000
Johnson, they accidentally dumped the whole bottle of chlorine,

1177
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,160
the whole jug of chlorine in, and now my daughter's hair is green.

1178
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,960
My daughter doesn't have pupils anymore.

1179
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,440
Yeah.

1180
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,340
Then I understand why you would be like gossiping about Mr.

1181
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,140
Johnson's pool.

1182
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,060
I don't think ambient health, when everyone is like blasting cigs indoors

1183
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,920
and burning blueberry candles, try to clean it up.

1184
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,180
I don't think they were necessarily concerned about a very specific

1185
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,380
neighborhood picture.

1186
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,160
Blueberry candles, cigarettes, the greenest of pools

1187
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,080
and the meanest of gossip.

1188
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,500
You know, I like I like I mean, I know I know to some degree

1189
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,900
what you're saying gossip wise.

1190
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,220
You know, I remember my grandmother gossiping about her friends and everything.

1191
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,140
I do remember my mom being like a little bit too worried about,

1192
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,980
you know, maybe appearance things for me.

1193
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,760
But you are painting a very specific picture of your childhood

1194
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,340
that I would like to hear more about.

1195
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:29,060
Well, and the blueberry candles thing that stuck in my mind

1196
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,940
because I can like remember like three houses, like it was not just

1197
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,860
the next door neighbors, multiple people were covering up.

1198
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,520
We're covering up with like a Yankee candle, blueberry candle.

1199
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,600
Well, you go into town.

1200
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,260
What city are we dealing with here?

1201
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,660
Where you grew up?

1202
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:45,840
Yeah.

1203
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,840
Where were you living in this neighborhood?

1204
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,740
Oh, Booth Wynn, Porta Troychester in Delaware County.

1205
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,460
Booth.

1206
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:53,820
Whoa.

1207
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,780
That was a lot of words.

1208
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,260
Booth Wynn, Porta Troy.

1209
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,080
What?

1210
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:57,540
Booth.

1211
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:57,980
Booth Wynn.

1212
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,800
What's the name of the town?

1213
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,160
Booth Wynn was the borough.

1214
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,240
Chichester was the overall town.

1215
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:02,800
OK.

1216
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:03,820
Chichester.

1217
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,080
Chichester was like, yeah, that was our town.

1218
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,800
You've been on the show before?

1219
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,120
You're from Chichester?

1220
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,040
I'm from Chichester, Pennsylvania.

1221
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,780
Upper Chichester.

1222
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,020
And then there was a lower Chichester.

1223
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,520
I would have been able to pull that out.

1224
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,080
The Chai, as they call it.

1225
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,100
Chirac.

1226
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:21,860
Wow.

1227
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I guess I didn't know that.

1228
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,660
I would have.

1229
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,460
That's the thing I should know about you.

1230
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,880
You go to downtown Chichester and there's the bad barber.

1231
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,780
There's a barber who fucks up every haircut.

1232
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,500
And then right next to it is the all blueberry candle store.

1233
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,740
The blueberry candle store.

1234
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,920
And then the Corrie store is next to it.

1235
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,240
That's very cheap.

1236
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,480
So people buy too much of it.

1237
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:40,880
Sure.

1238
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,960
Counting for 20 cents.

1239
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,480
She goes and buys like.

1240
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,060
From your childhood?

1241
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,200
From my childhood.

1242
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:50,480
Oh, wow.

1243
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,320
It was next to one of the elementary schools.

1244
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,400
So that's cool.

1245
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:53,820
Yeah.

1246
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,880
Did you see that in the theater?

1247
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,680
It's an HBO show.

1248
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,080
Oh, yeah.

1249
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,940
Did you go to the premiere?

1250
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,480
Yeah, I know the theater.

1251
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,080
The theater.

1252
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,900
The Grumman's Chinese Theater.

1253
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,160
I know.

1254
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,700
Did you see that in the theater?

1255
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,620
I'm not completely out of it when it comes to movies and TV that are out.

1256
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,620
He saw the play it was based on.

1257
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,880
I'm more of a music guy, OK?

1258
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,640
I know new music.

1259
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,520
Got so many half hours to listen to.

1260
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,820
It doesn't have time to find out what's a movie or show.

1261
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:20,760
God damn it.

1262
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,640
I'm a music guy.

1263
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,780
We'll get to some music stuff soon.

1264
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,420
We better.

1265
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,040
Yeah.

1266
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,800
We better stop confusing me.

1267
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,740
We've got some sea shanties to discuss.

1268
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,820
Stop confusing me.

1269
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,760
Is what all I ask.

1270
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,980
OK, so

1271
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,280
all right.

1272
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,220
Mermaid's green hair.

1273
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,360
Wait, did I have another mermaid thing?

1274
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,340
Oh, they also just had to.

1275
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,220
All right.

1276
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,680
You have like ride vehicles on a trip.

1277
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,820
Big lumbering ride vehicles on a track.

1278
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,060
Probably want to keep the humans swimming nearby

1279
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,280
away from them with like a big clear fence or something.

1280
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,680
Yeah, no, it didn't do that.

1281
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,300
They was just they just said, stay 15 feet away.

1282
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,900
So the girls just had to eyeball 15 feet.

1283
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,560
And they said one of them said, if you got too close,

1284
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,380
you could feel the suction of propellers.

1285
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,160
And that scared some of the girls.

1286
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,620
Oh, it did it.

1287
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,900
Come on, a little sucker.

1288
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,380
All right.

1289
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,620
Your hair gets a little green.

1290
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,740
You get a little sucked up.

1291
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,620
It's fine.

1292
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,040
It's going to it's going to zip your fin off first.

1293
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,980
And then you'll you'll have at least one full second

1294
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,920
to get out of the propeller after that.

1295
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:24,880
You have to.

1296
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,400
This is just the worst.

1297
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,480
So worst process to get a job.

1298
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,220
And then it's the worst job that would a dangerous job.

1299
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, not not well paid, if you can imagine.

1300
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,780
And then and then like men are leering at you, throwing coins at you.

1301
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,700
Like you're a human fountain.

1302
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,240
Yeah.

1303
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,340
And then to get out of there, you had to like that because they wanted to just

1304
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,540
you know, the way they do the character meet and greets were like

1305
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,060
there's always a Mickey out.

1306
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,020
And it's like, oh, Mickey has to step away for a second.

1307
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,320
And then he does and he comes back as another Mickey.

1308
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,840
They did the same thing.

1309
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,340
We're just like quick mermaid, just quick cigarette break.

1310
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,720
And then they were just like

1311
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,300
they would have to like dive into the show building and then get picked up

1312
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,000
from there.

1313
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,040
So a dive was involved.

1314
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:11,800
You had to fully submerge again near a ride vehicle and track.

1315
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,760
And then like men were waiting there to like get them up the ladder.

1316
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,460
And I'm sure that was I'm sure that was pleasant to the men

1317
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,720
that were waiting there to take the 21 year old girls.

1318
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,920
There's no way that was incredibly inappropriate.

1319
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,620
I'm not good with names.

1320
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,080
I just call you five foot five.

1321
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,120
Ah, and that was like the nicer guy, probably.

1322
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,640
Yeah, he put out his cigarette before he hoisted you.

1323
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,700
Oh, well, if you're lucky, he did.

1324
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,580
Yeah, well, I guess, you know, they'll they'll come off in the water, probably.

1325
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,800
It won't since you wet sit, wet skin.

1326
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,200
This was not the only it was not the mermaids

1327
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,660
only who had occupational hazards working the submarine.

1328
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,800
The the drivers, the drivers, the I think this was

1329
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,320
was considered one of the worst rides to work at Disneyland.

1330
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,580
We're talking about madness and fumes and all that.

1331
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,200
It kind of happened because and a lot of us, I'm pulling from the book

1332
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,280
more mouse tales.

1333
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,040
You all right.

1334
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,140
So they're like they're standing in the middle of the vehicles.

1335
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,340
And then since they're standing, they've got like a vantage point

1336
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,340
up in that little cab, which is that, you know, that's a little like

1337
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,460
head cage that they're in basically.

1338
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,180
And at least the way it used to work, the air circulation on the submarine

1339
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,160
for how many people got on board, probably like close to 40.

1340
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,420
And so you've got diesel fumes.

1341
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,860
You've got chlorine.

1342
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,320
You've got the smells of every one of all of these strangers mixing on board.

1343
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,700
I don't think ventilation is great, really, beyond that.

1344
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,480
So like stranger smells diesel chlorine, all getting like perfectly trapped

1345
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,760
up in that little head box that they're in.

1346
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,940
God, like if you took all of those smells and put it in a hat box

1347
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,480
and then put the hat box on and then had to do it for an entire 10 minute trip.

1348
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,420
That's kind of what this was like.

1349
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,760
Quote, you spent that you spent the day sucking diesel fumes and chlorine.

1350
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,360
Various employees called it obnoxious, the worst and a dungeon.

1351
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,640
Oh, my God.

1352
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,160
There was a it's an eight minute, 15 second trip, or it was at least.

1353
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,840
If a kid got scared,

1354
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,000
Mike style and could not use the bathroom excuse and was upset and claustrophobia

1355
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,600
or reasonably claustrophobia is a real thing on this ride.

1356
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,100
Sure.

1357
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,920
But if it happened to a kid and they like they wanted out, there was no way out.

1358
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,300
There's nothing you could do.

1359
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,200
So that's the full eight minute trip with just screaming child the whole time.

1360
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,740
There was also a story of a woman.

1361
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,080
This smells especially bad one day.

1362
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,820
And there's some grumbling driver realizes a woman is changing her baby's diaper

1363
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:59,060
mid ride, then ride finishes and she just gets off and leaves the diaper

1364
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,380
just sitting on the chair.

1365
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,340
God bless her.

1366
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,500
God bless her for that.

1367
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:02,980
Yeah.

1368
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,460
Wow.

1369
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,240
The lack of awareness.

1370
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,580
And then so he the driver just like I am not letting her get away with this.

1371
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,680
And she and he ran down, got it, said to her, hey, you left a package on board.

1372
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,660
And she was like, oh, I did not expecting the diaper.

1373
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,020
She puts her hand out and he just plops the diaper in her hand,

1374
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,180
waves and walks away.

1375
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,020
And all the other passengers were still close by.

1376
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,320
So they all gave a round of applause to that.

1377
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,160
That is a good story.

1378
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,600
So you have to add in that one trip, the smell of baby shit

1379
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,100
to all those things that the driver had to endure trapped in a submarine.

1380
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Yeah, because, you know, we've been through this.

1381
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,040
Well, we have a diaper genie, of course, that traps the the sole of the poops.

1382
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,580
And when you open up the top of it,

1383
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,140
like the containment unit and Ghostbusters,

1384
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,020
you get the ghost of every poop that she's ever made.

1385
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,380
So imagine putting your head in there and then a button

1386
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,140
and gasoline and chlorine on top of that.

1387
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,220
Add in the other one.

1388
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:00,640
All right.

1389
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,740
Have a good 10 minutes.

1390
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:02,800
Yes.

1391
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,560
And that's a good that's a scented thing.

1392
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,600
The diaper genie.

1393
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,300
Yeah.

1394
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,820
Is diaper genie not one of the things that's like handed down to new parents?

1395
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,380
Ah, you shouldn't be.

1396
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,220
Yeah, no, yeah, yeah.

1397
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,640
We've had two different diaper pail.

1398
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,800
We've had the diaper genie is newer and it's a little more efficient

1399
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,920
than the old one we had, but it's it's designed to make it seem like

1400
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,440
it's going to not absorb the smell as bad as the other ones.

1401
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,620
But I don't believe that that is happening.

1402
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,140
I believe it smells.

1403
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,820
The ghosts are stuck in there.

1404
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,300
And you'd have to have a really expensive thing

1405
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,800
that could completely like completely stay fresh forever.

1406
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,680
So if you're having a baby shower and somebody shows up

1407
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:54,060
with a clearly re gifted diaper, diaper genie with a big smile, I'm waiting.

1408
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,540
Yeah, I would say you unless they've like doused it in chlorine or something

1409
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,940
to kill it, to kill the germs or bleach or something.

1410
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,100
And maybe that would work.

1411
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,160
I don't think they should probably gift it.

1412
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,760
I that's my feeling.

1413
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,680
Maybe I'm wrong.

1414
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,660
Maybe you can effectively clean it.

1415
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,740
But I'll say that the last diaper pail that was still pretty or whatever

1416
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,840
diaper garbage can, I tried cleaning it.

1417
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:16,860
Impossible.

1418
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,580
There were just part of like they were just in there.

1419
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,900
It was baked in there forever.

1420
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,380
And I said, this is I spent like a half hour trying to do it.

1421
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,060
And I was like, never mind getting a new one.

1422
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:27,820
Yes.

1423
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,120
No, no.

1424
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,040
Not working.

1425
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,320
So we'll see.

1426
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,600
We'll see in a couple of months.

1427
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,120
And when I will see in a couple of months if it's if it's baked in forever

1428
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,140
on this thing.

1429
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,280
But I think it is.

1430
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,300
If it needs a refurb.

1431
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,140
So, yeah.

1432
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,780
So I don't know if the insides of a submarine would keep the

1433
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,380
the duty smell of a baby's poop

1434
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,680
stuck in there.

1435
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,340
I don't know.

1436
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,480
The pilot of the submarine,

1437
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,420
I saw they had a seat for a little while.

1438
00:54:59,500 --> 00:54:59,880
OK.

1439
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,100
And that was removed

1440
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,520
because they would stop paying attention and getting collisions.

1441
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,340
Oh, no.

1442
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,520
And then the other thing is, and this made me want to

1443
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,380
try and find other rides with this.

1444
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,820
There was a dead man switch.

1445
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,960
Are you guys familiar with the concept of a dead man switch?

1446
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,700
I usually do.

1447
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,400
I saw that phrase and I don't know what it is.

1448
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,320
So I think it goes back to locomotives

1449
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:31,840
and the idea being it has to be depressed or squeezed at all times.

1450
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,220
And if it if it lets go,

1451
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,220
if you let go of it,

1452
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,100
it like it would stop.

1453
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,020
It would stop going, I believe.

1454
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,060
What is it?

1455
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:51,780
Well, it's like a button or like a lever you have to constantly hold on to.

1456
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,240
I always learned about it from like trains in the Old West.

1457
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,700
If bandits came on board and shot the conductor,

1458
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,680
shot the right, you really got it.

1459
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,740
They would release it and the train would stop so that it wouldn't be out of control.

1460
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,680
So there was a dead man switch on the submarine.

1461
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,240
Oh, interesting.

1462
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,160
But then that made me go, how many attractions have a dead man switch?

1463
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,900
And I understand why it's called a dead man switch, a dead man's switch.

1464
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,100
But were they afraid that one of the sub captains was going to die mid journey?

1465
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,820
I guess there would be some sort of incident.

1466
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,880
They did apparently deal with collisions back in the day.

1467
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,140
And like, I think your little sub running into another little sub.

1468
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,320
So I guess it was very unnerving.

1469
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,980
Well, yeah, I wouldn't like that.

1470
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,600
So I guess they were just like they don't they don't trust the people

1471
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,060
they hired necessarily to not get like zoned out during one of these

1472
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,900
like turnarounds.

1473
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,140
Zoned out or zonked by diesel fumes.

1474
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:54,680
Right.

1475
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,000
So they had because that seems like it's so unpleasant to be holding this thing

1476
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,580
all day long.

1477
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,140
Yeah.

1478
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,740
To make sure for 10 minute.

1479
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,240
Right.

1480
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:03,700
Yeah.

1481
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,300
So I guess I guess it worked.

1482
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,720
Maybe.

1483
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,400
I don't know.

1484
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,560
You pay attention.

1485
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,860
You hold you keep a thing.

1486
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,420
You hold it.

1487
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,400
You don't drop it.

1488
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:11,860
Right.

1489
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,420
And a seat is distracting.

1490
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,780
Because, yeah, if you if there's if somebody's changing a diaper right near

1491
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,540
that captain and he passes out, then the thing will stop.

1492
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,080
So that's good.

1493
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,720
I guess it's good.

1494
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,340
I guess it's smart.

1495
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,900
This is the the difficulties of running the thing are one issue.

1496
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,820
Another is this this lagoon is massive.

1497
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,760
Apparently, when it opened, it was the largest body of filtered water in the world.

1498
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,120
Wow.

1499
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:38,840
I didn't see that.

1500
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,040
That doesn't as I say it.

1501
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,120
It doesn't sound right, because aren't there like wave pools or like those big,

1502
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,140
you know, like by the by the pier in Santa Cruz is like a big bathing hall.

1503
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,580
Maybe they weren't filtered.

1504
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,260
I don't know.

1505
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,180
Maybe it was a lie.

1506
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:50,920
Could be a lie.

1507
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,300
Like when they said it was the eighth largest submarine fleet,

1508
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,600
because that's not true, because they aren't submarines if they're right.

1509
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,800
Right.

1510
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,180
But anyway, I think what is true is that they refurbished this ride in 1988.

1511
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,580
They they did the like the longest drain of it that they'd done in a long time.

1512
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,940
And they found that the lagoon was losing three hundred

1513
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,400
thousand gallons of water a day.

1514
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,360
Oh, God.

1515
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,060
Every day, chlorinated water

1516
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,760
seeping into the below.

1517
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,600
Not a good, not good for all the residents of Atlantis.

1518
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,160
And and also it like, oh, OK, wait.

1519
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,820
So they they fixed that.

1520
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,200
All right.

1521
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,860
Let's seal up all those cracks and everything.

1522
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,380
And they got it to where post the refurbishment,

1523
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,820
they only lost a mere 50,000 a day.

1524
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,200
That's what it was.

1525
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,120
That's reasonable.

1526
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,700
Potentially still is.

1527
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,420
This is when you're dealing with something that hasn't been done,

1528
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:49,080
when nobody's made a like last year, lined submarine lagoon or whatever it is.

1529
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:50,680
Yeah.

1530
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,840
So this gets us into and we know, look, we this this whole area,

1531
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,360
this is interconnected with Autopia, which we've had our complaints about,

1532
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,120
which we've had our eye on real estate wise.

1533
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,180
It doesn't smell good coming out of those cars.

1534
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,980
Then all this really is like eco disaster alley.

1535
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,420
Yes.

1536
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,000
You could justify you could justify it using just the environment

1537
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,880
to demolish, not just that we want a new rider.

1538
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,100
If we need to get past the purists, right.

1539
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,860
Like need this to still be there because they grew up with it.

1540
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,900
Maybe that is a good reason.

1541
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,020
An exaggerated they're willing to lie about some of these facts.

1542
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,080
If they need to falsify an EPA report

1543
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,580
to get these things out of there.

1544
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Yes.

1545
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,560
Yes.

1546
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,140
So I think that's a good justification for.

1547
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,500
Yeah.

1548
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,220
Demolition.

1549
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:37,300
Yeah.

1550
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,440
I in the defunct land video, Kevin mentions

1551
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,920
this used nine million gallons of water to save full.

1552
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,420
Jaws the ride.

1553
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,920
Also, a lot of a lot of water.

1554
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,780
That was only five million gallons, so nearly half.

1555
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,440
Whoa.

1556
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,220
Really?

1557
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,340
That seems so much bigger.

1558
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,180
That's interesting.

1559
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,720
Yeah.

1560
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,500
But I don't know if that's deep.

1561
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:01,820
Oh, maybe.

1562
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:02,160
Yeah.

1563
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,080
Maybe that's.

1564
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,940
Oh, maybe it's kind of shallow.

1565
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,820
Yeah, could be.

1566
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,360
I don't know.

1567
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,760
I'm kind of I'm heading to Nemo era or closure era.

1568
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:09,960
Yeah.

1569
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,020
Anything before we we do that?

1570
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,240
Well, I know.

1571
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,080
I think about the military days that we miss.

1572
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,060
Yeah, I don't think so.

1573
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,960
I've never got to go on this version of it.

1574
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,200
No, they were.

1575
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,400
They were painted yellow in 86, which is Jason said is the word

1576
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,120
becomes research subs.

1577
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,080
And that's what I knew.

1578
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:28,600
That's right.

1579
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,680
First Disneyland visit.

1580
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,340
So they which I've always I like the yellow.

1581
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,000
I think it's friendly and nice.

1582
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,580
I like seeing them go.

1583
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,080
Yeah.

1584
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:34,600
Yeah.

1585
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:39,440
The names, the names change and when it reopened in 87.

1586
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,500
Mm hmm.

1587
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,020
The original names are a very.

1588
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:52,560
Military focus, not a sea wolf, skate, skipjack, Triton.

1589
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,440
Like skipjack.

1590
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,600
Skipjack is cool.

1591
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,080
Yeah.

1592
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:55,320
Yeah.

1593
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,440
That's a syndicated show.

1594
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,160
I would watch seven seasons of and then the last three are all revolutionary

1595
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,700
war figures, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Ethan Allen.

1596
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,260
Oh, Ethan Allen sub.

1597
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,920
Not you.

1598
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,400
Don't get confused.

1599
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,380
Not Byron Allen.

1600
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,820
Oh, sorry.

1601
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,380
I do get you're thinking.

1602
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,640
I love Ethan Allen's comics unleashed.

1603
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,580
I was thinking of that.

1604
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:17,740
Yeah.

1605
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,880
So then they switch to Nautilus Neptune.

1606
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,960
Nautilus is the same Nautilus Neptune, Seasar, Explorer, Seeker,

1607
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,100
Argonaut, Triton, Sea Wolf.

1608
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,280
And it was written on the subs, these names somewhere.

1609
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,980
Could we have any confirmation of that?

1610
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,120
Think anyone know these must be right.

1611
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,700
I would think so, because then, like, you know, we've talked about many times

1612
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,180
on the show how exciting it was to get certain cars on dark rides.

1613
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,180
You get different dwarves and the seven.

1614
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,460
Oh, I'm Seastar or nothing.

1615
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:48,960
Yeah.

1616
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:49,580
You know what?

1617
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,860
I won't even go on.

1618
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:51,800
Unless it's Seastar.

1619
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,320
We're getting Ethan Allen today.

1620
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:54,680
Yeah.

1621
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,460
Oh, skipjack.

1622
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,540
Oh, we don't skipjack.

1623
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,400
Oh, skipjack got full.

1624
01:01:58,740 --> 01:01:59,860
Oh, we get the next.

1625
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,160
Yeah.

1626
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,020
Like we are all children who would have like.

1627
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:03,460
Yeah.

1628
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,580
Patrick Henry.

1629
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:05,820
Hooray.

1630
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,780
Hello, Henry.

1631
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:08,880
Submarine.

1632
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,600
I know him from my studies.

1633
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,760
Argonaut again.

1634
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:19,160
But I yeah, I don't I don't see much discussion about the different names

1635
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,440
when people are recounting.

1636
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,380
That being said, I also don't see a ton of discussion about the subs in general.

1637
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,940
I feel like the subs and maybe getting ahead of myself again.

1638
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,860
The subs discourse is just once in a while when someone threatens to take it away.

1639
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,080
That's when somebody goes, hey, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

1640
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,320
We need them.

1641
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,300
Versus like there's

1642
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,300
there's rides that people are constantly talking about that have been there for 50 years.

1643
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:38,800
Sure.

1644
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:39,280
Yeah.

1645
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,800
I think it's just that you go back into Walt era.

1646
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,320
I think if it's a Walt thing.

1647
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,560
And I think this was like a primary memory for a lot of people.

1648
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:51,120
Imagine go back to pre pirates of the Caribbean, pre haunted mansion Disneyland.

1649
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,880
If you're doing that, then this is one of the best things to do.

1650
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,320
You're you're locked in on this.

1651
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:55,600
Yeah.

1652
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,740
And it feels sure.

1653
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,700
Yes, it feels special, especially the subs.

1654
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,700
I would even say the subs more than Autopia,

1655
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,820
just because you've been in a car at that point, probably.

1656
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,880
Obviously, you're going to drive the car, which is.

1657
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,600
Yeah, I think there I think there's more of that.

1658
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,000
I think there's more love of my first drive on Utopia.

1659
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,680
Utah, Utopia, Utopia, Utopia.

1660
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,300
Yeah, I guess, I guess.

1661
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:22,120
But it just for as a kid, I just remember this blowing my mind a little bit more,

1662
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,040
even though I liked Utopia and or the speedway.

1663
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,960
This definitely felt like kind of a crazy thing you got to do.

1664
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,240
Sure.

1665
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:30,740
Yeah.

1666
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,000
Well, you were a big James Mason kid.

1667
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,700
You love that Peter Rennet day sound I like.

1668
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:42,780
You were you never not look, I knew who he was,

1669
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,200
but you were the James Mason boy.

1670
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,500
There's no question.

1671
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,400
Yeah, no question.

1672
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,160
Yeah, yeah.

1673
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:53,080
Well, let's talk about the subs disappearance when it when it went away.

1674
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,940
I think it was rumored for a long time.

1675
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,680
And people this is a very like online upset thing.

1676
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,260
You know, it's it's like it's a cheapening out era.

1677
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,340
The Paul Pressler era era we're losing.

1678
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,100
If you don't know, he's like he was a controversial president of the Disneyland

1679
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:11,680
Resort.

1680
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:16,060
It was like cutting what a lot of people felt were basics and fundamentals.

1681
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:16,640
Yes.

1682
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,480
Eventually, he says, you know, this thing's getting a little outdated.

1683
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,720
I think we are looking at what else to do there.

1684
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,000
And it closes.

1685
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:28,660
It closes in September 98, right after New Tomorrowland opened.

1686
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,220
Yeah.

1687
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,780
So like tomorrow lands back and refreshed and better than ever.

1688
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,800
And now that body of water over there.

1689
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,320
No, that's a that's going to be a graveyard for a while.

1690
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,240
Don't worry about that.

1691
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,740
Don't ask questions about that.

1692
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,040
Something was in the air, I guess, because remember, right at the turn of the millennium,

1693
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,260
they're like, all right, and that's it for horizons.

1694
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,580
Yeah, right.

1695
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,080
Yeah.

1696
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,100
Looking right.

1697
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,520
Well, I think if if anything needed some serious love, if anything needed some

1698
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,880
some love and care, they decided instead to blow it up and do something else.

1699
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,840
This taking the subs away was not the audience wasn't happy.

1700
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,460
The Imagineers weren't happy.

1701
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,620
I found some some quotes.

1702
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,040
The great Tony Baxter told on the day when it closed, he told Paul Pressler,

1703
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,260
this is one of the worst days of my life.

1704
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,660
It's a pretty good life if you're the submarines going away.

1705
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,940
Yeah, it's a little dramatic, I suppose.

1706
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,060
Tony, don't worry.

1707
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,220
It's going to get worse.

1708
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,560
They're going to close more shit.

1709
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,160
Oh, yeah.

1710
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,720
Yeah, no kidding.

1711
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,100
Yeah, which you see what happens to Figment.

1712
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:36,460
Marty Sklar said if they close the subs,

1713
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,060
if we close the subs without a replacement ready,

1714
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,960
I will lie in the middle of Harbor Boulevard.

1715
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,300
That is something he said.

1716
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,220
And then it happened.

1717
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,280
It totally happened.

1718
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,280
He didn't follow through.

1719
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,260
And that's good.

1720
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,260
Lived a lived a good life for that.

1721
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,260
Getting crushed by a car.

1722
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,660
Not to say that they didn't try

1723
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:03,780
because there was an era in which all hopes were on a little movie,

1724
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:07,120
a little movie that we hope will be the movie that could.

1725
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,640
Yeah, it's a movie called Atlantis,

1726
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,940
sub called The Lost Empire?

1727
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:13,920
Question mark.

1728
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:14,960
Does that sound right?

1729
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,140
I've never seen it.

1730
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,920
Atlantis, the lost empire.

1731
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,480
Atlantis, the lost empire.

1732
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:24,420
This is maybe the way to get life into that lagoon again.

1733
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,300
And I'd only heard that rumor.

1734
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:27,220
I hadn't heard more.

1735
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,280
I looked into is there more?

1736
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,440
There was more.

1737
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,800
This would have been no mere reskin.

1738
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,040
We aren't just throwing the beloved characters down there.

1739
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,580
You don't just pass by Milo's thatch

1740
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,240
or Commander Lyle Tiberius Rourke.

1741
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,040
There's more than that.

1742
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,020
Tiberius, that was the middle name of Captain James T.

1743
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,820
Kirk played by William Shatner.

1744
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,000
Must have been a nod.

1745
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,120
I think so.

1746
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:52,660
Wow.

1747
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:57,200
Lyle Tiberius Rourke is a reference to James Tiberius.

1748
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:57,520
Kirk.

1749
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,060
That's right.

1750
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,240
So there's actually, there's concept art of this

1751
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,300
that you can look at.

1752
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,320
And it would have been like,

1753
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,900
in addition to, you know, reskinning the submarines

1754
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,200
and like, and refreshing them

1755
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,440
and making it all look cooler over there,

1756
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,940
they were gonna build a big volcano.

1757
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,720
This was pre Disney sea.

1758
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,040
Right.

1759
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,180
I'm trying to remember if I took a screenshot of it or not.

1760
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,660
But you could like,

1761
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,560
it would have been a ride that dropped you off.

1762
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:29,240
You would have actually gotten out.

1763
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,120
Oh wait, I got it.

1764
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:33,300
I mean, it looks extremely like, it's very Disney sea.

1765
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,740
It's very like what they're doing,

1766
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,640
the Peter Pan area that's opening scene, Fantasy Springs.

1767
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,920
And then there was gonna be stuff to do in that volcano.

1768
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,300
Look at this concept art.

1769
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:44,940
This is a macula.

1770
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:45,680
Yeah, that obviously is awesome.

1771
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,540
Yeah, it's really cool.

1772
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:52,180
And then Monorail is, still runs through it.

1773
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,340
It runs through the volcano.

1774
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:53,880
Yeah.

1775
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:55,700
Looks really neat.

1776
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,560
Here's something I didn't know.

1777
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,540
Not only did that concept art get drawn up,

1778
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,400
they were trying, the Imagineers desperate to do this,

1779
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,960
really wanting to do it,

1780
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,820
actually put a tarp over the submarine area.

1781
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:09,580
You sound this?

1782
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,360
Yeah, it's so good.

1783
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,220
This is crazy.

1784
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,860
Almost as if to like broadcast,

1785
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,800
it was like a hostage message.

1786
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,840
Like, can we blink and let the people on the outside know

1787
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,700
we're sure we're okay in here?

1788
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,740
They put up a sign without asking management

1789
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,200
that says Atlantis expedition,

1790
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,160
Imagineering preparation, something or other.

1791
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,060
The hubris there, I suppose.

1792
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,300
That's like, hey, pretty punk you gotta say, right?

1793
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,540
You do have to say that.

1794
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,640
They just did it, didn't ask permission.

1795
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,900
Tony Baxter, who I assume thinks the Beatles

1796
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,060
are too rock and roll.

1797
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,360
Definitely a punk move on his part.

1798
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,560
He listens to exclusively Sherman Brothers.

1799
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:54,820
I would think so.

1800
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,800
I would think he's a James Mason kid.

1801
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,320
He was not a Ringo Starr kid.

1802
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:01,380
Too wild.

1803
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:07,660
Atlantis, it did, I guess, kind of make its money back.

1804
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,080
Wasn't a total bomb.

1805
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:09,900
Have you seen it?

1806
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,740
No, I've never seen it.

1807
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,620
I was like, oh, I should find that on,

1808
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,480
assume it's on Disney+.

1809
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,060
Some of the movies it opened against around that time,

1810
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,300
Shrek, Lara Croft, Tomb Raider, Dr.

1811
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,240
Doolittle 2,

1812
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,960
and The Fast and the Furious.

1813
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,520
So stiff competition that summer.

1814
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,180
All of those battles, I think.

1815
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:32,300
This from the sound of it.

1816
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:32,720
I think so.

1817
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,320
These are all big hits.

1818
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,800
And think about all the movies that didn't do well

1819
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,760
that would have given us cool shit like that.

1820
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,740
Like all these movies that you're like,

1821
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:43,860
ha ha, Atlantis or whatever.

1822
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:44,820
And like, I haven't seen it.

1823
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,040
I don't know, maybe it's a good one.

1824
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,180
But all these different movies

1825
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,960
that if it actually had been a massive hit,

1826
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,100
we would be in better shape parts-wise.

1827
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,800
As we talk about Tomorrowland

1828
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,900
and the Tomorrowland curse and the Tomorrowland problem,

1829
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,600
hopes keep getting pinned on movies

1830
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,040
that don't end up doing great.

1831
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,520
And one of those obviously being Tomorrowland in general.

1832
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,300
It is too bad that the futuristic properties

1833
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,480
keep not working out.

1834
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,360
And it's just the fact that all we got at this point

1835
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:19,300
is Tron and that the Tron movies technically do well.

1836
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,520
Even enough that they're making,

1837
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,640
they're making Tren,

1838
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,000
which I'm ripping off from many people online.

1839
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,940
There was a director's chair of Tron 3

1840
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:33,940
styled as TR3N, which just looks like Tren.

1841
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,740
So Tren's happening.

1842
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,300
Leto, Gillian Anderson.

1843
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,240
Never miss Leto, I call him.

1844
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,880
No matter what you put him in.

1845
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,780
No matter what Disney property you put him in,

1846
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,480
guaranteed box office gold.

1847
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,720
Mama Mia, I'm in the game, Greg.

1848
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,640
Yeah, that's right.

1849
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,280
I hope he does his Versace voice.

1850
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,140
Versace or his WeWork voice?

1851
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:57,780
Oh yeah.

1852
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,080
Master of voices.

1853
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,480
Like, Tex Avery is back.

1854
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,400
Like, Bud gets the ride.

1855
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,540
Yeah, same thing.

1856
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,780
Maybe he'll do a Ringo voice.

1857
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:12,420
So yes, Tron is the only, technically successful.

1858
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,620
I'm like, how many Trons are we gonna get?

1859
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,880
Though again, I think I'm in the top tier of Tron fans

1860
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,040
and I don't care for the movies.

1861
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,400
Yeah, I guess it can't be upset

1862
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,080
that they're trying to do more.

1863
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,740
But if it leads to more, yeah, I don't,

1864
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,700
the odds are low that I'll be seeing Tren.

1865
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,760
Yeah.

1866
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,640
I think they should do Tomorrowland,

1867
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,440
Two-morrowland with a two.

1868
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,780
Two and then, yeah, no T on the Tomorrowland.

1869
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:38,280
And then it'll catch up this time.

1870
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,460
Like, the cult will have.

1871
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,440
I will, we've said it before.

1872
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,140
I know, real quick.

1873
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:45,200
Nothing was kind of more exciting than the idea of like,

1874
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,060
Brad Bird is doing a movie called Tomorrowland

1875
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,460
about the Disneyland Tomorrowland.

1876
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,120
I was like, holy shit, whoa.

1877
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,840
Those are the days when you didn't know

1878
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,000
that wasn't gonna work out,

1879
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,040
when you could just go to the park whenever you wanted.

1880
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,820
None of these ticket reservations,

1881
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,060
none of this nonsense.

1882
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,580
You never know how good you have it

1883
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,060
at a certain moment in your life.

1884
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:03,980
Probably for some of that,

1885
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,240
we had a real president, George W.

1886
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:06,700
Bush.

1887
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,300
Okay, I assume Obama was in the White House

1888
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:11,740
at this point.

1889
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,760
For some of it, yeah.

1890
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,380
For some of it, but.

1891
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,780
Well, I don't like to talk about that.

1892
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:17,080
I hear you.

1893
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,920
I miss those.

1894
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,840
Sure, sure, the good old days, as they call them.

1895
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,320
But yeah, no, I was just like, oh my God,

1896
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,320
the idea of it, the concept of that,

1897
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,600
and then the idea that, well,

1898
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,740
once this thing takes over the box office,

1899
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,380
now we're getting.

1900
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,480
Matter of time, anything he does is a hit.

1901
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,720
Slam dunk.

1902
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:34,380
Uh-huh.

1903
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:34,700
Yeah.

1904
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,320
Yeah.

1905
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,240
Wonder what that Star Wars would have been like too,

1906
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,080
because he was gonna do one.

1907
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,700
He was gonna do.

1908
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,520
At first Star Wars?

1909
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,220
He was in there pre-JJ, yeah.

1910
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,440
Well, and George, look, George was working on it

1911
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,300
before he sold to Disney.

1912
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,800
What would have George's pure vision,

1913
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,580
I mean, he was gonna do the,

1914
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,240
George was gonna direct the first one.

1915
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:52,860
That was the whole plan,

1916
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,480
is George was gonna direct seven and then sell to Disney.

1917
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,220
But that would have been the Wills.

1918
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,500
Yes.

1919
01:12:58,700 --> 01:12:58,860
Yeah.

1920
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,180
I explained the Wills from scratch

1921
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,100
to what George Lucas's vision of episode seven

1922
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,480
was gonna be.

1923
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:05,560
I explained the Wills from scratch to Aaron

1924
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,600
as best I could.

1925
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:06,880
Oh no, she was delighted.

1926
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,660
And by that, I mean, it's gonna be about the Wills,

1927
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,920
but the little, the forces right up with the Wills.

1928
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,500
Just the glaze over.

1929
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:13,900
And Wills.

1930
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,220
I think her head just hit the table

1931
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,420
to take her to the hospital.

1932
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,500
Wills are not mitochondria.

1933
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:20,480
Midichlorians.

1934
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,260
Midichlorians.

1935
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,240
Well, they're not that either.

1936
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,380
They're not that either.

1937
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,520
No, they're not, neither of the things we just said, yes.

1938
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,260
We'll get into everything that the Wills are not.

1939
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,200
Yeah, so yeah, that would have been the Wills,

1940
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,600
but yeah, there's the different timelines for what happens.

1941
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,640
A very interesting to speculate on.

1942
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,000
Yep.

1943
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,220
But I think we're,

1944
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,040
I think whatever we're in right now

1945
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,680
is just the worst timeline for everything.

1946
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,120
For all things.

1947
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,660
Everything, all things, yes.

1948
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,280
We need the Wills.

1949
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,220
We do need the Wills.

1950
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,140
The Wills can save us.

1951
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,220
We do need the Wills.

1952
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,760
Maybe they'll go back now.

1953
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:50,840
George, we were wrong.

1954
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,960
Please make the Wills movie.

1955
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,440
80-year-old George.

1956
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,820
Stars episode seven, the great Wills adventure.

1957
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,320
I shouldn't say 80-year-old George.

1958
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,680
Scorsese is just firing on all cylinders still.

1959
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,860
You got Ridley Scott shooting three movies a year.

1960
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,160
George, come on.

1961
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,460
Come out of retirement.

1962
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,540
Let's see those Wills.

1963
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,260
I just wanna know what one looks like.

1964
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,020
Are they cute?

1965
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,320
Are the Wills cute?

1966
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,860
Look, very good chance the Wills were bad and boring,

1967
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:20,120
but we would be doing so much Wills content.

1968
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,680
We would be laughing and laughing about the Wills.

1969
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,380
And we're talking about the Wills now.

1970
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,080
It would have brightened up all of our lives

1971
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,980
if we knew what the Wills looked like

1972
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,280
and we could see them realized on screen.

1973
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,040
Same movie, Han Solo gets all,

1974
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,840
Kylo kills Han Solo, or maybe he doesn't,

1975
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,280
all right, he pushes him,

1976
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,800
he's falling off the edge, he starts falling,

1977
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,880
but then a bunch of Wills all get together and,

1978
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:42,480
let's go Wills.

1979
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,480
It's like when the,

1980
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:43,900
Swans.

1981
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,160
And they lift him back up and then he clocks his son

1982
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,460
in the face and Kylo's dead and that's the end of seven.

1983
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,020
Thank you, Wills.

1984
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,720
It's like when the big minion hand,

1985
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,840
all the minions make like a hand to save you.

1986
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,240
Yeah, the M&M's minis.

1987
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:55,900
The Wills are like,

1988
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:59,380
they all form, I, oh, I'm liking these Wills now.

1989
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,420
George, come on.

1990
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,280
Come out of retirement.

1991
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,740
Buy it back, George.

1992
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:07,160
And publish a book of all those TV episodes.

1993
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,580
George, we want your green screen background

1994
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:13,960
only Wills movie that you only wanted to shoot

1995
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:14,680
for four hours a day.

1996
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,140
We want you not directing actors.

1997
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,260
We want you not looking actors in the eye.

1998
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,460
Give us the magic.

1999
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,180
Bring the magic back, George, with the Wills.

2000
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,780
Okay, well, speaking of bringing the magic back,

2001
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:31,060
for close to a decade, the lagoon sat dormant, unused.

2002
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:31,500
Yeah.

2003
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,500
Imagineers all livid, embarrassed to go to work each day.

2004
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:39,180
Also, that happened in Florida.

2005
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,040
Yeah.

2006
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,360
They closed 20,000 leagues

2007
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,140
and then it was just scenery for a while

2008
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,500
and then they used some of it to build a fucking playground

2009
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,240
called Pooh's Playful Spot, which get out of here.

2010
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:53,700
Come on.

2011
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,260
You're upset by that.

2012
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,840
You hate Pooh's Playful Spot.

2013
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,960
I hate Pooh's Playful Spot

2014
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,980
because my family loved 20,000 leagues under the sea.

2015
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:00,720
Oh, okay.

2016
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,960
Pooh shows up with a dagger

2017
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,020
and he takes it to Mr.

2018
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:06,460
Toad.

2019
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,960
We talked about that recently.

2020
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:08,400
Right, yeah.

2021
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:11,700
And then he takes it 20,000 leagues.

2022
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:12,540
He shivs Kirk Douglas.

2023
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,180
He slit Mr.

2024
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,100
Toad's throat.

2025
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,920
He disemboweled Badger

2026
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,900
and then he just ripped Kirk Douglas's nuts off.

2027
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:24,420
That's what Pooh, the nice guy Pooh, is up to.

2028
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,160
Who's next?

2029
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,240
Pooh's next.

2030
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,360
Oh, blood and honey is right.

2031
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,100
Is that one of the blood and honey taglines?

2032
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:32,840
Pooh's next.

2033
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,480
Pooh's next.

2034
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:33,780
Pooh's next.

2035
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:34,540
That's pretty good.

2036
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,720
The sequel could be.

2037
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,020
Yeah.

2038
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,000
But hey, there's hope on the horizon.

2039
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:44,640
A movie about the ocean does well, does extremely well.

2040
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:48,100
Finding Nemo becomes clearly the way to revive this thing.

2041
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,820
Same with the sea cabs and the living seas.

2042
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,480
And we get these, both of those attractions

2043
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,500
that have these new, these sophisticated

2044
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,200
underwater projection techniques.

2045
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:04,300
The Finding Nemo era also fixes another submarine problem.

2046
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,980
All of the chlorine and all of the heat and sunlight

2047
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:12,060
would drench the, like get rid of the paint, essentially,

2048
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,020
on anything that was color.

2049
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,780
Any colorful coral reef would just get zapped

2050
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,180
in the submarine lagoon.

2051
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,740
So they had to, but the Finding Nemo is very colorful.

2052
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,260
We gotta do something different there.

2053
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,000
So they developed a new technique.

2054
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
They used painted glass.

2055
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,580
It's all, it's micro glass.

2056
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,640
It's cool sounding.

2057
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,660
It looks really, it looks fantastic.

2058
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,940
There's scenes of this that are wonderful.

2059
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,620
Doesn't also, really doesn't sound like a good thing

2060
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:39,000
health-wise either, but they're not making

2061
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,040
alive women swim in there anymore.

2062
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:42,580
Yeah.

2063
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,760
So maybe it's okay.

2064
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,260
Right.

2065
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,020
I'll say a lot of nice things about Nemo era.

2066
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,360
I think great art direction.

2067
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,560
I think just like pure, like the craft

2068
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,960
of these big set pieces.

2069
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,280
Yeah.

2070
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,480
I think that screen blending is wonderful.

2071
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,980
Lasseter and Baxter worked together.

2072
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,700
They teamed up on this one.

2073
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,460
This seemed like a passion project for both.

2074
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:06,420
This was in that pre, before Lasseter goes away.

2075
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:07,080
Yeah.

2076
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,920
And he's Mr.

2077
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:09,840
Parks now.

2078
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,780
And he was good about like firing up.

2079
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,080
Why is the subs nothing?

2080
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:16,460
Why is Summit of California Adventure nothing?

2081
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,180
So he wrapped his arms around this attraction

2082
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,080
and hugged it until it got much better.

2083
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,120
There's a timeline where this motherfucker

2084
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,400
didn't hug everybody.

2085
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,040
You hug and then he's-

2086
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,720
Yeah, he's in charge of the company.

2087
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,140
Where his good ideas keep getting.

2088
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:35,680
Yeah, yeah.

2089
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:40,540
And his character Luck or whatever is now a big Disney hit.

2090
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,540
Yes.

2091
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,220
Yeah.

2092
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,140
What a work for them.

2093
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,340
Well, we've all watched Luck.

2094
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,840
We have to admit we've all loved Luck.

2095
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:48,240
Is that Trump?

2096
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,880
Folks, we love Luck very unfair.

2097
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,360
We've all watched Luck on whatever streaming service

2098
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,480
it's on exactly.

2099
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:57,660
I have no idea.

2100
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,680
I believe Luck will come up in one of these debates.

2101
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,360
One of these Biden Trump debates.

2102
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,260
Scott's talking about something.

2103
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,000
If it's in his head, it will be said.

2104
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,940
They added 30% more show building.

2105
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,980
So it's like, because knowing that like

2106
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,120
the underwater scenes are gonna be so much more

2107
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,460
of a part of it, we want it to be dark.

2108
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,200
We want it to be controlled, controllable down there.

2109
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,920
So they made the show building longer.

2110
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:20,060
Big plus ups, good improvements.

2111
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,080
Yeah, they did.

2112
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,580
I mean, they did a great job within the confines

2113
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:27,640
or like restrictions of the original.

2114
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,140
Yeah.

2115
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,440
Because like we've talked about before

2116
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,200
in Tokyo Disney Sea, they have a much superior sub.

2117
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,360
The ride system is better.

2118
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,500
Even though you don't get that like seeing,

2119
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,780
like you don't see something go under the water

2120
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:40,620
when you're waiting in line,

2121
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,380
which again is I think the magic trick of it.

2122
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,720
Still the experience of being in the 20,000 leagues ride

2123
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:49,200
in Tokyo Disney Sea is so much cooler and better.

2124
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,360
Well, it's a good lead in too,

2125
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:52,540
cause you're in that big lagoon inside the volcano,

2126
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,440
kind of like what didn't get built here.

2127
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,760
And there is a Nautilus that like helps you,

2128
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:59,080
that steps you closer to the illusion.

2129
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,920
And they, so yeah, they did a great job.

2130
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,240
I don't think they had an unlimited budget for it,

2131
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,700
but a lot of it, it definitely, when I went on it,

2132
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,580
the one or two times I've done it,

2133
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,540
it felt, oh, it's refreshed and that's cool.

2134
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,320
It's the best version of a refreshed submarine ride.

2135
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,340
The subs got to come back with a property

2136
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:22,080
that was relevant to people, is still relevant to people.

2137
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,360
I love finding Nemo.

2138
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:24,520
Compliments, compliments.

2139
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,340
Now, let's get rid of it.

2140
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,080
We're done, right?

2141
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,580
That's a great run.

2142
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,200
That's a fantastic run.

2143
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,460
For two, you know, it had from, we were down for a decade,

2144
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,020
but it's been there since 59.

2145
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,820
Nemo subs got a great, all right,

2146
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,540
we all got to do submarines again.

2147
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,660
Have we all done it again?

2148
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,320
Great, let's do something else.

2149
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,920
These are parts of it.

2150
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,540
It's still the same 59 subs.

2151
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,860
That's pretty crazy.

2152
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:52,880
Yeah, Marty Sklar had experts come in

2153
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,440
when they were thinking about totally scrapping it,

2154
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,660
and they said, like, the experts said,

2155
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:03,200
these vehicles have 40 to 50 more years of lifespan in them.

2156
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,560
Wow, that's amazing.

2157
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,180
They built them right.

2158
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:07,720
And that's great.

2159
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:10,360
It's gonna make it harder to blow them up

2160
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,980
when we destroy this ride.

2161
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,340
We will cry tears for each.

2162
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,180
I will cry eight single tears in a row

2163
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:20,060
when we hear, dun, dun, dun,

2164
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,940
and the submarines are blown up,

2165
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,880
and we do something else.

2166
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,380
I don't mean to rush us through it.

2167
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:28,220
I'm just like, I can't even pretend for a long time

2168
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,100
that I.

2169
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,800
It's just, it's past its time.

2170
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:31,940
I understand why.

2171
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,840
It's a great run of time.

2172
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,520
It's incredible.

2173
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,040
Universal's closed great rides

2174
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,620
that were half the time, less than this.

2175
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,820
I understand why the certain Imagineers,

2176
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,160
especially the ones that grew up with it,

2177
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,420
I understand why they're so nostalgic for it.

2178
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,420
I understand that.

2179
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:48,800
But now that different newer rides exist,

2180
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,200
and you have so many crazy experiences at theme parks,

2181
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,060
there's just, you can't look at it the same way anymore,

2182
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,480
especially when you go to 20,000 Leagues and Disney Sea.

2183
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,940
It's not the same experience anymore.

2184
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,160
You're looking through a tiny little window,

2185
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,720
and you go, oh, I see something there.

2186
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,280
That's good.

2187
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,500
It's fine.

2188
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,240
It's fine.

2189
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,500
But it's not worth the real estate.

2190
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:08,760
I also.

2191
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,020
Yeah, and it's also like,

2192
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,040
this neck of the woods is an environmental disaster.

2193
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,360
In the past, it was tomorrow,

2194
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,740
like submarines, automobiles constantly iterating

2195
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,240
and improving.

2196
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:24,140
That's what we're saying.

2197
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:27,960
Now it's like gas pollution, water sucking up.

2198
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,580
This is not, it's a dystopian corner.

2199
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,460
I agree with what you're saying.

2200
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,660
That being said, if it was a perfect clean energy thing

2201
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:40,160
and everything was like, there's no emissions or anything,

2202
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:40,960
I don't care.

2203
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,680
It's gone too.

2204
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,240
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2205
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:42,960
Yeah, I want it gone.

2206
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,240
No, it's gone.

2207
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,060
That's great.

2208
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,080
I love that we have justification for it

2209
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,540
from an environmental perspective.

2210
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,440
This helps.

2211
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:54,380
so we can only use environment to justify getting rid of it.

2212
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,140
Doesn't matter.

2213
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:55,920
Real estate, tomorrow.

2214
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,320
I also, just to that Nemo thing,

2215
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,040
and I do think like artistically,

2216
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,780
I think visually that ride is fantastic,

2217
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,600
and I have enjoyed it when I've gone on it,

2218
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,100
but I don't like this thing of like, Nemo's lost again.

2219
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,380
I think that is one of the weakest stories.

2220
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,200
He's lost again, and then he does all the same things

2221
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,340
he did in the movie.

2222
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,980
And I feel like the Imagineers,

2223
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,500
like Baxter's usually critical of like,

2224
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,320
what's that term?

2225
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,920
Yes, this is like, oh, we can't do a book report ride.

2226
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,000
Well, can we do all the same things

2227
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,400
and just slap a two on it, now that's fine.

2228
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,060
Sure.

2229
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:30,140
Crazy.

2230
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,920
I don't like that.

2231
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,560
Wouldn't they remember to not go into a whale

2232
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,820
or stay away from the jellyfish?

2233
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,280
Why would they do it all,

2234
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,980
well, I guess Dory loses her memory,

2235
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,320
but the other character, all right, she I forgive.

2236
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,320
Everybody else, how could you do it all again?

2237
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,740
Yeah, no, I agree.

2238
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,840
And that happens a lot, and that happens with movies

2239
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,460
where you're like, they're doing this again

2240
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,520
in the same way.

2241
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,860
And it's, I don't know if it's,

2242
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,640
I mean, Little Mermaid is still like the best example to me

2243
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,580
of like the dark ride phenomenon.

2244
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,120
You're just in the movie.

2245
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,080
You're doing the movie,

2246
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,020
and you're like, the ride system's not very interesting,

2247
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,560
and it's not a bad ride by any means,

2248
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,880
but it's like, there's something about it

2249
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,880
that feels a little bit, I don't know, rote,

2250
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,860
what is the word, a little, I guess so.

2251
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:13,380
That's one of those things that I see,

2252
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,520
you'll probably have too, you go on it with kids,

2253
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,520
and you're like, who cares,

2254
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:18,160
I'm not thinking about rotes anymore.

2255
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,940
But it's exciting, the Tiana ride that's coming,

2256
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:24,780
it's after the movie, it's a new thing.

2257
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,240
That is a sequel, yeah, yeah.

2258
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,100
That'll be good, that's great, yeah.

2259
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,880
And this is, but just technically barely,

2260
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:32,840
I don't dig it.

2261
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:38,140
And it's like a band-aid over a cracked porthole,

2262
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,900
window in a suburb, and they,

2263
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,260
it's a lot of the same beat when they're like,

2264
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:48,080
the seas, it's not enough, the research,

2265
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,600
put Nemo in there.

2266
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:53,540
You get in the shells, and then you kind of see some beats

2267
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:57,060
from the Nemo movie, and then you're at the exhibits.

2268
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,800
I don't like either, I think they've,

2269
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,880
in a lot of ways, they've done Nemo,

2270
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,580
a great movie, and a great property,

2271
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:06,180
with the Park Stream, except for Crush.

2272
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,000
I just did Turtle Talk with Crush for the first,

2273
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,960
not the first time, but the first time in a very long time,

2274
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,720
and with a kid, wonderful, great.

2275
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:12,600
Crush is great.

2276
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,760
Crush's coaster seems really good.

2277
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:16,780
So there's been good Nemo things.

2278
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,360
But this one, I don't know, I just think,

2279
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,380
I think we did it, right?

2280
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,360
We did it, it came back, everybody's happy it came back.

2281
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,020
we liked the mine mine goals.

2282
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,360
Oh, yes.

2283
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:29,800
The goals.

2284
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,020
Oh yeah.

2285
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:30,880
The sea goals.

2286
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,580
Hank, the octopus, I think they call him a septopus,

2287
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,700
because he's missing a tentacle.

2288
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,500
From the new one?

2289
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,300
From the new one.

2290
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:40,640
Oh yeah, he's been hanging out.

2291
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:44,260
I think Finding Nemo is very visually stunning,

2292
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,520
but I think Finding Dory is a more engaging movie,

2293
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,180
because it's just a prison escape movie,

2294
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,440
and I think I just like that better.

2295
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,460
I've never seen a whole it's room,

2296
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,100
my kid doesn't care for it, so I don't know.

2297
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:57,240
Oh, okay.

2298
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,860
I don't know.

2299
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:03,400
I mean, it's not really, but I don't know.

2300
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,260
It's gotta live in other places, I think.

2301
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,360
Guys, what do we do?

2302
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,520
What do we do with this land?

2303
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:08,920
All right, let's pretend it happened.

2304
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:09,700
It's gone.

2305
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:10,720
It's all gone.

2306
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,900
Our monorail loops, our endless loops,

2307
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:14,800
that happens over there,

2308
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,900
Autopia dead people mover tracks, it's gone.

2309
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:20,500
Who knows if this will happen in reality,

2310
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,920
but let's say that day has come.

2311
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,220
What do we do?

2312
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:27,440
Well, it's gonna be the rise of trend.

2313
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,540
You know, you get trend in there.

2314
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,860
You get the Tron roller coaster.

2315
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:37,480
Trend light, lethrite, site, cycles.

2316
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,460
Yeah.

2317
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,640
It's a little bit of a throw ride,

2318
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,540
because you film a new pre-show video

2319
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,460
with Jared Leto, and everyone's like,

2320
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:46,620
I feel oogie.

2321
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,720
Like I gotta get on this coaster

2322
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,420
to shake off the ooginess.

2323
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,380
Yeah, that's the practical.

2324
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,920
That's probably the most likely scenario.

2325
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:00,160
You're thinking from a businessman perspective, as usual.

2326
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,420
Well, you know me, I'm a capitalist.

2327
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,340
Through and through.

2328
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,580
I know, you said it all the time.

2329
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,780
Well, let's talk that out if it's Tron.

2330
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:12,560
I mean, that feels like the only way Tron's going in,

2331
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,020
I think, is there.

2332
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,960
I still, all right, I did some like overhead.

2333
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,980
I got some Google Maps out,

2334
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,200
and I was like dropping some attractions into spaces.

2335
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,780
There's room for a lot.

2336
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,420
I think you could do Tron,

2337
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:32,160
but I think it is a little awkward space-wise.

2338
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,540
I mean, I'll get into it.

2339
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:38,960
All right, let's talk about

2340
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,140
what are maybe the viable candidates for it.

2341
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,280
Tron definitely won.

2342
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:45,820
It's next to Tomorrowland, so it could be that.

2343
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:52,020
Let's invoke Awa, let's talk Avatar.

2344
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:52,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2345
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,160
Is there any possibility

2346
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:56,540
that you end up with something Avatar over here?

2347
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,160
Yeah, there's a possibility.

2348
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,120
I mean, at this moment in the company,

2349
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:03,780
it feels like it would just be a Flight of Passage clone.

2350
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,500
That's the most likely thing.

2351
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:09,080
I did an overhead of Pandora,

2352
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:10,920
and I think you could fit Pandora.

2353
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:11,840
I think existing.

2354
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:12,660
You mean the full land.

2355
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,720
Yeah, I think so.

2356
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:17,220
Maybe you gotta cut or move Satuli Canteen.

2357
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:20,600
You can't do the literal Galaxy's Edge

2358
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,180
where it's the exact same footprint land-wise.

2359
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:26,200
You gotta maybe tuck some things in,

2360
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,020
but I think there's some cool way to,

2361
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,280
because this is the border of Fantasyland and Tomorrowland,

2362
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,880
and Avatar is futuristic, but it's also fantasy,

2363
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,640
and I think there's some way to,

2364
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,860
it's the natural beauty that comes out of,

2365
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,180
I think it would blend with Matterhorn well,

2366
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:46,380
but then I think you could maybe keep it going,

2367
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:50,340
and there's some Pandora base, something takeover

2368
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,100
to the Inventions building too.

2369
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,740
Well, I was gonna say that you could transition

2370
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,600
from Tomorrowland, it's like, oh, it's a space,

2371
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:59,220
it's a spaceport hub, and then there's some sort

2372
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,120
of transition to the greenery of Pandora

2373
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:05,040
that kind of can, like the transition would blend.

2374
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,400
We're going with way of water here,

2375
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,740
and we're using some of what they got.

2376
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,660
Oh yeah, yeah, sure.

2377
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,800
You could also not do river adventure,

2378
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,920
which would make the show building a little smaller,

2379
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:19,600
which I don't know exactly where that happens.

2380
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,940
I'm not saying you have to, I'm just saying.

2381
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:22,760
It's like under it though, isn't it?

2382
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,700
I think maybe it would actually be.

2383
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,000
I guess you're right, I guess,

2384
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,120
because there's in the same building.

2385
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,220
It's not a hurt, I could be wrong.

2386
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,080
No, it is for sure,

2387
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,540
because that's the whole thing with the fire alarm.

2388
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,820
If somebody pulls a fire alarm on one of the rides,

2389
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,200
they both have to shut down.

2390
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,880
So maybe if they're copy pasting,

2391
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:40,720
and I say that very, for about a billion dollar thing,

2392
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,440
it is the same plans or whatever,

2393
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,800
but I think it makes sense to still do a river journey.

2394
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,720
Look at my map here, I think it fits.

2395
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:49,040
Yeah, it does.

2396
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,880
It kind of fits perfectly.

2397
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:53,320
And you're not, and you got,

2398
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,080
it's a tough neck of the woods,

2399
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,660
because you got Harbor Boulevard right there,

2400
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,840
and you also got train.

2401
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:01,380
Train's not moving, there's nowhere for train to go.

2402
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,620
And you've got to keep some monorail.

2403
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,800
I don't think, I think that the endless loops

2404
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,660
when you come back into the park, I think has to be gone.

2405
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,520
But I don't think they're gonna move the monorail station.

2406
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,120
But I think that fits in some Pandora, that's okay.

2407
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,560
I mean, I wouldn't be mad at that.

2408
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,700
I'm not sure if it's confirmed that's on top of Autopia,

2409
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:26,020
the Lagoon, and the interventions.

2410
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:29,580
In this version does not quite go to interventions.

2411
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,460
I think there's some way that it could,

2412
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,500
and I think you got to deal with Satuli,

2413
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,620
you got to put it somewhere.

2414
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:36,900
So you could extend that out.

2415
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:40,920
I'll try to post these vague bad Photoshop's.

2416
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,120
But Small World's fine.

2417
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,620
We're taking over like where Motorboat Cruise

2418
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,100
has not been for a long time.

2419
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,000
Just all of that, it's all gone.

2420
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,160
You clear it all out and we get Pandora.

2421
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,000
I would be thrilled if they were going to do that, yes.

2422
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,940
And yeah, I think when you look at that Google Maps,

2423
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,440
it's like it's so much bigger than you even imagine it is.

2424
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,880
It's like a quarter of a part,

2425
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,620
not literally, but like getting there.

2426
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:09,580
Yeah, I'm sure there are ways,

2427
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,620
I don't know if somebody could explain that,

2428
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:13,380
oh, they need to make part of this smaller

2429
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:16,680
just from the configuration of this land.

2430
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,100
But I'm sure they could do some things to make it smaller

2431
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,840
because Pandora is not that big of a land.

2432
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,240
No, it's pretty compact.

2433
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:27,940
And I almost like, there's pluses and minuses

2434
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,380
about it being smaller.

2435
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,640
Because I think it is cool that it's like feel like,

2436
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:38,240
you don't have to do like the hallelujah mountains,

2437
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,680
which I think would be maybe harder

2438
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:43,240
if there was like a galaxy's edge sized hallelujah mountains.

2439
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,060
Although maybe I'm wrong.

2440
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,360
Maybe like it would look even more amazing that way.

2441
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,980
But I kind of think that like it's consistent so small,

2442
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,360
it really feels impressive to look up

2443
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,160
and see these mountains floating.

2444
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:53,840
Yeah, oh, sure.

2445
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,980
But there's gotta be a way to even shrink it a little more

2446
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:01,720
and find little spots to sneak it into that land.

2447
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,380
I bet there's a way.

2448
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:03,640
I don't think you could just literally

2449
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,860
take the same footprint,

2450
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:06,620
but I think there's something you could do.

2451
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:11,580
Or demolish all of it, put up a big building,

2452
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,400
and you walk through a place

2453
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,960
where you just see the trees from Pandora.

2454
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,780
It's an experience, it's not a ride.

2455
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:20,800
Sounds good, yeah, yeah.

2456
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:22,980
Or you know what, leave everything as is.

2457
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,500
In inventions building, they just put some like acrons,

2458
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,100
some static acrons in there.

2459
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,960
Get some static acrons, you build the gift shop.

2460
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,680
Oh, gift shop too.

2461
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:34,940
Oh, great, all right.

2462
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:35,020
Do a gift shop.

2463
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,120
If we can buy our things, then we're all set.

2464
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:38,660
Who needs a wreck?

2465
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:41,660
But yeah, that is a good idea, very good idea.

2466
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,720
People have speculated in those Disneyland Forward

2467
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:48,940
pictures that part of one of the things looks like Pandora.

2468
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,440
And that's maybe one of the only,

2469
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:54,020
it all depends on are we getting Disneyland Forward,

2470
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,040
and to refresh any listener's memory,

2471
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:59,720
that's kind of any space over by the hotels

2472
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,640
that is not currently a parking lot,

2473
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,480
they want to turn into theme park.

2474
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,900
Including parking lots though too.

2475
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,520
Some, I think.

2476
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,420
Yes, yeah.

2477
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,780
Because you can, this is a theme park trick.

2478
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,620
Oh wait, I meant that is a parking lot.

2479
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,920
I think it's not a hotel is what I meant to say.

2480
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:15,360
Yes.

2481
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,640
Flat parking lots take up a lot of room,

2482
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:22,160
but I think that's what they're doing with Epic Universe.

2483
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,040
They're building a flat parking lot, and as time goes on,

2484
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,240
they'll close it and build a garage.

2485
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,980
So that the space goes up.

2486
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:32,800
Stack it up.

2487
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:33,560
Not a wreck it up.

2488
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:38,820
So yes, of realistic things to do,

2489
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:42,200
that is probably the top coolest idea I think.

2490
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:44,520
Having the most, if we've got the space

2491
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,800
over in Disneyland Forward area, maybe you wait for that.

2492
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,660
So we get like a lot of Pandora.

2493
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:54,280
I mean, a lot of the things on the short list could be,

2494
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,960
but what if it doesn't happen?

2495
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,440
And what if this could happen sooner?

2496
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:58,300
That would be amazing.

2497
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,860
I mean, I've heard like Matterhorn's gonna have to be rebuilt

2498
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:04,880
in the next couple of decades because it's falling apart.

2499
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:05,280
Really?

2500
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:08,500
There's a frozen land that's open or is opening soon,

2501
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,120
or is it open?

2502
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:09,600
Wait.

2503
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:10,560
It is open.

2504
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,780
It is in Hong Kong.

2505
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,620
I have an overhead of that as well, and it fits as well.

2506
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:17,560
Yeah, because that's the other rumor that's been happening.

2507
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,780
Have you seen pictures?

2508
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:19,440
Yes.

2509
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:20,680
Or video or anything.

2510
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:22,160
Now that I ask if it's open,

2511
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:25,540
I've watched a ride through the ride and go,

2512
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:28,520
oh, it's the same Matterhorn, or Matterhorn, Jesus,

2513
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:31,400
it's the same Maelstrom layout, the frozen ride.

2514
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:35,300
A little changes, and I think aesthetically better,

2515
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,380
those robots are better.

2516
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,420
Oh, of course, yeah, yeah.

2517
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,780
It seems, I think good little plus ups.

2518
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:41,920
Yeah, and the town looks cool.

2519
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,940
And I think, here's partially why I would vote for,

2520
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:49,220
maybe my border preference is Pandora, then Frozen,

2521
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,540
over Tron, because we did Tron, I like Tron.

2522
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,680
You do end up with, it'd be a shame to use a lot of that,

2523
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,420
too much of that land for just one giant show building,

2524
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,640
and that's what it becomes.

2525
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:03,640
Because I think what I do like about Submarine Lagoon

2526
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,140
is the lagoon itself.

2527
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,740
I like that there's some nature there, fake nature.

2528
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:13,980
You got a body of water, and the land itself in Hong Kong,

2529
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,220
the world of Frozen, I think looks fantastic.

2530
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:19,300
Just the lake and the harbor, and regardless of those rides,

2531
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:22,360
one of which is a roller coaster that's so short

2532
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,940
that if you watch a ride through of it,

2533
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,540
you laugh at the end.

2534
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:29,160
Like, truly, it ends, and you're like, you're kidding.

2535
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:30,800
I think it's 50 seconds.

2536
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,820
Is that shorter than Gadget's go coaster?

2537
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,180
I think so, close.

2538
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,720
So it's not like I'm dying to get the same wandering Okans,

2539
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,400
or even the slays or whatever.

2540
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:45,040
Frozen Arachne's fine, but I think aesthetically,

2541
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,040
and of course that blends with Matterhorn really well,

2542
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,860
it blends with Fantasyland really well.

2543
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,780
I think that's a great option over there.

2544
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:54,200
Well, here's a dark horse candidate.

2545
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,020
Japan is closing their space mountain, rebuilding it.

2546
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:02,820
Well, that would be received, people like that.

2547
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,940
And then we start in America, start going like,

2548
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:10,280
maybe we should demolish and rebuild some space mountains.

2549
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:13,420
Ooh, okay, well, if we're dealing with Tomorrowland problem,

2550
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,180
this is a very interesting notion that maybe,

2551
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,960
is there some way to rebuild the whole complex,

2552
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,660
you get a new space mountain and Tron,

2553
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:24,360
you make it such that those all do work together,

2554
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,880
maybe you gotta blow up Buzz Lightyear to make it all fit.

2555
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,660
Sorry, Buzz, whoops, whatever.

2556
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:31,580
I think that's-

2557
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:35,360
This is a larger fixing Tomorrowland thing

2558
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,620
we've talked about.

2559
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:39,960
We have, can I talk about my idea for a future episode

2560
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,560
about this very topic?

2561
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,000
Sure, tease it.

2562
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,660
We could cut it out if we don't wanna do it.

2563
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,180
I think we should do an episode where each of us

2564
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:48,360
get a different prompt for fixing Tomorrowland.

2565
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:52,060
One of us gets the open checkbook blue sky version

2566
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,800
where you get to do whatever you want

2567
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,080
with an unlimited budget.

2568
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:59,400
The next, this will all be probably at random,

2569
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,820
and the next person gets to do it

2570
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:04,200
in a very businessman-minded way,

2571
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:05,100
the Disneyland today.

2572
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,340
What would they do?

2573
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:06,680
Yes.

2574
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:07,200
What would they do

2575
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,240
with a decent good budget,

2576
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,960
which is probably, yes, Frozen or Pandora,

2577
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,900
but obviously you can think of fun, creative ways to do it.

2578
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:18,940
And then we're including all of this and we can,

2579
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:23,860
if budget allows, the eyes will be on the realism of that one,

2580
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:27,660
but can we do some stuff to Pizza Port

2581
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,560
and the theater and all that crap?

2582
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,440
Right, so you'll get a healthy budget, I'll say,

2583
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:35,560
to do cool stuff, and you could demolish things,

2584
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:36,480
and you can build things,

2585
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,280
but it won't be a crazy dream scenario.

2586
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,920
And then the third person will get fixed Tomorrowland

2587
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,300
on a budget, which means that you get

2588
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,000
a very small amount of money.

2589
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:49,120
You can not demolish things,

2590
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:52,200
but you can plus things up here and there in ways.

2591
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,660
You can change music, you can change lighting,

2592
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:57,820
you can serve different food at Pizza Port, maybe,

2593
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:58,360
or whatever.

2594
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,940
There's different things you could do

2595
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:01,980
that could at least dress it up,

2596
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:03,560
and you're gonna have to do your best

2597
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,680
with a low amount of money to fix.

2598
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,620
That's gonna be a bitter pill to swallow, I think,

2599
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,020
which one of us gets that,

2600
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,560
whichever one of us draws that straw,

2601
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:14,000
but maybe it's where the ultimate reward lies.

2602
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,120
Perhaps that's right.

2603
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,160
As the most true challenge.

2604
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,140
And then I guess we'll have the listeners vote

2605
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:21,700
on who's Tomorrowland you want.

2606
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:24,200
Aren't they gonna vote for the ultimate one?

2607
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:24,880
You would think so.

2608
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,540
In what world is the cheap one,

2609
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,400
even the best version of the cheap one?

2610
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,780
This is just an example, and I don't wanna,

2611
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,940
say Jason says, all right, here's what we're doing.

2612
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:33,720
We're demolishing all of Tomorrowland,

2613
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,400
and we're gonna build a museum

2614
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,680
that honors famous actor James Mason.

2615
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,940
Now that's an unlimited budget.

2616
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,200
He describes an amazing James Mason museum

2617
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,680
now that's coming to Tomorrowland.

2618
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,380
We see all these different movies,

2619
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:48,020
sort of rope animatronics of different James Mason movies.

2620
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:51,120
Yeah, like a half-hour symposium every hour

2621
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,120
where it's like, well, you know,

2622
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,780
the history of Lolita is very complicated.

2623
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:02,200
But Nabokov's way with the English language,

2624
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,660
even though he was a native Russian speaker.

2625
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:05,280
Of course.

2626
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,480
Well, you need to look at his work,

2627
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,420
Pale Fire, to really get his way.

2628
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:14,080
Right, and Space Mountain is now Space Mason,

2629
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:18,100
and he's here going through sort of a space adventure

2630
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,240
while he narrates it.

2631
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,360
And this is a very expensive redo,

2632
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,760
and you say, well, what does this have to do with Tomorrowland?

2633
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,160
And Jason says it doesn't.

2634
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,220
So there is a scenario where then the listener goes,

2635
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:29,540
well, I don't know if I necessarily want that version.

2636
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:33,200
In The Masons, where you discover innovative new ways

2637
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,880
that we'll be watching James Mason's films in the future.

2638
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:39,780
And by the future, I mean 28 years ago.

2639
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:40,500
Exactly.

2640
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,220
So I'm saying there's a versions where the audience

2641
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:45,280
maybe doesn't like the unlimited budget,

2642
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,980
Tomorrowland, depending on who draws that straw.

2643
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:49,040
Maybe you fly too close to the sun.

2644
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,860
So we'll see.

2645
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,520
If the ultimate version involves a lot of free drugs

2646
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,380
and pornographic acts, I picture a Tomorrowland

2647
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,460
that's a modern day Sodom.

2648
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,880
Well, let the demerats have their way.

2649
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,620
Well, I'm glad you've teased that.

2650
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:12,580
I mean, yeah, I think we're heading for that.

2651
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,840
That's where this Tomorrowland stuff will ultimately go.

2652
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:19,180
Well, look, maybe I should save this for that,

2653
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,620
but let me get this notion out there.

2654
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:21,220
Sure, go for it.

2655
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:24,200
Here's my other, because I'm resistant to,

2656
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:28,400
I'm interested in Tron, but I don't know

2657
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,400
if I just want Tron light cycle run plopped there,

2658
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,780
show building, we lose nature, whatever.

2659
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,240
Maybe there's a way to fit two things in there,

2660
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:40,020
I'm not sure, but here's, maybe if I'm getting all greedy,

2661
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,960
here's what I think it is, that I think you could do

2662
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,580
World of Frozen in a smaller way,

2663
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:48,620
and then maybe it's not full, okay, I liked Tron,

2664
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,840
I liked light cycle run.

2665
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,460
Is it the show building that I care,

2666
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,260
is it what happens in the show building that I liked a lot?

2667
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,720
Not necessarily, I think I like that track,

2668
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,240
I think I like that ride vehicle,

2669
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,560
I think I like the aesthetic.

2670
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:06,000
Isn't there some way that you could do a new Tron thing

2671
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,860
designed for Tomorrowland that uses some of where

2672
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,280
the people mover and rocket rods used to go?

2673
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,980
That uses some new space, it's like mini show buildings,

2674
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:19,360
something to get you that kinetic energy,

2675
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:23,360
let's all say it together, that has been lost

2676
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:24,800
for so long in this land.

2677
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:29,360
The light cycles become the new people mover rocket rods,

2678
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:32,580
and it's like this deconstructed version of it,

2679
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:34,620
and that's our future transportation.

2680
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,820
Maybe you could take over some backstage area,

2681
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:41,040
maybe it goes around Space Mountain,

2682
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,340
maybe there's some wild new way to do the light cycle.

2683
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,720
Oh yeah, I mean what you're describing

2684
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,700
is the perfect way to do it,

2685
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:51,320
but you're veering into unlimited money prompt.

2686
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:54,400
Sure, so I gotta put that in the, yeah.

2687
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,200
It's just on the line of it.

2688
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,940
Just on the line, Tron, ride it out.

2689
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:59,940
We gotta see what happens to Tron.

2690
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:02,040
Because yeah, they just plopped Tron down

2691
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:06,780
from Shanghai into Orlando, which I guess it works fine

2692
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:08,120
because they have a lot of room there,

2693
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:10,580
but it's like Space Mountain's next to Tron,

2694
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:12,520
it's still kind of weird to me a little bit.

2695
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:13,680
It's not that bad.

2696
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:15,120
Just Tron is such a huge building.

2697
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,540
I like that, aesthetically I like that building so much.

2698
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:19,300
Yeah, I do too.

2699
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:20,900
But yeah, what you're describing

2700
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,300
is the ultimate awesome version of it,

2701
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:26,620
which will, I think you need a full demolition though

2702
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:27,460
in this scenario.

2703
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:28,920
Of everything still.

2704
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:29,840
Of everything, I think.

2705
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,440
I think absolutely, because I think

2706
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,840
because they can open up the people mover track again

2707
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,160
because of the OSHA codes.

2708
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,060
Well, it's not using that track.

2709
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,720
I think it's some weird tubes

2710
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,900
that go around all of it.

2711
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,940
I still think you gotta demolish everything.

2712
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,100
I think I don't think, unless you build stuff

2713
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,200
on top of the buildings maybe.

2714
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:48,000
That's what I'm thinking.

2715
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,160
This is a twisted colossus.

2716
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:50,300
Maybe.

2717
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:54,980
Yeah, I don't know Anaheim codes

2718
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:57,240
of how high stuff can go.

2719
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:59,440
I don't think we're breaking any codes.

2720
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,860
We're not getting higher than Guardians, Tower of Terror.

2721
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:04,440
Well, I think Tower of Terror,

2722
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,520
they had to go just under it

2723
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,960
and put the blinking, maybe some blinking red lights on top.

2724
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:11,660
No, we don't need no lights.

2725
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:12,620
Well, that's in Florida.

2726
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:13,320
It's just under it.

2727
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:15,340
We're staying low and lean.

2728
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:20,580
Yeah, no, it's the coolest idea for the Tron ride,

2729
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:23,260
especially going in and out of stuff.

2730
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:25,380
Because we haven't done Tron episode yet,

2731
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,720
but Tron is very simple to me.

2732
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:31,740
The ride is very simple and it does a couple things cool

2733
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:36,300
and I like it, but the idea of going in and out of things

2734
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:39,340
and into the grid and out of the grid

2735
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:41,360
and seeing Disneyland and then back into the grid.

2736
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,560
Is that not the Tomorrowland spirit?

2737
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:45,660
Is that not what the whole area needs?

2738
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,440
That is very exciting, that idea.

2739
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,100
So, yeah.

2740
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:52,140
Did I, have I told that story where I won a drink ticket

2741
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,840
at like a Disney themed cabaret show?

2742
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:59,340
There used to be this cabaret space called Rockwell in LA

2743
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:01,660
and they were like, it was a bunch of,

2744
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,480
Jane knew some people doing it

2745
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,900
and they were doing a lot of Disney songs and stuff

2746
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:10,220
and the host was like, okay, does anyone know

2747
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,220
why there's a song and so about Terra Terra in Florida?

2748
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:17,400
And I was like, it's one fleet lower

2749
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,980
than the FAA regulations.

2750
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:22,180
They didn't wanna put blinking red lights on it,

2751
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,660
so they built it slightly lower.

2752
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:25,740
And he went, why do you know that?

2753
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:27,680
And I was like, I used to podcast about team.

2754
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,120
Wow.

2755
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:31,620
Well, you got it out.

2756
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,480
Yes, congratulations.

2757
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:34,820
Did you get a round of applause?

2758
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:39,620
Yes, I got a confused like round of applause

2759
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:43,220
to get that well gin and tonic ticket.

2760
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,420
That was sick.

2761
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:45,800
Nice.

2762
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:49,940
You could have, did it say does not apply to higher shelf?

2763
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,520
No bee feeders, no tango ready.

2764
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:56,220
Anything above that blinking red light, you cannot have.

2765
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:59,260
Yes, no, the well does not have a blinking red light.

2766
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:02,740
The new Amsterdam or whatever, you know, is fine.

2767
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,820
Well, I think these are all interesting things

2768
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:06,460
to think about.

2769
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,460
It's mainly interesting to think about

2770
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:11,060
a demolition team coming and destroying

2771
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:12,100
this leaking lagoon.

2772
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:12,560
We should have.

2773
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,680
Which had a good run, it did.

2774
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:16,480
We said what was good about it.

2775
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,460
I'm not taking this away from Baxter or any of them.

2776
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,160
It was a good attraction.

2777
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,920
Good job, everyone.

2778
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:30,040
Now step aside gracefully so we can get some new cool stuff.

2779
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:35,040
So we can go honor AWA or Tren or whatever,

2780
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,380
or Okan or whatever it is.

2781
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:41,260
Yes, like Pyocon destroying those boats,

2782
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:44,880
the whales are starting to destroy boats on earth.

2783
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:45,460
Exactly.

2784
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:50,620
And it is time for the whale brand bulldozers to come in.

2785
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,400
Yeah, flop on it, yank all the pieces away

2786
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,140
with the taut metal cables.

2787
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:00,240
I'm sorry, but that is our ruling.

2788
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,060
Do you agree with us?

2789
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,600
Let us know in comments.

2790
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:07,540
But I don't think we're too far off

2791
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:09,480
from what people are saying because I did do a poll

2792
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,140
right after Astro Orbiter.

2793
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:12,860
I think it occurred to us mid-episode.

2794
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,680
I asked the question, what's the worst ride

2795
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:15,700
in Disneyland proper?

2796
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,260
Astro Orbiter did not win that poll.

2797
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,240
Autopia won that poll, second place finding Nemo subs.

2798
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:26,100
Then people wanted canoes in the poll.

2799
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:27,420
Wow, that's ridiculous.

2800
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:29,080
I put it in the poll and I said,

2801
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:33,120
canoes, all caps, not this, wrong, and it lost, thank God.

2802
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:37,460
I put Storybookland in because people said that

2803
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:39,100
in the comments and then people said,

2804
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:40,260
why is that in the poll?

2805
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:42,940
I don't know, because a lot of people said it.

2806
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:48,560
I'm not saying, I would never, Storybookland,

2807
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,240
I would never put that in the poll.

2808
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,800
Never, not me either.

2809
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:53,100
Charming, nice, great.

2810
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:57,860
But the two possible worst rides on top of each other,

2811
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:00,100
sorry, I think it's time.

2812
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:00,920
I think it's time.

2813
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:04,500
Well with that, official ruling, say what you think,

2814
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:08,740
but that is, we have ruled and no one can actually disagree.

2815
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:09,020
No.

2816
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,300
We will be the final judge of quality.

2817
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,120
Thanks for listening.

2818
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,580
We're making our way through Tomorrowland.

2819
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:19,140
We're doing it.

2820
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:20,520
We'll fix Tomorrowland down the road.

2821

that is gonna have to open up.

2830

This can be, we might end up with just like,
