1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,220
Warning, the following podcast may contain torrid lightning storm hookups, rowdy carnival

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,360
brawls between drunk 13 year olds, and unwise drug and cheese cocktails.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,280
And if you can't tell, none of this is stuff Scott, Mike, or Jason did.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:47,800
John Gabris leads us on a good time in Long Island's Adventureland on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast hosted by three real confident guys, not dorks at

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
all.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,840
Guys play along so our guest doesn't figure it out.

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,080
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Hi.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,880
Hey, I am confident and sounds like it.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Yeah.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Yeah.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
My voice is very deep.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
That's right.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Always.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,800
That's not because I have a canker sore like way back in my throat today, which is true.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,120
It's because of my toughness.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,160
Not because of the stress I put on myself on a day to day basis that gives me sores

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,400
in my mouth.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,320
That's not why it's because I'm so fucking tough and I cursed.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
So yeah, that's right.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
That was very tough.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,480
Jason Sheridan fits into the circuit type as well.

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,960
I'm so confident.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,480
So my ailment currently is that I have some sort of inflammation on my left index finger.

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,560
So I am on multiple antibiotics.

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Multiple.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,320
Well, an ointment and a pill.

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Yeah.

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Wait, prescribed?

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Prescribed.

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Yeah.

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Via the miracle of Teladoc.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,120
I thought it was like a very painful ingrown nail and then it just was not going away.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,400
So that's my thing that I likely did through stress, potentially.

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,520
It wasn't through jamming on the guitar.

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,240
No, it wasn't through just like getting some T.C. licks on the guitar.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,320
Jason usually plugs in and just like solos over some old Sammy Hagar Montrose albums.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,480
That's how I get into the zone.

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,720
Let's bring in our guest too.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,960
I think we've done a good job preparing for who we are in our time.

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,120
You know, he's one of the funniest people in all of podcast from high and mighty action

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
boys.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
John Gavris is here.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,600
Yeah, I actually am unduly confident.

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,480
So it's smart to bring me in.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,360
I'll bring that kind of energy for you guys.

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Good.

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Thank you.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Needed.

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
My only physical elements are ones I've been dealing with forever.

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Obesity, small dick.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Arguably one really helping the other one shine.

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,360
What a pairing.

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
What a deadly combo.

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
The devil's pair, if you will.

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,960
I got a pimple right in the inside of my nostril also.

61
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,280
So we're all, everyone's doing great.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,040
We're going to need this as relief today.

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm so stoked to be on podcast the ride because since we did that live show in Chicago, sort

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,640
of we repaired action boys and you guys.

65
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Yeah.

66
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,400
And leading up to that, the action boys, we cannot stop talking about how we are probably

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,920
the two opposite energy podcasts.

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Like, because we roast like Disney adults because we're just 40 year old toxic masculinity

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
guys.

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,720
We're just like, and it's like, it's so funny that we're like, again, talking about four

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:48,680
quadrants, we're hitting four quadrants between those two podcasts for white quadrants.

72
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
It would have been really funny.

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,520
It would have been really funny if our audience had stayed and then you guys just did the

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
show in front of them.

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah.

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
And vice versa.

77
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,960
People who like watched a Chuck Norris movie in preparation, sit down with you to talk

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,320
about like the parking lot at whatever.

79
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
The would be ours.

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
It was about a mall.

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,560
It was about things that used to be at a mall that aren't there anymore.

82
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Interesting stores and restaurants.

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Yeah.

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Compatible.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
I'd say.

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,320
Yeah, no, we're glad you could be here to bring this energy and flesh out the quadrant

87
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
situation.

88
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,800
And also, I think it bears mentioning possibly, I think it's a little interesting that we

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,640
were like, we've been wanting to have you on for a while, but in my head it was like,

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,120
No, that's one to not zoom was we're sick of zoom.

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,400
We're going to do it in person or to do it right when things are safe.

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,400
And then you said you do it and then you got COVID.

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,520
I got COVID over Christmas and I was like, I should look at my calendar because I think

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,320
this takes me to 10 days, takes me to January 5th.

95
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,080
Do I have anything early in the year?

96
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,000
It's like, oh, I do have an in-person podcast record.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,760
I'm like, Scott, I confidently said yes, I record in person, but alas, we need to punt

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
it.

99
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
It seems like it went fine.

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,120
Seems like you're good to go.

101
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm OK now.

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
Yeah, I feel I feel good.

103
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,120
Something occurred to me.

104
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,800
There is we have a system that we have probably not used in years.

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,600
The idea of how we're supposed to rank rides and parks.

106
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,320
Yeah.

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,800
Our system of is it it's keep it as is plus it up or burn it to the ground for insurance

108
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
money. We rarely do this.

109
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,160
And maybe we'll do it today with adventure land.

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,400
But I thought we should ask you to do that with COVID.

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Or on the cron.

112
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,000
If you had to keep your keep COVID as is plus it up, prove it in some way.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
Ideally, we burn it all to the ground and get insurance money or at least insurance.

114
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
We just get health insurance.

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,360
Might help all of us.

116
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,400
Burn it all the ground and give everyone health insurance.

117
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,360
That sounds good to me.

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,320
All things to the entire country to the ground.

119
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,720
Yeah. Yeah. Start over.

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,800
I'll take another six hundred dollars, honestly.

121
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,120
I just prefer not to be on a prepaid debit card for whatever reason.

122
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,920
This makes it so hard.

123
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,120
There I did a podcast where the payment was like a seventy five dollar MX gift card.

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,080
I'm like, I have no idea how to use this.

125
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,120
And it's like I got to buy something that's exactly seventy five dollars, I guess.

126
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,640
Or I have to bring it with me in store shopping, which is not a thing you want to do these

127
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,000
days. Swipe my seventy five, then pull out my credit card and put that last eight bucks

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,560
on it or something.

129
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,520
Had more. And then the transaction is longer.

130
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,880
Now you're in the place longer.

131
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,280
Yeah, that's that's no good.

132
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,840
No, that's you got like a code to write.

133
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,680
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm not of the level of wealth yet where I'm going to let seventy five

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,360
dollars that I got for podcasting fall on the way side.

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm like, I'm like, my wife is like, you OK?

136
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm like, I got to figure out I got to get this money in our accounts.

137
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm going to say we're going to be OK.

138
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,760
And I'm like, well, you know, I don't make a lot of money.

139
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,680
So when it comes in, I want to put it so I'm trying to like take the money out of the

140
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,200
card somehow. I need the money.

141
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Where's the money?

142
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Ripping it up with your fingernails is inside it.

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,280
I have the money.

144
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
Like you think it's an envelope.

145
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,560
It's like, yeah, like something's got to be inside.

146
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,800
Guys, hide the American Express gift cards.

147
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
We'll do something else.

148
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,080
Thank you for shoving it back in your backpack.

149
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
Shit. All these Jeffrey bucks we're going to go.

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
You're you are here today. You brought up this topic.

151
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,960
I love when there's something that has not come up on the show and that like

152
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,920
represents a whole area of the country that we don't really know about.

153
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,880
And we are talking about adventure land, which we should say is not

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
the Disneyland land, adventure land.

155
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
And it's not a place in Iowa called Adventureland.

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,160
This is Long Island's Adventureland.

157
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,400
Not to get to fully into like Long Island centric, but I googled Adventureland

158
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,040
just to see if like before I came here, like check the Wikipedia and see if if I.

159
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,480
And I was like, what do you mean there's multiple Adventureland?

160
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,480
And I'm like, yeah, the most basic ass fucking name, but it's such a part of my

161
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,080
childhood that I was flabbergasted that it existed elsewhere.

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, and the the one in Iowa just changed owners to right at the end of twenty twenty one.

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,280
Like the people who own Kenny Wood bought the Adventureland in Iowa.

164
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,160
And I'm reading this article and I was like, I don't think this is Long Island

165
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,200
because it mentions Des Moines a lot.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,960
It mentions nowhere about New York.

167
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
And then I was just looking at all the names, the owners.

168
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,680
And so now I'm just Googling guys names

169
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,560
just to make sure I'm not like, oh, funny enough, it's owned by the no, it's not.

170
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,720
But this is the Adventureland that inspired the Jesse Eisenberg movie.

171
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,920
Yes. Adventureland.

172
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,160
Yes. Even though in that movie, that Adventureland is in like Pennsylvania.

173
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,320
That is Kenny. Yeah, that was shot in Pittsburgh.

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,600
Yeah. Kenny Wood. Yeah.

175
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
So that they shot it at Kenny Wood.

176
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,560
But Greg Mottola, the writer, director is from Long Island and based it on his,

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,880
I think his experience working at Adventureland or at least hanging out there.

178
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,280
Yeah. Worked like Carnival Games, seemingly.

179
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I haven't seen the movie.

180
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,760
So if there's Carnival Games in the movie, I think they're carnival games.

181
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,840
In the movie. Yeah, I haven't seen the movie in a long time.

182
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,640
And if I remember correctly, there is it Van Wildt, Ryan Reynolds?

183
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,320
Van Wilder. Yeah, he's in the movie.

184
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,800
Wilder to me, baby.

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
But Ryan Reynolds, I think, is in it.

186
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,160
And Kristen Stewart.

187
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
Stewart. Yeah.

188
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,360
Stewart. I think Hader and Wigg.

189
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,800
Yes. Hader and Wigg are sort of like the grownups at the place.

190
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,360
Yeah. OK. And they all they have shirts that say Games, Games, Games.

191
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
OK. That was one of the things about it.

192
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
Yeah. What are the what are the other character's shirts say?

193
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't know. I just remember they all had that on the poster.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,200
When you search Adventureland on eBay, you find the promotional Games, Games, Games.

195
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
I kind of want that shirt now, though.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,640
Now that you're saying it. Yeah.

197
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,920
Deep reference. Wow. Deep merch.

198
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,000
What it so deep merch that conveys something else also.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,120
You know what I mean? Like I'm a fan of games in general.

200
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,960
But if so, people are like, oh, you like games.

201
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm like, yeah. But if people are like, oh, is that from Adventureland?

202
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
You could be like, yeah, now now you're getting like the bonus content out of it.

203
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
Yeah, this is this is what I say all the time about the toys I collect.

204
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,800
You want like deep, you want deep characters that people go on.

205
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,400
Who's that? And then you explain to them like because my biggest dream

206
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
is to have a Michael Eisner doll.

207
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,840
And I say like, this is a first like edition Michael Eisner doll from 1989

208
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,080
when he was like fresh CEO.

209
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,800
Yeah. The Disney is of all Disney figures I got.

210
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
Yeah. Not Mickey. Fuck Mickey.

211
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,040
But Mickey fuck Walt.

212
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
It's the original Eisner.

213
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,040
Characters are made up.

214
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,440
I feel real.

215
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,880
Is there's a real fucking guy, man? Yeah.

216
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,200
That action figure does not exist, though.

217
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,240
It doesn't. But I feel like I want to will it.

218
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,680
I'm just it's something I'm mentioning a lot on the show.

219
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
So it's it's like a dream for some.

220
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
No one's going to make it at this point.

221
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,280
The guy's 80 fucking five years old.

222
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,640
I think somebody can make it.

223
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,600
Yeah, somebody can make it.

224
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
I guarantee. And printing being what it is.

225
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,520
You know what? This I hate to really take us off on a tangent.

226
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,840
There's a guy who sculpted a lot of like the old Ninja Turtle toys

227
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,160
when we were kids and like a lot of the Happy Meal toys.

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,960
And he just posted that he's willing to do like sculpting work.

229
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,560
So I don't know if he should sculpt the podcast, the Ride Boys,

230
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,240
and then have Michael Eisner as their friend as well.

231
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,880
I got to figure out where you run into a thing where you see that connection.

232
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,640
You're like, all right, I can get us a cool gift for the podcast

233
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,160
or I can make my dumb dream finally come true.

234
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,120
You're trying to make those both happen at the same though.

235
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
I'd rather have Eisner.

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to be judging how I look in the like, oh, that's what he thinks.

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,960
I look like I didn't know we did Funko pops.

238
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,240
He's a dozen.

239
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,160
I'm like, well, that's what my fucking head looks like.

240
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,120
But if we're like the same scale as like the Muppet Baby

241
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,600
Happy Meal toys with Nanny and Eisner's like Nanny

242
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,440
and the three of us are like on the big wheel.

243
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,240
Like you want to tie your shoes next to you.

244
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,680
That's a good point.

245
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,960
You want him to be our daddy is what you want.

246
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,840
I mean, yeah, I do.

247
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,000
Long story short, I'm looking for a daddy.

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,240
Does anyone get anyone 3D print me a daddy?

249
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,200
Yeah.

250
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,840
Preferably the resembles Michael Eisner.

251
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,920
Yeah, please.

252
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,280
Your actual father is listening.

253
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,800
He listens to every episode.

254
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,080
I said that I could.

256
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,040
There's an episode where I said that the full houseman raised me in the morning

257
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,120
because he worked nights and he got really upset.

258
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
Oh, man.

259
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,520
Does your dad listen to any other podcasts?

260
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,880
Yeah, he listens to like he he's in like this.

261
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,560
He like goes like, oh, you know, this off book podcast is really good.

262
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,120
And then he listens to Doughboys and.

263
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,560
Oh, cool. All right.

264
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,080
Because I was like my mom doesn't listen to my podcast,

265
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,760
but I don't feel offended because she doesn't listen to anything.

266
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
But really, Joel and Elton John. Sure.

267
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,280
So but a dad who listens to other like that generation,

268
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,720
someone who listens to podcasts, that blows me away a little. Yeah.

269
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
He probably listen to yours now.

270
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,920
No shit. Thanks, Pop.

271
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,320
Well, you know, as you.

272
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Sorry, Mr. Eisner.

273
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,840
Yeah. You're not very polite.

274
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,640
You might not get that listener.

275
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,520
Mike's dad specifically. Yeah.

276
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,680
He'll try it. Now that we brought it up, he'll try it.

277
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,000
He'll listen to the show. My dad worked nights as well.

278
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,480
I should mention really quick that my speaking of off book,

279
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,400
my mom finally has a phone that gets podcasts.

280
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,960
And I told you guys this

281
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,200
finally attempted to listen to podcast the ride and put it on and said,

282
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
I didn't understand what was going on. There were songs about bears.

283
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,440
I don't know what was happening.

284
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,960
Basically, we did an episode with the off book podcast.

285
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,320
There was an improvised country bear jamboree

286
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,880
that does not represent the other episodes whatsoever.

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,320
So my mom finally tried.

288
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,600
Why are there bear songs? Never trying it again.

289
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,560
Damn it. My one chance.

290
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
And any broken format. Yeah.

291
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,560
Any time a friend from the past or a non comedy friend

292
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,040
who doesn't understand podcasting or family member chooses to listen.

293
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
It's always like, I listen to the one you did about pornos with.

294
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,160
And it's like, oh, they always listen to the one where you're like,

295
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,920
I would never send that as the one to listen to.

296
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,160
I listen to the off format one where the audio was really fucked up

297
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,360
from seven years ago. It's like, why?

298
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,800
What did you choose that one?

299
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,280
A friend of mine from high school listened and hadn't listened.

300
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,160
And he's like, oh, a friend of mine listens to your show. He said.

301
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,880
And he said, oh, and I went to high school with Jason.

302
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,880
And he's like, oh, yeah, Jason, we recently mentioned a short story

303
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,200
to crickets like the response to mentioning that story was complete silence.

304
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,960
What short stories?

305
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,320
This happened, I think, when we were talking about

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
two about the impressions to France.

307
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,560
And I said something about like writers who wrote about theme parks.

308
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,960
And I mentioned a George Saunders short story.

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,480
MacArthur genius grant.

310
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, you said we were like, we were like, what are you talking about?

311
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,880
Yeah. And I was like, oh, that's OK.

312
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,320
Let's just move on. Don't worry about it.

313
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,440
This feels like a humble brag that you're saying, like, oh, by the way,

314
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,800
this is a classic relitigation.

315
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,080
It's a relitigation.

316
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,680
But it's also a reaction this time around, assholes.

317
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,360
But this isn't like I listen to the podcast and I was embarrassed

318
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,640
what I heard. This was like I was in the podcast and Jason's smarter

319
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,920
than his other host. Yeah.

320
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,000
No, it was like, you know, Jason misread the room and was created

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,040
with complete silence.

322
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,960
OK, I was trying to.

323
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah. I'm going to say the cricket.

324
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,040
That's fair. Undeserved.

325
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,240
Yeah. As his foes, sir, his co-hosts are dummies.

326
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,560
Which is true. But OK, I get your framing was correct.

327
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,040
I try to get if you can weave organically a George Saunders reference

328
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,520
into this episode will react huge.

329
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,560
I promise. Luckily, there is a rainy pond in Adventureland

330
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
so you can shoehorn in swimming.

331
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,720
I assume I don't know the references myself.

332
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,480
Crickets, crickets, crickets.

333
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Tell us your connection to adventure.

334
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
This was a place that you went on as a kid.

335
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,280
You live near what's what's your situation?

336
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,000
It was a few towns away, but like anything on Long Island,

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
like everything is 20 minutes away.

338
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
If anyone asks, you know, it's like it's a 20 minute drive.

339
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,760
It's 20 minute drive. It wasn't bad.

340
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,280
It's in Farmingdale, Long Island, and it was a go to like

341
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,760
treat destination like, oh, we'll take you guys to Adventureland.

342
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,960
Like once a year was a thing from the family.

343
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,760
But it was also a go to like field trip location for high schools

344
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
and younger. And then also like so and so is having their birthday

345
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,000
at Adventureland or so and so's mom wants to take

346
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,880
so and so and three friends to Adventureland.

347
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,520
So it was it was like kind of like a thing to do.

348
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,000
I would compare it to hiking in Los Angeles.

349
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,600
Would you like to go to Adventureland Saturday morning or whatever?

350
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,320
But it it was a fucking.

351
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,760
And so we had Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey,

352
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,440
which was, you know, way further away.

353
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,720
But we knew that was like the real Adventureland felt like to us.

354
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,480
And again, we didn't even know the differences between that.

355
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,280
We just knew that they both had the word adventure in it.

356
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,280
So it was like Adventureland is like Junior is like the little brother

357
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
to Six Flags. And in reality, they have no connection whatsoever.

358
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,720
It's just, again, our small world of like we've been the Six Flags.

359
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,760
And that's huge.

360
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,200
So this must be the little brother that's on Long Island.

361
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,400
And we fucking I love I love that place.

362
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,280
I love that Adventureland until you got to it like 19.

363
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,360
And you were like, this is this is an arcade more or less.

364
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,160
It's like it's arguably like a large street fair in a way.

365
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,520
You know what I mean? It's not like it's not particularly

366
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,120
thrilling or exciting.

367
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,840
And there's not cool vintage shit that you would be like,

368
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,600
oh, this is legendary. It's been around since forever.

369
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,080
Like the music express. Oh, fuck.

370
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,200
They still they're still playing Get a Grip on this.

371
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,480
Eat the rich in 2011.

372
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,440
Well, this is yeah, you're historic.

373
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,640
Look, we talk about Aerosmith all the time on this podcast.

374
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,040
So you talk about I'm sorry, I don't recognize the bad boys.

375
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,400
The bad boys from Boston is really calling.

376
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,160
So I hate to keep sidetracking, but do you agree with Scott

377
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,280
and I that the best Aerosmith song is jaded? Oh, shit.

378
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,200
I do not. I don't know.

379
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah, it's a little like power poppy.

380
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,240
I don't know. Yeah, it's power.

381
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,280
I like Dream On. OK.

382
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,320
That's a solid choice. Yeah, that's right.

383
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,200
That's because and maybe it's because it's the song when I first heard it.

384
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,280
And someone's like, that's Aerosmith.

385
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,720
I was like, no fucking way.

386
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
His voice sounds different.

387
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,640
My favorite Aerosmith song is the one that doesn't sound like them at all.

388
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,920
Yeah, there is a disk.

389
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,840
However, not understanding that once I getting acquainted

390
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,560
with 80s, 90s Aerosmith, like Wayne and Garth Alicia Silverstone Aerosmith

391
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,880
and like, wait, that can't be that doesn't sound like the same guy at all.

392
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,600
My way into Aerosmith was like the first album I got was Get a Grip

393
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,440
because they were cool from Revolution X and. Oh, yeah.

394
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,160
And those videos that which that VR one

395
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,960
that goes right hand in hand with Revolution X.

396
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,760
These guys are up on technology and they rock.

397
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,800
I love I just watched a full Aerosmith concert four days ago.

398
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,760
What?

399
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,680
On an access TV,

400
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,000
all the rock and roll you'd ever want from all the different personalities

401
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
talking about it.

402
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,200
And Steven Tyler starts out the show in a giant Native American headdress.

403
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,040
OK, good, good, good.

404
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,040
I'm not going to pretend I don't know his background.

405
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,880
I don't know. I'm not.

406
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm unwilling to weigh in on this either way.

407
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
I just said a fact. I just said a statement.

408
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,000
We're all know. Oh, yeah, you're right.

409
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,800
You didn't ask for opinions. OK, thanks for the fact that that

410
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,200
would you say that's one of the biggest things the pandemic took from you?

411
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,920
Because in twenty nineteen twenty twenty, you you were really excited

412
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,360
for the lead up to Aerosmith Vegas.

413
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,000
Aerosmith had been doing a Deuces are Wild Las Vegas residency.

414
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,160
And I wanted to be in the pit so bad.

415
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
And then a Deuces are Wild.

416
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,840
A Deuces are Wild Residences are Wild Residences.

417
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,240
Sort of famous Deuces are Wild.

418
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,800
You know, you're very familiar with it.

419
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,520
I'm very familiar with Vegas and very familiar with Aerosmith.

420
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,240
So this is starting to creep into my likes here.

421
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,880
I DMed the Park MGM and I said, will Aerosmith be back for their Deuces

422
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,960
are Wild residency?

423
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,480
And they said, we have no information about that at this time.

424
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,520
So it feels like no, it feels like they're not going to be back doing it.

425
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,000
So I'm sitting on Billy Joel tickets for the end of February in Vegas,

426
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,200
hoping that that doesn't get rescheduled or canceled.

427
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
I know I'm just like spitting into the wind with Covid.

428
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,960
I'm like, fuck it, I'll go to Vegas.

429
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
That might be OK in February.

430
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,200
But I feel I think you turned the mic off.

431
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,240
Yeah, you're good. Perfect.

432
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,800
Podcasting professional here, turning the mic off mid sentence.

433
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,000
Secret information you wanted to give.

434
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,720
Yeah, I just listed my credit card number that I used to purchase

435
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,200
the Billy Joel tickets.

436
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm glad I happened to turn the mic off.

437
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,680
You'll be in at that with the specific time.

438
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,120
And it's from the sniper section across the other side.

439
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
It's wide open. Clear shot.

440
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,760
No barricades whatsoever.

441
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,480
Where were we?

442
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,160
I mean, we're talking about

443
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,120
we're happy to be in Smith as much as possible.

444
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,440
Yeah, eventually.

445
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,320
Well, I you know, I I saw that in looking at it on on Google Maps or whatever.

446
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,160
And I I noted from above that the the physical space of the park,

447
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,280
I think might be a little smaller than the target that's next door.

448
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,480
Yeah, it is like there's not a ton of room.

449
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,600
No, there is like a mall that's like now like, you know,

450
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,760
sort of not a full blown closed in mall, but like a strip mall kind of thing

451
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,640
that features a Dave and Buster's.

452
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,960
That's like a five minute drive north on the one or whatever.

453
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,080
This is on 10 because I used to be in the name of the park.

454
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,480
Is what we was called Adventureland 110 Playland.

455
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Really clunky.

456
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,960
Try to get land in there as much as possible

457
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,320
so people understand that it's not in the sea or in the air. Yeah.

458
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,160
Uh huh.

459
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
It's not virtual.

460
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,760
People are very confused. We got to say land a few times.

461
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,360
OK, 10 land play land land.

462
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,640
So like a little further up on the one 10 was a Dave and Buster's

463
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,560
and the rest of them all like the Dave and Buster's was like half

464
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,520
the size of Adventureland, you know what I mean?

465
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,160
And it was like it started to feel really quaint as things got bigger.

466
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,840
Like even like the proliferation of like SUVs made Adventureland seem small.

467
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,200
You know what I mean?

468
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
The second you were like 16, you were like, this place is small

469
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,320
because you were just finally big enough to not be in awe of it.

470
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,160
Yeah, it definitely is the definition of like a local park,

471
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,400
like a neighborhood park.

472
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Yeah. And like I said that before about Knott's Berry Farm,

473
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,080
because there's like houses right behind it.

474
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,640
There's houses close by.

475
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,040
But this is really like, oh, yeah, when you look at it on the on Google Maps,

476
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,160
there's a target on one end and then down the street is a speedway.

477
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,640
So it's like it's just off the main dreads.

478
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,320
Yeah, off the one 10.

479
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,600
And it's like, OK, so if you pass the target, you're coming up on it.

480
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,520
If you hit the speedway, you've gone too far.

481
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,800
Right. And that and that one 10 just has the most suburban

482
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,200
Long Island bullshit all the way up and down.

483
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
And it's like a main dread.

484
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
It's a main thoroughfare.

485
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,640
You got Buffalo Wild Wings around there.

486
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,440
You got a Stu Leonard's.

487
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,880
Oh, yeah. People keep saying we got to go to Stu Leonard's,

488
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
this grocery store with all these animatronics.

489
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,920
Oh, I've never been.

490
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,080
I've never. I didn't even know that was a Long Island place.

491
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,600
I think I went once in upstate New York because someone loved their hot chocolate

492
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,240
or their chocolate milk or something.

493
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,920
We got to stop at Stu Leonard's to get the chocolate.

494
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,160
And I was like, I remember being like mad at the woman who was saying that.

495
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,560
So I didn't go in.

496
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,720
Oh, my friend's wife was like, I got it.

497
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,160
And I was like, oh, I'm fine.

498
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,360
I was just like mad at the way she was her energy.

499
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,600
And I like did like the pouty thing where you're like, I don't want anything.

500
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,480
Then you just sat in the car and I said, I'm like, now I'm in a situation

501
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,240
where people are talking about Stu Leonard's and I'm like, fuck,

502
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,400
why didn't I just go in the Stu Leonard's, a guy who loves to see new things

503
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,320
and eat food and drink beverages?

504
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,640
I was like, no, I'll spite you.

505
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,320
You won't register it at all.

506
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,120
There will never be a moment where people ask on on some sort of error.

507
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,800
Have you ever been to this place?

508
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,080
Do you have observations about it, especially the chocolate milk?

509
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,800
Someone did warn us once.

510
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,840
It's like, hey, be careful, though.

511
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,440
There's one Stu Leonard's that doesn't have the animatronics.

512
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,800
So don't waste your time.

513
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,280
Oh, that'd be the one we all drive to.

514
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,720
You take a huge field trip.

515
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,240
It's only five hours away in central California.

516
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,200
You get there is the one without animatronics.

517
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,440
That happened to me in Dallas.

518
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,880
I tried to go to a fancy McDonald's that had chandeliers,

519
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,920
and then I got dropped off in just the most bitter, cold, desolate parking lot.

520
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,520
Immediately clear from the outside, this was not a fancy McDonald's.

521
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,080
Walked in just to make totally sure.

522
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,040
No bad people sleeping in.

523
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,920
All right, let's get out.

524
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,800
I like did a change long lift ride to get to the.

525
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,520
Yeah, it was once.

526
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
I swear, guys, I'm not making it up.

527
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,920
There was a McDonald's, a bunch of chandeliers.

528
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,880
That's worth going way out of your way.

529
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,240
How long did you drive?

530
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,160
Like 25 minutes, I think.

531
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,760
That's not so bad.

532
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,640
Do it, too. Yeah.

533
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,520
Then went in and like, oh, this is Chuck E.

534
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,360
Cheese, though Chuck E.

535
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
Cheese didn't have the animatronics.

536
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
Total waste of a.

537
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,560
Oh, to Chuck E.

538
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,520
Cheese. Not again, not to go on tangents, actually, but I'm purposely doing it.

539
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,000
That's OK. Yeah, we it's for that.

540
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,240
Not a tangent.

541
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,680
A kid had their birth.

542
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,400
Chuck E. Cheese was a big birthday party destination on Long Island as well.

543
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,200
We had a nearby one and a person had their

544
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,960
classmate had their birthday party there.

545
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,320
I went Chuck E.

546
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,440
At a big figure comes up, maybe Chuck E., maybe one of the other gangs,

547
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,640
but a costumed mascot asks me for the gift is like, oh, and I'm like, yeah,

548
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,400
I'm here for Samantha Lopez, maybe Samantha.

549
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,360
I was like here for her birthday and is like any like smiles and nods and takes

550
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,880
the gift. And then later on, when they're opening the gifts, I'm like, hey,

551
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,640
I got something and it's not here.

552
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,840
And it's like no one could find it.

553
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
I was like, oh, my God, I think the mascot stole the gift.

554
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,560
And I remember what the gift was because I started I was old enough

555
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,120
like I was 10 or 12 or something, but I was old enough to know it was

556
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,560
not a kid that stole it like a grownup stole it or at least a 17 year old.

557
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,120
And it was remember those like

558
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,400
scoop little handheld baskets that were sort of like

559
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,480
fake high life for kids, you know, like you would throw like a Wiffle

560
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
ball back and forth with, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

561
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
It was just like a plastic look.

562
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
That's what the gift was.

563
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,280
And it made me laugh so much that like an adult stole that.

564
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,040
Someone's like, oh, right.

565
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,080
Hopefully it's a video game and they just take it home.

566
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,440
And it's something that's like seven dollars in garbage.

567
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,040
You need a friend to do.

568
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,840
Did that doesn't even feel like I could we had birthday parties.

569
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,440
I don't remember like Chuckie or Mr.

570
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,400
Munch taking the gift.

571
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,160
Yeah, it was weird.

572
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,360
Like I walk in, they were like, oh, and I like handed him the gift.

573
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,600
He's like, oh, no, it's I'm like walks away.

574
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,880
And I was like, well, you must know.

575
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,880
Be really funny if it was like not an official Chuck E.

576
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,680
Cheese character.

577
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,560
Oh, yeah, this guy's very specific.

578
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,760
Yeah, he's like, I bought this thing on fucking eBay for eight bucks.

579
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,720
I can get anything I want from these kids.

580
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm a fucking art.

581
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm an art vark and I wander into Chuck E.

582
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,360
Cheese and I steal some presents and I leave.

583
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,960
Everyone there is stoned.

584
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,080
They don't know.

585
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,280
They don't know what the characters of the IP are.

586
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,800
Corporate party yard.

587
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,920
Hey, who's the art vark?

588
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,160
And it's like, oh, I gave my present to the art vark.

589
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
Well, there's no art vark in the band.

590
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,760
It's like, well, I'll tell you what, there's no art vark in the park.

591
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,680
There's no art vark and Chuck E.

592
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Cheese. Everyone laughs at you.

593
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,760
You know, who did I suck off in the bathroom?

594
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,080
What?

595
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,520
I gave him the gift I was going to give the birthday boy.

596
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,920
He showed me we had matching stamps.

597
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,720
Man.

598
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh, boy.

599
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,120
Okay, this place.

600
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,800
What about this place?

601
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,080
Okay.

602
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Any particularly like memorable specific parties?

603
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,600
Yeah, I have a really strong memory of,

604
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,240
a really strong memory.

605
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:55,880
One of my biggest memories at Adventureland, which was I went for a physics field trip

606
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,040
sophomore year of high school or junior year of high school, maybe, maybe a sophomore,

607
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,680
one of those two.

608
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,120
And the girl I had a crush on was in my physics class and she smoked pot.

609
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,800
And I didn't smoke pot at the time.

610
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,760
I just drank.

611
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,080
As a matter of fact, we'll get into it.

612
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,680
We drink before the field trip.

613
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,680
So we get to 40s, me and me and some of the and this is an advanced physics class.

614
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,040
So a handful of the AP kids, we get together and drink 40s at 7 a.m.

615
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,080
before we're going to before we're going to Adventureland.

616
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,440
We're like, get fucked up.

617
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,480
It's a field trip, bro.

618
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,960
We used to get drunk before school, like once a month.

619
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,320
Like it was like, yeah, I was a true dirt bag in high school.

620
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,600
Like I was like, the more I talked to people, I thought the amount

621
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,880
I misread, I thought everyone's high school experience was like mine.

622
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,960
I'm so like self-centered in that way.

623
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,200
Whereas I got to UCB and I'm like, you guys are all crazy ass class clowns, right?

624
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,680
Who try to break a bottle over your own head at a party once.

625
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,680
And it's like, no, I went to NYU for theater and it's like, oh, OK, well,

626
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,520
I guess we'll never get along until you're hiring me.

627
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,280
That's a small type in this community.

628
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,360
There's like there's four more of you.

629
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,160
You'll meet them all.

630
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,520
Yeah, you shouldn't against them.

631
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,360
You're doing a podcast with three guys who were like, like, mother, I took too much cold

632
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,240
medicine this morning, mother, and I don't feel comfortable walking to school.

633
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,920
Would you give me a ride, please?

634
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm still going to school.

635
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,640
I'm still going to school.

636
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,080
My studies are more important than my finger.

637
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,440
Can I take a day off school?

638
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,120
I'm on two different antibiotics.

639
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,080
It's rocking me.

640
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,360
Mother, my canker sores are acting up again, mother.

641
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,160
And I'm worried I won't be able to answer all the questions in every class like I normally

642
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
do during the day.

643
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,720
My George Saunders report.

644
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,560
I'm going to blow it.

645
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:43,960
Mother.

646
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
Meanwhile, you're fucking hammered.

647
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,560
So describing what is happening on another planet.

648
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,720
Yeah, this is like Nat Geo.

649
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,040
It's like a movie or a film.

650
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,840
I'm imagining.

651
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,320
Yeah, so we're we're drunk before school, getting on the bus to go to Adventureland

652
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,920
and we're like having a, you know, just shenanigans.

653
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,200
We're like, we're so stoked to get there.

654
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,520
We have to do some physics stuff.

655
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,480
Like we have to do some things where we're like, just like notice angles and shit like

656
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:17,720
that.

657
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,480
You know, like we'll talk about centrifugal force at when we're in one of the things like

658
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,360
they wanted it.

659
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,520
And but it was all sort of like this is a movie for you to watch.

660
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,800
It'll help you learn biology.

661
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
You know, it was all like get the kids and make them run around or whatever.

662
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,960
I remember that happening at like at Magic Mountain around here.

663
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,000
But then like but there are things that defy gravity and it doesn't even have anything

664
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,360
that would teach you anything about.

665
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,320
Again, the more the more I thought about Adventureland on the drive over here, the more

666
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,800
I was like, it really was very similar to the street fair that would like roll through

667
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,840
or the Strawberry Festival was another one that would roll through Long Island.

668
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,680
And it would be like the same exact shit.

669
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,280
But so we're there.

670
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,000
I'll just name the crush Joanne, which is my mom's name, which is weird.

671
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,280
But this is also my crush's name.

672
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,080
So it's not a I didn't make up my mom's name for her.

673
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,120
I could have made any name.

674
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,240
I chose her real name.

675
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,280
So in case she listens, Carlson's dad, please get her on.

676
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,600
You got to send it to her.

677
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,440
Not the off book episode, the one I'm on.

678
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,760
Don't send her my monster.

679
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
I never talk about her except on podcast the ride.

680
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,320
So we get there and she is drunk as well.

681
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,480
And she's being a little flirty and we were friends, but we only later hooked up once

682
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,200
in college when we were both like adults again.

683
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,160
It worked out.

684
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,040
It worked out a little.

685
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,160
Yeah, I got a strong ending made out in a pool.

686
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,200
During a lightning storm.

687
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,880
So, but mother, there's a lightning storm.

688
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,240
I can't today.

689
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,400
Yeah.

690
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,880
So as a strong ending, like we're like 18 years old, 19 years old or something like that.

691
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,480
But I was like ready to marry her at that time.

692
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,120
Like just, I was, I was like, oh, you were my high school crush.

693
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,760
I'm now cool in college and you like me.

694
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,720
Oh, I learned I was like a drunken hookup for her.

695
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,840
I felt the opposite for the first time.

696
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,640
Something I had done in college a few times at this point.

697
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,880
I felt the inverse where I was like, so like call texting her the next day.

698
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,760
So that was wild.

699
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,000
Huh?

700
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,800
She's like, I know I really, you know, like I made a mistake.

701
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,440
And I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

702
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,940
Huh?

703
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,080
That's where I'm at as well.

704
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Making sure you felt weird too.

705
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,960
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

706
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,640
I've got a lot going on for me at college.

707
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,000
I got to get back early.

708
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,520
Actually the short form improv team I'm in where I've got a big show every semester.

709
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,480
Let me.

710
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,200
By the lightning.

711
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,800
I think, I think our brains weren't right.

712
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,680
Oh, okay.

713
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,880
It was very dangerous.

714
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,920
I know lightning in a pool.

715
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,560
No, no, no.

716
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,200
Making out with you.

717
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,320
For my social status.

718
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,960
Oh, yeah, yeah.

719
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,460
Okay.

720
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,880
But at the time she's just, we're friends.

721
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm the funny guy.

722
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,440
She has a crush on me.

723
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
I have a crush on her.

724
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We're riding the Ferris wheel and we, and the Ferris wheel, I think was like you got in.

725
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,400
It was like a, you can be in like a four person thing.

726
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,720
And it was like shaped like an apple, if I remember.

727
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,040
And like a circular table in the middle.

728
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:12,840
So it was kind of like a cocktail table at a bar, like a four top that you sat at.

729
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,360
And then it just went around.

730
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,840
And so we told the guy we had to stop it at the top for a project.

731
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,640
Can you stop us at the top just five minutes so we can get a met?

732
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,760
And the guy's like, yeah, of course.

733
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,320
It's like, I think it, and if I, I might be misremembering this, but it might've been like

734
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,640
all of Long Island physics classes would go to this field.

735
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,280
I feel like maybe it was like physics day at Adventureland or something like that.

736
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,840
Possibly.

737
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,600
Cause I remember the guy being like, totally.

738
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,520
But then again, he was probably my age, like a year and a half old.

739
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,600
He's probably a year and a half older than I was then and stoned.

740
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,200
And was like, yeah, fuck, I don't give a shit.

741
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,200
There was no question that yeah, totally wasn't going to be the response.

742
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,920
I don't get paid any less if you sit up there for hours.

743
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,640
I don't give a fuck.

744
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,400
So he puts us up there and we're faking like we're measuring.

745
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,400
We have like a weird astrolab type thing that like we took from that.

746
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,560
The teacher gave us from the lab to like, but really we're sparking a bowl and I don't smoke weed,

747
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,480
but Joanne sparks the ball.

748
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,080
So she's like, yeah, even then I was called Gabris by everyone.

749
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,680
I was like, uh, hell yeah.

750
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,240
And I just, I took a rip of a bowl and I'm drunk and I'm 16.

751
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm drunk.

752
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,680
I've been drinking for a few years, but I've never smoked.

753
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,080
Now I'm maybe arguably crossfaded.

754
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,400
We, and it was so, and it was so fun.

755
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,520
It was like magical.

756
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,880
And in my head, I'm seeing like, this is like teen romance.

757
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,280
Oh yeah.

758
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,480
We're like smoking pot at the top.

759
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,400
It's going to be fucking great.

760
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,280
So then we go to get snacks and we go to the concession stand.

761
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,640
We're in line at the concession stand.

762
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,520
We get up there.

763
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,720
They have chicken nuggets.

764
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,680
I'm like, fuck yeah.

765
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,320
Chicken nuggets.

766
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,760
And they were like, uh, do you want barbecue sauce or something?

767
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,560
Probably honey mustard.

768
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,520
Which dip would you like?

769
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,560
I'd be like, I want the nacho cheese from the nachos.

770
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,800
Like they had like a little peel back nacho cheese.

771
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
And they were like, OK.

772
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,200
And they gave me that.

773
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,480
And I'm like, hell yeah.

774
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,080
And I'm eating chicken nuggets dipped in nacho cheese, lit as fuck,

775
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,400
giving them to people being like, this actually rules.

776
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,600
And people eating it being like, it's kind of like, it's hot.

777
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,400
It's really hot.

778
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,920
It's kind of warm out here.

779
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,160
And I'm like, yeah, it's fucking good, huh?

780
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,920
And they're like, yeah, it's really greasy.

781
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,880
And I'm like, oh yeah.

782
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,760
And I'm like digging in, going ham on these things.

783
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,320
And then Joanne and friends are like, we've got to go on the pirate ship next.

784
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Which the pirate ship, I think, is a pretty famous ride.

785
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
I think I'm talking to guys.

786
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,160
Swings back and forth.

787
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,520
Yeah, swings back and forth.

788
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,080
And the cool thing is to be in the last row, right?

789
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,600
Because that hits you the most.

790
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,880
You get the most perpendicular.

791
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,360
Yeah.

792
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,320
Yeah.

793
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,560
And if I remember correctly, the pirate ship, it either had the E had fallen off.

794
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,960
Because it was like PI dash rat.

795
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,880
I remember we would call it the pirate and be like, you want to ride the pirate?

796
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,760
And it's like, it's got.

797
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,840
And it's all themed out like a pirate ship.

798
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,480
But we all refer to it as the pirate.

799
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,920
It's like, was that for physics day?

800
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,880
They just took the E off.

801
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,520
Oh, shit.

802
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,000
We got to take the E down.

803
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,640
Come on, boys.

804
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,040
So we get on, sit in the back row and she's sitting next to me and like,

805
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,400
you know, like sit next to the girl.

806
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,280
You have a crush on your thighs are touching and you're just like,

807
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,720
it's not sexual at all, but it's you're like, you feel static electricity.

808
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,040
You're like, oh my God, oh my God, this is physical contact of our thighs.

809
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,000
And we're on the pirate ship.

810
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,240
And I'm just starting to turn fucking gray.

811
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,760
I'm like, oh my God, I'm stoned for the first time.

812
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,880
I'm drunk.

813
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,160
I'm full of chicken nuggets and nacho cheese and probably a Dr.

814
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,040
Pepper or something like that.

815
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,160
And I'm like, and I'm like, really great.

816
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,720
And now I'm a grown up and I like know that feeling where you're like,

817
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,280
OK, just sit, breathe your little like you've gotten a little too fucked up

818
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,800
or a little too dizzy or as you get older, you know, like, OK, just relax,

819
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,720
just relax. I'm just get water in a second.

820
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,360
I'm good for that.

821
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,520
Like, but then you're just like, are you OK?

822
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,440
I'm like, fine.

823
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,680
Get off the ride and barf in one of those green barrel,

824
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,320
you know, like the garbage barrels that they have laying around.

825
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,960
And I'm just like, I am so torn because people are roasting me

826
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,240
for throwing up from the kiddie ride that is the pirate ship.

827
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,080
But the teachers are around, so I can't be like, I'm fucking hammering.

828
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,560
So I have to be like, I think the nacho cheese was bad.

829
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,480
My friends who know I'm drunk are like, you liar.

830
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,200
And then even the teachers are probably like, you've been staggering

831
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,360
and your breath reeks of fucking malt liquor.

832
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,160
We're on to you.

833
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,640
You should be commended, though, for being considerate enough to make it

834
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,880
to the barrel. Yeah, you get to a green barrel.

835
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,600
I remember distinctly being like, oh, oh, you know, like, yeah, sort of like

836
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm going to demonstrate for you guys sort of this.

837
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,800
Where you're just like your cheeks are puffing and you're like,

838
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,800
chicken books.

839
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,520
You're pecking.

840
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,360
When you see a three or five year old do it, you know what's about to come.

841
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,200
It's a 16 year old.

842
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,200
16 year old backwards, quick silver visor and frosted tips.

843
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:20,760
Oh, yeah, I had blonde hair and our frosted tips from like 98 through one or two.

844
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,440
So around this time period, that was just sort of the natural greeting on Long Island.

845
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,200
You were just like a salute.

846
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,400
Basically, they're like, is he saluting us or is he going to vomit?

847
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,600
Welcome to the island, brother.

848
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,080
Nassau County, I can tell by the nacho cheese, you know.

849
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,520
But that's like my most distinct memory there.

850
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,840
And it's like a highlight for me.

851
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,200
Honestly, it would maybe not be as fun of a story if I never actually closed a loop

852
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,400
and got to make out with Joanne.

853
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,800
I think I would look back at that as like my one chance that I blew.

854
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,640
Because that's how I felt in the moment, too.

855
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,560
I was like, it was really cruising for me.

856
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,480
But again, I'm 16.

857
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,920
I'm misreading everything.

858
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,600
Like friends with a girl who really does want to date you.

859
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,520
And you're like, that's my friend Janet.

860
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,880
You can't tell that she likes you.

861
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,080
You're in love with a girl who's just like using you for homework and you have no life.

862
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yeah, that's I was like, oh, yeah, these two girls that like you, those are your friends.

863
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,960
The girl you love you've never spoken to before.

864
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,800
You've never spoken to and you sent her a note and she said she didn't want to date you.

865
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,400
What's going on?

866
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,240
Just the fuck.

867
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,200
If I would have had just a modicum more of bravery or self-awareness,

868
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,720
you could turn to like a girl back.

869
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,840
Hey, we've like hung out every weekend for junior year.

870
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,440
Are we like, are you into me?

871
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:40,920
Am I?

872
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
I think I might be into you.

873
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,240
It's like, oh, shit, should we kiss?

874
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,200
Like instead you're like, I'm in love with that girl.

875
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,440
What?

876
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,200
She's like five years older, smoke cigarettes, works at a salon.

877
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,360
She fucking wants you.

878
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,760
You're sick.

879
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,400
You drive your mom's minivan when she lets you.

880
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,640
I had a middle school crush.

881
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,880
I don't think I've said this on the show who like was I thought maybe I was like making my way in

882
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,120
there.

883
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,720
We'd like talk between classes a little bit, but she's a little bit like not really giving

884
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,040
me the time of day, but I'm like, this is going fine.

885
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,360
But I was around enough that she could tell what was going on.

886
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,240
And one time she was like, tie my shoes.

887
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,200
And I went, I bent down and did it and I tied her shoes.

888
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,480
So I was like, now she's, I have just sealed the deal.

889
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,320
She was going by prison rules and you were going like, oh, this is the first step in

890
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,960
our courtship.

891
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,720
And she's like, I got them in my hip pocket.

892
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,960
You're walking around class with one finger in her pocket.

893
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,200
Scott's like whistling his way home.

894
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
I tied a girl shoes today.

895
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,560
It was like Cinderella.

896
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,640
Someday your kid will be like, dad, the girl, my dreams.

897
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,040
I tied her shoes in class and you're going to be like, son, this is actually a lesson

898
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,320
I can give you on love.

899
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,480
Don't have many, but let me stretch strap in.

900
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,880
She told me she was going to let me kick the football then pulled it away at the last minute

901
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,840
for days.

902
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,760
She's done this for days on end.

903
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,520
I'm going to try again tomorrow.

904
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,960
It's Christmas after all.

905
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,680
So great when it works because there will be a win.

906
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,120
Yeah.

907
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,680
And that's going to be a satisfying kick to it.

908
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,280
Worth the many, many trips.

909
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,360
Wow.

910
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:20,600
Wow.

911
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:20,840
Yeah.

912
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,240
Incredible.

913
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,520
That has a happy end that there.

914
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,680
That wasn't just like the end for you socially in several regards, but I guess, but I don't

915
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,280
know other people, some people in that group must have also thrown up in similar situations.

916
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,440
Yeah.

917
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:32,760
People.

918
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,240
Right.

919
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,840
I'm positive other people have.

920
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,480
I mean, I would later be too sick to hook up with a girl in college like that.

921
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,320
Like, you know, it'd be like, yeah, definitely.

922
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,160
We're lining this up that we're going home together and I just crossed the line.

923
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,920
I just crossed the thin red line or whatever.

924
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,760
Wait, what's the name of the Malik war movie?

925
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,800
The thin red line.

926
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,200
Red line.

927
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,360
Okay.

928
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,760
Because in my head, I was like, am I being anti-cop out loud?

929
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:09,160
Adventureland also recently back into my brain and zeitgeist because of Good Time.

930
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,400
Yeah.

931
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:09,960
Oh, yeah.

932
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,600
Which I fucking loved.

933
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,080
Yeah.

934
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,520
They like the end of the second actor, a big chunk of the back half of the movie takes place

935
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,840
at Adventureland on Long Island.

936
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:26,920
Not even name change, just it and you see it on a map and they use the real address.

937
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,840
It is just fully the place, which is strange that they, it's cool that they would allow

938
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,640
that to come film here and use the name.

939
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,160
And do acid and kills.

940
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,800
Terrific.

941
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Because yeah, I didn't realize that's where this was shot.

942
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,280
And when you brought it up, like, oh, that's where like one of the most horrifying things

943
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,600
ever was filmed is true psychological nightmare.

944
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:50,840
Yeah.

945
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,360
Which if you haven't seen it.

946
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,480
It might be more distressing than all of Uncut Gems, a very distressing movie,

947
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,120
but I think the theme park sequence of Good Time is so unnerving.

948
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,920
Such a nightmare.

949
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,520
They have to break in there because they left a bag of cash and a, like a seven up bottle

950
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,880
that is full of pure acid or pure MDA or LSD.

951
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,440
Yeah.

952
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,120
And it's in the haunted house.

953
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,960
So it's, which is like a kind of, I mean, any haunted house, I guess will be a little

954
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:29,000
scary in the wrong circumstances, but like that is a grimy neon upsetting, jarring.

955
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,480
Yeah.

956
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,200
I was kind of horrified to realize, oh, it's that place, God.

957
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,080
It's so you feel like you're on acid or so.

958
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,320
Right.

959
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,840
It's, it's, it's pretty wild to like the, the idea of that.

960
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,400
Chincy cheesy ass haunted house.

961
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,320
If you're in the wagon driving through, you're like, this is absolute bullshit.

962
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,520
But if the park, if it's just dark and you look in, you're like,

963
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,600
that's the scariest fucking thing I've ever seen.

964
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,080
Like the side view of a haunted house, you know, you're like, oh, that's too spooky.

965
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,760
But when you're in it, you're like, this is cheesy.

966
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,920
This is, it's a small world more or less.

967
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,880
And then when you just happen to like, get back and look back, you're like, actually,

968
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,320
it's fucking terrifying.

969
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:03,560
Yeah.

970
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,160
The break room is scarier.

971
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,400
Yeah.

972
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,560
It's the, so this is the, see if you haven't seen the movie where the like

973
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,760
Robert Pattinson and I don't know the other actor, but they break into,

974
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,800
they break into the park.

975
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,280
Security guard sees them, bar cod, OBD from, uh, Captain Phillips.

976
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,560
I'm the captain now.

977
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,240
And he, he like tries to find them, take them down.

978
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:30,840
Uh, but they beat them up real bad, a merciless beating and then steal his clothes.

979
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,840
Poses the security guard.

980
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,240
He no longer has security guard clothes on.

981
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,080
He now looks like a drifter and they dump all of the LSD.

982
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:44,360
They force feed it into his mouth so that when he comes to and the paramedics are there,

983
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,320
he seems like a crazy person who broke in and he's just babbling.

984
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,480
And whatever's happening in his brain is enough.

985
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,000
I just, I was like, it's so stressful.

986
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,040
It's one of those movies.

987
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,560
It's not a good time at all.

988
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,360
It's really, there's very funny moments, but it's not a good time.

989
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:00,600
No.

990
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,040
I loved it.

991
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,560
It was maybe my favorite movie of the year.

992
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,840
It came out 2017 or whatever, but I haven't seen it since.

993
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,320
Yeah.

994
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,080
Not when you're at dying to revisit.

995
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,080
I did watch this part of this horrible part for this and it is, it's great.

996
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,160
I got curious why the Safdies were interested in shooting there.

997
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,240
If it was part of their upbringing and apparently Josh Safdie,

998
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,800
the adventure land is the first place that he ever saw bloodshed.

999
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,800
You saw like dumb teenagers get into a really bad fight and blood splattered on the ground.

1000
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,360
Jesus.

1001
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,920
Wow.

1002
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,600
So he'd never seen just blood hit pavement or anything in his life and it was there.

1003
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,200
So just the trashiness of it.

1004
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:42,840
Oh, well.

1005
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,640
It hit him.

1006
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,440
Simultaneously Adventureland was used in, I don't know what this is,

1007
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,440
Sherian Lolley's Diddy Doodle Work song, Bunky Lou.

1008
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,400
So same place, same filming location.

1009
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,160
I think if you keep reading, I read that same article, it explains that in that

1010
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,960
Shinky puts PCP all over Dipsy Doo and they have a meltdown.

1011
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,800
Yeah, so it's a children's thing.

1012
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,240
Kind of a ripoff or an homage.

1013
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,160
We haven't had a chance to talk to the creators.

1014
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:09,880
Yeah.

1015
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,520
So.

1016
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,840
They can shoot other types of scenes there.

1017
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,880
Be creative, guys.

1018
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,640
I'm assuming that's also what the scenes from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and successor

1019
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,640
were like.

1020
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah, that's a pretty big like filming notable aspect of Adventureland too.

1021
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,160
It's the first episode of Succession and that it's one of the play.

1022
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,480
I think they've also filmed A Great Adventure, but it's one of the places that has represented

1023
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,840
the Waystar Royco.

1024
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,480
Oh, right.

1025
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,960
Because Cousin Greg is like a mascot.

1026
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,560
That's where that happens.

1027
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,280
Yeah, he worked before he climbs up to be one of the immediately to be one of the six most

1028
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,880
important people in the company.

1029
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,120
He is super stoned in a mascot costume and throws up out of the mouth of the costume.

1030
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,600
Yes.

1031
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,240
And is fired within.

1032
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:53,640
Kids.

1033
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,960
And yeah, that's where that happens and steals a child's highlight playset.

1034
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,960
Oh, shit.

1035
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,520
Cousin Greg has been fucking me from the jump off.

1036
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,760
I knew it.

1037
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,880
He plays a character in that named Dodrick Dog.

1038
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,480
That's the who's that's the mascot mascot.

1039
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,600
And then in another episode, I think Kieran Culkin has to dress up as Dirk Turkey.

1040
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:25,800
Dirk Turkey is I'm going to use that name in something like John Gaber's as Dirk Turkey.

1041
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,840
Like that's so wrong.

1042
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,240
They do a very good job, I think, in that show of creating not just you can really tell.

1043
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,640
And there's probably a whole episode we could get out of viewing the viewing the Succession

1044
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,480
universe from the theme park perspective.

1045
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,720
But it's so clear that that that awful corporate umbrella owns not a Disneyland, not a Universal

1046
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,400
Studios, but a Six Flags.

1047
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:47,640
Right.

1048
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,880
This is so clearly with like bargain bin IP and it's weird and dirty and unpleasant.

1049
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,320
It's like they've they've perfect their milking like blood from the stone of, you know,

1050
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,760
it's like we're not trying to make a lot of money.

1051
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,240
We're just ripping off like, you know, get a thousand of these bullshit like sweatshop

1052
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,400
versions of theme parks.

1053
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,200
With constant turnover, we never have to pay anyone well.

1054
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,800
No one will ever work at this park.

1055
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,840
Yeah, no one's going to ever really love it either, but no one's ever good.

1056
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,640
People are still going to go because it's a fucking, you know, oasis in a dry desert.

1057
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:19,960
Sure.

1058
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,080
Yeah, we will always put them in somewhere kind of boring.

1059
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,360
Not a lot to do.

1060
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,160
What else are you going to do?

1061
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,600
They're called Bright Star parks, I believe.

1062
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,240
I think so.

1063
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,360
Not going to Bright Star.

1064
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,640
What the fuck else are you going to do?

1065
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,440
That's the tagline.

1066
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,880
Kendall's I'm sorry, Logan's.

1067
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,160
I just created like just put fucking the tagline.

1068
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,960
I don't give a shit.

1069
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,000
Grow a pair.

1070
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,720
Yeah, the show.

1071
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,120
Can we get a hold of the succession show Bible, but just the chapters about

1072
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
different company structures?

1073
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,600
Oh, yes, please.

1074
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,040
We don't need the character back.

1075
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,920
We're around.

1076
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,720
We just want the corporate structure of Waystar Royco.

1077
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,040
Yes.

1078
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,360
Yes.

1079
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,960
I want to read the annual report and the profit margins of their crappy theme.

1080
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,560
I can't wait to like, all right, guys, spoilers for the upcoming season of succession,

1081
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,720
but it looks like they start turning a profit on the European Bright Star park.

1082
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,720
It's like, what?

1083
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,320
How is that a spoiler?

1084
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,680
Are you guys watching the show?

1085
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,000
This is what you're taking from it.

1086
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,280
You're a bright star.

1087
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:29,320
There's one other good similar nonsense to what you read, Jason, in terms of things that

1088
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:29,880
have filmed there.

1089
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:36,920
This is in the Wikipedia that an advertisement for Daniel Keemstar Keem's cotton candy G fuel

1090
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,720
flavor filmed at Adventureland.

1091
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:47,240
Yeah, Keemstar, of course, one of the streamer video game streamer who just now has like

1092
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,040
millions of followers on social media and everything.

1093
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,080
He's one of those dudes who's become just like an advertising.

1094
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,360
Like he's like an advertising.

1095
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,000
They become like advertising companies.

1096
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,800
What agency?

1097
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,920
That's the word I'm looking for.

1098
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,400
Advertising.

1099
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,360
They just become advertising agencies where it's like products come to me.

1100
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,560
I make an ad for it.

1101
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,760
Whether that ad is just me going, I love blank or, you know, here's my cotton candy G fuel.

1102
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,040
Just on his own accounts, just post the most insane thought that comes into his head.

1103
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,480
We'll just tweet it out.

1104
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,040
Oh, yeah.

1105
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,960
I think I saw him getting roasted for some, you know, like a lot of these guys like to

1106
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,360
wade in on like gender conversation.

1107
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,920
Yeah, the current events.

1108
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,640
Their geopolitical view is not the most.

1109
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,880
I have good opinions and I don't put them out there.

1110
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,680
Learn from me, Keem.

1111
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,640
You said something about the Safdie brothers, Josh seeing blood shed there for the first

1112
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,360
time, and I thought this would also be sort of antithetical to your theme park experience.

1113
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,640
But like street fairs, Adventureland and the Strawberry Festival, which was like a kind

1114
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,560
of street fair that came through one weekend in the summer street, the other, the Belmore

1115
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,600
Street Fair came in one weekend during the, you know, jumped around for every weekend

1116
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,880
around Long Island.

1117
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:07,720
But we would go to fight like it would be like you would go like the kids from want to high

1118
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,520
school are going to be there or, you know, like another high school was going to be there.

1119
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,640
And you know, one one of your friends had beef with one kid from Calhoun or whatever.

1120
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,840
And it was just like, all right.

1121
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,680
And then you would have like an 11 on 11 scrum or a fight.

1122
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,400
I've been in like a handful of fistfights that were with the backdrop was the fucking

1123
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,880
zipper.

1124
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,200
Wait, it's like, well, it's like it's a setting in like a street fighter type.

1125
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,680
Yeah.

1126
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,720
Do you go to these places because like, hey, it'll look cool in the background.

1127
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,480
It does start to feel like outsiders or a West Side story when you think about it.

1128
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,480
It's like we're heading to the street fair.

1129
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,440
Gonna be a rumble.

1130
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Would you say 11 on 11?

1131
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,320
Yeah, it would be like, you know, it would never it would always either be one on one

1132
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:56,920
between two kids that got bad and everyone joined in or it would be a sort of a big scuffle.

1133
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,840
And arguably maybe no one really wanted to fight.

1134
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,320
You know what I mean?

1135
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,880
It was like kind of like, well, we just got to get together.

1136
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,800
It was like Rams, butting horns, you know, where it's like, it's mostly for practice,

1137
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,120
really.

1138
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:15,160
It felt like just instead a thing to do instead of jerking off, you know, just to get aggression

1139
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,320
out.

1140
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,760
It's like, let's just go wrestle kids from another school.

1141
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,640
Like the first year you can go to the street fair or strawberry festival without your parents

1142
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,800
is the first year you throw a punch at a stranger.

1143
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,360
It's a long island ride of passage.

1144
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,400
You got got to go with your mom until you're like 12 or 13.

1145
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,240
Then once you're 12 or 13, you go with your friends.

1146
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,480
Then you start fucking whipping the fucking, you know, shooting the guy with the water

1147
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,000
pistol instead of the clown's mouth.

1148
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,360
You just start to become a fucking feral park.

1149
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,440
The closest thing I have to that is going to a different set of kids.

1150
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,800
Backyard Wrestling Federation.

1151
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,240
Challenging them.

1152
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,080
Yeah, like a different, yeah, different fake, like fake fighting with different people.

1153
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,400
Really know the rules.

1154
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,280
You don't like so explicitly, you know, the boundaries kind of.

1155
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:00,840
Yeah.

1156
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,240
I don't know.

1157
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,760
They might be wild cards there.

1158
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,560
Yeah, I did.

1159
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,480
I did some backyard wrestling and really.

1160
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,720
Yeah, I was a character named Aquarius.

1161
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,040
Okay.

1162
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,200
I came out to dawning of the age of Aquarius.

1163
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,000
Heal or face.

1164
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,200
I was sort of a Val Venus, like a fat Val Venus.

1165
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,360
Like I was like sexy.

1166
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,560
I was I would do it in like an aqua colored speedo that I had.

1167
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,120
And I was like a fat little kid, like, you know, fat high school kids.

1168
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,840
Scott Val Venus was a porn star gimmick.

1169
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,800
Oh, I see.

1170
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,760
In case.

1171
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,240
Okay.

1172
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:35,640
Oh, who had in a very problematic scene had his penis chopped off in like 1998.

1173
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,160
But then they didn't reference it the next week.

1174
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,200
He was seemed to be fine.

1175
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:43,080
I couldn't believe that they had a character named Val Venus and his thing was his schlong.

1176
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,280
Yeah.

1177
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,920
Yikes.

1178
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,560
Wow.

1179
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,160
And don't look up Val Venus's Twitter for for good opinions either.

1180
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,760
I'll tell you that.

1181
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,680
Oh, is he a 50 year old wrestler?

1182
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,640
So he's either dead or bad thoughts.

1183
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,440
Was at January six, potentially on the table.

1184
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:06,840
This is I think everybody, all the like backyard wrestlers from high school who now have podcasts.

1185
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,320
It's time to like bring the personas back.

1186
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,680
You mean to wrestle again.

1187
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,180
Yeah.

1188
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,640
And we want to like bring the because who were you?

1189
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,160
Did you have a or were you just you?

1190
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,280
I was fat Carlson.

1191
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,320
P H A T.

1192
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,080
And I thought I was I was like a heel.

1193
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,720
I was cocky.

1194
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,040
Like I was cool, but I was not cool.

1195
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,360
And my promo ability was very poor.

1196
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,680
I I don't see it.

1197
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,640
You believe it or not?

1198
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,160
Believe it or not.

1199
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,960
I can't believe that the confident the confident heel persona of a 16 year old me.

1200
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,160
Maybe not up there yet.

1201
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:47,720
But yeah, I came I came I I developed some better personas when I was doing UCBW on in New York, UCB.

1202
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,840
Yeah, we used to do like a running content.

1203
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:57,720
Charlie Todd used to run like a running continuity wrestling league that would wrestle on the break in cage match.

1204
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,320
But you would do a promo before.

1205
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:08,200
Wrestle on the break and then whoever because he would have like a running storyline and then quarterly paper views at midnight, Saturday at midnight.

1206
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,360
It would be UCBW only show.

1207
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,520
It would be like eight cards or whatever.

1208
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,960
It'd be so long and dumb.

1209
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,120
Who is this for?

1210
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,800
No real athletes doing it.

1211
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,240
Like five people who had any physical strength.

1212
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,320
I did a few of these out here, but they never got it going like it was in New York.

1213
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,320
I think it ran for like five years.

1214
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,800
Yeah.

1215
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,200
Yeah.

1216
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,800
And New York was hard core time.

1217
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,280
Yeah.

1218
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:30,680
Yeah.

1219
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,320
If I was in New York and younger, that would have been.

1220
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,120
Yeah, now I would not be excited to do that.

1221
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:43,560
Although my buddy just my news, my buddy does news in Wisconsin, local news in Wisconsin, just had a match at a big show for like a celebrity thing.

1222
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,720
And I'm very jealous and upset.

1223
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,440
Got to come in as a celebrity because he's a news.

1224
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:48,680
Yes.

1225
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,480
And he got the pin.

1226
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,520
He beat Kevin Thorne.

1227
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:57,160
He pinned Kevin Thorne, ex WWE guy and teamed with Austin and Colton Gunn from the Billy Gunn from the New Age Outlaws Sons.

1228
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,200
Oh, sick.

1229
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,680
And I'm like so jealous.

1230
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,160
Oh, that's.

1231
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,040
With rage.

1232
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm jealous.

1233
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,040
I mean, I know it's its own art form and people take it super seriously, but it's something I've always thought about.

1234
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,280
Like, I would enjoy this.

1235
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,840
Like, you know what I mean?

1236
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,640
Like I could fall back on being a 48 year old wrestler.

1237
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,560
Every three weeks.

1238
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,240
Looking for an excuse to kill my wife and kid.

1239
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,480
Every.

1240
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,200
Every.

1241
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,680
I know where there's a wrestling ring 10 minutes from here right now.

1242
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,440
And every like couple of weeks of my buddy and I are just like, we could still train.

1243
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,200
We could do some falls and shit.

1244
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,400
We could still do it.

1245
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:39,960
Power plan.

1246
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:49,320
I don't want to put you on the spot, but I would kind of be curious about if you could bring the energy of a 16 year old fat Carlson and do any sort of challenge.

1247
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,000
I don't know the lingo, but if you were going to like.

1248
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,120
Cut a problem.

1249
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,800
Yeah, against what was your name?

1250
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,440
Aquarius.

1251
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,400
Aquarius.

1252
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,520
Oh, so you want to channel my 16 year old self how I would have delivered a heel promo to Aquarius.

1253
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,320
I like this.

1254
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,200
OK, I would be like Aquarius.

1255
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,080
What you thought you did last week, that was out of line.

1256
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,320
And I'm here to tell you that you should come out here and fight me now because I'm going to kick your ass.

1257
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,640
Like this is the level.

1258
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,840
Yeah, I would be like you got it Aquarius and for the record, I'm not gay.

1259
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,840
Because if I'm like 14 or 15, I'm pretty making sure everyone knows I'm not accurate.

1260
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,280
Yeah, it's 94.

1261
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,160
Maybe WWE is right to have writers.

1262
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,640
There's still a chance.

1263
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,040
I think maybe when I'm like 60, I'll stop having the fantasy that it's possible.

1264
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,320
Sure, I think that's fair.

1265
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,400
I mean, I do some mouth of the South stuff like I would love.

1266
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,480
You know, I would do a little management like a little, you know, sneak the chair in if I have to or whatever.

1267
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,720
Mitch and Weiger on Doughboy's had Excalibur who just called her commentary for or he just,

1268
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,680
excuse me, play by play for AEW and Mitch tried to get it.

1269
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,000
He goes, you know, what about the Doughboys in AEW?

1270
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,040
And Excalibur went up.

1271
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,720
In what capacity?

1272
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,520
It's a great question.

1273
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,720
And you're mentioning Excalibur now and I'm aware who he is solely because of you.

1274
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,640
Yeah, got me turned on to PWG.

1275
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:25,240
Which I refreshed my love of wrestling because it's been out since WCW and WO on Nintendo 64.

1276
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:25,800
Sure.

1277
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,440
Came back hard for fucking PWG.

1278
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,160
Yeah, it's the greatest.

1279
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,560
Am I making up, did anybody stumble upon a fact that Adventureland is in a video game?

1280
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,440
It's in the King of Fighters 97.

1281
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,600
Yeah, the SNK game.

1282
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:43,400
Well, I stopped myself from going down the rabbit hole because SNK was the company

1283
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,440
that did the modular arcade cabinets.

1284
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,200
So the arcade cabinets that would have four different games that you could pick from.

1285
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,960
Not Neo Geo, but SNK.

1286
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,320
No, SNK made the Neo Geo system.

1287
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:00,040
I think I stopped myself from watching like hours long YouTube videos about like

1288
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,800
the corporate structure of SNK.

1289
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:10,520
But yeah, Adventureland is a stage in King of Fighters 97.

1290
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,160
Wow, wow.

1291
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,880
That's awesome.

1292
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,680
I didn't even know that.

1293
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,880
I didn't even know that I say like I'm an expert on Adventureland.

1294
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,080
I didn't even know that and I grew up near it.

1295
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,680
That's the real answer.

1296
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Very fucked up there several times.

1297
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,920
If King of Fighters had like a creative character, you could recreate your brawls from the old days.

1298
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,040
Shit, that'd be wild.

1299
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,720
Put myself in a fucking.

1300
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,680
The funny thing is that I dressed exactly the same in high school, like shorts and Hawaiian shirts

1301
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,360
and like dumb hats.

1302
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,280
I'm like, oh, I'm 40 and dressed the same way.

1303
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,760
Okay, here's I want to bring up a specific attraction thing.

1304
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,720
I want to make sure I hit it because like,

1305
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:52,040
Gavis, you were saying that how the there's not that thing that's like old and special,

1306
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:57,080
but there's something that might be a little close and it was restored based off of audience demand.

1307
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:02,600
Do you have any memory of a haunted tree, a talking tree outside of her?

1308
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,640
There's been several.

1309
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:08,280
I don't know what the scary ride was when they shot Good Time,

1310
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,040
but at some point in time it was called 1313 Cemetery Way.

1311
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,320
Oh shit, that's awesome.

1312
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,640
There was a scary tree outside of it.

1313
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,720
I remember like and if I might be wrong, but like it's a face on the side of the trunk,

1314
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,760
like built into the tree.

1315
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,200
I remember that image and like it's mouth moved or whatever.

1316
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:26,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1317
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,200
I remember that image.

1318
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,720
I'm going to play a video.

1319
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:35,240
This is going to sound pretty terrible, but you need to get the tone of the guy of the tree.

1320
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,680
Who it's it's like because it's pretty demonic.

1321
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,360
It's pretty from hell.

1322
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,680
And there's also this is a back and forth between a scary tree who is I don't know if you could see

1323
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,560
this probably a lot of glare.

1324
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,320
It is a very disturbing tree.

1325
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,080
I feel and then a and then an owl in its branches.

1326
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,360
And let me play this.

1327
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:09,160
Wow, that what was just said was I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

1328
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,640
What's wrong with the little fun in the dark adventure land?

1329
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,080
And I forget the other exchange.

1330
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:29,800
My idea of fun is not being chased by a man with a chainsaw is what the owl says.

1331
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,720
And then the tree says something about how he doesn't like chainsaws either.

1332
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,800
I had a close shave with one.

1333
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,800
And this is like this video is only 46 seconds.

1334
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,400
And I think that's the entire spiel.

1335
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:47,560
And it seems like this plays with that level of speaker tinniness all day, every day.

1336
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:53,480
I got a sense that if you worked there, this spiel drove you absolutely out of your mind.

1337
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,200
Yeah, you would carve it on the wall of your padded room.

1338
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,480
Carve that phrase in there.

1339
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,760
You're cut it off like bark.

1340
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,760
That is a time where the distortion and the click clacking add to the fear.

1341
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,960
That's by the way better than anything in a Six Flags.

1342
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, you're right in terms of immersion character.

1343
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,800
That's actually cool.

1344
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,160
We talked about getting to this this Halloween season,

1345
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,560
but just since we're talking about a scary tree, I want to call this out.

1346
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,920
We talked about this a while back.

1347
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,520
This Halloween, this haunt cast the fright season, I would like to do an episode about

1348
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,800
scary trees.

1349
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,800
There's a lot of scary trees out there.

1350
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,800
Not all of them are supposed to be scary.

1351
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,280
I'm a little scared of the Rainforest Cafe tree.

1352
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,320
I'm scared of the what's the toy store?

1353
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,520
Is it FAO Schwartz?

1354
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:50,440
There were trees in the McDonaldland universe, apple pie tree.

1355
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,120
I don't like any of these and I would like to figure it out and see if other people are

1356
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,760
freaked out by tree faces as I am.

1357
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,800
There's a there's a bosomy tree in the movie, the last unicorn.

1358
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,680
That's kind of scary.

1359
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:01,960
You know what I'm talking about?

1360
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,440
You hear me.

1361
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,240
You hear what I'm saying?

1362
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,400
Weirdly enough, if it had bosoms in it before 1994, I remembered it.

1363
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,960
You would have posted that tree in your wall in college.

1364
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,960
On Action Boys, we watch classic action movies from 70s, 80s and 90s.

1365
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,840
And I'll throw a movie.

1366
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,240
Well, you know, the movie of the week will be whatever.

1367
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:29,240
I'll put it on and be like, I've watched so many movies on TNT or HBO over the years as a kid.

1368
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,760
I'm like, oh, I think I've and especially like a Chuck Norris movie.

1369
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,120
They all kind of blend together.

1370
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,520
So you're like, I don't know if I've but then every once in a while you're like,

1371
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,120
have I seen this movie before?

1372
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,080
An example was like we were watching The Howling and I was like,

1373
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,760
I don't think I've ever seen this movie.

1374
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,440
Feels familiar.

1375
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,040
And then there's a scene where like a woman takes her shirt off by a campfire.

1376
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,560
I'm like, oh, yeah, I've seen this.

1377
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,960
I have this in my head.

1378
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,640
Of course, this is still there because I watch this at the most like sexual developing time of my life.

1379
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,200
Yeah, I humiliated a roommate in college because a girl came in and I don't know what.

1380
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,720
I guess I was being a real asshole because she goes, what's this movie?

1381
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,680
Fair game.

1382
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,600
And I go, oh, yeah, he's got that Cassini Crawford is topless for like two seconds in it.

1383
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,000
Like, I know exactly what the movie fair game is.

1384
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,520
And I just sold this guy out.

1385
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,760
Although she should be like, you know that too, you asshole.

1386
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:24,520
Did you know that that the book that that movie is an adaptation of is also adapted

1387
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:30,440
into the movie Cobra with Sylvester Stallone, which is nowhere near the same plot or anything?

1388
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,160
Wow.

1389
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:31,800
One book.

1390
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,480
Technically, there's two different ways.

1391
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,120
Wow.

1392
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:34,520
Wow.

1393
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,040
That's crazy.

1394
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:36,520
Wow.

1395
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,360
I think I have all those specifics right.

1396
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:44,520
Did you know that Cindy Crawford's husband, Randy Gerber, owns the Casa Migos tequila?

1397
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,760
And there was a story where George Clooney gave everybody, all the investors in the company,

1398
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,200
a million dollars in briefcases and said, here, now you're all whole.

1399
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,880
This is a story that has come up on the podcast.

1400
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,840
With 29.

1401
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,720
A lot of times.

1402
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,240
It's a hard guess.

1403
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,880
He gave like a million dollars to nine of his friends.

1404
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,080
Randy didn't do that.

1405
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,320
Randy Gerber, Cindy Crawford's husband, didn't do that.

1406
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,120
That was George.

1407
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:06,680
That was George.

1408
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,520
And he paid the taxes for everyone.

1409
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:14,440
And the love with which you say that, Jason, I do think that's the root of it.

1410
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,920
This is your dream is that this happens to you.

1411
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,640
Jason wants me to give him a million dollar briefcase.

1412
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,280
So bad.

1413
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,600
This has been as soon as he met me.

1414
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,680
Any person he's ever made friends with, he's dreaming of them handing him a briefcase

1415
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,640
full of free money.

1416
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,380
Yeah.

1417
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,640
Well, relieve yourself of dreaming of me doing that.

1418
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,400
I'm not a real money person.

1419
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,800
I'm definitely not a briefcase person for sure.

1420
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,240
Definitely an old duffel bag.

1421
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,760
And you have to pay taxes on whatever's inside.

1422
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,080
Yeah.

1423
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,080
You gotta pay taxes on my 1099.

1424
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,680
I'm in over my head, Sherrod, and you've got to help me.

1425
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,120
Patreon does not help you out on that.

1426
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,400
Please, no.

1427
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,000
No guidance whatsoever.

1428
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,240
No Clooneys are they.

1429
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:06,200
Uh, is, is George Clooney like weirdly immune to like the Hollywood criticism of even the

1430
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,600
elite liberals?

1431
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:16,200
Like he's sort of like so magnanimous and backs up his acting talent and he's not very

1432
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,200
out there doing a lot of shit either.

1433
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,240
So he, I think he like threads a very good needle.

1434
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:21,880
Yeah.

1435
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,600
With these stories.

1436
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,680
Well, these are like, it's a good PR story too.

1437
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,160
Cause you hear and Jason is just like imagining it.

1438
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,040
I reiterate George Clooney PR stories sometimes too.

1439
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,600
Here's one that I've heard that I read a new story.

1440
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,200
Yeah.

1441
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:34,600
Could be.

1442
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,800
We have some people here with computers, maybe fact check me after the fact, but I had heard

1443
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:48,360
that he uses his, he does those Nespresso ads to take that money and use it directly to hire

1444
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,320
drone surveillance of like a war criminal somewhere.

1445
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,680
I've heard this too.

1446
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,320
Yeah.

1447
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:53,720
Okay.

1448
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,040
Good.

1449
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:54,280
Good.

1450
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:54,600
Yeah.

1451
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,720
Oh, yeah.

1452
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,840
This is a good story, but it doesn't involve Randy Gerber.

1453
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,000
Yeah.

1454
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,400
I know.

1455
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,560
And kind of whack and that's Cindy Crawford's husband.

1456
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:01,800
Yeah.

1457
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:07,320
So Cindy Crawford who shows like the side of her nipple for a split second and fair game

1458
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:07,960
in the train.

1459
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,640
I was wondering, cause you didn't say immediately what I was talking about, but I knew you knew.

1460
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,200
I knew you knew.

1461
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,520
Before Howie Long comes in to, oh yeah, it's broken arrow.

1462
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,000
Let's train with the screen.

1463
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,200
That's where the screen comes from.

1464
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:20,760
I know that.

1465
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,680
That's that crazy yell he does.

1466
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,240
I think right.

1467
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,040
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1468
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,000
There's a crazy yell.

1469
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
It's like, yeah.

1470
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,240
That is how that's how we long from that movie.

1471
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,840
I believe like the Wilhelm scream.

1472
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,400
It's similar.

1473
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:32,920
The long scream.

1474
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:33,880
We've talked about this before.

1475
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,920
I was looking for it and trying to figure it out.

1476
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,040
Is that the Wilhelm scream?

1477
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,040
And I came across the Google results on the website, not the Wilhelm scream.

1478
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,000
I call them everybody has to clarify that.

1479
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,480
No, no, no.

1480
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,680
It's the Urog, which you'll hear in a lot of like haunted house, six flag, fright fest kind of ads.

1481
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,120
One of those screens is present in Adventureland, the current

1482
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,320
haunted house from like a few years ago, new in the last couple of years.

1483
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:04,600
The mystery mansion is mostly animatronics popping out and screaming at you.

1484
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,640
They're not a lot of story, but it is a suspended haunted house where the track is above you.

1485
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,680
You can see the cars here with the mascot for Adventureland, Alfie Adventureland.

1486
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,080
I love the fucking superhero look.

1487
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,160
It's like we got to get kids in here.

1488
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,200
It's got to be superheroes.

1489
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,600
He does have like a weird 50s.

1490
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,320
He has like a pompadour again, an official symbol of Long Island.

1491
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,200
Our superheroes use hair gel here.

1492
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:30,920
Of course.

1493
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,320
He looks like a clip art, a piece of clip art here.

1494
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,200
He really does.

1495
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,320
It's not a ton.

1496
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:39,400
Colored him in on a menu at a non chain restaurant.

1497
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,560
Yes, he does.

1498
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,840
Well, do we love Alfie?

1499
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,800
Do we love him in spite of the way he's drawn?

1500
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,680
Do we love him?

1501
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,680
I like the fact that he's kind of like original.

1502
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,240
Even though he's just a blank ass superhero.

1503
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:55,160
I do like original IP theme, which they have with the tree.

1504
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,920
This is a small theme park to have two pieces of original IP.

1505
01:08:58,920 --> 01:08:59,480
That's true.

1506
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,120
I looked up the food options at this park too.

1507
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,360
There's a food court called Three Generations Food Court.

1508
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:13,080
There is a restaurant that is just labeled restaurant, which is very funny.

1509
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,320
Then there's a place called Tony's Tavern, which is just a stand.

1510
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,960
And Gabris, I don't want to speak ill of this place.

1511
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,080
Tony's Tavern either is the most guarded place in Long Island

1512
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,480
or the least guarded place in Long Island.

1513
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:31,560
But their options are beer, White Claw, or spiked Arnold Palmer.

1514
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,480
Oh, that is Long Island, dude.

1515
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,200
Holy shit.

1516
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,160
That's so funny.

1517
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:41,320
I didn't a guy named Tony buy it because I remember when it got bought

1518
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:45,800
in the late 90s or at some point in the 2000s, a dude named Tony bought Adventureland.

1519
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,160
Or one of the investors was named something.

1520
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,600
I remember roasting the idea of, of course, a guy named Tony owns Adventureland.

1521
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,600
I would believe it.

1522
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:02,040
It's changed hands a few times now, but it's still owned locally, I think.

1523
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,920
You guys have inspired me and maybe we can do a follow-up episode

1524
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,240
or I could do some correspondent shit.

1525
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,600
When I go back east eventually, when it's safe to travel again,

1526
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,360
I have two nephews now that are six and three.

1527
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:22,200
They're not old enough enough, but it would be a good cover to get to go to Adventureland.

1528
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:22,600
Oh, yeah.

1529
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,560
Oh, yeah.

1530
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,360
I could take you like, hey, Uncle John's going to take you to Adventureland.

1531
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,400
Let's go check it out.

1532
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,280
He's like, hold this boom mic for Uncle John while he's got it.

1533
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,080
Are you familiar with podcast the ride?

1534
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:33,560
No?

1535
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,280
Okay, hold on.

1536
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:34,840
Let me just go.

1537
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,160
Adventureland is this little wall of big postcards from other

1538
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,560
amusement parks around the country and that's pretty cool.

1539
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,080
It's almost like the park road a postcard.

1540
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,200
Really?

1541
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,880
I just saw that real quick in a YouTube video.

1542
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,760
That's really funny.

1543
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,560
I think another ride I remember being cool was Bumper Boats.

1544
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,800
And I don't know if that's a bit...

1545
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,560
I haven't seen that in a lot of like...

1546
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:04,200
Because I guess most of my rides growing up were for traveling things

1547
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:09,080
and I guess Bumper Boats travel not as well as Gravitron or whatever.

1548
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,800
But I remember Bumper Boats being really cool and kind of scary to get in and out of.

1549
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,640
Like, you know, it was kind of like, all right, drive it up over here by the wall.

1550
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,680
And like a teen is going to pull you out or whatever.

1551
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:24,520
You know, it's kind of like you stand and it's like wobbly and the water is like

1552
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:27,080
that fucking Lisa Simpson like itchiness.

1553
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:27,720
Water, yeah.

1554
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,240
Lisa and the 30, yeah.

1555
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,480
I'll say on the current map of Adventureland, they are labeled rescue boats.

1556
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,080
So you know what you're getting in for.

1557
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:35,720
Oh my God.

1558
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,280
Wait, hold on.

1559
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:41,160
I think I also remember the boats maybe possibly had water guns on them.

1560
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,640
Oh, like that you could like, you had like operated like a 50 cal kind of.

1561
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,600
Yeah, I've seen those.

1562
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,240
Water off of it at other people, if I remember correctly.

1563
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah, like other boats but off the ride even.

1564
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,040
That's really cool.

1565
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,360
That's more satisfying than like bumping boats.

1566
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,480
Yeah, because boats are slow.

1567
01:11:59,080 --> 01:11:59,960
You can't get that much speed.

1568
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,360
And I was always oversized, you know, for my age.

1569
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,240
So like I was always in the slowest thing.

1570
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,080
My bumper boat was always like water was coming over the side and shit.

1571
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,400
Like everything was just always like an extra difficult thing for me of like,

1572
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,760
oh, well, I can't get the bar.

1573
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,800
Let's push the bar down.

1574
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,880
Anything else you remember in the ride department?

1575
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,120
I feel like I don't know a lot of the specific rides.

1576
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,120
Yeah, I remember Pirate.

1577
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:35,320
I remember the sort of like Richard Scary Apple Ferris Wheel type thing.

1578
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:35,640
Okay.

1579
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,040
I remember Games.

1580
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:43,240
Like Games was big because like that felt like when you were the age that rides felt corny

1581
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,080
when they weren't like scary rides.

1582
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:45,320
Right.

1583
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,240
Now I can have a nostalgia for being like, and I'm assuming you guys understand.

1584
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,320
I think I'm talking in the right place here.

1585
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:51,960
Go ahead.

1586
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:57,480
Now I can go on a ride that's cheesy and bad and love it because it's not a fucking Marvel movie

1587
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,360
or whatever, you know what I mean?

1588
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,120
And just be like, this is so crazy.

1589
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,480
Someone built this with their hands.

1590
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,120
This is great.

1591
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,720
This has been around for 50 years.

1592
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:08,280
But when I was a kid, the second it wasn't scary anymore, it was like whack.

1593
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,720
But Games was like gambling in a way.

1594
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,360
You know what I mean?

1595
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,560
And that was fun of like, what can we come home with?

1596
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,080
What can we leave with felt like a big thing.

1597
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:24,600
I remember the shift in like, my money is for Games, not for ride tickets.

1598
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,360
I remember at one point where it was like, and maybe it was sort of like

1599
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,160
aging up a little when wanting to seem cool.

1600
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,320
Not wanting to be like cheering on a ride because there were other 15,

1601
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,840
16 year olds around or something.

1602
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,520
I remember distinctly a shift to like, the Games are really what I do.

1603
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,760
I play the hoop game.

1604
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,200
They're all kind of sports actually.

1605
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,320
You know, I'm not like.

1606
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,880
That's like when you're like 11 at Chuck E. Cheese and you're like, I don't do the little

1607
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,920
ride you go on anymore.

1608
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,720
I'm just playing Skeeball because I'm coming home with something.

1609
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,840
I'm taking that toaster oven home.

1610
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,640
I just need 2200 tickets to get the toaster oven.

1611
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:02,040
I just need $1100 from my mom to get that many tickets.

1612
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:08,280
Yeah, Dad, I know that if I wanted a yo-yo, you could just buy it for way cheaper than

1613
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,720
the amount of quarters you gave me here at this Nathan's, but just shut the fuck up

1614
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,760
and give me the money.

1615
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:19,640
So distinct that memory of like Jesus Christ, John, that I'll just buy you a fucking toy.

1616
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,400
I didn't earn it with play.

1617
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,240
On the games front, did you ever go to a place?

1618
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,360
It looks like it's seven minutes down the road, a place called Fun Zone.

1619
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,560
Yes.

1620
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:33,880
Okay.

1621
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,120
Yeah.

1622
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,840
Fun Zone had laser tag, if I remember correctly.

1623
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,080
Yeah.

1624
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,280
So Fun Zone ruled.

1625
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,000
Fun Zone was like a birthday party.

1626
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,440
Destiny kids would have their birthday parties there in my town.

1627
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,000
I had.

1628
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,640
I wish I can remember the name of it.

1629
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:48,040
Fuck.

1630
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:48,760
It'll come to me.

1631
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:55,800
But we had in my town, we had a, one of those rented for three hours for a birthday party

1632
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,960
and it has 10 arcade games in it, you know, like, and it was like the cheaper version

1633
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,320
because it was like the townie version.

1634
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,160
It wasn't Fun Zone a with TM and commercials.

1635
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:10,760
It was, yeah, I went to like a 10 arcade cabinets in like a conference room and they served

1636
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,880
pizza and cake there.

1637
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:18,040
And it was the best because a free arcade at the time, even though you had a free arcade

1638
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:26,040
just still felt like, like it felt like free arcade is to a teen as open bar is to a 20

1639
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,200
something.

1640
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,680
Oh yeah.

1641
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,240
That's perfect.

1642
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,000
Like where it's just like, Oh, I don't like, even when you're in your twenties, you're

1643
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,760
like, I don't want to drink at all today.

1644
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:37,240
I feel like shit, but I don't want, I'm not going to have to pay for drinks at this party.

1645
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,360
So I'm going to get absolutely blasted or whatever.

1646
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,040
Oh, it's a wrap party for the job.

1647
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,640
I'm a PA for hell.

1648
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:43,880
Yeah.

1649
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,240
Open bar.

1650
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,920
I'm going to fucking scream in the executive producers face.

1651
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,200
A great equalizer.

1652
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:50,920
The wrap party.

1653
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:56,520
When you're a PA, it's like, we all eat the same reheated catering bullshit food right

1654
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,000
now.

1655
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,800
I'll tell you what.

1656
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,160
It's very funny.

1657
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,800
You say that because the wrap party is a great equalizer, especially when I was first coming

1658
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:10,520
up because I was a PA who was in his early twenties, super confident, cocky, annoying

1659
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,200
class clown energy.

1660
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,640
And so I was kind of and a party animal and I had been drinking for 10 years, even though

1661
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,960
I'm only 20, only 22 at this point.

1662
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,880
So the nerds who are like segment producers and writers on these shows, I'm working on

1663
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,560
them like at the wrap party.

1664
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,240
I'm like, you fucking bitch.

1665
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,320
Let's do another shot of soco line.

1666
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:40,120
I'm like the alpha at the MTV networks party, which was like the big annual party that you

1667
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,280
had to and they were such scumbags about everything at Viacom.

1668
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:44,840
Surprise.

1669
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:52,040
You had to work 40 weeks or 46 weeks out of the year or something crazy like that as a

1670
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,680
freelancer to be invited to the holiday party.

1671
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:00,600
They checked your how much you worked because someone might get a 20 week gig and then a

1672
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,040
10 week gig in the same year and then they don't get invited to the.

1673
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,920
So it was a huge deal.

1674
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,920
It was at the Hammerstein ballroom.

1675
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,040
Everyone is there from like like sway is there.

1676
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,240
Sumner Redstone is there.

1677
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,040
You know what I mean?

1678
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,360
So even the PAs from best week ever are there, which is what I was.

1679
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,280
So yeah, that's weirdly enough.

1680
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:29,000
Paul Scheer was my level two improv teacher and I was transcribing his take on the bachelor.

1681
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,500
Wow.

1682
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,760
That's probably the first thing.

1683
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,200
It's the first thing I ever saw him on.

1684
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:32,700
Yeah.

1685
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,240
I think you're right.

1686
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,560
Yeah, that must have been because an all all.

1687
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,480
Now people who are like my peers were were people like Donna and Danielle.

1688
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:50,680
Hubel, Riggle, like all these people that I would eventually work with where

1689
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:51,880
I was transcribing all their jokes.

1690
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,880
But Hammerstein ballroom, huge fucking party.

1691
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,000
Everyone's there.

1692
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,160
My supervising producer at best week ever, a dude who had written on Bill Maher before

1693
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,760
he came to best week ever.

1694
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:11,640
So he had a WGA job when everyone else was sort of non-union pseudo writer segment producer jobs.

1695
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:16,840
And so he came in and was such an alpha asshole and he was kind of like the right hand man to the

1696
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,040
whole EP of best week ever, whose name was Fred Graver.

1697
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,640
He was quite a dick to me.

1698
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,120
So I'm I'm not going to let the right hand guy, the right hand guy I've since worked with

1699
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,200
and we've gotten our over it.

1700
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:38,920
But he we we were at the party and no one liked me on the production, not like the comedy

1701
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:43,720
because I was and I think it was in hindsight and this is such maybe a rewriting of history.

1702
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:49,080
I was funnier than the people who did the comedy for best week ever, not the panelists,

1703
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:53,080
but the writers and segment producers would be like would be like this.

1704
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,360
Actually, this is a really funny joke.

1705
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,360
I got to get so and so to say this joke.

1706
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,000
I'm like, let the fucking person just say whatever they want.

1707
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,640
Doug Benson, shut the fuck up.

1708
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,440
You know, so they wrote the interstitial like the setups.

1709
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,480
Yeah, they would write the setups.

1710
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,600
Just can you do one the way you say something and they would try like pitch a joke.

1711
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,760
They were proud that they wrote is bad.

1712
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,120
And I think they hated me because I was like confident and funny,

1713
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,360
but I was supposed to be the lowest man on the totem pole.

1714
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:24,040
Long story short, this guy, the right hand guy, he fucking at the holiday party were all in a big

1715
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:24,360
circle.

1716
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,400
Everyone from best week ever, all the behind the scenes people,

1717
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,720
someone bumps into him.

1718
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:35,400
He turns around, thinks it's me, walks up to me and I don't know this is happening.

1719
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:35,800
He comes up to me.

1720
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,680
He's like, Gabris.

1721
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,200
And I'm like, what up, man?

1722
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:45,560
And he takes my pants and pours a cup of like ice like or whatever is left of his like Jack and Coke

1723
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,440
into my pants.

1724
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:53,640
And I just look at him and I grab him by his collar, raise my fist, punch him once in the head

1725
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,840
and go to punch him again.

1726
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:00,280
And like everyone, like all my co our coworkers, grab me and pull me off of him.

1727
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,440
He's like, what the fuck, man?

1728
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,640
What the fuck, man?

1729
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,000
You can't just swing on people.

1730
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,200
I'm like, yeah, that's what I do if someone does this to me.

1731
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,040
And I'm like so worked up.

1732
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:14,280
And I realized again, like we discussed several times in this podcast, that's when I realized I

1733
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,240
was different than the other.

1734
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:19,720
Like I was raised differently than everyone else is like, you know, I've been working in TV

1735
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,680
production for four years and I'm like, I'm 23 ready to fist fight anyone who challenges

1736
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,720
my alpha dim from the streets of adventure land.

1737
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,440
I trained in adventure land.

1738
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,920
My Sifu is an old tree.

1739
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:42,120
But I fucking but the Hammerstein ballroom thing was always just the biggest bash of the year.

1740
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:47,480
Like and you and your executive producer who was like a 40 year old woman who was beautiful.

1741
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:52,200
And like now I know would be a friend of mine, like a beautiful, interesting woman who's very

1742
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,600
into music and she's like married with a kid.

1743
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,480
But now she's like, take your fucking shirt off.

1744
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:02,040
Like at the party, you know, like everyone is just like it's flipped where you're like this

1745
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:07,640
place rules because it's like if you're 40 and still working at Viacom, you have a certain like

1746
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,720
it has like that comedy energy to it.

1747
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,640
That is a legendary ECW venue.

1748
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,760
The Hammerstein ballroom.

1749
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,480
Oh, she had same bloodshed were spilled there.

1750
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,480
There's something about it.

1751
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,800
Taz, Rob Van Dyck, there are crazy shit went down in that place.

1752
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,000
A friend of mine got thrown out for jumping off the balcony at the party.

1753
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,160
It's like 20 feet in the air.

1754
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,120
It was so loud.

1755
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,800
That's what New Jack did.

1756
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,200
Yeah, that's the only reason I know about the Hammerstein.

1757
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,320
But I was like, well, that seems like normal behavior for the Hammerstein ballroom.

1758
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,320
Dudes jumped off that balcony all the time.

1759
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,600
It's a huge balcony.

1760
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,680
How I think that's awesome.

1761
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,840
You threw a punch in the Hammerstein ballroom.

1762
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:49,480
Wow.

1763
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,600
And hallowed halls.

1764
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,560
Yeah, that's awesome.

1765
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,280
What's the place?

1766
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,800
So impressed.

1767
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,760
Oh, my God.

1768
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,520
My forefathers before me.

1769
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,020
Yeah.

1770
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,880
Before we wrap it up, listen, people have other stuff.

1771
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,520
I got one thing real quick, and I think this might be new because it looks new.

1772
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:08,280
But one of my favorite of the attractions is just called Sports Tower.

1773
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,720
Oh, that's so funny.

1774
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,040
Yeah, that's and it's just excuse me.

1775
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,840
It's just I'm getting the Wi-Fi here.

1776
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,360
So it just looks like this and it goes up and down.

1777
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,240
It's just a bunch of every type of sports.

1778
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,800
Oh, so you're just like in a ball that goes up and down.

1779
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,200
Yeah, it's like so like it's like you it's like what you sit in is half of the ball

1780
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,880
and then a giant ball is above you.

1781
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,400
So you're a soccer ball above you and then half a soccer ball you sit in.

1782
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,440
So it's kind of kind of like a hot air balloon.

1783
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:36,920
Exactly.

1784
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,680
And it's like yeah, Sports Tower is what it's called.

1785
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,960
That's awesome.

1786
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,320
That's like where you get vanished to like as punishment.

1787
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,640
Send them to Sports Tower.

1788
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,800
So no baseball.

1789
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,560
No film it.

1790
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,520
Show his family.

1791
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,080
I'm afraid of the ball.

1792
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,400
Show his worst uncle him at bat.

1793
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:02,680
I tried pitching one in second grade and the coach pulled me out after one inning.

1794
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,680
It ruined me.

1795
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:05,960
It did.

1796
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,600
It ruined me.

1797
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,040
Along the lines of Sports Tower.

1798
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,400
I want to ask you guys something.

1799
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:15,960
Do you guys have like a feverish because I love there's a million rides and a million parks that

1800
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,160
go up and down or they swing back and forth or they spin.

1801
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:24,840
But I love the little flair that each one gets of like the Sports Tower.

1802
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,000
There's probably one where it's Dumbo Elf.

1803
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,480
It's probably one where it's parachutes where and I love the example I always use

1804
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:36,280
that I my version of that that I love is slot machine branding because I'm a big

1805
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,600
Vegas and casino guy.

1806
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,960
So for me when I go I love finding like Arctic Wolf, you know, and it's just like the wolf ones

1807
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,680
are crazy.

1808
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:51,480
Yes, it's like Montezuma's belief and it's like a pharaoh and like money behind you.

1809
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,760
I don't know what any of this means.

1810
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,960
So many pharaoh ones.

1811
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:54,840
The gem.

1812
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,640
Yeah, exactly.

1813
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:01,560
As a fantasy had a lot of them are fantasy adjacent to like you said, wisdom of the gem

1814
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:07,000
or like unicorns dreams, you know, and I like love is there do you guys have that with like

1815
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,760
some of these as you see theme parks?

1816
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:13,080
It's like every theme park has the thing that shoots water and you feel a clown's mouth,

1817
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:17,240
but they, you know, what is the mild other spin that they put on it?

1818
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,400
But you fill a pharaoh's mouth with water.

1819
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,760
Yeah, I love because I love that where it's like this is the same game as that,

1820
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,840
but people are choosing this because it's called majestic Buffalo or whatever.

1821
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,240
Yeah.

1822
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:27,640
Yeah.

1823
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:31,320
Oh God, because all these rides are like this is a cheap like this is an all they call off

1824
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,640
the shelf ride, which is like a basic ride.

1825
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:38,360
Any place can buy but just the fact that there's ball sports balls, which would you call them,

1826
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:38,520
right?

1827
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,040
Sports ball sports balls like that makes it so much better.

1828
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:42,520
Yeah.

1829
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:43,400
Yeah.

1830
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,000
Weird lazy theme.

1831
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,560
Oh man.

1832
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,760
I mean, this is from the higher budget end, but one that comes to mind is how there's like a

1833
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,000
there's a ride that just is like scary spins you up and down.

1834
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,240
Wow.

1835
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:55,960
Your way up here.

1836
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,960
Now your way down here and your face in the ground.

1837
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:03,240
It's like whipping you around on a big pole and the vehicle itself spins and it was in

1838
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,680
a paramount park.

1839
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,600
So it used to have official branding and it was called Tomb Raider the ride,

1840
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,360
but then they lost the paramount branding and they just had to call it the crypt.

1841
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,880
So it's like all got limited.

1842
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:17,640
There was a bunch of those like the Italian job.

1843
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:23,400
The ride became stunt coaster and now it's just like, like how can we still make it feel

1844
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,160
like without having to like change a bunch?

1845
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:25,400
Yeah.

1846
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,520
We're real IP.

1847
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,040
The laziness of the crypt.

1848
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,320
I like, I really enjoy that.

1849
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,760
It's like perfect.

1850
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,160
I like it's like Lenny Croft, the tomb divider, you know,

1851
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:44,440
I really like, we were talking about Dumbo, the flying elephant recently and how many

1852
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,160
carnivals and amusement parks just have an elephant ride.

1853
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,480
My favorite one.

1854
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:56,440
I didn't don't think we had time to get to this on the show, but they're at the lion

1855
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,480
county safari park in Loxahatchee, Florida.

1856
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:04,760
So like in Florida, same state as Dumbo, they have bullwoggies flying adventure.

1857
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:11,400
Bullwoggy was an elephant that was born at this safari park and it is very clearly barely.

1858
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,200
It's a cartoon.

1859
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:17,160
It's just it's not a real recreation of bullwoggy over there.

1860
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,480
But it's just the Dumbo ride.

1861
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,760
It's just like less busy Dumbo ride and eventually bullwoggy

1862
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,800
moved to a number of zoos and was at Disney's animal kingdom for a little while.

1863
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,440
I didn't realize elephants moved around so much.

1864
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,880
It's disheartening, man.

1865
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,560
Did they sign bullwoggy?

1866
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:33,880
Huh?

1867
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,160
They sign the elephant.

1868
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:40,280
Well, I think it's either for they move for medical treatment or to make more elephants.

1869
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,080
He went on a fucking cum run to Disney.

1870
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,920
Gotta go drop a few loads off, boys.

1871
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:50,920
Classic.

1872
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:54,440
Well, the other elephants are like cheering for him as he's walking like a guy who's getting

1873
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,800
released from prison.

1874
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,840
Classic bullwoggy.

1875
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,000
Bullwoggy, man.

1876
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,800
Bullwoggy.

1877
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,480
Bullwoggy.

1878
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,200
It's like Alcatraz, they're clanging peanuts against their cage.

1879
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,080
You know, to me now, I can't wait.

1880
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,520
I'm inseminating right this second.

1881
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,040
Bullwoggy magic.

1882
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,280
Yeah, the Dumbo ride is a good one because you'll just see that like variations of that

1883
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:18,680
everywhere.

1884
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,760
It's like a dragon that has like big ears and like along the trunk.

1885
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:26,680
And you're like, you just painted an elephant green and are trying to call this a dragon.

1886
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,240
And Disney's now going to sue them because it's like, well, most people are going to

1887
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,720
walk by that and call it like Dumbo anyway.

1888
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,560
So it's just free marketing for them.

1889
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,480
Dumbo out of the conversation.

1890
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:45,640
And like Hatch-A-Tatchy Florida is not stealing Disney World's thunder at all, I don't think.

1891
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,360
Okay, let me get to this before we wind it down.

1892
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,360
This is something I should do more often with with Parks is look at Yelp reviews.

1893
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:03,160
Um, this, the Yelp review situation, uh, I mean, there's a lot of complaints about just,

1894
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,960
I have to pay for the wristband myself, even though just the kids are going to go on the rides.

1895
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,600
So I guess to watch out for with the, with the nephews.

1896
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:12,360
But you know what you're getting into?

1897
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,480
I'm like a huge stink.

1898
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,760
I look forward to embarrassing my nephews.

1899
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,880
I am a drunkenly argue with the guy about you.

1900
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,720
I'm not paying extra for nacho cheese.

1901
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,760
Just give it to me for a ticket to enter this place.

1902
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,360
That's weird, man.

1903
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,040
It's gated land.

1904
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,160
Private establishment.

1905
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:37,720
But the ticket and the bracelet caused this other melee that is, is one of the funnier things I've

1906
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,240
seen on Yelp in a while.

1907
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,120
Let me try to condense this, uh, the best I can.

1908
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:47,800
Basically this person, uh, one mega paragraph, so many paragraphs, one star review.

1909
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,160
They're so angry.

1910
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:53,480
Um, and it starts with complaining that if you sometimes you have to wait in a long line

1911
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:58,440
to even get the bracelet and to get into the park and there are no bathrooms on the outside

1912
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:58,840
of the park.

1913
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:02,760
So you have to pay before you get to use a bathroom.

1914
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:06,840
And if you've done a long drive, if you've come in from the city, you got a lot of P loaded up.

1915
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:07,480
What are you going to do?

1916
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,920
Well, you're going to be really weird and write a weird Yelp review.

1917
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,600
I gotta go piss in the, uh, target.

1918
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,960
Well, that'd be better than where they landed.

1919
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,040
So, uh, all right.

1920
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,480
You know, many people need to use the bathroom, but they won't let you in unless you pay.

1921
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,240
The management need portals for their customer portals.

1922
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,480
It's just the human thing to do.

1923
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:31,960
The staff told us to pee in the parking lot because we do not have a bracelet.

1924
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:36,280
We ended up peeing, uh, while a family and their kids walked around us.

1925
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:43,240
Like there's been a way to not be peeing next to the children straight onto the pavement.

1926
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,960
Does this guy know what plumbing hookups cost nowadays?

1927
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,720
Hey, come on, buddy.

1928
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,520
Give me a portal.

1929
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,040
Oh no.

1930
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,640
I'm in, I'm in earth prime.

1931
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,280
I hope there's toilets here.

1932
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,880
And then this leap.

1933
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,520
Imagine if we end up getting in a video.

1934
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,400
I guess it's free advertisement for Adventureland.

1935
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,280
How humiliating for me and especially my wife.

1936
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,040
Reviews go on.

1937
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,920
Uh, the staff actually said to pee in the parking lot.

1938
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:17,880
Then he keeps saying shame, but he says Shane with an N instead multiple times.

1939
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,840
Urinating in the parking lot is illegal and disgusting.

1940
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,440
And then again, he brings and these reviews are months apart by the way.

1941
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,920
So these fixated on this specific idea.

1942
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:32,280
We hope nobody took a video of us when their staff wouldn't let us use the restroom after

1943
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,720
traveling for hours.

1944
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:39,640
If anyone ended up taking a video of us urinating, especially with my wife in that position,

1945
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,120
we are taking legal action against it.

1946
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,000
Holy shit.

1947
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,200
How does his wife piss?

1948
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:45,960
What question?

1949
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:47,800
What are we talking about?

1950
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,560
That's how she's comfortable.

1951
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:52,920
Who taking video?

1952
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,560
This sounds like someone took a video or he did and she's mad about it.

1953
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,720
And he's like, I think it was someone else at the park.

1954
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,320
And I got to get to the bottom of it.

1955
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:04,120
Remembering where I was, I couldn't have been filming you.

1956
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,200
There's a car antenna in the way.

1957
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,880
I think some weirdo put this straight on the porn hub.

1958
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,520
Tits out wife Adventureland piss vid.

1959
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,560
So this was interesting.

1960
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,520
And then I kept going.

1961
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,120
Let me keep looking at one stars.

1962
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:24,120
And then I landed at first of all, when me and my husband got to the park, we needed

1963
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,880
to use the restroom very badly.

1964
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:29,320
There was a long line into the park and they said we couldn't go in without a wristband.

1965
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,000
I'm like, oh my God, this keeps happening.

1966
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,200
People keep not getting to pee until they get into the park.

1967
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,200
As I went on, I went, wait a minute.

1968
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,360
The first review was Jeff D.

1969
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,440
The next review is Andy.

1970
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,040
They're both from urinator.

1971
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,120
I think it's out here.

1972
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:46,920
I just started.

1973
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:52,280
And both accounts involve somebody like somebody named Bob, the manager, saying after their

1974
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,080
third time at City Hall, all right, fine.

1975
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,600
What if I offer you dinner?

1976
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,560
And their response is it's too late for dinner.

1977
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,200
I'm not hungry now.

1978
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,160
Like that poor Bob is trying to do something for me.

1979
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:05,720
Oh, man.

1980
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,080
No, I'm full.

1981
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,560
So then but her account adds another thing to the story.

1982
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,560
What did he want us to do?

1983
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:14,680
Go in the parking lot.

1984
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,960
He shrugged his shoulders and suggested that that's what we do.

1985
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:22,680
We ran to a section behind a car where both my husband and I squatted to go pee.

1986
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,440
He squatted too?

1987
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:24,600
Yeah.

1988
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,440
The husband also squatted.

1989
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,960
Who made you squat?

1990
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,440
The manager didn't say you had to squat.

1991
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:35,000
Yeah, it's also funny that the manager's like, the other guy's like, they told us to pee in

1992
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,480
the lot.

1993
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,880
Then her recollection is like, what do you want us to do?

1994
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,160
Pee in the lot?

1995
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:40,120
And he's like, OK.

1996
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,360
He's just like saying OK.

1997
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,080
And the husband's like, that guy, Bob's a sick fuck.

1998
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,320
I've got a video of my wife.

1999
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:52,360
Bob wants me to go squat and pee in front of all the children, in front of the prying

2000
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,360
eyes of as many children as possible.

2001
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,000
That's what Bob's look conveyed to me.

2002
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,520
I got to say, though, I don't have an assumption of me being able to go to a bath, unless it's

2003
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,520
like a restaurant where my table's not ready.

2004
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,160
You know what I mean?

2005
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:12,760
If I'm waiting in line outside at a bar to get in college or a club that has a long line,

2006
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:18,600
I wouldn't expect to be able to cut the entire line to urinate and then get back in line.

2007
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:18,840
No.

2008
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,320
That has never been allowed anywhere.

2009
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,320
It's unfortunate.

2010
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:23,800
It sucks.

2011
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,920
You have to kind of plan for that.

2012
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:28,680
It's like, I'm going to run across the street to the Carvel and get an ice cream cone and

2013
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,320
pee in there.

2014
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,880
There's a target, a Starbucks, and a gas station.

2015
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,640
Going the same direction.

2016
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:37,240
You would have like going into a theme park and trying to pee is the same as if you were

2017
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:41,400
like going to like if there was only a bathroom pass security in an airport.

2018
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,040
Right, right.

2019
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,320
It would be like, what?

2020
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,760
It's going to be like, you know, a nine minute walk.

2021
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,560
I mean, at Adventureland, nine minutes takes you from one end to the other.

2022
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,280
But like in another theme park, you'd have to like walk all the way to the bathroom and

2023
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:57,400
then like be escorted back out in line or cut the line and buy a bracelet because you're

2024
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,080
pretending you have to urinate.

2025
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,600
There's no special treatment.

2026
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,520
The people in the line are going to be mad at you.

2027
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,360
There's humiliation either way.

2028
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:05,640
Yeah, it's Long Island.

2029
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,560
Just piss your pants, piss in the parking lot.

2030
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,600
No one's going to give a fuck.

2031
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,360
Is this like a piss scam?

2032
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,760
Bob's got a fucking OnlyFans.

2033
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,280
He's like, oh, it's Bob's.

2034
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,320
You guys want a dinner?

2035
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,240
I'm flossing with cash over here.

2036
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,960
If you're in Long Island, go to Adventureland.

2037
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,320
Do not go to Bobland.

2038
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,800
Yeah, Bobland is very fucked up.

2039
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:34,040
They have the Sprite bottle full of PCP, though, at Bobland.

2040
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,800
Really quick, there's a little more to the story of them.

2041
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,760
I was curious what their other reviews are like.

2042
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:47,880
And it's a ton of similarly unhinged one star reviews of like it's they seem to like go to

2043
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:51,320
buffets in the New York area and get upset about different things.

2044
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:52,840
It's COVID.

2045
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:56,760
They the people, the customers in line weren't using masks or gloves.

2046
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,360
I'm like, hang on.

2047
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:00,280
We've been in this for nearly two years.

2048
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:04,760
I have never seen gloves as a suggestion in any establishment.

2049
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,800
Also, your gloves.

2050
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:10,600
You're taking your fucking life into your hands going into a buffet during the pandemic.

2051
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,680
I'm not judging you for doing it, but you can't go in there and be like, this is not COVID safe.

2052
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,520
That's not how it works.

2053
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,080
Unfortunately, I don't think it was safe before.

2054
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,040
Right.

2055
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:29,480
But my favorite review that we that I landed at was a poor review for a music tutor.

2056
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:36,600
And the winding path that this takes where it starts with music related concerns,

2057
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:43,560
such as she rarely taught me any areas down to then through a lot of obscure music complaints,

2058
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,480
she doesn't know how to teach the harmony.

2059
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:48,600
But then it gets into out of nowhere.

2060
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,920
She doesn't know how to drive.

2061
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:57,240
So many times she had me drive her around for free places like a wedding that we weren't invited to

2062
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:00,120
where she made me and my husband sing without practice.

2063
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:01,400
What?

2064
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,440
I'm confused.

2065
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:08,520
I was snuck in there and D or whatever your name is and M.

2066
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,040
Holy shit.

2067
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,920
I get complaining that your music teachers roped you into driving,

2068
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:19,400
but I didn't know she wrote to driving her to a gig playing with her.

2069
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:20,280
That sounds good.

2070
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,040
That sounds like a dream come true.

2071
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,080
Yeah, that might be fun.

2072
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,480
Like rip the bandaid off situation.

2073
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,280
Look, you know, pressures on perform.

2074
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:33,400
Imagine you book a singer for your wedding and she comes with like two students who are

2075
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,760
seethingly mad and are begging to use your bathroom and being like,

2076
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,080
why the fuck would you let me piss in your wedding?

2077
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,640
Do you have triple A my check engine light cable?

2078
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:44,760
Stop looking at my wife while she squats in the fucking parking lot.

2079
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,560
You sickos.

2080
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,320
You fervor.

2081
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:49,560
She wants to squat and be in positions.

2082
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,360
Like me.

2083
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,560
This is how I piss.

2084
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,000
I tuck my dick between my legs.

2085
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,840
So the tip touches the concrete.

2086
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,840
My deepest squat and I just let it out.

2087
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,120
So there's no splash.

2088
01:36:58,760 --> 01:36:59,000
What?

2089
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,320
The art is.

2090
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:04,280
You know, lift us up where we they all start singing

2091
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,480
after railing about the lack of bathrooms at the wedding.

2092
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,440
We need portals.

2093
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,640
This wedding has no portals.

2094
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:19,320
The arc this Yelp account has taken is more interesting than a number of short stories

2095
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,040
I have read.

2096
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:21,800
Bye.

2097
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,160
George Saunders stories.

2098
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,160
Civil Warland in decline.

2099
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,760
And that's a theme park based.

2100
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,560
That is the park.

2101
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,320
It's about a Civil War theme park falling apart.

2102
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:37,240
Great story.

2103
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:39,240
One more thing really quick.

2104
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,000
The other complaint.

2105
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:46,840
The other complaint I think during these forced somehow without a gun in play drive to a

2106
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,240
wedding and make you perform at a perform at the wedding on these drives.

2107
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,880
She talks about things like her boyfriend and their sex life.

2108
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:58,760
And once she talked about how she likes the beast and Rolf because they are hairy like

2109
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,720
the men she likes.

2110
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:01,640
What's Rolf?

2111
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:03,160
Rolf is from Muppets.

2112
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,120
Yeah, the dog.

2113
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,000
He's the piano player.

2114
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,280
And he's Hank McCoy.

2115
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,280
Yeah, I think so.

2116
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,440
Probably Beauty and the Beast.

2117
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,480
Or is it X-Men?

2118
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,120
I don't know.

2119
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,480
Ron Perlman beast.

2120
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:13,960
Could be.

2121
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,920
Kelsey Grammer beast.

2122
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,440
Is it Nicklaus Old Beast?

2123
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:21,240
I mean all of our dreams are Kelsey Grammer beast.

2124
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:21,740
Yeah.

2125
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:27,400
So yeah, drive me around perform at this wedding.

2126
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:33,960
Squad in the bathroom and listen to how I want to fuck Rolf the dog.

2127
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:40,280
So we're still waiting on the succession show Bible, but you have found the Requiem for a Dream show.

2128
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:42,680
Juice by Sarah.

2129
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,640
Juice by Sarah.

2130
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,680
It's really funny because I thought she was gonna be like, she makes me pick her up and drop her

2131
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:52,760
off, which is kind of annoying as hiring a music teacher or whatever.

2132
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:56,680
And I'm thinking piano or guitar and I'm thinking it's for her kids.

2133
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:57,740
Right?

2134
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,240
These are adults who want to be operatic type singers.

2135
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:08,680
Now imagine you and your wife taking opera lessons together at your house and then you have to like,

2136
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,920
all right, let's both drive her to the wedding.

2137
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:17,720
If I'm her husband, I'll be like, look, please you've embarrassed me in front of Bob at Adventureland.

2138
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,680
Take this woman by yourself to the fucking theme park.

2139
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:23,240
Look, Gabris, you got out of Long Island your way.

2140
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,520
She's trying to get out there.

2141
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,520
And all the UCB is fucking closed in Manhattan.

2142
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,640
Yes handing isn't enough anymore, brother.

2143
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:37,800
I gotta sing arias with my husband unprepared at weddings.

2144
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,040
Anyway, this is one of the best pieces of literature.

2145
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:44,440
I know.

2146
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,960
Holy shit, please send a link.

2147
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:50,760
I'm thrilled with this, which for that I really have to thank you for bringing Adventureland,

2148
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:57,640
the wonderful world of Adventureland, an episode full of punching and peeing

2149
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,960
and blood splashing and fighting.

2150
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,360
Just like my child.

2151
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,960
You painted a picture of your life.

2152
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:07,880
John Gabris, you survived podcast The Ride.

2153
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,480
What a blast.

2154
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,920
Oh my God, so much fun.

2155
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,520
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2156
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,360
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2157
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:15,000
Yes.

2158
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,160
I got a podcast called High and Mighty and I also have a podcast called Action Boys,

2159
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,720
which is a Patreon podcast, but we got some free episodes out there.

2160
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:25,960
So wherever you're listening to this, just search for it and get a sniff, get hooked.

2161
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:31,320
And then every Monday night at 11 Eastern, 8 Pacific, I'm talking movies live on Spotify

2162
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,800
Green Room and you can talk to me as well.

2163
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:40,840
It's complicated and an app that's kind of difficult to figure out, but I'm enjoying doing

2164
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,280
it and I'd love to see some more people there.

2165
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:49,400
It's not easy to find, but what you do, hopefully you will never hear this blog.

2166
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:53,320
Hey, still less horrific than whatever Clubhouse is.

2167
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:53,880
Right, right.

2168
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,640
It's the same exact thing.

2169
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,200
I see.

2170
01:40:58,920 --> 01:40:59,400
All right.

2171
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,800
Hey, and as for us, you can find us on the socials at Podcast The Ride.

2172
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,160
Merch is available in our Tee Public store and for three bonus episodes every month,

2173
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:11,480
check out Podcast The Ride, the second gate at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2174
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:14,360
I can't promise that other episodes are as violent as this.

2175
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:15,720
I promise that they are not.

2176
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,240
I think you brought, I'm not sure.

2177
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,600
Maybe nobody but Mundy has talked about fighting on the show.

2178
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,440
This is generally the pool of the guests.

2179
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,600
Talk about a guy you see at a lot of auditions.

2180
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:30,360
Oh boy.

2181
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:30,600
All right.

2182
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:31,720
Thanks for listening everybody.

2183
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:33,240
See you.

2184
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,120
See you.

2185
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:34,440
Bye.

2186
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,440
