1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever!

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog!

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:12,160
Audience, audience, when we last left the Good Boys, they were ripped apart from each other and scattered into different corners of the multiverse.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,900
The only way they can fix the dimensional rift and reunite is to record separate solo podcasts about stuff at malls next to theme parks.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,100
We take you now to Mike's End of the Multiverse.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:38,540
Today, on the 23rd installment of Wompoppers Dusty Trail, a restaurant retrospective, we dig into some newly unearthed audio from restaurant owner C.

7
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,680
L.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,480
Wompopper the 4th himself.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,500
Yee-haw!

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,420
Wompoppers, Wompoppers, bag, borrow, even steal!

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,560
Wompoppers, Wompoppers, to afford our wagon meal!

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,700
Wompoppers, Wompoppers, get your wagon to a mule!

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,440
Wompoppers, Wompoppers, come up after Sunday school!

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,600
Dad and Abbot eat here already!

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,720
Welcome back to Wompoppers Dusty Trail, a restaurant retrospective.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,120
I'm your host Michael R.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,580
Carlson.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,860
This is of course the only weekly podcast dedicated to the history of Wompoppers Wagon Works Restaurant,

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,520
a wagon dealership themed eatery located just outside Universal Studios Hollywood from 1981 to 1988.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,720
For weeks now, we've been looking through menus, digging through trash, and talking to ex-employees,

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,180
all in an effort to gain some insight into why this brilliant restaurant closed.

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,500
Well today, I'm happy to report we've hit the mother-load.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,280
A freshly unearthed interview with Wompoppers owner and proprietor C.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,400
L.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,920
Wompopper the 4th.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,260
C.

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,360
L.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,520
of course based this restaurant on his great grandfather's wagon dealership that was opened near the Coanga Pass in the mid-1800s.

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,080
In this newly acquired audio, C.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,200
L.

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,380
the 4th addresses a number of personal and professional incidents and accusations

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,180
that eventually led to his business' closure.

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,340
Now we take you to 1981.

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,700
This is Cassidy Blaine on Cassidy's hard-hitting news exposés.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
Today I am here with a controversial figure.

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm talking about none other than C.

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,200
L.

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,000
Wompopper the 4th.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,720
And we're here to discuss the many allegations leveled against him about his practices, his restaurant, and his lifestyle.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, thank you for having me.

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,500
I think you're going to find that I'm an honest guy.

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:41,140
And all I want to do is make a bunch of nice people happy by serving them wagon burgers, donkey drinks, and tumbleweed tuna melts.

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,160
When people are coming into the restaurant, there have been some complaints that people are actually contracting cholera and measles.

44
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,600
And I don't know if this is intentional, but it seems like C.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,800
L.

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,880
Wompopper is the epicenter for these ancient or bygone illnesses.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,220
Well, let me address that right away and say you are correct about it.

48
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,960
Oh my God, thank you for being so open and agreeing.

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,760
I really thought I was going to have to bully you.

50
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,440
Oh no, I'm an honest man, yeah.

51
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,680
So we are hosting child measle parties in the back room.

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,380
What is a measle party?

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,520
Measle party where one kid gets measles and you throw them in a pan, about 100 kids in a pan.

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,400
In a pan or in a pen?

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,060
In a pan.

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,340
Okay, well I still can't fully understand.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,460
Is that pan or pen?

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,440
It's a pan, yeah.

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,820
Because if you're putting them in a hot object that's being heated on a stove, that sounds crazy.

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,700
If you're putting them in a pig sty, I get behind it.

61
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,140
Well, it's a big area, but it is also heated.

62
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,260
So you heat the measles out of them.

63
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, but is the point to get the measles to spread or are we just, you know, like a, what is this, like vapor going away?

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,400
When you heat up a child with measles, the measles comes out of him faster.

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,900
And then it can spread to the other children who just get it out of the way.

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,580
So you can do it in the summer, you can do it on a spring break.

67
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,920
Kids get the measles out of the way like that.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,540
But they're playing, they're having fun, they're doing all sorts of imaginative games, okay?

69
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,540
And I heard some of those imaginative games are assembling the wagon burgers.

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,900
For a lot, a lot, as far as kitchen staff is concerned, yeah.

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,060
Kids will assemble the burgers in a hot room.

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,040
Okay.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,560
Some might say this is child labor issue.

74
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,560
It is, yeah.

75
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,540
Okay, so you're…

76
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,720
But we're getting around it.

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm just skirting it.

78
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm just not doing, I'm not following the rules.

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,240
Okay, and why aren't you following the rules?

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,000
Because it's easier not to.

81
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:44,200
Well, I think every liar and huckster throughout time has felt that way.

82
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,080
I think so, but have I lied yet?

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,300
I don't think I have.

84
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,880
Honestly, you have.

85
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,440
I don't think I have.

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
I think I'm being truthful here.

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,300
It's true, it's true.

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,920
I've been remarkably surprised by how honest you've been.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,200
So truthful.

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,360
People say that the restrooms at your restaurant…

91
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,520
Go ahead.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:14,140
…

93
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,140
are unclean, that they feel like outhouses, and they are literally outside.

94
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,800
There's no actual plumbing.

95
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,720
Well, I want to address that because…

96
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,420
Yes.

97
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,420
People say outhouse.

98
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,400
Well, there's no house.

99
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,920
It's just out.

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,220
So you just go out, and then it's like choose your own adventure as far as what you want to do.

101
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:32,480
How you want to do it in the open, or you can bring a tarp from home and just cover yourself up.

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,460
Yeah, because there aren't even like kind of sitting areas.

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,660
It's just like an open…

104
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,340
Yeah, it's dirt and grass.

105
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,500
And then everything rolls down the hill toward Ventura Boulevard.

106
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,560
Heated child measle rooms and excrement rolling and mudsliding down the hill toward Ventura Boulevard.

107
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,260
But these revelations were just the tip of the mesa.

108
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
You know, it's really bugging me lately.

109
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,800
People are obsessed with these submarine sandwiches.

110
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,820
They're like, oh, these are so good.

111
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,320
We love submarines.

112
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,020
But what about wagons?

113
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,760
Okay?

114
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,060
Let's make the vehicle, the wagon, more popular.

115
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,580
Which is why I've debuted my new sandwich called Wagon Sandwich.

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,700
Wags for short.

117
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,820
It's a ham, thin layer of mayonnaise, more ham, and then a thicker layer of mayonnaise.

118
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:27,340
And I've heard that this mayonnaise is kept in the same pan with the children and may or may not be too hot.

119
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,980
It is.

120
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,020
It's hot mayonnaise.

121
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,160
Yeah, and some people complain about the mouth feel.

122
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,300
Yeah, it's unnerving.

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
It's lumpy as well.

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,820
Yeah.

125
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,120
And yeah, some people complain about it, but like that's sort of one of our signatures is just having lumpy hot mayonnaise.

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,920
Yeah.

127
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,880
And it's like it'll it also it's a it lingers with you as well.

128
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,180
Like you'll be driving down the hill here after you've eaten here and you'll feel it'll be like stuck in your throat.

129
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:04,080
You know, yeah, I wanted to address that because people have been leaving your restaurant and immediately choking on the way home.

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:04,960
Yeah.

131
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,920
What happens is we've had a string of people choking on their cars as they drive down the hill toward Ventura.

132
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,720
So on any given night, there are about 30 car accidents.

133
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,140
Yes.

134
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,480
Of people colliding just into the businesses on Ventura.

135
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,120
Yeah.

136
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,820
And some people say that your restaurant is a scourge for Los Angeles.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Well, I can only agree with that.

138
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,300
OK.

139
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,260
Well, again, you're too dang charming.

140
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,620
I got.

141
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,900
Hey, do you want to buy a bottle of romantic liquid?

142
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,460
I mean, it looks cloudy.

143
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,560
It's called C.

144
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,860
A.

145
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,700
O.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,860
Poppers Romantic Liquid.

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,540
And I'm just curious, is this like an elixir you drink?

148
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,020
Is this something you rub on your body?

149
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
What is this romantic liquid?

150
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,940
Well, between the two of us, it's that hot, thick mayonnaise.

151
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,740
It's the same thing.

152
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,420
OK.

153
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,200
And would you say because I've heard you've made claims that this is an aphrodisiac.

154
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
Oh, yeah, it is.

155
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,000
OK.

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,220
And what does that mean?

157
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,780
Is this is this the secret that got your grandpappy doinking?

158
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,000
OK.

159
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,440
Across America should be very honest.

160
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,980
Here's what's going on.

161
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,320
All right.

162
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,280
And you're going to say you're going to say, oh, my God, I saw it all now.

163
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,600
The pieces all make sense.

164
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,060
All right.

165
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,460
Yeah.

166
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:28,100
So my great grandfather was into that auto erotic asphyxiation as many wagoners are, as many wagoners are.

167
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,080
All the famous ones were into it.

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,480
OK.

169
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Because like basically what it is, when you're wheeling and dealing and you're selling wagons, you're chasing a high.

170
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Yeah.

171
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,640
You're chasing the high of the deal, chasing the high of selling a bunch of wagons.

172
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,040
And what would happen is that he would need greater and greater sexual gratification, essentially.

173
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,720
I mean, anything we do in life, we get used to it and then need to have a bigger boost.

174
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,280
That's right.

175
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,100
That's right.

176
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
We get used to stuff and then we need a bigger boost.

177
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,880
So what he would do is he would have this hot mayonnaise that would stick in your throat.

178
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,380
OK.

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,540
It would make him choke.

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,260
That would do the same basic thing as having a hand around it or a belt around it.

181
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,580
But how would he then release the pressure?

182
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,460
How would he then release that?

183
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,540
Just drink a glass of water.

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,320
So you're getting really hot and horny with this mayonnaise in your throat.

185
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,140
Yeah, go ahead.

186
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,420
Yeah.

187
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,920
You spooch and then you reach for a glass of water.

188
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,340
But some people put it into the lovemaking.

189
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,920
They have a partner give you the water.

190
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,720
OK, great.

191
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,980
That could be part of it.

192
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,540
Yes.

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,640
I mean, I'm not judging anyone's water or mayonnaise practices.

194
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Good.

195
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,680
Yeah, don't.

196
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,260
Who knew that the original C.

197
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,400
L.

198
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,260
Wompopper was a mayonnaise pervert?

199
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,680
You're offering me this mayonnaise.

200
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,360
Yeah.

201
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,680
And some people have complained that you are a sex shop.

202
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,600
OK.

203
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,860
Not you as the person.

204
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,340
People are saying things here.

205
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,440
C.

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
L.

207
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,740
Womphoppers.

208
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,140
Yeah.

209
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,020
Sex shoppers is what some people are saying.

210
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,480
Yeah, I saw the report last week of Walter Cronkite report.

211
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,780
Yeah, and he did such a good job.

212
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,560
He did.

213
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,980
I trust him implicitly.

214
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,920
When he said C.

215
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,020
L.

216
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,200
Wompoppers sex shoppers, the nation listened.

217
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,320
Yeah, he did.

218
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:35,540
And it's because you're selling these items like this autoerotic asphyxiation related mayonnaise that clumps in your throat.

219
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,860
And then you the only way you can breathe again is by drinking a glass of water.

220
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,600
And I also heard you had…

221
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,580
And I'm not trying to be gross, but I've heard you have wagon cock rings.

222
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Well, look, when Walter Cronkite brought out the cock rings on TV last night, yeah.

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,400
Which was brave.

224
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,520
Which was brave of him.

225
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,080
He's never done it before, despite numerous calls to address that.

226
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,260
America's been wanting it.

227
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,900
America's been wanting it.

228
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,160
He did it.

229
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,180
And what can I say but we do sell C.

230
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,300
L.

231
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,260
Wompopper cock rings.

232
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Yep.

233
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
Which just look, it's just a functional thing.

234
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,920
Yeah, of course, of course.

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,160
It's just a part of it.

236
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,260
It's not untoward.

237
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,600
No.

238
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,500
It's not nothing.

239
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,060
But yeah, it's in a glass case up with the gum and cigarettes.

240
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:33,980
Okay.

241
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,240
And you have C.

242
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,400
L.

243
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,900
Wompopper cigarettes.

244
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,520
Yeah, we sell our own cigarettes.

245
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,480
We roll them, yeah.

246
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,480
And who's rolling them?

247
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,120
The kids.

248
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,860
So they're hot, sweaty little cigarettes.

249
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,020
Yeah, of course.

250
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,640
The cigarettes are warm already.

251
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,940
They're basically just lit.

252
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,660
They come lit?

253
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,540
You buy a pack of cigarettes, they're all lit already, yeah.

254
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,800
There are 20 cigarettes that are just lit inside of a little package.

255
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,580
Yeah, 20 lit cigarettes.

256
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,900
You gotta smoke them fast.

257
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,720
That's the fun of it.

258
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,540
That's what you get when you come here.

259
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,160
Right, I understand that.

260
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,440
But people have complained that there's a lot of secondhand smoke in your restaurant.

261
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,660
There's tons of secondhand smoke here, yeah.

262
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:18,500
And I know there hasn't been a lot of litigation so far in 1981.

263
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,380
Right, yeah.

264
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,880
But I predict there might be more litigation against secondhand smoke.

265
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,940
Well, I'm all seeing and all knowing, and like, yeah, maybe lawsuits are coming, maybe laws are coming.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,800
But for now, enjoy the smoke.

267
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,520
Okay.

268
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,440
Enjoy the smoke.

269
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,500
You buy 20 cigarettes and you gotta smoke them within 10 minutes or else they're gone.

270
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,720
That's fun.

271
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,680
That's fun.

272
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,380
Woohoo!

273
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,140
That's fun.

274
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,740
Isn't it fun?

275
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,920
Does it make you want to woohoo?

276
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,600
Woohoo!

277
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah, right, yeah.

278
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,580
Hell yeah.

279
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,600
So, no, we sell cigarettes, we make cigarettes, we make the rings for the thing.

280
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,280
We make rings for your thing.

281
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,000
That's what we say.

282
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,360
It's fun.

283
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
They're called wagon rings, by the way.

284
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,800
And I wanted to address too that they're made out of spindly wood.

285
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah, they're wooden.

286
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,160
They're wooden, and some people are complaining about splinters.

287
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,920
Everyone is complaining about splinters, yeah.

288
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,220
We have 10 to 12 to 20 people every day that will come back in here and they're angry with us.

289
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,860
Yeah, oh God.

290
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
How do you deal with them?

291
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,960
What do you do?

292
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,280
I just, we kind of hide.

293
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,200
When someone comes in and they're angry, you hide in the back.

294
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,320
And then they go away eventually.

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,640
So, again, you are a bit of a coward.

296
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,540
A bit?

297
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm a huge coward.

298
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,280
I don't want to deal with these people.

299
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,200
What are you talking about?

300
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,520
They're mad at me because I put a bunch of wood in their peen.

301
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,780
Yeah, I wouldn't want to talk to them either.

302
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,340
It doesn't happen every time though.

303
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,380
Some of them are fine.

304
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,980
Some of them are fine.

305
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,340
Yeah, some of them, it's probably appreciated.

306
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,680
Some people like it.

307
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,720
Some people like it because they want to feel something.

308
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
You get used to normal stuff and then you need to feel something new.

309
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,500
I mean, that's the curse of living, right?

310
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,460
That's the curse of living.

311
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
Oh, thank God you understand me.

312
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,100
Oh God, oh God.

313
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,560
I need to take a big huff of something real quick.

314
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,720
I don't know what it, oh, it's a big, oh, there's secondhand smoke over here.

315
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,480
Oh yeah, thank you.

316
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,820
And that clears your brain by…

317
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Oh, it makes it worse.

318
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,020
It makes my brain feel worse.

319
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,860
Okay.

320
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,880
Tsk, tsk.

321
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,700
We all know the proper materials to make a cock ring are copper, brass, or gold.

322
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:39,560
Now, people have said that your great grandfather was legitimately mad.

323
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,080
Like he was a mad man.

324
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:57,280
Well, people have speculated, they have inquired, they have written about at length that my great grandfather was cuckoo.

325
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,180
They call him a cuckoo bird.

326
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,880
Yeah.

327
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,620
They would call him loony tunes.

328
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,040
A lot of things that are upsetting to me to hear.

329
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,080
But the fact of the matter is they were all right.

330
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,980
Okay, oh my God.

331
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,860
Amazing, amazing.

332
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,660
Thank you.

333
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,580
He performed sort of a self- lobotomy when he was 21 years old.

334
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,400
Yeah, and can you describe that?

335
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,960
Because I, he, you know, most lobotomies you go in through the nose and kind of disconnect a portion of the left and right hemisphere.

336
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,520
That's what I know about lobotomies.

337
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,880
Well, all I know that my great grandfather didn't do it the normal way to save costs.

338
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,980
He just put a chimp in a doctor's outfit and then started smearing peanut butter on the parts of his skull.

339
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,520
He wanted the chimp to cave in.

340
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,520
And after that point, basically, he just kind of picked and choose what he wanted to pull out.

341
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,200
The reason why he did it, by the time he was 21, he felt so bad about all the mean stuff he had done and all those people.

342
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,400
The wagons he had repossessed and the single wheels he would take off of people's wagons.

343
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Really sucking people over.

344
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,420
Yeah, he would make it like people were moving their whole family and he'd just take their wheel in the middle of nowhere.

345
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,720
And then they just either had to set up camp there forever or die.

346
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,940
Right, I hear that's how Bakersfield was started.

347
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,100
Yeah, oh yeah.

348
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,680
He repossessed so many different wheels in Bakersfield.

349
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
That's how the whole city started.

350
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,760
There were so many people stranded there, they were like, well, let's just do a city here, I guess.

351
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,120
We should just do it.

352
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,940
We should just do a city.

353
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,720
Yeah, that's how most cities are started, that people just want to do them.

354
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,380
Let's just do a city, they would say.

355
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,920
Yeah, so he felt bad about all that stuff, so instead of changing his ways, he decided to take out the part of his brain that felt empathy.

356
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,560
Wow.

357
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,440
And he accidentally took a bunch of other pieces too, but yeah.

358
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,100
Yeah, well, yeah.

359
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,500
Yeah, well, it seems like he also kind of ignited his sexual function in a stronger way.

360
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Oh yeah, it weaponized it, I would say.

361
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:08,440
And I'm just wondering, as the great-grandson of a man who removed empathy from his own brain, the ability to feel empathy,

362
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,600
How do you live at night with that piece intact in your own brain?

363
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,880
Well, to be fully honest with you, I have also performed a mild lobotomy.

364
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,180
A mild lobotomy, and what does that mean?

365
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:36,860
Yeah, well, it means that I found a baby chimp and put it in a doctor's outfit, and then put peanut butter on my skull,

366
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,520
and let the baby chimp cave it in, and then, you know, same deal, smaller chimp.

367
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,840
To be very honest, it didn't fully work, and I still feel a deep sadness at night.

368
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,280
But it's probably less sad than I would otherwise.

369
00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:01,820
Yeah, well, it seems like you're aware and you're sad, but you also continue to do practices that maybe aren't the best.

370
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,220
I continue to do, yeah.

371
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,180
I continue to do what I do, and that's just the way Wampobbers always acted, okay?

372
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,620
I can't fight my programming, you understand?

373
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,660
That's just another human being lesson, is that we can't fight who we are, what we do, what our family heritage is.

374
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,560
I have to serve food and I have to sell cock rings.

375
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,500
I have to do it.

376
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,160
That legacy is predetermined for you.

377
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,920
Just like the one that…

378
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,420
Honest Abe used.

379
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:37,460
Honest Abe did, and George did, and Ben, and Tom, all the guys, and the King of England.

380
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,280
He still does it.

381
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,120
Of course he does, because America is, you know, Little England.

382
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,760
America is Little England.

383
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,680
I know, I know it is.

384
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,840
In some ways, I guess it's kind of true.

385
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,800
People have complained that there aren't enough cherries in the Wagon Cherries Jubilee.

386
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
Well, yeah, they're right.

387
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,720
Basically, I just painted a bunch of almonds red and hoped nobody would notice.

388
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,940
I mean, let's not focus on that.

389
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,720
Let's talk about the presentation of that.

390
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,760
It comes in what's basically a big wash tub for a large St.

391
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,160
Bernard.

392
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,940
What do you mean, wash tub?

393
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,720
A big metal tub that could fit a St.

394
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,240
Bernard.

395
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,240
The Cherries Jubilee comes in that because it's a fun sort of thing to do.

396
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,880
It's a novelty.

397
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,740
It's sort of…

398
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,960
You know how you take a picture and then you show it to everybody and it'll go viral among your friends?

399
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:51,520
Yeah, I mean, one time I was at a bachelorette party and I got up on a table and some of my friends took a film photograph and then showed it to my other friends.

400
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,040
Right, and it's like when the photo goes viral, because it's 1981.

401
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,060
And what do you mean, viral?

402
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,940
Sorry, this word is confusing to me.

403
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,800
Well, we talk about disease so much, I'm always thinking viral.

404
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,900
And it's just like spread.

405
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,080
Spread is what I'm saying.

406
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,120
So it's like when you have a Polaroid photo or something and there's a photo but everyone wants to see it and everyone passes it around.

407
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,400
That's when I say a Polaroid is going viral.

408
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,760
That's a term I just kind of made up, I think.

409
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:23,620
So yeah, when we take a picture of a big wash tub full of Cherries Jubilee and you take a Polaroid of it, I want that to go viral because then that's promotion for us.

410
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,480
I love that.

411
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,680
I guess what's hard to understand is it's such a big wash tub, which is camp, which is kitschy, it's cute.

412
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,460
Yeah, it is, yeah.

413
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,840
But the amount of Cherries Jubilee is very small and it almost looks like a dookie that a St.

414
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,260
Bernard left behind.

415
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,040
Yeah, it does look like that.

416
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,740
It's small.

417
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,280
It's small in a big tub and we're already thinking, when I see a wash tub I'm like, that's a St.

418
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,180
Bernard wash tub.

419
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,200
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,220
When you see a wash tub you generally think of, oh, what size dog could fit in it?

421
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,980
That's all I think about.

422
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,440
Yeah, because you go to the store and you try to get a wash tub, you just have to, like a St.

423
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,020
Bernard, is it some sort of terrier?

424
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,280
Pomeranian.

425
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,840
Pomeranian, is it a bulldog?

426
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah.

427
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,340
Yeah, what kind of bulldog?

428
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,320
But yeah, yeah, it is a small amount of food.

429
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,940
It's a regular dessert in a big tub.

430
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,500
Yeah, and people get upset.

431
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:22,600
Yeah, people get upset not only that it might feel unclean to eat out of that vessel, but also they expected a tub of Cherries Jubilee.

432
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,700
Right, and it costs $100.

433
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,660
Yeah, and that is a lot of money right now.

434
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,900
Yeah, right now it is.

435
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,280
I mean, it maybe will forever feel like a lot of money, but it's even more money right now.

436
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,200
Right now, I agree with you, it is a lot of money.

437
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,420
So people are upset and I get it.

438
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,220
I get it, it's weird.

439
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,820
It's predatory, I get it.

440
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,340
Yeah, people will say they feel bilked out of money when they buy this dessert.

441
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,760
Yeah, they will say that, yeah.

442
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,920
They always say it.

443
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,160
Well, thank you for being so candid.

444
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,340
Yeah, I'm trying my best, yeah.

445
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,520
And I've noticed all of your menus are sopping wet.

446
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,340
Soaked with tears, yeah, from me, basically.

447
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,640
Are you crying over the menus?

448
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,100
Are you upset at the food?

449
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,100
I'm upset at just the atrocities that I've helped commit and different things here.

450
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,400
And when you say atrocities, that's bold language.

451
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
You're going on record.

452
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,740
I am on record as committing atrocities, yeah.

453
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,580
Like against the human race?

454
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,980
Yes, things that the human race will never recover from.

455
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,040
I am admitting to here right now.

456
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,800
I mean, this is blowing my mind.

457
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,300
There are political things that I've done.

458
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,640
You've been involved in like shadow campaigns and stuff?

459
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,580
I've been involved in many shadow campaigns, yeah.

460
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,240
Wow.

461
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:42,400
What's happened is if there's been a world leader assassinated in the last 30 years, look in the background of the photo.

462
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,120
Are we going to find a Womp Hopper?

463
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,480
There's a wagon back there.

464
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:53,640
If there's a world leader that's been killed in the last 30 years, look at the photo of their last moments.

465
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,820
You're going to be able to find a wagon.

466
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,900
If there's a will, there's a wagon.

467
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,840
If there's a will, there's a wagon.

468
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,700
I did it all.

469
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,580
I did all of it.

470
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,020
Everything.

471
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,360
And like this is huge.

472
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:07,960
Yeah.

473
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,500
Thank you for revealing this on Cassidy Blaine.

474
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,260
How do you sleep at night?

475
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,420
You've upset nations.

476
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,220
You've murdered politicians.

477
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:18,840
Yeah.

478
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,780
This is heavy, heavy stuff.

479
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,480
Yeah.

480
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,000
How do you sleep at night?

481
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,880
On a straw mat or?

482
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,700
Well, I do have a straw mat, but it's better for my back.

483
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,420
Okay.

484
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:39,280
But the way I sleep is that if one person comes up the hill into see a Womp Hoppers,

485
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,120
and they shake my hand, they say I had a delicious wagon burger.

486
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:45,860
Yeah.

487
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
And the cockering you sold me didn't give me no splinters in my dick.

488
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,200
Yeah.

489
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,540
And they say I had so much fun smoking 20 cigarettes very fast.

490
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,100
People leave looking leathered.

491
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,700
You're going to be leathered after you come out of this place.

492
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah.

493
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,620
Secondhand smoke can.

494
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,580
If you come out of this place.

495
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,280
Some people don't?

496
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,220
Some people don't, yeah.

497
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,440
We have a graveyard in one of the back rooms.

498
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,020
Yeah, I heard it's in one of the troughs.

499
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,580
Yeah, it is a trough, yeah.

500
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,940
But if they say I had a good time, I carry that with me,

501
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,180
and that gives me the energy I need to take me into the next day.

502
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,880
That's all.

503
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,200
Let me get you some menus to cry on.

504
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,500
Thank you.

505
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,060
Thank you so much.

506
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,140
Um, Mr.

507
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,500
I killed JFK.

508
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,940
There's a wagon on the grassy knoll.

509
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,380
There's a wagon on the grassy knoll?

510
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,380
Yeah.

511
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,540
Well, I'll have to go and look at those photos more clearly.

512
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,440
Okay.

513
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,660
Because of this audio, I was able to pull up many pre-assassination photos

514
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,780
of world leaders and identify a wagon in the background,

515
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,400
thus solving around 30 different mysteries in the process.

516
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,700
Apparently, Womp Hoppers was then seized by the CIA upon closure,

517
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,860
turned into a universal city branch of the organization,

518
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,780
and was then disguised as a Tony Roma's.

519
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,820
So if you ate at the Tony Roma's up at Universal Studios

520
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,860
between 1988 and 1994,

521
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,200
you're likely complicit in some weird CIA stuff.

522
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,780
Anyway, this will be the final installment of Womp Hoppers' Dusty Trail,

523
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,020
a restaurant retrospective.

524
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,660
Join me next week as I start a new journey trying to use black magic

525
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,080
to conjure Merlin and figure out just what evil spirits

526
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,420
shut down the CityWalk restaurant Wizards.

527
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,740
Thanks for listening.

528
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm Michael R.
