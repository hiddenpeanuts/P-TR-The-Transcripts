00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,240
Welcome to PodcastsAride, the Second Gate where today you've all been accepted to a

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,880
very special academy.

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,240
The Second Gate School for Gifted Youngsters, I'm Jason Sheridan, here with me the Sean

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,480
Cassidy to my Emma Frost, Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,520
Yes, I'm a headmaster I suppose you would call me?

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,800
A head, yeah, headmaster and I'm head administrator.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,840
Are those real titles from the film we watched or are you assuming?

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,960
No, they are real titles from the film, I just can't remember who was which.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,280
It's okay, there's probably a few things I can't remember from the film but I will get

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,960
to those eventually.

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,520
I do want to say of course today's episode is Scott Free, what would you call it?

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,400
Our new branding, that's what it is.

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,160
Our new branding, yes, the jubilee to our Frost and Cassidy is not here today.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,560
Right and he's, I don't want to speak for him but I will and say that he is thrilled

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,520
to not be wallowing in the slop of Marvel Universe films and continuity and characters,

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
I believe that.

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,640
So we are getting away with something today, Scott Free, by talking about the characters

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
of Generation X.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, we're talking the 1996 television pilot that became a TV movie, Generation X, starring

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,200
a guy from Cold Case, James Vanderbeek's ex-wife and a woman from some soap operas.

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,600
Should we say also though, today, the reason we're, not that we couldn't do this any other

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,240
day but the reason we're doing this is because this is your birthday shot.

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:17,040
Yes, it's my birthday shot, we're a little late on this Halloween haunt season, butts

24
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
up against my October 4th birthday.

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,000
But hey, better late than never, you know.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right, so we are finally honoring you and celebrating your birthday by watching this

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,120
made-for-TV movie and talking about it today.

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes, now this movie, I saw it when it aired in February 1996 and in a way that, you know,

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,960
I think I've described this before but like as a kid growing up, like TV special events

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:00,760
like one-off movies or magic specials kind of gave me that little bit of a rush that

31
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:08,680
theme parks did, like, oh my God, it's a special thing, it doesn't happen that often, this

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
is so exciting.

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,320
I have to schedule the week around, like I have to make sure we, like, homework is done,

34
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
dinner is eaten.

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,120
Right, so the novelty of a made-for-TV movie or a one-off special, we've talked about,

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,560
you know, breaking the magician's code, we've talked about, beyond belief, fact or fiction

37
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,480
was an actual series but this type of even Fox specific genre of alien autopsy specials

38
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,320
or an actual just made-for-TV movie like these Marvel movies that they made in the 90s including

39
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,280
Nick Fury played by David Hasselhoff, that's something Scott would be happy to be on, I

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,440
think, talking about that type of a Marvel property or today's topic of Generation X

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,160
which was sort of an X-Men offshoot property.

42
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,680
So you were saying that this is something you would get just as hyped for as going to

43
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,040
Islands of Adventure.

44
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,760
Yeah, a little bit, closer to methadone than the heroine that is Islands of Adventure but

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
like...

46
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,600
Well, yeah, fair enough, fair enough, the drug wasn't as strong with these movies.

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:20,680
Not as strong and this especially was very exciting because the Generation X comic came

48
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:31,440
out in 1994 and it sort of like, kind of, after like Jim Lee left the X-Men, we're going

49
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,480
to get very granular here, it sort of made a big impact, I think, not just because of

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:46,600
the hologram foil cover that was very common in the 90s but it was like, it looked different

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:55,680
from everything else, it was a bunch of new characters and what we've talked about before,

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:04,320
it's kids at a boarding school, it's teenager next generation of X-Men and they live at

53
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,440
the school and there is like a biodome that is their danger room and that's very exciting

54
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:21,760
and my dear friend Jubilee was kind of leading the charge so it was just, it hit at just

55
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,440
the right time that comic and then this movie hit even more so.

56
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,200
So it's 1994, this comic book Generation X comes out and as you were saying, it's a mix

57
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,120
of old characters and new characters, Banshee and the White Queen are sort of the leaders

58
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,040
of it, they have been in other X-Men comics before, Jubilee, of course, has been on the

59
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,280
X-Men but now she's in a whole new crop of teenage heroes and they're trying to do like

60
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,600
teen X-Men now, it's not your father's X-Men, these are the new kids, it's sort of probably

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,840
in the same vein as Beverly Hills 90210, there's a 90s wave of teen stuff and I almost feel

62
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,760
like this is kind of in the wake of all of it happening and if, I mean, how old are you

63
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,080
at 94? How old am I, 10? You're what, 9?

64
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:22,880
Nine, yeah, so then like 11 in 96? I went back and read the first Generation X issue

65
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,800
in the Marvel Unlimited app the other day and it is, there's a few things going on to

66
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,140
compare and contrast it with this movie. One, the first issue of the comic is setting up

67
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:47,140
a lot of threads to pay off in this series and two, it kind of, like I said, it doesn't,

68
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:55,660
the artist is Chris Bockelo who would go on to draw X-Men and Spider-Man, draw a lot

69
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:02,980
of stuff but the inker is this guy Mark Buckingham and Mark Buckingham and Chris Bockelo were

70
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:12,100
just doing a ton of work on Vertigo in the 90s, especially early mid 90s and so this

71
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:20,060
book really didn't look like a lot of the other X-Men comics of the time, the sort

72
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,660
of like hulking, you know, lots of muscles, lots of pouches. It looked a little weirder

73
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,020
and that was very exciting to me.

74
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,260
Okay, now let me give you a counter, not that you're wrong, you are right about all the

75
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,980
things you just said. For me, it looked a little too weird and it was something a little

76
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,260
bit too much. I don't think, I was so totally on board with the teens, I think the teens

77
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,420
kind of scared me and I was like, well where are my favorites? Where's Gambit? Where's

78
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,620
Iceman? Where's Rogue? Where's Beast? They're not here? I don't know, maybe this comic is

79
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,220
not for me. So I stayed away from the comic book of Generation X. I didn't dislike it

80
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,580
but I think that the weirder art and the teens specifically were a little off-putting because

81
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,460
again, you're nine, I'm ten. It's not like we were teens yet. We were not teens.

82
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,940
No, but I think at that point I had already had the logic problem of like, all the X-Men

83
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,940
seem like they're in their 20s or 30s. Why are they living at a school? So this kind

84
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,220
of solved that of like, oh these are teenagers at a school.

85
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,460
It makes sense and the things would go on different comic book runs when I got a little

86
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,820
older and more comfortable with teens. That would happen where I would say, okay great,

87
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,320
Grant Morrison introduced a bunch of young X-Men in his new X-Men run. Great, I'm comfortable

88
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,900
with these teens. I'm comfortable with, maybe even some of them are not even teens. Like

89
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,660
Quentin Quire, even though he's a bad guy, comfortable with him. Beak, the X-Man Beak,

90
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,620
who just kind of has a beak and he has like wings and stuff, very comfortable with him.

91
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,980
You go on another Chris Boccolo, Jason Aaron run, Wolverine and the X-Men, which is almost

92
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,060
like a Magic School Bus meets X-Men run, which I love. That's got a bunch of teens. I'm good

93
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,540
with this concept. I think you're right on. I just think I wasn't ready for these new

94
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,540
teens.

95
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:18,220
Well, I will say I liked it. I think I was a little nervous about the teens and the weird

96
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:24,820
art style. They scared me, the teens. They scared me and the villain empath, who was

97
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,840
kind of horrific, scared me as well. Yes, scared me too. He was a scary guy. That was

98
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,100
probably why after that first issue, I didn't really read Generation X monthly. I just picked

99
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,540
it up here and there, but I was very happy it was going on. I was also intrigued by like,

100
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,060
oh, Banshee and White Queen, a good guy and a bad guy are the headmasters. Now, it wasn't

101
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,420
until later I learned about Emma Frost's first class of children, the Hellions, which are

102
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,860
oddly enough mentioned in this movie of all the things to keep from the comic.

103
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,220
There are references in this movie. I like the idea of Generation X. It kind of was a

104
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,820
short-lived thing. They haven't brought it back for a long time as far as the title of

105
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,180
the book. Characters have appeared in other things, but that feels so 90s to me. Then

106
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,700
the fact that they very quickly turned around a movie of it was shocking to me at the time

107
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,020
because we were in the desert back then. We weren't living the life now where we get a

108
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:40,900
Marvel thing every few weeks. Oh yeah, and we're like, ugh, do I have to do this? It's

109
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,460
almost a hassle to try and keep up with it. Of course, some of it's homework. Some of it's

110
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,500
homework. If somebody's asking you, what is all this Deadpool Wolverine continuity? I don't

111
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,580
understand it. You're like, well, there's six things you've got to watch to fully understand

112
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,220
what the TVA is and to understand all the different references. But yes, back then I was

113
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,700
like, oh my God. So I was excited about Generation X on Fox. I love the Fox network. Big fan of Fox

114
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,500
network. It was a little naughty. It was a little naughty. I didn't care for that as much, but we

115
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,980
talked about the specials. We talked about the sort of tone of Fox, mostly because of the Simpsons,

116
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,620
but other stuff too. So I was excited that Fox was dipping their toe in the X-Men universe

117
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,420
and was excited. I think I watched this live. I think I was that excited about it.

118
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,620
Yeah. Now I watched on YouTube. There's a few rips of it on YouTube and I unfortunately,

119
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:42,020
not until an hour ago, did I find the rip of the live broadcast with the commercials

120
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:50,580
and live correspondence from Mardi Gras. Fox's Mardi Gras was happening at the same time this

121
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,180
aired, including, I don't know, did you see the first chunk of it? I kind of jumped around,

122
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,740
but I think I know what you're going to reference. So there's different hosts and there's a guy I

123
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,820
recognize. I'm not sure who he is. He was on TV at one point. And then Jimmy Kimmel is there all of

124
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:12,180
a sudden. Yeah. And then it cuts even more excitingly from Jimmy Kimmel to the House of Blues,

125
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:18,820
to Jim Belushi in full Blues Brothers outfit. And he is also one of the hosts of Fox's Mardi Gras.

126
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,020
And I just, I fell out of my chair. I was so excited. House of Blues and Jim Belushi

127
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,580
introducing Generation X. I don't remember that happening at the time. That being said,

128
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,220
I don't think as a 10 year old, or excuse me, a 12 year old, I was that excited about Jim Belushi.

129
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:41,300
No, I don't think so. One thing is certain. This celebration and this made for TV movie

130
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:48,900
are brought to you by 1-800-COLLECT. Well, that's 1-800-COLLECT logo is everywhere. Let me,

131
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,580
Mike, I'm going to share the screen just to show you a picture and I'll post this online.

132
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:02,260
This was another thing about this movie that really lived in my mind. And that's this print ad

133
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:11,780
with all of the teens and Banshee and the White Queen, like they are all giving some attitude.

134
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:19,460
Yeah. And I just thought this was the coolest thing. This was obviously in a lot of comics

135
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:26,900
and magazines at the time. It doesn't even look like an ad for a movie or a show. It looks like

136
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,620
it's a nineties print ad for like a clothing store. It looks like.

137
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,420
Yeah. But they are all dressed wildly differently. So I guess it would be

138
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:46,100
a department store where you can buy all items. This isn't a regular Sears. This would be like,

139
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,020
say Sears started like Sears started trying to do like a store called Sears Extreme or something in

140
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,100
1996. It's like, this is Sears, but it's a little different than a normal Sears. Like the clothing,

141
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,140
a little bit sexier, a little more of the belly will show when you wear a shirt.

142
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,900
Nowadays, if they did like, oh, we're doing an alternate version,

143
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,620
but kind of nodding to our past, the store would probably be called Robox.

144
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,380
Oh, I see. Oh, we're brainstorming like different Sears. Yes. Because like McDonald's has that.

145
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,740
First of all, have we even talked that much about the McDonald's like test stores the,

146
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,820
and what are they called? They're called like, you know what I'm talking about?

147
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,780
The, the like caught the place competing with Panera and Starbucks. Oh, it's Cosmix.

148
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,980
Cosmix. Yeah. So there's like these just specific, like you can get like a little flatbread

149
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,260
sandwich or something, but it's a lot of different drinks. It's almost like Sonic,

150
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,420
where you can have all these different options as far as if you want like boba in there,

151
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,060
if you want different flavors added to your sodas. So like they're testing that out.

152
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,060
So you're saying a Sears kind of like alternative cooler brand would be called Robox because that's

153
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:04,980
an old school thing. Yeah. Cause it was originally called Sears and Robox. Sears and Robox. I think

154
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,580
it was singular. Don't quote me. Don't these Robox heads come after me? Not Daniel Robox heads,

155
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,220
original Sears and Robox heads. We're getting into Barnes and Nobles territory.

156
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,020
No, it's not that. There's no S on the end of that.

157
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:28,420
No, that's Barnes and Noble for sure. Yeah. Anyway, Cosmix. We haven't really talked about it

158
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,620
on this show a lot. Again, Scott Free. We're getting away Scott Free talking about the fact

159
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,460
that McDonald's is testing out this store where you just drive through and you can get like

160
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,020
different little like juices in your drinks or little flavor shots in your drinks and they have

161
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,140
different kinds of drinks, different kinds of sugar drinks. And I want Cosmix here so bad.

162
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,220
Why won't they do that? I know they always test it out in the Midwest and maybe I think, maybe I

163
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,340
should have never moved away. Maybe I should not have come to California because I've talked about

164
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,500
this before. Woodfield Mall, they would test out McDonald's pizza. They would test out McDonald's

165
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,140
hot dogs. And that was cool. That was cool as shit to walk into McDonald's and Woodfield, Woodfield

166
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,700
Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois. And all of a sudden they have a new type of food they sell there.

167
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,060
Yeah. It seems very exciting. Like when I ordered pasta, I ordered a big bowl of pasta at the

168
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,900
McDonald's in Orlando. And a cheesesteak. And a fucking cheesesteak. And I was elated. It was

169
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,260
2 a.m. It was after our live show and I took it back to the hotel room and I ate every piece of

170
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,580
both things and passed out for two hours and then got up and went to Tron.

171
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,300
Yeah. My Lyft driver on the way to the show was like, hey, the biggest McDonald's in the

172
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,780
world is over there. And I went, oh. So we drove by so fast. I didn't really see anything. But

173
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,900
yeah, I don't know that we talked about Cosmix a lot on the show. Talked about it a lot in our

174
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:58,660
text messages. In our private life, yes. In our private life, we've considered it a lot.

175
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:06,580
So Sears, yeah. Sears should have tried Sears Xtreme in the 90s. A sexier version of Sears.

176
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:13,460
They could have had Bob Vila, but Bob Vila would wear little shorts instead of his normal jeans.

177
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:19,460
That's good. Yeah. Some fluorescent clothes. Some black light stuff.

178
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:27,540
Hunky Bob Vila. A younger, hunkier Bob Vila. I don't know if he has a son. If Bob Vila has a hot

179
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,740
son, I'm not sure. But you could have gotten somebody like that. You could even get an actor

180
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:40,740
to play hot young Bob Vila. And he's wearing a weird vest like the Generation X cast.

181
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,500
There are a good amount. There are a number of vests.

182
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:51,540
Oh yeah. It was a very vest-centric decade. So yeah. So this ad you're showing,

183
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,300
it doesn't officially look like something you actually can watch on TV.

184
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Yeah. Everyone is dressed differently. Almost to a point, it was different. Jubilee's kind of a

185
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:10,820
skater. Monet is kind of the cool girl. She's got a green leather jacket with a bra underneath.

186
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:21,380
Skin is kind of the nerd. Refrax is kind of a, I don't know, kind of a bleach blonde jock.

187
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:29,060
Yeah. Skin. So yeah, these characters, Skin, Refrax, Mondo, Jubilee.

188
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,220
Yeah. And Buff.

189
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,860
And Buff. Buff is what young Bob Vila would have been.

190
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:43,380
All right. We could only hope. Buff, this is a very important distinction. Because I,

191
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,860
as I started to read about this, I was like, I think there were characters in this that were

192
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,620
only for the movie. And I bet it's because of the budget. And sure enough,

193
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:03,940
that's what the fandom entry also said. Because Refrax and Buff have very manageable powers for

194
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:12,900
a $4 million made for TV budget. Yes. Because so much of the discourse around movies with

195
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,580
comic book stuff in them at the time was like too expensive. We cannot do an X-Men movie.

196
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,900
There are seven or eight characters and each one of their powers is so expensive,

197
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,780
there would be no way to get this in the budget. Superman, okay, he can fly. He's one guy. Fine.

198
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,220
Batman doesn't even have powers. And then it was like, you're not getting good superhero movies

199
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:43,620
because the budget doesn't allow it. Yes. And Refrax and Buff especially were stand-ins for the

200
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:50,980
comic book characters Chamber and Husk. Yes. Chamber is a proper British teenager

201
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:57,300
who's like from his nose to his chest is just a giant ball of energy.

202
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Chamber scared me. And this is what we're getting at today about Generation X is that I saw Chamber

203
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,500
and I was afraid of him. I was afraid of both of these characters, to be honest with you,

204
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,900
but I was afraid of Chamber. Yeah, both kind of, this phrase gets thrown around a lot,

205
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,860
but like body horror, like Chamber has a big ball of energy. He's almost like a human torch.

206
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,620
He's almost on fire the whole time, but it's only a little part of him. And to me, that makes it

207
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,820
seem scarier than if you were just head to toe flames. Head to toe flames doesn't scare me like

208
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,580
Johnny Storm and the Fantastic Four, but for some reason a little chunk cut out of energy or flames

209
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:43,780
does scare me. Because he usually has like a turtle neck, kind of like leather collar pulled

210
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:51,460
up to his nose and he communicates telepathically. And then Husk, who is the younger sister of

211
00:20:51,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Cannonball, Husk's power is she pulls off her skin to reveal either new skin or like

212
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,460
power, like solid metal or fire under, like she just keeps pulling off her skin as needed.

213
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:15,380
She can rip her face off like the movie Face Off and then there'll be a different type of skin

214
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,500
underneath. And it is unclear to me how, so she can decide what the next layer of skin is going

215
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,020
to be when she rips off her exterior layer? I think different writers have gone different

216
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:32,580
directions because in the first issue of Generation X, she is very, she's portrayed as very type A.

217
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:40,020
So she's going for like a 6 a.m. run through the woods and then Jubilees like why are you up so

218
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:47,460
early? Specifically like you woke me up playing your Bridget Fonda work or your Jane Fonda workout,

219
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,580
not Bridget Fonda. That would be very funny. I don't think Bridget Fonda.

220
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,140
She didn't go into the family business of having a workout tape?

221
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:04,100
Peter Fonda's workout tape, it's just a lot of like the Family Guy style, like hut, hut, hut, like.

222
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:11,300
Oh, how about Henry Fonda's workout tape? Now we're talking, or were you thinking,

223
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,340
you were thinking Henry and you said Peter, Peter's Jane's brother.

224
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,500
Henry is Jane's father who's in on Golden Pond. I'm just terrible with names nowadays,

225
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,180
which I was always bad with names, but it's frustrating mixing up.

226
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,260
Well, I just, there was a guy I've gone to wrestling shows with that I looked straight

227
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,740
in the eye and didn't recognize him a couple of days ago. So I'm not like, I'm doing very good.

228
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,540
Yeah. I apologize to Kyle is what I'm saying.

229
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,540
Those wrestling shows are very high. You get, you know, you kind of.

230
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,460
You get so excited you forget the face of a person that's sitting next to you. Yeah.

231
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,500
Yeah. This is all to say that in the first issue of Generation X,

232
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,860
husk goes for an early morning jog and then she tries a trick with her powers where she pulls

233
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,540
off her skin and goes, Oh, well, that worked. It was like taking a hot shower. It pulled off the

234
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:09,220
sweat and grime. And I'm like, that's pretty clever. I, that's an interesting use of that power.

235
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,180
It seems like a lot of effort though. Instead of just taking a quick shot. I mean, I guess,

236
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,420
I guess the skin could be potentially damaged. Like we do shed our skin as humans, but it takes

237
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,700
a lot longer. So I would think it would make more sense if you were like, it would almost be like

238
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:31,860
getting an immediate facial, like the skin below this, the other skin would be so like new and

239
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,540
taut and fresh that you would look regenerated. I mean, I'm sure there's been something in one

240
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,540
of the comics where she did that. All right. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's where I would think,

241
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,220
because I guess getting like getting your skin sweaty, I don't think hurts it.

242
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,900
I guess if it's dirty, but I don't know. I'm saying she's experimenting. I understand. She's

243
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:58,180
experimenting. Yeah. The book and the comic do, they do both go in on the like, you're here to

244
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:05,940
learn how to harness and experiment with your powers. So that is copacetic with both. I would

245
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,020
like a mutant power that would like sort of secondarily help me appear more youthful as I

246
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:18,020
age. That would, that would rule. I would be, and I would try to use like, if I had Iceman's power,

247
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,380
I would try to kind of like freeze my face, like Botox style before I went out or something, or

248
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,620
not before. I wouldn't freeze it like it's so I couldn't move, but you'd kind of do a little

249
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,580
something to sort of keep it like taut before going out. Like I would try to, whatever power

250
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:38,340
I was granted by the universe, I would try to figure out some sort of anti-aging element to it.

251
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:45,060
Oh yeah. That's fun. It is fun. I don't know if they would all apply. Obviously Wolverine has

252
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,780
healing power, so he just kind of stays younger, youthful looking longer because he's been alive

253
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,500
so long. And Wolverine in the, that early 2010s, Wolverine and the X-Men comic, he is the head

254
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:03,620
master of a new class, a new Xavier's school. Yes, it's a great, it's a great like comedy

255
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,420
setup of like Wolverine's in charge of this school and wacky stuff's happening and the school is on

256
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:15,460
top of a living island and they get into all sorts of mischief and it's fun. How, what do you think

257
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:21,780
minute wise Scott would have said, can we talk about the movie itself yet? Probably about 10

258
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,420
minutes ago. Yeah, I think so. I'm not saying, by the way, I'm not saying we have to get to the

259
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,340
movie. We don't have to get to the movie at all. Hey, we don't have to get to the movie at all.

260
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,860
I'm enjoying a kombucha, health aid kombucha, pink lady apple flavor right here in a can.

261
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:43,860
So I'm fine. This is your birthday. I'm along for the ride. That's true. I did make a lot of notes

262
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:52,180
on that. I was surprised that like this was actually pretty well documented. So I will,

263
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:59,300
it's not a hundred years old or anything. No, no, I just wasn't sure how forgotten it was, but.

264
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,340
Can we start with a question about the movie? We can go into the movie. We can talk about the

265
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,660
movie real quick. We can talk about the movie real long. Do you like this movie? Can I ask that

266
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:17,460
first? Did you like watching this now in the year 2024? I just want that's my question before we

267
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:24,340
even start. I have to say, and I have the trailer queued up, so we'll we'll do that next. Sure,

268
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:32,980
sure. Yeah, because it's a pretty pretty solid captures everything about it in 25, 30 seconds.

269
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,460
I did like it as an adult. I definitely clocked some weird stuff with this movie.

270
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,580
Well, sure. Yeah, really what I'm driving at, because if you were going to give it a

271
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,140
general positive review before this, do you still think that Country Bears movie is that bad?

272
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:58,020
I am not ready. You're already more positive about this Generation X movie than that Country Bears

273
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:05,620
movie. Well, now this Generation X movie, I positive childhood memories of the Country Bears

274
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:11,540
movie. I really only remember trailers of when I was in high school and I was like,

275
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:17,700
oh, I don't want to see that. That doesn't seem like the Bears at all. Yeah, because in case you

276
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:26,020
didn't guess, I kind of found this movie boring. It's a little boring, boring and cheap, boring and

277
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:35,060
90s cheap and not not there's not even as many treats as I would want, whether it be like weird

278
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:41,060
stuff or a strange performance. I mean, we talk about Matt Fruer, who is great, who I like a lot.

279
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:49,140
Remember, I have other Fruer thoughts that I want to share, but I was watching this and I at the

280
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,660
time, I didn't love it. I didn't run out the next day and say everybody, oh my gosh, Generation X

281
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,060
was awesome. Maybe I did. Maybe I'm misremembering. I had a weird feeling about it because I was like,

282
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:04,740
isn't that quite what I want? I was still hopeful that it would become a TV series because I,

283
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,380
look, I was so savvy back then. I knew the biz. I knew that like, you know,

284
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,780
if we get one comic book show on the year, then we get a second one. I knew how that stuff worked.

285
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,060
I was reading Entertainment Weekly, you know, you were too. You knew the biz. So I was not against

286
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,820
it or anything, but I was watching this and going, gosh, the budget. It looks like they gave them no

287
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,140
money to do this. Like for instance, I just watched the pilot of TJ Hooker a few weeks ago.

288
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:36,420
Okay. And I was like, man, is that watchable? That's not a good show. Okay. There's a few

289
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:42,820
interesting things in it actually, but man, just Shatner's performance, giving monologues to like

290
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,100
no one in a bar, like just looking off into the distance, monologuing into no one. We're watching

291
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:53,780
this and we're like, man, maybe TJ Hooker is good. So then compared to this where I'm just like,

292
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:01,460
okay, this is 90 minutes. So all that to say, I think you owe Country Bears another watch.

293
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,660
Now, I don't think you should watch it with the idea that I really want to like this. I need you

294
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,980
to watch it. And if you come back and you say, I still hate Country Bears, Generation X is a better

295
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,340
movie. That's fine. We talk about it then. Don't do anything to please me. You don't have to please

296
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,780
me. I'm just always interested in when we talk about enjoyment of movies. I always like to rank

297
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,900
it against Country Bears because that was such a contentious episode of Podcast The Ride.

298
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:35,140
Well, I'll say this. This and Country Bears both share something in common that drove me nuts as a

299
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:45,060
kid, which was deviating too much from the source material. Yes, sure. Because there's stuff in the

300
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:52,980
source material that I wanted to see. Like in this, I thought the portrayal of Jubilee was pretty

301
00:29:52,980 --> 00:30:01,140
solid. She's like a teenager. She's a lit, very mouthy. I don't think you get enough of her

302
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:07,300
powers. She only really uses her powers like probably less than five times. Those are expensive

303
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:14,180
powers. But they're, they're kind of not. They're, they're kind of just sparks. It depends how you

304
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:20,660
do them, I guess. It depends on how you do them. The last shot when she's fighting Matt Fruer,

305
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,460
that seems like the expensive Jubilee power use. Yeah. And Jubilee, if you didn't know, sort of has

306
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,780
like, she shoots fireworks out of her hands, basically. She kind of has, I don't know,

307
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,220
I guess they're like, they do hurt if she wants them to. I think she can control how strong they

308
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,180
are. She could just make fireworks appear as if it was a fun party, but I think she also could

309
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:50,980
hit you with fireworks and that would hurt. Yeah. They're kind of, as a kid, I loved energy blast

310
00:30:50,980 --> 00:31:00,340
powers like Cyclops or Havoc or Jubilee or Bishop. If you could shoot powers out of a part of your

311
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:10,100
body. Yeah, I love that. Hand, eyes, head, chest. But they're, again, granular. Like each one is

312
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:18,820
kind of different. Like Cyclops optic glass are concussive. Right. Which means that it's like

313
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:26,820
getting hit by a bus. It's not like Superman's x-ray vision, which can melt stuff. And this is

314
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:34,020
so granular. This is so like, and it is very funny to see writers using powers in different

315
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:40,900
ways. It's kind of one of the fun things. Like in the current like X-Men, they're setting up like

316
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:49,300
Jubilee kind of, if her power's kind of evolving, like her kind of mastering them down to like a

317
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:56,900
very certain level, like in the Gale Simone run, which very weird time for X-Men comics.

318
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:03,780
They've recently relaunched after five years where all the mutants live on a magical island.

319
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,980
And now they're just back to like, they're hunted and feared, even though they saved the whole world.

320
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,540
It's a little bit, it's a soft reboot. It's a reset. It's a soft reboot. It happens all the

321
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:25,460
time though. Which seems like it was rumored. It was a Kevin Feige request because there's going

322
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:35,460
to be an X-Men movie in the next 10 years, maybe. Um, I think five within five, five. Okay. I think,

323
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:42,580
I'm guessing. Let me play the trailer for this generation X movie. I will rewatch country bears

324
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,980
and give it another chance. I've been meaning to do that for the longest time.

325
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,780
Tonight, Fox presents a world premiere motion picture from the creators of the hit comic book

326
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:01,700
series. The X-Men comes generation X. They've got the power. They've got the technology.

327
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,420
There's a new generation of superheroes and they're coming

328
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:17,860
to save the world. Get ready for generation X on the Fox Tuesday night movie.

329
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,900
Wow. Wow. That was very exciting. It was very exciting. I mean, there's, there are powers

330
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,860
showcased in that trailer, stretching powers, some energy powers. So like just the idea,

331
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,860
just the idea that like the legitimate entertainment business would acknowledge comics

332
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,820
because I mean, at the time it was just like, oh, I, me and one other kid I know in college,

333
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,820
in high school or in elementary school, read these comics. So we felt very much like a very small

334
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,820
club. Obviously you go to comic conventions, you'd see a lot of other people, but it was like,

335
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:01,140
almost like you were being like, yes, what you like is cool enough to be on the big stage. Now,

336
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,500
do I kind of wish some of the stuff I liked was back on the small stage? Sometimes I do, not

337
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:13,460
always, not always, but sometimes you're like, ah, I missed the good old days when everything was

338
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:19,780
sort of not all of, when all of entertainment wasn't a stuff I liked when I was eight,

339
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,580
which is shocking, which is shocking because I would have never guessed that. But when you're

340
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,860
like, oh yeah, maybe a couple non things I liked when I was eight would be good. Yeah. Now it's

341
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:36,900
everything. I mean, it, you know, you lose the hunt. The hunt used to be part of the fun,

342
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:42,980
you know? Sure. Yeah. Hunting stuff down, going to obviously I still go to comic shops plenty.

343
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:54,260
But yeah, I remember being in second grade, getting really into the X-Men cartoon.

344
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:02,660
And then later that's like when the baseball season started talking to one of my friends

345
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,740
at like a little league game and he's like, oh yeah, there's all these X-Men comics and

346
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:15,860
trading cards. You should go to a comic book store and check it out. And somehow my parent,

347
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:21,460
I like, I either talked to my parents or they, their parents talked to mine and like right

348
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:28,340
after the game, we went to a comic book store and I bought like X-Men 21 or 22,

349
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:35,300
which is like a very confusing, it's like the middle of a story arc about how

350
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:45,940
Psylocke traded bodies with Revanche, who's a ninja. And it wasn't until much later. I was like,

351
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,900
wait, why? So that British lady became an Asian lady? That's odd.

352
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,620
Yes, that is a storyline in X-Men.

353
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:02,420
And eventually they retconned, they switched that and dealt with the fallout from that in the last

354
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:11,860
few years. But at the time I was very thrilled and I went all in on X-Men and Marvel trading cards,

355
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:18,420
went all in on the comics for like eight years or so. I had an X-Men subscription

356
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:24,100
where it would be sent to me. And I always had one or two friends who were in this.

357
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:32,660
And as we all got older, they started dropping off and I was like, nope, still good on comics,

358
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,020
still doing this. And then- This is a story of my life.

359
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,100
Yeah, it made new friends, it got me into other comics and expanded.

360
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,940
All these guys watching wrestling in their high school years and going to pay-per-views,

361
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,060
and then all of a sudden things fall off and they're no longer watching week to week.

362
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,700
And I'm still there, baby. I'm still watching. I'm the last man standing when it comes to

363
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,900
liking stuff. And this has happened throughout my entire life. And it's what you're describing now.

364
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,580
And I'm not annoyed by it because I enjoy it, but I just feel like no one has the stamina.

365
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:15,380
No one has the stamina, brother, when it comes to liking stuff longer than me. That's what I'm

366
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:21,780
saying. That's fair. That's fair. You've fallen off with comics though, a little bit. Okay, wait,

367
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,660
hold on. Wait, hold on. I have- Now turning it around on you where I'm the stamina boy.

368
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,260
I have a Ninja Turtle comic here. This is the first. All right. This is a special.

369
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,140
I have a bunch of things. I have X-Men 700 sitting here that is a recent comic. I'm not

370
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,540
fully caught up, but I'm just saying that- You're not fully caught up in all fairness. And I am

371
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:49,620
only up to January 2023 on the Krakoa era of X-Men comics.

372
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:57,860
All right, there you go. And I look, I'm a father, okay? I am a father who has responsibilities.

373
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:06,180
We both have other things, yes. As you said, next to three bookshelves of action figures,

374
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,660
your other responsibilities. I'm up on those. I'm up on those. You are up on those. I'm all caught

375
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:16,420
up. I got all the NECA Turtles. I got the Wrestling Turtles up here. I'm all caught up. So yeah,

376
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,940
so what you're describing is correct because I would also, my whole life I've had the energy of,

377
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:28,340
hey, come on guys, isn't this exciting? And it just, that's been my life with a lot of things

378
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,500
with stuff that I've liked. And I'm always trying to rally everyone to sort of get on board.

379
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:42,420
Sure. Yeah, I had fallen off of the AEW a few months ago and then I got back on board and it's

380
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,140
like, wait, every time I watch this, it's good. But when I read about it on the internet, people

381
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,380
are insane. Well, that's a whole, that's a whole nother story. That's a whole like,

382
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,180
I, I, everything. That's a whole nother Scott Free episode. Social media is just

383
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:07,460
more and more removed from objective reality. I could do specific episodes on everything that

384
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:16,340
I'm a fan of. I know, I wallow in the dark side secretly on social media. Sure. Yeah. So I know

385
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:22,660
I know the bad insane discourse for Marvel stuff. I know it for Star Wars stuff. I know it for

386
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:29,140
wrestling. And it is a fascinating thing. Some people are truly just bad faith instigators.

387
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,140
They're trying to irritate everyone and get clicks. Some people I think are just sort of,

388
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,660
they don't have a context for things. Maybe they're young people and they haven't been

389
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:44,020
watching a reading or knowing. They don't know a lot about this. They just know one thing. They

390
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:50,100
know how WWE does things. They know that they like X-Men one way. They don't have a, a vast

391
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,980
knowledge of it. So maybe they're not so informed. I'm giving those people the benefit of that out.

392
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:03,060
Then you have just like, uh, uh, hateful people, vile, angry people with bad opinions. Uh, and it's

393
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,660
interesting. And I, I wish I didn't pick up the rock to look at all the ants, but that is another

394
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:15,460
thing that I unfortunately do. You mentioned Matt Frewer. Yes. Uh, let's, let's get into this.

395
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,820
Cause I have a Matt Frewer moment queued up. Please play it first. Play it first. I'll play

396
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:27,060
it first and we'll talk. Matt Frewer was Max and hopefully one day again is Max Headroom,

397
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,420
which is a character. Did you say something? No, I did not real. I didn't know that.

398
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,340
Oh, well then we, whoa. When I, we were talking before we started recording that we,

399
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,940
but then I had some Frewer stuff now. Okay. Now you know what I'm talking about.

400
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,260
I had Max Headroom queued. I don't really know a lot. I've just seen little clips about that.

401
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,540
This is so PTR coded as people say now online when they see things. And,

402
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,620
and I don't know a ton about Max Headroom either. I know if in case the listener, uh, wasn't, uh,

403
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:04,020
isn't a hundred years old, like we are, uh, Max Headroom was in the eighties primarily and was,

404
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:10,580
uh, a character that was like inside the computer almost and looked like those like Duracell family

405
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,940
like characters in a way. So they would basically like in a space ghost coast to coast moment,

406
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:22,740
like on Letterman, Matt Frewer as Max Headroom would be in the TV. The resolution on the TV

407
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:30,020
looks kind of poor. It looks glitchy and he would have this full like prosthetic outfit on that

408
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,140
made him look like he was a digital character, like from, I don't know, the eighties was a reboot

409
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:42,180
style. That's, I guess that's nineties, but like a polygon character. Have you seen Videodrome?

410
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:51,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That, that kind of like, uh, haunted TV stage, like interrupting, like we,

411
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:59,300
like weird, like the characters from the Money for Nothing Dire Straits video. Sure. So, uh,

412
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,380
look it up. You'll understand. It's my birthday shot. So I'm going to call a birth, another shot,

413
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,580
Max Headroom episode coming soon. Yeah, of course. Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. 100%.

414
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:16,260
Let me share an early. Yeah, go for it. Go for it. Frewer's seat and then we can talk more.

415
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,500
He also reminds me of like Mac Tonight almost. Like there's just this like eighties,

416
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:26,180
nineties sort of aesthetic of characters. Yeah. Very Mac Tonight coded. Okay.

417
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,060
What are they? Brain waves, Bobby Bird, nothing you'd understand.

418
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:37,220
Try me. Sorry. It's the next phase in free market mind control. It has to do with the

419
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:45,380
machine I've been working on. That dream device? No, Bobby Boy, not that dream device. Like I'm some

420
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,780
maladjusted computer nerd who makes some machines so stressed out yuppies can catch some decent

421
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:56,260
alpha waves. I'm sorry, Russell. Please go on. It's okay, Bob. I completely understand.

422
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:05,620
I'll start from the beginning. Okay. Okay. So I assume what you're going to say.

423
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:13,540
I was going to say it's very quirky. It's very quirky and it's very Jim Carrey Riddler.

424
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,580
As soon as I saw this and I haven't watched this in a while, I went,

425
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:23,940
geez, this is crazy. Did Matt Fruer steal his whole delivery and this character

426
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:31,700
off of Jim Carrey? Cause like it's a year after Batman Forever. Also, I will say plot wise,

427
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,660
character wise, this is like an evil scientist with a dream machine that steals things from

428
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,780
people's minds, which is what Edward Nigma does in Batman Forever. Jim Carrey is the Riddler.

429
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:48,420
But then I started going down a rabbit hole online and there are many people that do believe

430
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:59,620
that Jim Carrey took a lot of his personas from Max Headroom. I'm not saying this definitively,

431
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,180
but you look at Max Headroom, he's on Letterman in the 80s and he has very similar delivery to

432
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:12,740
this. A lot of specific kind of quirks that Jim Carrey would have and it's hard not to draw

433
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,500
that conclusion. Now Jim Carrey does appear, so I was trying to figure out, okay, when is Jim Carrey

434
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:26,900
on TV? Jim Carrey is on TV in 1983 on The Tonight Show and it is not like, I will say this, the set

435
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,660
isn't great. He does like some impressions, but he does a lot of like, he takes like 90 seconds to

436
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,460
contort his body to become the impression. It's not my favorite piece of Jim Carrey comedy,

437
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,220
I'll say that. But he wasn't totally a different guy, different performer. It's not like Andrew

438
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,020
Dice Clay when he was doing his other characters before he became Dice. So it's not like it's

439
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:54,340
totally different, but it doesn't have some of the like kind of specific Jim Carrey stuff you would

440
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:00,660
see on In Living Color. So there are people online that do believe that Jim Carrey took a lot of his

441
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:08,100
juice from Max Headroom specifically, from Matt Fruer. Now they're both Canadian, they both do have

442
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:14,180
just normal like, normal like Canadian voices, because if you're seeing Fruer, now this is,

443
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:19,140
by the way, in case you couldn't tell, I got so sidetracked from watching this movie

444
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:25,780
going down this. I was like, yeah, yeah, Generation X, but I need to figure out the situation here,

445
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:31,220
because I love stuff like this. I like from The Lucy Show, I like hearing that Gail Gordon may

446
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:37,380
have stolen his whole thing from Frank Nelson, that guy who goes, yes, because he has very similar

447
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:43,140
voice, very similar delivery. So I got really derailed from watching this movie by looking at

448
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:49,860
this. And it's interesting, because yes, they have, as I was saying, they have similar voices,

449
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,940
but there are so many little quirky things. And you can hear it in that Generation X clip,

450
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,700
which is why immediately you think, oh, he's just doing an impression of Jim Carrey.

451
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:04,020
There's so many other things that are so spot on Jim Carrey. And even so, even so much so,

452
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:11,780
that Matt Fruer does the voice of Lloyd in the Dumb and Dumber cartoon. Oh, boy. See, I didn't

453
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:21,380
know any of this. So I mean, I was like, I acknowledge that I connected through Jim Carrey,

454
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:27,460
like I was kind of doing a quirky guy kind of thing. It was the 90s, man. Doing Jim Carrey,

455
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,900
channeling Jim Carrey was what you had to do. I mean, some might say that the guy who plays

456
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,260
Deadpool is still doing it. He's still channeling him. Initially, when I started watching this,

457
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:44,180
I was just like, oh, yeah, Jim Carrey was was hot at the time. And people wanted a Jim Carrey type

458
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:50,180
performance. But no, there's a chance at the very least Max Headroom influenced Jim.

459
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,420
I think at the very least, that's that whether you want to accuse Jim of outright stealing

460
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,020
the whole thing for his whole thing. I don't know. I'm not there yet. I would love to do

461
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:09,700
more of a deep dive and then declare something like that. I think Max Headroom was very influential

462
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:18,260
for a lot of things and performances. So, OK, we'll put a pin in that and revisit it in the

463
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:25,380
future. Some of the other actors, I mean, the one thing I was very curious about going back

464
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:33,700
and looking at was, were these actors and other stuff? And by and large, the answer is yes.

465
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:41,940
Uh, Jeremy Ratchford, who played Sean Cassidy, Banshee, one of the headmasters,

466
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:51,220
he started Cold Case for a number of years, like 100 plus episodes of Cold Case. So,

467
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,860
Finola Hughes, I don't think I've ever seen that name before, Finola.

468
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,980
Finola. Isn't that one of Shrek's children?

469
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,620
Oh, maybe it's one of Shrek's children. No, that's Fargo, Furkus, and Felicia, sorry.

470
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:18,420
Felicia, OK. She was on Charmed for a bunch of episodes. She was on General Hospital.

471
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,620
General Hospital, one at Daytime Emmy for General Hospital.

472
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,500
She was on All My Children, too, I believe. Yeah, she was on a couple of soap operas.

473
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:41,700
Heather McComb, who plays Jubilee, she went on to be in The Profiler, if you remember The Profiler.

474
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,540
I don't really remember The Profiler. She was on Party of Five as well,

475
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:55,460
which was another Big Fox hit. And I guess Matt Fruer was a big get for Dr. Russell Tresh,

476
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:01,620
a normal last name that lots of people have. Russell Tresh is the evil character, the Matt

477
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:07,780
Fruer character. I think Fruer is the only one who, I'm not saying any, everyone else is,

478
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:13,860
I'm sure, very talented. Fruer is the only one who pops in my mind. Obviously, he gets to do a big,

479
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:19,700
fun villain, but that's the only performance that I was like, what is this?

480
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:28,580
He's kind of giving 110 percent. I think Jeremy Ratchford's Sean Cassidy and Heather McComb's

481
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:39,140
Jubilee are pretty faithful to the comics. The Emma Frost gets a lot of it, right?

482
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,660
Sure.

483
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:48,900
But isn't the most... Talking about powers, this movie does a thing that I feel like,

484
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,900
or a lot of superhero stuff used to do when the budget was smaller,

485
00:49:54,100 --> 00:50:03,220
where they try too hard to solve logic and budget problems and create much more complicated logic

486
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,780
problems.

487
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,380
Sure.

488
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:15,140
Because in this world, mutants all have latent telepathic abilities,

489
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:26,420
but similarly to the way they don't want to just make refract cyclops, even though he kind of has

490
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:36,500
laser eyes and wears glasses to block the laser eyes, they don't want to just call the astral

491
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:45,860
plane that telepaths can access. There's a lot of convoluted stuff about dreams and planting ideas

492
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:57,620
and dreams. Oh, this is well before Inception, but they kind of go out of their way to establish

493
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:06,580
another dimension that is mostly, like I said, colored lighting and blackout curtains and

494
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:14,820
walkways. They also, there is a room full of computers, large computers, and they go...

495
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,020
This looks like the set of a porno when there's always computers.

496
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:26,020
Silk stockings on USA I felt like had a better budget than some of them. There were USA late

497
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:31,140
night shows or late night hour longs. Baywatch Nights, I'm sure, had bigger budget for some of

498
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,900
this, but this is the zone of set quality you're getting in a lot of these scenes.

499
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:43,380
They were specifically like, this is a room full of computers and it's Cerebro,

500
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:51,620
and it's how we find mutants. Then there is also some dream machines that kind of look like a

501
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:56,900
cheaper version of Cerebro, but they're different. It's not the same.

502
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:05,540
Yes. Then they need to do some sort of high tech scan on Jubilee when she gets to this

503
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:11,380
room you're talking about. They basically put her in what looks like the eye exam you do with the DMV.

504
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:16,820
You just a little bit of like, she puts her head on it and I'm like,

505
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:22,420
this isn't the sophisticated equipment of a highly evolved mutant school.

506
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,940
This is just like, oh, what do we have here? Okay. Well, we can go down to the DMV and check

507
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:34,180
their dumpster. Let's talk about this scene because it's a thing that happens a couple

508
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:41,140
times in this movie that as an adult, I was like, oh, that's weird. Which is,

509
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:49,540
they say we need a full body scan, take off your clothes. You know, it's that famous comic scene

510
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:56,580
where Jubilee takes off her top in front of Emma Frost. This is where I almost

511
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,460
went, am I accidentally watching the porno version of this?

512
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:08,580
It does. Because that's just a porno setup where you're like, the teacher at the school

513
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,380
is going to stand. It's not even like they go, oh, here, go into this little booth

514
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:19,860
and here's the like undressing area with your modesty curtain or something and then go do that

515
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,700
and she's even still a little weirded out, which would still be kind of a weird or would be a weird

516
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:31,620
scene. But Emma Frost stands with her and makes her do it and you're like, this is, I don't know

517
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:37,300
of a movie that has a more porno setup than this. This is just the start of a porno.

518
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:43,860
And as Jubilee's mother said a few scenes earlier, Emma Frost looks like a stripper

519
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:50,660
with all the latex and leather she's wearing. She just dresses very flashy. I think she's actually,

520
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:56,260
some of the comic depictions of Emma Frost, she shows more skin. So she was actually fairly

521
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:02,900
modestly dressed, but she does still have like silver boots and stuff. So, but yes, this also,

522
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:11,300
I was like, huh? But at 11, I was like, oh my God, it's a teenager's back. And I'm like,

523
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:17,780
well, yes, that made me uncomfortable. Yeah. I was kind of uncomfortable, but I was kind of like,

524
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:25,060
ooh, Fox, this is naughty. When you were 11? Yeah. I was like, oh my, I was scandalized too.

525
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,820
You were tugging at your collar. I probably ran and hit under a blanket probably.

526
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:40,580
But, and look, this actress, Heather McComb, married to James Vanderbeek for six years in

527
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:47,620
the 2000s. So she's probably like 1920 when they're making this movie. They'd already

528
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:58,020
established that Jubilee was 15. That's insane. And that's not the end of a teenager's back,

529
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:07,300
although it's much weirder later in the movie. So they've established in the movie that the

530
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:17,060
character Buff. Buff is a character on the country bears, that name. That's right. Yeah.

531
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:23,780
Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry. Jubilee's like, oh, I'll come get changed with you. Like they were going

532
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:30,740
to get changed from bed. And she's like, no, I prefer to get changed alone. And Monet, the

533
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:36,180
character who's super strong and invincible and knows everything says like, oh, she doesn't let

534
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:44,100
anyone get changed with her because of her horrible body, which is insane. That was insane

535
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:52,900
to hear about as an adult. And then at some point they go to town, they go into town and they're at

536
00:55:52,900 --> 00:56:01,540
a cool thrift store and Jubilee walks in on Buff changing. And in my mind, my memory from childhood

537
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:09,940
was they put some sort of prosthetic or hunchback on Buff. The reality is that there is a cheap

538
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:18,100
insert shot of a normal muscular person. And then the actress turns around and goes, doesn't anyone

539
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:25,940
knock? But doesn't cheat enough. So you can kind of see her normal back in the mirror. But don't

540
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:37,620
worry about it. But I, I swore there was like an insert shot of like, oh, this mutated, super

541
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:45,460
strong back. Again, no, it's just a normal muscular back. One of the, if I forget which character

542
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:52,100
like says something like nice beaver to another, like a lot of this stuff, you go, oh God. Now the

543
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,420
Emma Frost thing with the shirt off, that's just like abuse. That's just straight up. That's not

544
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:02,180
something, that's not something that the group guy character would do. No, you all should leave the room

545
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:08,900
because it also keeps cutting to skin, Angelo. And he keeps like, oh yeah. Like he kind of gives like a

546
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:16,980
whoa sort of nod. Yeah. Only teenagers should be allowed to write scripts where teenagers are body

547
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,780
or say insulting things to each other. You know, then it's authentic. Then it's fine.

548
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:28,900
Cause teenagers are doing it. It feels authentic when Olivia Rodrigo sings about this stuff.

549
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,500
Well, of course it does because she is just recently out of her teens.

550
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:41,700
And in some cases was still a teen. So it like, it just made a lot more sense. I think again,

551
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:46,260
there's a couple of logic problems going on, which is I think they were like, okay,

552
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:55,060
well teens are kind of into each other and lascivious. So it'd be weird if we didn't include

553
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:02,580
that, but they went a little too far in being very weird about it. The other thing is they make all

554
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:09,940
the characters really mean to each other so that it makes sense when they like overcome that and

555
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:16,340
come together and support each other at the end, which you probably didn't need to do that much.

556
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:21,620
No, because it's unpleasant to watch most of these characters interact. This is where I see

557
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:27,140
why it's just like not like most of the movies, like not fun and everybody's mean to each other

558
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:31,300
and they're making a mean comments or lascivious comments. And I'm just like,

559
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,980
don't we want this to be fun? Like you can still have it be fun and have there be some conflict.

560
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:41,620
And then the characters come together at the end, but this is just like unpleasant,

561
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,420
unpleasant, unpleasant. Okay. They're a team. And you're like, that's not,

562
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,620
that's not what we need to do here. I want to have some fun with the characters.

563
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:55,860
I was trying to examine like, okay, the stuff that I find weird as an adult,

564
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:02,260
which I was like intrigued by as a kid, what borrowed into my self-conscious,

565
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:13,460
like I did think buff was very cute as a kid. And I did end up with a partner who is incredibly

566
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:20,980
strong. Oh, so you think that's the generation X is because of that? I'm what I, I don't know.

567
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:27,060
Cause she like throws around Matt for her, like she beats the shit out of them in this.

568
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,100
So you think you became attracted. So you're, you're, you had a thing now because of

569
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:38,020
generation X. It was a formative time. Maybe. Were you a She-Hulk kid? Did you like she,

570
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:42,260
cause she was really strong. It's funny to say that I am actually reading one of the

571
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:48,580
current runs of She-Hulk. Like they're, it's a very, it's a very fun light romantic comedy

572
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:55,540
where She-Hulk and Jack of Hearts are an item. How strong is she? Like how muscly is she drawn

573
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:03,620
in the comic? She is very, she's very mousy and then she's very muscly. And I'm like, yeah,

574
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:14,580
yeah, I think I kind of like both. Okay. She-Hulk kind of, all right. And yeah, so, so I ended,

575
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:21,540
yeah, I ended up with my own buff. Jean can just throw me around the room. She's fair. Like I said,

576
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:29,460
she's all muscly. She's very strong. Yeah. Do you have a bench press in the apartment?

577
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,900
We don't have a bench press in the apartment. I mean, we have yoga mats and yoga straps and

578
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,620
I just want to see if she could like bench press you or something. She could bench press you or

579
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:47,780
something. Well, I, if I like having, were like doing stretches on the ground or like have fallen,

580
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:53,860
she's like once or twice squeezed me up so hard. I'm like, oh, hey, you're going to pull my arm

581
01:00:53,860 --> 01:01:03,780
out of the socket. Very impressive. So yeah, I mean, that's also probably like, I'm kind of,

582
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:12,180
you know, made of glass. You know, I'm not that, I, I am a little bit of a never drop the full

583
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:19,780
roly poly kid, you know, uh, eating corn and I'm still eating corn and taters every day. I just

584
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:25,540
try to portion size control it a little more. The a hundred year old song, the Bob will song,

585
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:32,900
roly poly is what Jason's referencing in case you didn't know. So, uh, yeah, I have my own little

586
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:41,700
buff, little buff in the house. I hope I'm not as crude as refraxes because he's kind of a jerk,

587
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:47,220
although he says he looks away when his x-ray vision kicks in when they're making out in the

588
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:51,460
car. Yes. And there's a lot of like x-ray vision. Oh, I could see through your clothes talk and

589
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:56,820
that's all like, I guess that's sort of par for the course as far as I guess a teenager having

590
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:00,740
those powers. Cause that's like, it is an intro. There's been plenty of different comic series

591
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:05,300
that like examine, well, what would a human being actually do if they weren't like a virtuous

592
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,740
person? Yeah. Most human beings aren't a hundred percent virtuous. So, uh, yeah,

593
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:15,220
you could imagine there'd be some problems that would arise if you gave a bunch of teens powers.

594
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,700
Yes. And, um, did you, what power did you want? What power did you want as a kid?

595
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:29,620
Oh, I mean, I certainly wanted that energy blast power. I really liked long shots agility,

596
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:36,020
just how he could flip around. Cause I had just no center of gravity as a kid. I had no balance.

597
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:41,220
Um, and, oh, what was the other out? But there's nothing you could do practically with the pot,

598
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,980
with the like blasting, like cause there weren't super villains in the real. I'm talking about

599
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:50,500
like in real world, if you got powers and there weren't super villains around. I think I wanted

600
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,660
shadow cats ability to walk through things. I know what I wanted. I wanted ice man powers.

601
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,500
You wanted ice man. Ice man could kind of turn into a solid piece of ice,

602
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:08,020
but he could then use his powers to create like ice sleds basically where he could kind of shoot

603
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:13,540
around very fast on ice that he created almost like he's making his own like slide or roller

604
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:18,660
coaster in real time. And I was like, Oh, that sounds awesome. I guess I could have just gotten

605
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:22,340
a power that where I could fly, but there was something about the ice that was very cool

606
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:28,820
and I wanted. Yes. And then he could go and he could look like a regular human too. But yeah,

607
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:34,820
the stuff that like does resonate with everybody is just, Oh my God, my body is changing. What is

608
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:41,460
happening to me? I feel so weird right now. I think, uh, yeah. And that's why as a kid,

609
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:48,340
I like leave the buff thing. Probably. I was like, that is very relatable. Cause I was like,

610
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,980
I don't know what I, my body is changing. I smell bad, you know,

611
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,340
and the angle, the generator, that's probably what I was afraid of when it comes to generation X

612
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:04,260
because generation X was leaning into that aspect of all of it. And I think that's probably,

613
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,580
I don't want to speak for Scott Lobdall, the writer, but I'm assuming that was the idea

614
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:14,580
because the characters weren't like perfect specimens. Like a lot of the X-Men were the

615
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:18,660
characters look stranger. The powers were weirder. Grant Morrison did the same thing

616
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,700
when he made up a bunch of new beak. It looks like a bird. He's like a half human, half bird.

617
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:29,140
Those weren't like all like just like perfect asymmetrical face human looking characters with

618
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:36,100
a little power they could turn on and off. So it makes sense. Yeah. And the beast in his run is

619
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:43,940
very much kind of has like horse legs and he looks more like beasts from the Disney

620
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:50,500
beauty and the beast. And that was the thing that became like artists sort of all draw him

621
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:55,620
differently, but it seems like Morrison had something more in mind because they started

622
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:01,860
getting into secondary mutations where characters started either heightening their powers or getting

623
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:08,660
other powers, which this also plays with a little too. I was a little disappointed watching this

624
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:15,140
and that it starts with like Jubilee is kind of your way in and like Jubilee, Shadow Cat,

625
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:22,820
other teen characters after them have kind of been your way in. But this very quickly takes a turn

626
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:30,420
where Angelo's skin is sort of becomes the main focus because he gets obsessed with the dream

627
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:36,100
machine. Yes, that, yeah, that's true. I mean, I, this was, they were hoping this was going to turn

628
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:42,500
into a series. So like that's what I understand about it. So it makes sense that it's kind of

629
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,860
ends up being more of an ensemble than it's just like, Oh, Jubilee is the main character.

630
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:54,660
But yeah, they, they, I think probably also just a hook in at any X-Men comic or cartoon fans. It

631
01:05:54,660 --> 01:06:01,060
was like, well, you know Jubilee is. Yeah. And they're watching the broadcast version with the

632
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:09,060
commercials. There's X-Men Fox Kids commercials in there. Oh yeah. Sure. So that's bridging the gap.

633
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:12,420
Yes. If you're a kid, now they're going to, now they're going to bring you into prime time to see

634
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:19,460
what Fox prime time has to offer all the wonderful programming that you could possibly see. Honestly,

635
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:26,340
if they're smart with this MCU X-Men movie, just have Jubilee, you know, come into the school and

636
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:31,700
everyone else is there already, you know. That's what you would do with the Marvel, the new MCU

637
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:38,260
X-Men you mean? I think it's an approach. I think Jubilee, if you're going to have a audience surrogate

638
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:44,900
character, have it be Jubilee because everyone who grew up with the X-Men cartoon is like 40 or

639
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:51,620
something now. So they'll be like, oh yeah, I know my friend from childhood. Yeah. They use

640
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:56,900
Rogue in the original and the singer, the Brian Singer 2000X, like Rogue was sort of the Jubilee

641
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:03,860
or the shadow character, the Anna Paquin Rogue. Yeah. She was like the new recruit. That's a

642
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:10,740
changing body. Like Rogue can't touch anyone, but she has these feelings for Iceman in the movie,

643
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:18,420
right? Well, and I liked Rogue the best and I've determined now after psychoanalyzing myself that

644
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:26,660
I think I liked Rogue because she couldn't touch anyone. Okay. Thus making her safe. She was not

645
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:31,940
going to try to kiss me. Even though I wanted to kiss Rogue, she was not going to kiss me because

646
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:39,620
she couldn't. Safe. Good. That is my favorite character. So much so that Rogue is sitting on

647
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:48,500
my shelf up there waving to me. At a safe distance. Hey, Suga. Out of sight, Adamon, baby.

648
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:55,380
She's way up there. She's way up there. She cannot, she cannot hurt me. She cannot hurt you,

649
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:02,500
but she can also not love you. Well, she can love me from afar, but it's a comfortable kind of love.

650
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:08,660
Yeah. At some point in the comics, they figured out the Rogan Gambit touching each other and

651
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:14,580
they're married now. It's fun. And they're fun. They're like a fun couple together. Sure. They've

652
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:22,740
done, I think, some short run series under the name Mr. and Mrs. X, which that's cute because

653
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:32,100
Gambit and Rogue were also like the smart Alex, you know? Sure. There are, in the Generation X comic,

654
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,700
this kind of carries over to the show. There's a lot of characters razzing each other,

655
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:45,140
but in the comics, it's also a way to get out what their powers are and what their personalities are.

656
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:49,140
I am looking currently at the schedule, like the Fox schedule for

657
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:57,780
96, 97 and Beyond Belief Factor Fiction was on the air at this point. This is the Jonathan Freaks.

658
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:02,020
Right. Where they would film different little short stories and then at the end,

659
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:06,180
they would tell you if it was a made up thing or if it was actually based on a real spooky story.

660
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:12,260
That has kind of taken on a life of its own on the internet

661
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:16,500
the last few years. It's like a meme, right? Yeah. Yeah. And you can find super cuts of

662
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:21,140
Jonathan Freaks asking like, have you ever read, you can find him be like,

663
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,620
have you ever ridden a bicycle with two seats before?

664
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:28,980
Have you ever stopped and eaten ice cream? You want to talk about someone giving 110%

665
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:37,700
Jonathan Freaks and those bumpers are, it's really something. It's very much Rod Serling,

666
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:45,460
Twilight Zone or I didn't know this. Do you know about the Orson Welles on the BBC?

667
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:53,140
He hosted like a show where he would introduce an outro. I don't think so. I've seen that Orson

668
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:58,660
Welles talk show where he's got like Kermit on it or something. Sure. But I have not seen what

669
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,900
you're, I don't think I've seen what you're talking about. Still uncovering Orson Welles.

670
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:13,060
He did a lot. Get back to the movie. There is a moment that I think the rip I watched must have

671
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:22,260
been either a master copy or like if they sold it on VHS, because there is some profanity that I

672
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:28,500
found quite shocking. Yes. I also, I looked at, okay, I looked at both versions. I don't believe

673
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:36,580
this scene is in the broadcast because they say two fucks and a shit, I think. And I was like,

674
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:43,540
what? My head spun. I said, what is this? Some Cinemax? What is this? Like what channel? This

675
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:47,700
was Fox. I was like, there's no way. I was like, I wonder if they bleeped this in the other version,

676
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:54,100
but no, I don't believe that scene is even in the original Mardi Gras rip with Jim Belushi and

677
01:10:54,100 --> 01:11:00,820
Jimmy Kimmel. You're talking about this scene. They're sitting outside the school skin and jubilee.

678
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:10,180
Yes. Skin and jubilee. And I only caught the one, but it was very off the cuff. And I was like,

679
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:14,980
oh, this makes sense. But I didn't expect it. I think there's a couple. I think you were so

680
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:20,020
blown away by one that you just like your ears filled up. I wouldn't be surprised here. Let's

681
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:26,100
go to it now. It was like my, my brain was floating in outer space, but with like nothing

682
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:32,180
to hold onto it. You know what I'm saying? Awesome. Are you fucking nuts? That was the

683
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:38,500
scariest thing I have ever felt in my entire life. I cosmically shit my fucking pants. I

684
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:43,700
cosmically shit my fucking pants. So three, there you go. Two F's and a shit. Two F's and a shit.

685
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:50,580
Yeah. And you were right. No, you were right. I was just like, that first fuck caught me so off

686
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:56,900
guard. And it is like true to the character. Like Jubilee would square. Jubilee would say she shit

687
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:03,780
her pants. She fucking shit her pants. Teenager real life Jubilee would say that. Has she ever

688
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:10,260
in the comics said I'm going to fucking shit my pants? No, cause they are, were comics code rated.

689
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:14,660
But would they have done the little like expletive like, you know, where they put like symbols in to

690
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:19,780
say that they were saying an ash swear or something? I think so. Yeah. I think she would.

691
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:25,460
And now they're what? Rated teen, T from T, whatever Marvel's kooky rating system is. I

692
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:31,540
feel like that doesn't feel like Jubilee to me. That she fucking shit her pants. I feel like a

693
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:41,300
a confused, frightened teen probably has a potty mouth. I think she, okay, she wouldn't say I made

694
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:46,980
in my pants cause that's like a kid's, a little kid says that she, but it doesn't feel right to,

695
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:52,100
I'm just trying to analyze my own feelings here. Why I don't think that that feels right to Jubilee.

696
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:56,580
I think she would have said it in like a cooler way. Like she would have talked about shitting her

697
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:05,860
pants in a cooler way. I'm trying to think like, I like, like, it's like, like I blazed one,

698
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:11,540
not blazed one out. That's like weed. Okay. I not shot one out. That's weird. Um,

699
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:19,060
drop the kids at the, I dropped the fucking kids at the pool. I fucking dropped one. I dropped one

700
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:24,260
off in my pants. No, that's not cool. See, I'm not cool like Jubilee. So I can't even think of

701
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:31,300
something good. Like she, yeah. What was cool at the time? Rollerblading, like a piece of shit,

702
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:36,740
rollerbladed out into my pants. Like that's not, I see again, I'm not the guy to think of this cool

703
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:43,140
teen dialogue. I can't do that. An old boss I used to have, uh, he was a little weird. He, uh,

704
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:49,060
you say I got a turtle head peeking out. If he was going to the bathroom, he would say that.

705
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:56,100
That's like the least offensive thing he would say. That's what fat bastard in Austin powers

706
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,940
says. I think. Oh my God. Yeah. I think he was probably your old boss was stealing lines from

707
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:08,900
fat bastard from gold members spy who shagged me. I don't remember which, which movie I believe

708
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:14,660
spy who shagged me, but I don't. Okay. That's a little better. If, if someone worked in a quote

709
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:20,500
from gold member into their repertoire, that would be very strange. I've, but I'll say like,

710
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:26,740
I love gold and stuff. I will work a gold member quotes into my real life. Yeah, but we're weird.

711
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:33,860
We're weird. We're, but I guess we're still thinking about the strange Mike Myers character

712
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:40,020
from 20 years ago. They were cultural phenomenon, gold member to some degree.

713
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:48,740
Yeah. Not as important as, uh, uh, Dr. Evil in Austin and, uh, Felicity Shagwell, but

714
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:56,820
gold gold member is like, that's, I feel like the clue to the love guru. Like that's a preview of

715
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:02,180
love guru Myers. I feel the love guru was that character was supposed to be in one of the Austin

716
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:08,900
powers movies. He had been thinking about it for so long. So yeah, maybe I remember in college,

717
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:16,180
um, uh, I used to see stuff on comedy message boards or comedy websites. So like,

718
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:23,860
Oh, Mike Myers workshop, a new character. And that was like, Oh, New York, they're sold out,

719
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:32,420
but New York is so far away. Which how long was it from you? Oh, probably good three plus hours.

720
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:39,700
Oh, wow. And there really wasn't, I guess you could get Ithaca to New York on a greyhound,

721
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:46,900
but there wasn't any trains anymore to Ithaca. I would, I would travel three hours to see Mike

722
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:55,060
Myers now, I think. Maybe, maybe. Cause you want to see, you want to see him revive his

723
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:02,740
gong show character. Tommy Maitland? Yeah, Tommy Maitland. British host of the gong show. Yeah.

724
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:08,420
But yeah, I, I, for whatever reason, it just seemed aggressive. Jubilee seemed like she had

725
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:14,100
such a hard edge here with, with her type of swearing. Well, she was generation X. They were

726
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:20,420
extreme. They were, I understand they were a little bit more, uh, out there. They had a lot more edge

727
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:26,660
than my average. Yeah. Than my average mutant teen. I get that. This is pre Mad Manic Pixie

728
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:34,660
dream girl. You know, cool skater girls back in the nineties had an edge. She's almost more like

729
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:41,620
my so-called life. Like she's almost more. Very so-called life. Yeah. Yeah. It's almost,

730
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:47,700
that's kind of the vibe to it too. Um, another thing I've never seen and had no interest when

731
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:52,260
I was a kid, because I wanted to be a child forever and I wasn't interested in the lives

732
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:56,980
of people who were older, unless they were much, much older, like Henry Fonda level older.

733
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:06,020
But not if it was Bridget or Laura that could get dangerous. They're very beautiful. Very beautiful.

734
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:12,820
Yes. Uh, uh, I wonder, yeah, did they sell like, was this common where they would do a scene

735
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:20,260
with like a couple curses for overseas? I don't know. That's interesting. Maybe. I did a quick,

736
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:26,020
there's not a ton of trivia. Just if you look at IMDb about this thing. Um, so yeah, I wonder,

737
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:30,820
obviously they knew that wasn't going to air and I don't recall, like X-Files didn't have just a

738
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:36,100
bunch of bleeps in it. Like show regular shows on Fox didn't just have a lot of bleeping.

739
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:42,100
So it must've been filmed for the idea that it could be a theatrical release somewhere,

740
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:48,740
or it would go somewhere where a country that celebrates the phrase, uh, fucking shitting,

741
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:54,020
fucking shitting, like it may be in Germany or something. That's a, that's like a popular

742
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:58,340
teen phrase and they were just trying to appeal to that market. I don't know. I'm speculating here.

743
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:03,620
I don't know. I have no information really going in on the Germans and their shit love. Um,

744
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:09,780
they, uh, yeah, I don't know. I must, like you said, they might've just cut this scene.

745
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:17,220
I think it makes sense without it. I, it starts to not make sense pretty quickly because they,

746
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:29,380
Angelo helps out Dr. Uh, Trash. Uh, and then he communicates to Jubilee, uh, like help me help.

747
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:35,700
I mean, I'm stuck. And then Emma Jubilee wakes up Sean and Emma and they get the whole team

748
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:43,860
together and then transport is layer into the real world or they transport them to the dream.

749
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:50,740
It's very unclear. It just kind of like is a complicated way to get everyone to go fight

750
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:57,700
this bad guy who doesn't really seem that powerful. No, his power is his quirkiness.

751
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:05,460
His power is his silly, uh, vocal delivery and getting the shit beat out of him. And he gets

752
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:14,420
beat up, surviving a pipe exploding above him. Um, uh, there are some other weird little moments

753
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:20,820
in that for one, the product placement of the video game virtual fighter. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

754
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:29,220
Fighter is mentioned multiple times. Um, the teen was a virtual fighter. Is that what you're

755
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:37,220
looking for? Is that the Sega Sega? Yeah, I was just called a virtual fighter. I fucked up.

756
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:46,020
I think I was not cool, you know? Yeah, it's a virtual fighter. Uh, after refrax and buff make

757
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:52,660
out the car and he accidentally reveals his x-ray vision, start to act up and she storms away.

758
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:59,300
Him and Mondo are like, uh, he's like, oh man, what do I do? Mondo says, uh, listen, man,

759
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:08,020
there's only one thing to do at a time like this. Let's crack a 40 and, and then it cuts to them

760
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:15,460
at like a soda stall. It's not quite clear. I, I think they just wanted the reference in there.

761
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:22,820
They weren't drinking like a 40 ounce beer. They were drinking a 40 ounce soda. Yeah. I, oh yeah.

762
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:28,820
I guess it, I, I, I don't know. I don't think it was that well thought out. Just like it wasn't

763
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:36,340
well thought out. The toss off line mutants can see subliminal message. What's it was at the end.

764
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:40,100
I don't even remember this at this point. At this point I'm trying to piece together. I have the

765
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,740
Charlie day meme going with Jim Carrey and Matt Fruer. So I'm forgetting some of the lines toward

766
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:51,860
the end of this movie. Uh, Matt Fruer is also like a real creep about you. He's like, oh yeah,

767
01:20:51,860 --> 01:21:01,060
he's very lascivious, a pedophile or whatever. Like, yeah, she's very young. Um, he also,

768
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:06,180
the bad guy there's, I swear they watched, I was looking up who, who did this directed it,

769
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:13,220
wrote it and it's like, uh, guy who had some writing credits on Cagney and Lacey, some old shows.

770
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:20,340
Uh, but I swear somebody watched Batman forever right before this because there's even a scene

771
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:27,060
like we all remember the famous scene when Jim Carrey throws, uh, at Begley junior out a window

772
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:34,020
in Batman forever. He's his boss, uh, at Wayne, whatever Wayne tech. Uh, there's a scene here

773
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:43,220
where Matt Fruer, uh, Dr. Tesh, Dr. Tresh, not John Tesh, Dr. Tresh, uh, uh, like tricks a person

774
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:47,860
into thinking they're in a dream and then throws them out a window at the top of a building.

775
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:52,660
And it was like, did somebody just say, give me Batman forever? And I know I'm a guy who has

776
01:21:52,660 --> 01:22:01,540
Batman forever on the brain 24 seven, but still it felt just like the Batman forever had just had

777
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:09,220
cast such a shadow over this movie. Uh, let me just say the director, Jack shoulder, uh,

778
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:17,140
Jack shoulder, he's from Philadelphia. Uh, he directed a load in the dark, a nightmare on Elm

779
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:24,500
street to Freddy's revenge and wish master to evil never dies. Does he still working?

780
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:32,340
I, let me see what his most recent credit was. Both him and the writer had made a lot before.

781
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:37,620
Could you get an internship with Jack shoulder because of the Philadelphia connection

782
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,940
solely? I think a lot of people have lived in that city, Michael. Um,

783
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:47,700
well, that would just be a little bit. I mean, obviously you're a fan of his movie. So that

784
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,380
would be another, that would be maybe a stronger connection, but I would just like to see you

785
01:22:51,460 --> 01:23:00,420
working for Jack shoulder for no money. Um, Ed Blake knee is the writer. He directed, uh,

786
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:08,020
he wrote some episodes at 21 jump street. He also directed a 2000s movie that I very clearly

787
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:15,620
remember the poster, but I've never seen called gun shy Liam Neeson, Oliver Platt and Sandra Bullock.

788
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:23,220
Okay. Uh, kind of a powerhouse cast. Oh, budget 14 million box office, three million.

789
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:30,820
So maybe it's good. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. It seems like up my alley. Um,

790
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:37,300
so yeah, I mean, I shoulder Jack shoulder sounds like he could be an X man. Cause like he has

791
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:43,220
shoulder, a shoulder power or something. He, Jack shoulder would be the one. Maybe that's

792
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:49,460
whose shoulder they used in that insert shot in the changing room. Oh, maybe he actually,

793
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:53,780
that's like almost a pseudonym or a nickname because he has such a nice looking shoulder.

794
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:58,580
And then anytime he does a shot where somebody has to like disrobe, they use his shoulder.

795
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:04,340
Yeah. Hmm. I was thinking more along the lines of he had like a mutant power of like

796
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:08,020
his shoulder could grow bigger. One shoulder could grow bigger.

797
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:13,460
Oh, that's more interesting. It's one shoulder shoulder gets really big,

798
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:17,940
but like it gets so big. Like you could, if like you could carry a piano on it or something,

799
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:22,900
like it's, it's not as such a great superhero power, but it is good if you need to like

800
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:29,620
carry three different garbage bags to the curb at once. You can just set them on his big shoulder.

801
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:38,020
Very funny scene too, to like communicate the, the teens feel affection or camaraderie with each

802
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:45,700
other where Mondo and refrax are eating in a fifties diner, a classic meal of hamburger pizza

803
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:53,140
slice and milkshake and Mondo. A regular Jay Leno, a regular Jay Leno meal. Well, breakfast, lunch

804
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:59,540
and dinner, you know, uh, Mondo starts having like an across the room eating competition.

805
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:05,380
The bully kids, uh, push his face into a banana split.

806
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:11,940
Did that upset you seeing that? I mean, I was mostly trying to figure out what flavors of ice

807
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:19,700
cream, cause it didn't seem like, it seemed like bright colors, but isn't it usually chocolate,

808
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:24,500
vanilla strawberry? You're asking me. I'm asking you. I'm asking you as a pro.

809
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:32,660
I would think you want a Neapolitan lineup. You want something simple, but varied to go

810
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:39,060
along with the bananas and the crushed pineapple. Okay. I have a pitch for you here. Yeah. Your

811
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:47,380
mutant power is that your fingers dispense soft serve ice cream. Do I eat the sauce or ice cream?

812
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:54,740
Yes. And each finger is a different, each finger is a different flavor of soft serve.

813
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:01,540
And you can, you can, you can use it. Like here's the thing. You can also shoot the soft serve very

814
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:07,060
fast. So it could be some sort of a defense or weapon. So you could hit somebody in the

815
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:14,340
face with like a chocolate soft serve stream, but it also is just regular good soft serve.

816
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:19,860
So you could use it and eat it and, and give it to your guests at a dinner party.

817
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:27,460
I am a nail biter since I was a kid. So if I could turn that into just

818
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:32,500
eating soft serve ice cream, it would really help. Although I'd probably,

819
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:40,340
probably be bad for my arteries. That feels like a mutant power where it's not like not a hundred

820
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:46,340
percent reliable, uh, offensively. So the character just has a gun for some reason,

821
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:54,980
like, uh, yeah, backup like cable kind of has telekinesis, but he's got to keep his body together.

822
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:59,860
So he also has a lot of guns. Right. And your name will be your, your code name is soft serve.

823
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:05,060
That's pretty good. I don't think we've had a mutant soft serve. Um,

824
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:13,140
that, which brings me to another point. I think a carrot, uh, uh, a comics creator,

825
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:20,500
I'm kind of shocked in like 18 years that no character, uh, creator has written in refrax or

826
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:27,460
buff of just like, you're shocked by that. I think it's probably, there's probably some trademark

827
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:33,940
copyright stuff, but it's like, if you need a bunch of mutants, I think that no one watched this

828
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:39,940
or liked it. And that's the reason that those characters haven't appeared anywhere else.

829
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:51,220
I could be wrong. I like the names, but, uh, it seems like first off, uh, credit to Jubilee

830
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:59,060
for being the first cursing X-Men on camera. Sorry, Deadpool and Wolverine Jubilee beat you to it.

831
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:06,980
But like, if they're bringing back all of the filmed Marvel characters in all of these movies,

832
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:11,220
have the Fox generation X pop up and explain who they are.

833
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:16,740
It would grind the movie to such a halt to use. You have to explain to the audience who they are.

834
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:22,820
Well, not if Deadpool's like, check out these guys next.

835
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,580
Okay. So you're going to bring them in just as a gag.

836
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:33,620
He does like the loony tunes, like when they push the frame, when they push the frame out of view.

837
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:39,380
Right. Um, yeah. Okay. It's a gag. I think that's, that's okay. I mean, the Nick fear,

838
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:46,180
uh, Castle of Nick Fury would play well. Which we should, I, I didn't want to do

839
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:50,420
talk about both those because obviously there was more than enough to talk about

840
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:55,620
in the world of generation X. I think we should examine that one with Scott.

841
01:28:55,620 --> 01:29:00,020
Cause that one, I think is a little more standalone. He's a Hasselhoff enthusiast.

842
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:04,740
He's a Hasselhoff connoisseur. Yeah. He's of the three. He knows his Hasselhoff so he can,

843
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:11,140
he can pull recall. I'm sure other Hasselhoff performances, um, and compare and contrast in a

844
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:16,820
lot better, more effective way than us. Um, and I haven't seen the Hasselhoff Nick Fury. I did not

845
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:24,100
watch it. Oh, okay. I was excited about that one. I just Fox's. Isn't there one more? Am I

846
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:30,420
forgetting one? Like a Fox or is it only two? There's, um, there's a low budget man thing,

847
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:35,060
like horror movie, but I don't know if that was looped in with this. Hey, by the way,

848
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:40,660
at the very beginning of the movie, there's a production card for a company called, um,

849
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:46,740
I think it's new world entertainment. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did you look that up?

850
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:51,700
I did look that up and I was shocked to find like they had sold it in the mid eighties,

851
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:58,740
but that was founded by Roger Corman and his brother. Okay. In the mid eighties, they sold it

852
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:07,300
for like 16 and a half million dollars. So, uh, I eat, eat, I think it was low budget movies when

853
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:13,220
they were doing it. And eventually it just kind of became a public, like independent production

854
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:20,100
company and they had a lot more like legitimate credits to its, to their name. Let me ask you a

855
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:29,140
question. Uh, did the Craven, the Hunter movie ever come out? Did it come out or is it about

856
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:38,420
to come out? Uh, it's a very good question. Um, did it come out? I don't, I don't think it did,

857
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:48,020
but I'm not sure. The movie Craven, the Hunter, the film is coming out December 13th, 2024.

858
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:53,060
It has not come out. I was right. And this has happened before where you all say the same or

859
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:58,500
ask a similar question to you, uh, where I go, did that movie come out a year ago or is it coming

860
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:05,940
out in a year? And yes, we're a month away from Craven. Darren Taylor Johnson is Kick-Ass,

861
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:13,300
Quicksilver and Craven. Yes. That's racking up. I am, I am interested in a lot of these guys who

862
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:18,580
are going to end up, a lot of these actors, uh, who will end up playing like 10 different comic

863
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:24,500
book characters once their career is all said and done. Yeah. And just hoping they end up in a future

864
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:30,260
Deadpool. They were trying to get Brolin to be Hal Jordan, Green Lantern. And I was like,

865
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:39,860
oh, is Brolin going to be Cable, Thanos and Green Lantern? I heard Kyle Chandler last.

866
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:44,100
Oh no, I know. Yeah. They were trying to get him, but they didn't. Kyle Chandler, who I'm a big fan

867
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:51,060
of. Yeah. He would be perfect as Hal Jordan. Who else could play soft serve other than Jason

868
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:56,820
Sherwood? Well, only me. Yeah, I am not. I'm offer only on soft serve. I'm not auditioning.

869
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:02,020
Well, the character has been created on this podcast now, so I don't know. You don't have

870
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:06,820
to get an offer from anyone but us, I think, unless we sell the character to the X-Men,

871
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:12,820
which I would like to. Well, that's fine, but I'm not auditioning. I'm demanding. I don't think

872
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:17,860
you should audition. Original character. No, I think I should get co-creator rights, you know.

873
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:23,060
Sure. I mean, again, I invented the whole thing, so I really should have the full rights,

874
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:30,820
but I will give you a 20% stake in soft serve. And we will say that if you buy the rights to

875
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:35,540
soft serve, you have to play the character. So at the very least, you'll get your big payday there.

876
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:42,580
I get my scale. Yeah. That is a sort of cutthroat negotiating that who would have been doing it,

877
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:47,540
Stanley or Roger Corman? Would they have just both been cutthroat to each other?

878
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:53,220
That's a good question. I don't know how cutthroat Corman was. I mean, Corman seemed like everybody

879
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:58,340
had nice things to say about him, and Stan, I think, is a little more murky. I don't know

880
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:03,860
exactly if he had a lawyer doing a lot of it, but early in the day.

881
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:10,180
Jack Nicholson breaks down in tears in that one Corman documentary talking about how he made his

882
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:15,220
career. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think a lot of people got their start with Roger Corman.

883
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:19,300
Yeah. But I don't know. I don't know the negotiator that he was. I don't know anything

884
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:24,980
about it. That's none of my business. Well, if you ever are listening to this,

885
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:29,780
if you ever had to negotiate with Roger Corman when he was still with us, let us know.

886
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:36,260
Yes, please. And on that note, I'm going to say you survived podcast to ride the second gate.

887
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:42,900
Jason's birthday shot. Hey, yeah. Oh, yeah. Somebody called somebody pub head in one of

888
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:49,380
these scenes. Oh, yes. Yeah. And that's I guess that's all in good teen fun, right?

889
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:57,380
Yeah, there's a lot of good teen fun. You know, there's a lot of mid 90s good teen fun

890
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:08,740
superimposed with Fox primetime Mardi Gras correspondents. I recommend watching the full

891
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:13,220
two hour block that as if you were going back in time, because I think that's more of an

892
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:17,860
interesting experience viewing wise, because then you have the full time machine and you

893
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:23,940
at least can enjoy because you can I am and I enjoy the cheap aesthetic of this movie. I enjoy

894
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:29,860
like, oh, this is what these these cheaper movies and TV shows look like at the time.

895
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:34,660
I enjoy all that stuff. And I enjoy the commercial. So I would recommend if you're interested,

896
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:40,660
I do I would do that. And then you could scroll around. But if you want to hear Jubilee say that

897
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:45,380
she fucking shit her pants, you do have to watch the other version without the commercials.

898
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:55,940
Correct. Yeah. And I I do like this probably did imprint on me, you know, not this specifically,

899
01:34:55,940 --> 01:35:05,540
but this was like of a piece of like sound design, kooky angles, kooky colored lighting,

900
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:12,740
things I still like. Well, who doesn't like a lot of the things you listed, you know, if you don't

901
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,260
like that, something's wrong with you real quick before we go. And I'm going to put you on the

902
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:21,700
spot here. And I want you to do it. I'm going to give you maybe 60 seconds to do this. I'm going

903
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:27,540
to give you 60 seconds. And to play us out, to talk us out, you're going to list the different

904
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:33,860
flavors that soft serve has coming out of each finger. As far as the powers are concerned,

905
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:40,420
I guess you could they could switch up. But like a basic wise, what would you think each finger

906
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:48,260
would be? And tell me when you're ready. And I will give you the 60 seconds on the on the stopwatch.

907
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:54,980
All right, this is going to be it's going to probably end up being pretty close to

908
01:35:56,260 --> 01:36:02,740
obviously yogurt land out here, but then Coors Brothers soft serve custard, frozen custard back

909
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:07,620
east. You can get wild with you. OK, are you ready? Yeah, you ready? All right, I hit start.

910
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:15,780
OK, vanilla chocolate, vanilla chocolate twist, strawberry banana, strawberry banana twist,

911
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,140
coffee, peanut butter.

912
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:29,220
I don't think you have to do the twist because I think you could you could combine the two fingers

913
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:34,100
and that would be a twist anyway. So we have to start all over again. All right, chocolate,

914
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:41,060
vanilla. OK, strawberry banana. Right. Peanut butter, coffee. OK.

915
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:50,420
Uh, oh, now he's stunned me. OK, make stuff up. Chocolate, chocolate, almond. OK.

916
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:59,860
Birthday cake. OK, you didn't need 60 seconds. Caramel. OK, good. And

917
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:05,700
rounding out the list, butterscotch. Butterscotch. Wow. You only need 29

918
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:12,260
seconds and that was with one restart. OK, that's that's great. I mean, I would have thrown in

919
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:16,740
did they have like cookie dough soft serve? They have to be able to do that, right?

920
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:23,780
They I think they've tried. We're like, I feel like I've seen chocolate pudding. Like, I think

921
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:29,700
it's just variants. That's a doctor. It's like time variance authority, you know, TVA.

922
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,300
An evil doctor, Tresh, would try some sort of abomination like a cookie dough soft serve.

923
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:43,300
Yes. Anyway, I just confirmed a dental appointment on my phone.
