1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,960
I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,200
Are we getting the embarrassing Mike story

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,400
in this episode or not?

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,080
Is this the Club Three or we get it?

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,620
And it doesn't have to be, I'm just trying to,

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,560
I'm trying to keep that ball in the air.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,400
No, I think that's right.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,040
So it doesn't just go in the gutter.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,920
Have I heard this story before?

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,760
No.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,200
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,560
I don't know that I've told this to anyone I've met

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,880
in the last 13 years.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,720
Well, I don't think.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,480
So it's gonna open way up.

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,300
We're getting above a thousand at least.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,280
Yeah, does Lindsay know the story?

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,660
I don't even know.

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,600
She might not.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,480
I think maybe, you know what?

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,640
Maybe she does know the story, but that's it.

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,880
I don't think any of my macho male friends,

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,240
I would never tell them this story

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,120
because it makes me look like too much of a grade A wimp.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,320
So.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,960
I know how much the macho reputation.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,800
Yeah.

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,980
Because look, you're Mr. Rock and Roll.

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,440
You're Mr. Hammered.

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,280
You're Mr. Peace.

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,000
You told us that you had a drink at 11 a.m. one,

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
at 10 a.m. at a bachelor party.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,560
That you liked it that one time.

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,720
It was a bucket of beers and I had a couple of those beers.

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
Each did do a bucket.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
A whole bucket.

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,600
The waiter could not handle how many drinks there were.

39
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,800
They had to acquire that bucket from behind the bar.

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,480
And there was a bucket had to be acquired at this bachelor.

41
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,040
It was a bucket bachelor party.

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,160
And here you have him safe.

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,420
You know what I'm remembering now

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,040
is that we were at the Hard Rock,

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,680
no, we were at the Planet Hollywood

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
and we were at the pool

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,600
and there was a bathing suit contest that day

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
at the pool as well, now that I'm remembering.

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Oh me, oh my.

50
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Yeah.

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,040
It was a whole thing.

52
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,260
Color scheme, stitching, like what are we judging here?

53
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,220
I think they really weren't specific.

54
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,020
I think it was just there was a lot of music playing

55
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,140
and some nice young ladies would kind of come on

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,540
under this catwalk that was constructed over the water.

57
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,540
And then a bunch of gentlemen would cheer.

58
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,540
Well I hope that you took a coaster or something

59
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,620
and put it above all,

60
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,620
or covered everything below their necks.

61
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,460
Yeah.

62
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,780
Because otherwise that would be a rude way

63
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,180
to look at these nice young ladies.

64
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,540
You know, cat bless them.

65
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,620
It's very nerve wracking for some people to get on stage.

66
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,740
So that they put themselves out there like that

67
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,500
and it's very, very confident.

68
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,700
Well that's what I said at the time

69
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,580
and that's why I was supporting it.

70
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,380
It's nice to see some confidence on display.

71
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,220
Yeah.

72
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,580
And that's all that it's nice to see.

73
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,740
And I will cease to look in that direction.

74
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,580
That's right.

75
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,300
Now show me to the bucket.

76
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,700
I have beers to drink.

77
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,780
You know what, I had a beer at 4 p.m. yesterday

78
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,620
alone at the Whole Foods in Burbank.

79
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,860
How about that?

80
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,860
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

81
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,300
And I typed on my computer while I did it,

82
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,140
while I drank it.

83
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,980
It was a working beer.

84
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,700
It was a working beer.

85
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,020
Very rare, but yes.

86
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,500
Well, all right, that's good.

87
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,660
You know, we're getting perilously close

88
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,180
to 11 a.m. with that, but.

89
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,460
Yeah, but it's not quite, yeah.

90
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,740
I will, you know.

91
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,900
I admire your confidence.

92
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,740
Thank you.

93
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,500
I think that the topic will come in

94
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,140
and will present itself the perfect opportunity

95
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,940
for the story.

96
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,340
And I was not asking to say,

97
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,220
hey, tell it right now at the top of the No I Know.

98
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,740
The top three episode about Disneyland smoking areas.

99
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,540
Again, I just didn't want it to get lost.

100
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,860
Yeah, I mean, keep that ball in the air.

101
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,260
The Minotaur is still in the air.

102
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,740
There's a couple threads here

103
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,820
that will have to be paid off eventually.

104
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,780
But yeah, no, I think we're gonna get the topic

105
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,380
and I'm gonna go, oh my God, it's that.

106
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,340
There it is.

107
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,180
Well.

108
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,660
I think, this is just a feeling I have,

109
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,940
but maybe, we'll see.

110
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,860
Mm-hmm.

111
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,060
Is the top, is it what it'll be like

112
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,260
getting your dick caught in an elevator?

113
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,980
Is the top, uh-oh.

114
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
That's exactly what happened.

115
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,820
Yeah, no.

116
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,780
It might be very specific.

117
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,100
It could be, we'll see.

118
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,780
It could be, yeah, it could be very specific.

119
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,780
I'm trying to, there's a ride we've probably already

120
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,740
discussed that I could have come up on, I think.

121
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,580
But we'll talk about it.

122
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,020
Is that too big of a hint?

123
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,980
No, I don't think so.

124
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,860
What's the ride?

125
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,180
It's one of the Epcot rides,

126
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,140
but as we've talked about before,

127
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,300
it's hard to remember sometimes specifically

128
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,340
what ride was what when you were younger

129
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,660
going on Epcot rides.

130
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,580
Was it World of Motion?

131
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,420
Was it?

132
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,740
Oh, I can probably parse it.

133
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,700
I do remember, I really watched them all a lot

134
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,540
for some of these episodes.

135
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,300
I'll tell you the reason I specifically don't remember

136
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,260
anything about the ride is because I was like,

137
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,020
like so nervous on it.

138
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,260
I was just nervous about what was happening.

139
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,500
Like, so I was not focused on the actual ride itself at all.

140
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,220
I know it was not Spaceship Earth, though.

141
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,100
But it's something that happens,

142
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,940
something that happened to you.

143
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,500
There's so many parts, multi-day, it's multi-day.

144
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,420
It is involves other things and friends in high school

145
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,940
and like seeming betrayals at the time,

146
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,540
which weren't betrayals at all, but embarrassing,

147
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,940
like embarrassing failings on my part and naivete.

148
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Is it an adventure that takes you to space and the seas?

149
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,340
If so, then you're thinking of horizons.

150
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,940
Is it a horizon type adventure?

151
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,380
This is the thing is, I wish if we could,

152
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,060
one of these times, one of these months,

153
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,020
I should go to like a hypnotist and see if I can really

154
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,260
like unleash this memory to remember what ride I was on.

155
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,580
You were on a ride.

156
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,700
Well, for part of this story,

157
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,180
sort of the part of the story,

158
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,100
the major part of the story, I was not on a ride.

159
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,060
Okay, I was gonna say, I didn't think it was.

160
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,700
But there is a little part of the story

161
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,300
where I'm on a ride at Epcot

162
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,340
and I try to figure out if what I think I've completely

163
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,020
bungled, if I did indeed bungle it.

164
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,460
This is relevant then.

165
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,300
Yeah.

166
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,860
Yeah, no, it's very.

167
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,100
Is this just like incomplete hand stuff?

168
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,140
No, it's not.

169
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,980
Okay.

170
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,300
You're giving me too much credit when you even.

171
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,940
I always give you credit.

172
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Assume there's anything sexual at all.

173
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,260
He's like, I got your number.

174
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,100
This is incomplete hand stuff, isn't it?

175
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,180
You tallies, you tall tights,

176
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,900
you have that confidence about you,

177
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,060
although it doesn't seem like you're tall.

178
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,900
Incomplete hand stuff.

179
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,100
I got half a hand job on horizons.

180
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,940
I mean, the way you were saying things started

181
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,780
and that it was incomplete.

182
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,100
Yeah, I mean, it has to do with

183
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,940
it's not out of the realm of possibility.

184
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,340
It has to do with, yeah, yeah.

185
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,100
Also, we built all this up,

186
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,220
so now I wanna hear the story.

187
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,340
You do know you don't have to tell it on this podcast.

188
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,140
No, I know, I'll tell it, it's fine.

189
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,060
Wow. It's okay.

190
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,780
It's just, it is, it's just so pain,

191
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,140
when I think about it,

192
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,180
it took me a couple years of doing the podcast

193
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,620
for me to realize that this was a directly

194
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,660
Walt Disney World related story.

195
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
And I was like, oh,

196
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,380
cause I really try to block it out

197
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,940
cause it just feels like if there's a perfect,

198
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,980
if there's a perfect like summation

199
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,460
for my romantic failings as a teen,

200
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,740
it's this story.

201
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,220
This is the perfect version.

202
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,060
It's long and it's a little, some twists and turns.

203
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,340
And it's just like, I think about it and I go, oh God.

204
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,740
It just makes me wince still,

205
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,700
even though I'm a much older man.

206
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,500
Youthful old, much older man.

207
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,260
When you lay this out to your co-hosts

208
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,300
and this audience who I expect,

209
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,740
the group that I just said has 100% success

210
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,380
in their romantic endeavors as teens.

211
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
They're gonna make fun of me.

212
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,220
Everyone's gonna make fun of me.

213
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,940
Perfect runs for all of us.

214
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,660
The shame that you'll feel.

215
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,180
And yeah, now at this point,

216
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,060
now Jesus, I've hyped this so much.

217
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,900
Yeah, you've opened a candle for it

218
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,100
where this is going to be one of the voted on topics

219
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,940
for the next month.

220
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,420
I think you were probably correct.

221
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,140
The story is gonna be.

222
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,980
Do you wanna take that off the table?

223
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,260
Yeah, I mean you can.

224
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,780
Or do you wanna make that a sub?

225
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,460
Ooh, here's the, oh shoot.

226
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,220
Should I, I mean we can do, we talk about Club 3.

227
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,620
We're adding things to the charter essentially

228
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,820
so we could vote on it.

229
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,420
Is the story off the table?

230
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,260
And you both could override me

231
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,100
and force the story as an episode.

232
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,460
It seems to me like a week full topic that it's just,

233
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,740
unless it's a 90 minute story.

234
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,860
I don't, it doesn't feel like a 90 minute story,

235
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,580
but I guess I could weave a real tale

236
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,540
about high school for you if you want.

237
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,780
I can certainly stretch, I know how to stretch.

238
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,220
If you included some of the music,

239
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,260
if you put the band in it too.

240
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,900
Oh yeah, I guess I could do that.

241
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,220
I could, can I find the CD of,

242
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,220
the mixed song CD I made for the bus ride

243
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,860
that includes Red Hot Chili Peppers by the way,

244
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,300
because it had just come out.

245
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,340
Yeah, I got some fresh,

246
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,380
I got some fresh Hot Chili Peppers on here.

247
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,860
Yeah, yeah, no this just came out.

248
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,620
I still got it, but I got it on the mixing time.

249
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah, I think that was maybe track one.

250
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,860
And it was a radio rip of it I remember too,

251
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,340
because it was like the first single on the radio.

252
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,220
Somebody ripped it and then put it into an MP3.

253
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,060
So then I grabbed it.

254
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,300
Yeah, I just stole this from Clear Channel.

255
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,140
I don't even care.

256
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,960
Yeah.

257
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,800
You know, they deserve it.

258
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,220
They're an evil corporation.

259
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,300
And recently, I just learned this year

260
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,700
that corporations are evil.

261
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Yeah, it was, yeah, I was talking a lot.

262
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,460
Probably said a lot of dumb shit.

263
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,700
Well, I guess, I don't know.

264
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,380
Maybe we have to leave it to the audience.

265
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,940
Is this to be one of the four topics

266
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,220
that we harvest for next month?

267
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm not gonna force you to do this.

268
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,500
No, and I think you're right.

269
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,620
I think it has to come up on its own time.

270
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,140
I'm sure it's something,

271
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,740
I bet something will cue it off organically.

272
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,220
Where it's like, okay, I can't not tell it now,

273
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,220
because like the berries and cream,

274
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,060
that little weird little guy commercial,

275
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,660
comes into play.

276
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,500
Something gets referenced from the 2000s.

277
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,860
Jason's thinking of something from his own life.

278
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,980
This came back around recently on the internet.

279
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,020
It was for, I think, those Hershey,

280
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,420
was it the smoothies?

281
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,580
The strawberry and cream hard candies?

282
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,420
Oh, I have those.

283
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,420
It was a weird medieval guy in a modern setting.

284
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,300
And he was like, berries and cream, berries and cream.

285
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,740
It is, it's very annoying.

286
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,900
It was a very annoying commercial from like 20 years ago.

287
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,100
I would like to put the topic

288
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,940
of the berries and cream commercial

289
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,140
on the charter from next month.

290
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,980
Great.

291
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,820
If people wanna vote on that.

292
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,540
Yeah, well, it's just up to somebody now.

293
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,860
The protocol is that someone has to suggest it.

294
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,100
We can parse, I think just try to back topic suggestions

295
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,700
into if you think that it's one

296
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,540
that might provoke one like story.

297
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,380
Well, I mean, people could be like.

298
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,100
It's a good example of like the funny,

299
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,300
cause it's random humor that was so popular

300
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,580
in the early 2000s, I think.

301
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,660
Like it kinda sucks, but it's like,

302
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,140
oh, I see why people are like,

303
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,620
oh, did you see that fucking thing?

304
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,740
Which thankfully died off and commercials today

305
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,220
are smart, well-written and rarely.

306
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,060
Patriotic. Relying on randomness.

307
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,900
Yeah. From the point of.

308
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,260
They are perfect now. The comedic value.

309
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,700
Okay, so we do need four topics.

310
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,220
Please suggest the way the incumbents

311
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,580
that'll face off against those.

312
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,860
Escape to Margaritaville, the musical.

313
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,620
That was the runner up, I believe.

314
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,900
Last time.

315
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,780
I was gonna say, I was, it is not,

316
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,380
I know you guys saw it.

317
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,260
It has not really come up in full on the show.

318
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,140
I was wondering if that bodes poorly.

319
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,460
That it does not. We can talk about it.

320
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,940
I mean, we probably would have done it

321
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,980
cause it was the last thing we did

322
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,420
before the pandemic started.

323
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,060
I don't know, it's kind of just like a pleasant time,

324
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,900
honestly.

325
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,660
So, so I'm not, maybe I'm, maybe then I'll make people

326
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,100
want us to hear us talk about it.

327
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,980
But it wasn't like. Last minute rush tickets,

328
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,300
I feel like.

329
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,140
Was that how we ended up there?

330
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,980
We gotta hear that story. We love that.

331
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,260
We gotta hear how that played out last minute.

332
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,820
I'm just saying this, it's not like you go,

333
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,420
yeah, then they sang Volcano and then they did this.

334
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,420
And it's not like, it's not as good as like,

335
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,580
like Rumpy from Swine Knot,

336
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,100
Jimmy Buffett's book about the pig doesn't appear.

337
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,540
Like it doesn't have some like deep,

338
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm sure there's some Buffett Easter eggs I missed,

339
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,340
but like it doesn't have,

340
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,940
there's not a lot of like crazy stuff in it,

341
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,980
is what I'm saying.

342
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Interesting.

343
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,820
So if you want us to do it.

344
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,460
It may not have what it takes, is your review.

345
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,340
That's fine, but there's definitely, I mean,

346
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,300
Swine Knot, I think is a better choice for topics.

347
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,620
Putting that out there too.

348
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,460
Why not?

349
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,020
Which Swine Knot, it's, you're saying it's Swine Knot,

350
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,860
not a Rumpy episode.

351
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,140
I'm not saying that actually.

352
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,980
Again, it's up to you.

353
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,980
We are forcing people's hands too much here.

354
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,260
All right, so four topics,

355
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,140
list away in the Patreon comments.

356
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,060
But for now, let us get to today's topic,

357
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,020
which is Disneyland smoking areas.

358
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,460
Really like the suggestion.

359
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,820
Let me read the official quote from Eric B. Madden.

360
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,860
Thank you for the topic.

361
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,260
Congrats on your victory.

362
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,940
After revisiting the Joe Camel episode,

363
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,540
I became yearnful for the days of being able

364
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,140
to enjoy a cigarette at Disneyland.

365
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,500
That being said, my suggestion is a retrospective

366
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,220
on the old smoking spots

367
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,740
that were located throughout the park.

368
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,060
Sure.

369
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,980
Can I read the current state of smoking

370
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,420
from the official Disneyland site in 2023?

371
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,660
The current policy here in 2023.

372
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,820
For the comfort of all guests,

373
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,060
smoking is not permitted in the theme parks

374
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,020
and hotels of the Disneyland Resort,

375
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,540
the esplanade between the parks

376
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,100
where the downtown Disney district.

377
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,140
So yeah, that's the current state.

378
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,180
Party's over, folks.

379
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,020
No more smoking.

380
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,060
Don't smoke them if you got them.

381
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,220
Don't have them.

382
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,260
Right.

383
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,860
Yeah, you are now, I mean, I'm not sure

384
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,300
where is the closest place to Disneyland Park

385
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
that you can smoke.

386
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,460
I'm not exactly sure of the hotel policy at this point.

387
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,580
It's obviously changed.

388
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,980
There were once smoking rooms

389
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,340
and there are not smoking rooms now.

390
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,260
But I know it is at least outside of security

391
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,860
because now things have changed

392
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,260
where you gotta go through security

393
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,980
to be in the downtown Disney district at all.

394
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,820
Yeah.

395
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,220
It's not happening anywhere near between those.

396
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,580
It's not happening in those parks.

397
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,780
It's not happening in the space between those parks.

398
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,620
Yeah.

399
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,460
I, it's funny.

400
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,540
I do have to let my dad know this

401
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,180
because him and my brother are coming out to visit

402
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,580
in the fall and I don't think he realized that.

403
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,500
It's like, by the way, he doesn't smoke anymore

404
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,860
but he jewels.

405
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Like he got off tobacco with blue e-cigarettes

406
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,940
and when those stopped being like readily available,

407
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,220
he begrudgingly switched to jewel.

408
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,980
What are his, do you know what his flavors are?

409
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,900
I don't think there's many left.

410
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,420
I think it's like tobacco or menthol

411
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,580
or sweet Virginia tobacco.

412
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,420
Oh really?

413
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,540
They give them names now to encourage you to not do it.

414
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,860
So you can smoke guilt grape.

415
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,380
Like mango.

416
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,580
Feel bad fruit.

417
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,620
Feel bad passion fruit.

418
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,100
I think they legislated the fruit snack flavors

419
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,940
out of existence.

420
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,780
Oh they did.

421
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,620
I didn't know this.

422
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,340
I know, I didn't know a lot of smoking stuff

423
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,180
that I learned today.

424
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,860
So now it tastes like, you can choose sand.

425
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,700
You can choose termites.

426
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,540
It tastes like tobacco juice.

427
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,380
Basically.

428
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,220
Glass.

429
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,820
Dirty glass.

430
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,460
I mean they say people.

431
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,100
Extra sour milk.

432
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,260
They say people in general are smoking less and less

433
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,660
and I think you see that as the Disneyland smoking areas

434
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,540
get less, there's less and less of them.

435
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,580
Well I think the question is yes,

436
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,540
is it the tale of smoking decreasing in this country

437
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,140
or did they force the tale?

438
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,260
Are they part of, as with us,

439
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
forcing the hand of our audience in the topics?

440
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,420
Yeah.

441
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,940
Or did they cause the story via their smoking policies?

442
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,500
I think if it was still as popular as it was in the 90s,

443
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,100
they would not wanna leave money on the table.

444
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,700
Yes, like Alienate, a big part of their audience base.

445
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,340
They must have been hearing more of,

446
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,020
I don't want secondhand smoke blown at me

447
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,260
when I'm in the park.

448
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,100
Yeah.

449
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,940
When I'm with my kids.

450
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,780
That must have been more definite.

451
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,140
I think that's a valid complaint.

452
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,460
And I think like, first of all,

453
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,180
I didn't realize or forgot

454
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,980
that it had been completely taken out of the park

455
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,100
because I go, oh yeah, there's those couple sections

456
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,340
where you can smoke.

457
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,300
So those things were pretty, I don't know, out of the way.

458
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,340
I guess some of the Fantasyland, Big Thunder,

459
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,420
that was sort of the most prominent one in my memory.

460
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,180
But they must have really felt like there was not the demand

461
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,740
to get rid of a couple places

462
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,460
that I couldn't even quite remember,

463
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,980
even though we went constantly for a decade.

464
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,940
Well, I think a big thing that did that

465
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,420
was the opening of Galaxy's Edge in 2019.

466
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,260
Because one of the big last smoking areas in the park

467
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,700
was that crop of benches on the way to Big Thunder Ranch.

468
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,020
And they're like, oh, no more smoking there.

469
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,540
We'll need that for the rush of people

470
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,220
waiting to get into Galaxy's Edge.

471
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,300
That's a good point.

472
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,940
The announcement is simultaneous

473
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
that smoking areas are going away

474
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,460
and that the giant strollers

475
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,060
are not gonna be tolerated anymore.

476
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,980
You can't bring a big wagon

477
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,300
and now we all see the rectangle that shows you

478
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,180
what your stroller has to fit in.

479
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,540
These happen at the same time,

480
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,980
so it's almost like they're pinning it on,

481
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,020
it's a space issue, it's a crowd flow issue.

482
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,060
And I don't know if that's hiding,

483
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,420
I don't know if that's them trying to get off

484
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,180
or just like sweep it under the rug.

485
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,780
Because they also made people angry

486
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,580
with the other announcement, I think.

487
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,500
I think people really wanted to take their baby RVs

488
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,780
into the park still.

489
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,300
So maybe they thought, well, we can get some of the heat

490
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,340
on this if we announce this other thing too.

491
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,780
But it does seem like it's all,

492
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,780
you're very right that that Big Thunder one going away

493
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,140
has gotta be in the effort to like,

494
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,180
boy, we're gonna get, there's just gonna be throngs

495
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,260
heading right through here.

496
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,820
Yeah, but I remember my dad,

497
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,940
when he came out and visited in 2008,

498
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,500
and a very fond memory of sitting on the old fantasy land,

499
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,700
that little strip of that dock that the boat,

500
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,780
used to be the boat dock.

501
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,620
The motorboat crew.

502
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,460
The motorboat.

503
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
So it was where you loaded for the,

504
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,980
it's like the water version of Autopia.

505
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,300
And it just became this kind of oddly long, narrow patio

506
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,100
that seems kind of pleasant, maybe a good place to smoke.

507
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,620
It's where Jane and I sat and like ate popcorn

508
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,380
and met that weird bird who was like really giving us the eye

509
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,420
right after Disneyland reopened.

510
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,060
You're bringing this up like that weird bird.

511
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,900
It's stuck with me.

512
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,500
I needn't say the weird bird story.

513
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,300
I think she was, it was a story where she was like,

514
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,500
oh, look at that cute bird.

515
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,460
And I'm like, that beak is really long and really sharp.

516
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,140
I don't want it near me.

517
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,980
Did you tell this on the podcast?

518
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,660
I think I told it on the reopening,

519
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,940
but we were also crazed and we were also excited

520
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,100
to be back in the park.

521
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,100
The bird, we were all too crazed to remember it.

522
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,340
Yeah, in the spring of 2021, if you can believe it.

523
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,220
The bird with the deadly beak.

524
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,300
Yeah.

525
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,140
The bird has gone back.

526
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,380
I don't remember this at all.

527
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,220
I don't.

528
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,060
I'm gonna find the bird.

529
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,540
Were you worried that you'd get poked or stabbed?

530
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,100
Yeah, I was worried about it like stabbing us

531
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,460
as it ate like ground popcorn

532
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,420
that the people before us had dropped.

533
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,220
So, yeah.

534
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,180
Because you weren't dropping popcorn yourself.

535
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,020
You're like, I don't want this.

536
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,300
I don't want to attract this thing.

537
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,140
Yeah.

538
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,980
It's delicious.

539
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,700
It's delicious, it's salty.

540
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,380
It goes great with the Coca Cola we got.

541
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,300
You felt threatened because you wanted to eat the popcorn.

542
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,940
We were, yeah, we were both alpha predators

543
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,020
and we were eyeing each other up.

544
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,860
This feels like maybe,

545
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,260
I don't know, how could we have glossed over this?

546
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,340
I feel like this evil pointy beaked bird

547
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,060
would have been a whole runner on this episode.

548
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,900
We were crazed.

549
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,100
If you listen to the episode,

550
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,980
it's like we just snorted a bunch of meth.

551
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,540
We were so excited to be back.

552
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,300
Anyway, so 2008, that was the smoking dock.

553
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,620
But by the time he came out to visit again in 2015,

554
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,380
the smoking area had shifted to that sort of weird outcrop

555
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,740
of benches by the Matterhorn and the subs.

556
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,420
It just kind of set off from the pathway.

557
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,260
Okay.

558
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,220
I have no memory of that one.

559
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,460
That was one of the last standing ones that I saw.

560
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,740
At the risk of like jumping ahead,

561
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,300
but I think as we tell the story,

562
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,540
it'll kind of take this shape.

563
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,100
I feel like it generally goes from,

564
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,260
all right, people want to smoke,

565
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,780
but we don't want the smoke to spread

566
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,820
to people who don't want it.

567
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,340
So what if we sort of like create these little special areas

568
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,740
and we'll still do a little bit of Disney touches

569
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,380
and we'll try to make it somewhere nice

570
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,780
and somewhere shady and somewhere that's still as,

571
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,220
or that's scenic, you know,

572
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,860
as a little bit of Disney magic.

573
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,860
And then by the end of the run, it's like,

574
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,220
this is your cage.

575
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,700
Stay in your cage.

576
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,540
Do your dirty deed in your cage.

577
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,380
Wrap it up.

578
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,020
Do not bring it out of the cage.

579
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,260
Yeah, it is.

580
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,540
Yes, no, you're correct.

581
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,380
It is interesting.

582
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,740
That's one of the things I,

583
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,100
we've talked about this on the show maybe

584
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,580
where the change in society in general happened so quickly.

585
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,780
Because when we were in college,

586
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,740
bars were full of smoke.

587
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,580
Yeah.

588
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,940
And shortly after they were not,

589
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,260
other than in Las Vegas.

590
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,540
And I should say American society because-

591
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,540
I looked at the Shanghai Disneyland website

592
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,540
and there are 16 smoking areas in the park.

593
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Yes, there's a ton there.

594
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,580
Disneyland Paris might be down to a dozen

595
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,860
between the two parks,

596
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,940
but somewhere between 16 and a dozen.

597
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,860
In France, you're allowed to smoke in front of Goofy.

598
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,220
You're in front of Mickey, you blow it in his face.

599
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,260
Yeah.

600
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,940
Yeah, you know, it's interesting to see, yeah.

601
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
Cause there's a big map, a fun map

602
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,660
showing you all the places to smoke in France and Shanghai.

603
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,500
Yeah.

604
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,580
Yeah.

605
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,100
So they're depriving us of kind of a scavenger hunt.

606
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,700
That's like a fun collect them all

607
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,740
that we don't get here anymore.

608
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,820
If you're not into pin trading,

609
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,140
then what else am I supposed to,

610
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,860
how do I make sure that I've seen all the little,

611
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,860
I don't know, you just have to go to former locations.

612
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,380
That's what you have to do.

613
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,540
They've deprived people of smoking around the world

614
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,460
at World Showcase and Epcot Center, you know?

615
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,620
Oh yeah.

616
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,220
Have a different cigarette in each country.

617
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,020
That was a thing, again,

618
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,700
recalling Sheridan family vacation memories.

619
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,420
You could still smoke at the hotels there.

620
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,500
You walk out the building and make a left or a right

621
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,220
and there's a little smoking, there's an ashtray and a bench.

622
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,340
And then at the entrance of every park,

623
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,660
they're like, over there is the smoking section.

624
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
That's where you can smoke,

625
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,060
you can't smoke in the parks anymore.

626
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,140
So do it before you come in.

627
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,500
Did you then on vacations have to wait around?

628
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,980
Or are you like, okay, dad has to go,

629
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,580
he has to go to the smoking spot and smoke and I got to...

630
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,420
Usually if we were like, just getting everyone,

631
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,740
if we were meeting up or if everyone was just getting there,

632
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,980
like maybe half the party would go into the park

633
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,340
and check out some stores while the other half, you know.

634
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,180
Lit up.

635
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,540
Did some plumes.

636
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,620
I don't remember a lot when we were younger.

637
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,860
I think my dad, when he would just come upon them,

638
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,420
when they were in the parks, when he was more avid smoker,

639
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,220
he would just be like, oh, if you guys want to go ahead,

640
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm just going to have a cigarette.

641
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
You know?

642
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,740
Yeah, it's not, because I was going to say,

643
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,820
if it seems like, if that was slowing you down,

644
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,260
if that's slowing...

645
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,220
And like, I'm imagining this happening

646
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,540
at Islands of Adventure and like, hang on Jason,

647
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,020
don't get on Spider-Man yet, wait for dad.

648
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,700
Islands of Adventure, by the way, Universal Orlando,

649
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,300
you can still smoke in those two parks.

650
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,140
Is that so?

651
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,980
Really?

652
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,380
Yes, it's just the start of this year.

653
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,900
It was down to one location in both park.

654
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,900
In Universal Florida, it's the Lancy Park across from Mummy.

655
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,260
Okay.

656
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
And Islands of Adventure, it's that beautiful spot

657
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,500
right at the end of Port of Entry, right at the lagoon.

658
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,580
So the spot I totally want to go to.

659
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,500
It's like, yeah, it used to be the boat launch

660
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,100
is now the smoking.

661
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,820
Oh, Port of Entry is basically just like the smoking section

662
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,580
of Islands of Adventure.

663
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,420
Be careful, Mike.

664
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,180
Don't, you're dancing on getting Club 3 canceled again.

665
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,140
Oh, full of smoke, second hand smoke.

666
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,540
Smell of sweat, man.

667
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,220
You have to rush through it, there's too much smoke.

668
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,900
That's why I rush through Port of Entry,

669
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,740
that's why I never noticed that.

670
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,260
Yeah, get your Starbucks, get your Cinnabon,

671
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,580
get your Parliament, you know?

672
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,460
Get your big puff of somebody else's smoke.

673
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,300
Sure, yeah.

674
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,460
Let me do a bit of timeline laying.

675
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,460
And it's not like I am now an expert

676
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,660
in how smoking goes away in America in general.

677
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,580
But roughly, it seems like end of the 60s

678
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,700
is when we're starting to sound the alarm.

679
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,540
Maybe these things aren't great for you.

680
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,220
Ralph Nader, I think, is a party in that.

681
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,740
Maybe we should start to take these things away

682
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,180
and maybe curb the use of cigarettes in indoor spaces.

683
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,900
And then it seems like the 80s are really where

684
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,980
it really starts to kick into gear,

685
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,900
to where by the late 80s, now,

686
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,740
planes, it's not happening so much.

687
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,780
Restaurants require smoking and non-smoking.

688
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,180
And it's crazy to see, now we just know this.

689
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,180
I mean, it now makes you feel old to have heard that phrase

690
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,020
in your childhood.

691
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
Yeah, it's probably.

692
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,860
It seems so far away, smoking in a restaurant.

693
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,260
But yeah, I'm not sure what my point was.

694
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,540
Well, I was gonna say smoking or non-smoking is like theater.

695
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,580
That was the original health theater

696
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,700
in the sense that, or in the same way that,

697
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
they're like, COVID, yeah, you wear the mask

698
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,100
to the table inside.

699
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,340
It's like, theater, what are you doing?

700
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,700
If it's in a restaurant, if it's in the plaza,

701
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
it's like a plane.

702
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,500
Yeah, right, exactly.

703
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,380
And the plane, non-smoking section of the plane,

704
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,540
I remember going like, oh, non-smoking,

705
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,100
and we sat down and I remember being like,

706
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,540
there's smoke everywhere.

707
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,020
This is one big room.

708
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,980
It could not have come out of my mom's mouth fast enough

709
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,940
when we went in a restaurant and say non-smoking.

710
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,380
And just as quick was the complaints

711
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,380
that you can still smoke in the non-smoking section.

712
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,220
Of course, yeah.

713
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,060
Which she wasn't wrong.

714
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,900
No.

715
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,620
Like in the school, in the Cub Scouts,

716
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,260
I was always told that smoking was poison

717
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,380
and was gonna kill us all.

718
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,820
And then we'd have to go home and tell our parents.

719
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,140
I'd have to be like, well, dad, I know you're a smoker,

720
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,460
but did you know it's killing us all?

721
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,740
They'd say it like, go tell your parents.

722
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,980
I knew there was some.

723
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,820
In this case, you need to do the educating, kiddo.

724
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,100
There was some health assignment in the Cub Scouts.

725
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,700
There was some level of weeblow or tender foot or something

726
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,740
where we had to like, oh, let's talk about health,

727
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,700
you know, discrepancies in daily life.

728
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,820
Let's talk about like health problems in daily life.

729
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,580
Well, smoking, that'll kill you.

730
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,220
I was like, is it gonna kill us all?

731
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,340
Like this week?

732
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,540
Yeah, this week, that was my thing.

733
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,380
I was a nervous child given prone to many fears.

734
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,580
So I was like, well, smoking is gonna kill us all.

735
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,220
What level of Boy Scout did you rise?

736
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,820
What rank did you make?

737
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,380
I think I got up to whatever you hit,

738
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,540
second class or first class, like I got two levels in

739
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,540
and then there was two or three levels after that.

740
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,860
Weeblow and tender, you made it to tender foot?

741
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,860
I think, yeah, I made it to tender foot.

742
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,420
Weeblows were, that was Cub Scouts,

743
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,380
that was before Boy Scouts, I think.

744
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,500
Okay, I know Eagle Scout is like the best.

745
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,780
Yeah, I never got anywhere near that.

746
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,220
That's like the Navy Seal of Boy Scouts.

747
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,820
Nick Weiger and Eagle Scout, is that right?

748
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,660
Oh, maybe, I think.

749
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,180
I think I would believe it.

750
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,700
Yeah.

751
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,060
Did you do Boy Scouts ever?

752
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,900
I did, yeah.

753
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,260
Well, I was about to say,

754
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,300
I didn't wanna be one of those weird older scouts

755
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,580
hanging around. Oh, yeah, yeah.

756
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,060
And then you said the name of someone we like.

757
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,220
Oh, whatever.

758
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,020
I think a little bit of that.

759
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,140
I mean, there was a lot of positive,

760
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,100
the most, a lot of the Boy Scouts that I,

761
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,380
most people wanted to be there

762
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,460
to get access to fire and knives.

763
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,220
I wanted to be a Boy Scout to do the archery,

764
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,020
but my mom was like, no way.

765
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,540
I have that merit badge.

766
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,360
You do?

767
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,820
I do, yeah, I have an archery merit badge.

768
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,700
I saw you shoot a bow and arrow in the desert

769
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,140
and you weren't very good at it, I'll be honest.

770
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,580
Well, it wasn't a very good bow and arrow.

771
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,500
Oh, that is true.

772
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,340
You're right about that.

773
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,900
You mean the free bow and arrow at the Airbnb?

774
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,740
That's correct.

775
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,580
Okay.

776
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,820
I don't know how to tell you this,

777
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,780
I don't think it was kept up very well.

778
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,980
I mean, you're right about that,

779
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,700
but I'm just saying,

780
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,540
it didn't look like you would wield

781
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,940
at a bow and arrow in a while.

782
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,460
Is this a bachelor party story involving you guys

783
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,340
that hasn't been told 15 times on the show?

784
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,940
No, it's not a bachelor party.

785
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,180
It's Marissa Strickland's birthday in the desert.

786
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,020
Yeah.

787
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,060
Yeah.

788
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,420
And Jason shot a bow and arrow, poorly.

789
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,460
Yeah.

790
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,740
Now, hang on, but did you try the bow and arrow?

791
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
I don't remember.

792
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,860
Maybe, maybe.

793
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,060
So you're like, yeah, I think I did.

794
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,620
I think it sailed clean out of the,

795
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,740
I think it, I think it went, came back around.

796
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,460
Like it went all the way around the earth.

797
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,300
As I recall.

798
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,140
I remember.

799
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,060
Jason's was not so good.

800
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,100
I remember somebody put an apple on their head

801
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,780
and I split it in two.

802
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,020
That's what I recall.

803
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,260
I just asked the question because tender foot is funny.

804
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,100
Yeah, no, it's funny.

805
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,940
Tender foot is funny.

806
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,780
I didn't know what tender foot is.

807
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,740
I think that's the entry level.

808
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,020
I think that's the first level one.

809
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,300
That does feel, that feels early.

810
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,780
It feels gentle.

811
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,860
Yeah.

812
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,300
But you know, it's one of these things that,

813
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,820
it spreads all through America,

814
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,780
smoking bans and indoor smoking bans,

815
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,940
but Southern California leads the charge on it

816
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,540
and is doing these things first, typically.

817
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Not always, but like 1987, it looks like Beverly Hills

818
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,340
passed laws to ban smoking in restaurant stores

819
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,420
and public gatherings.

820
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,220
And you go back and you look at articles

821
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,700
where people are indignant about every step of this.

822
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,660
I, 87's also, they, LA requires non-smoking areas

823
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,620
and restaurants and they feel, it feels very familiar.

824
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,420
The half of people are, we have to do this

825
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,020
and the other half are Gripen and Grousen.

826
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,500
And it's funny because it's like,

827
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,900
well, this feels like everything.

828
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Like you're saying like masks or guns to bed and extreme,

829
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,660
except that it doesn't fall along the same lines.

830
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,260
Is it like, we're used to every argument in the world

831
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,740
falling along the same stupid lines,

832
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,580
but back then it's a little more mixed up.

833
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,420
Right, right, right.

834
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,340
It's not necessarily a red and blue issue.

835
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,260
Like for example, once it happens at Disneyland,

836
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,900
they talk to a guy at Disneyland,

837
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,100
what do you think about this?

838
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,820
He says, where does it stop?

839
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,060
Indignantly grousing about the country's

840
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,180
increasingly moralistic bent.

841
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,140
Next he muttered, they'll be restricting diaper changing

842
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,420
and breastfeeding.

843
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,260
Which doesn't feel like, yeah,

844
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,660
I think those things need to happen.

845
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,020
Yeah. Yeah, it's a little different.

846
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,380
Small creatures to live.

847
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,180
Yeah.

848
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,900
Yeah, also, yeah, like I need to have a cigarette

849
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,820
as much as a baby needs to not have its poop

850
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,340
soaking around its butt all the time.

851
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,180
But you know what I mean?

852
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,740
Like, doesn't that seem, I read that and I thought,

853
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,820
well, I feel like DeSantis would be the first

854
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,660
to start the discussion of banning breastfeeding in general.

855
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,500
Yeah, yeah.

856
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,420
Well, everything gets mixed around a little bit

857
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,580
as the years go on.

858
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,700
You know, certain parties like end up

859
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,420
like taking the mantle of something, I feel like.

860
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,260
Sure.

861
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,420
Well, maybe you shift hands a little bit.

862
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,340
Stuff shifts a little bit over time.

863
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,260
I don't know, it's probably right

864
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,660
because the lack of social media and cable news

865
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,260
didn't solidify people.

866
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,020
Didn't send people down these specific paths.

867
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
Yeah, as much.

868
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,700
So people probably had more stray opinions.

869
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,380
People got to have their own unique anger cocktails.

870
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,660
Yes, exactly. Yeah.

871
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,420
Yeah, versus whatever Gutfeld is saying.

872
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,700
Grousing and complaining about things

873
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,420
is a fine American pastime.

874
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,980
But I think when everyone started living

875
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,900
in their own distinct realities, it became a problem.

876
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,540
Yeah, it seems like Bill here, who's Matt,

877
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,180
who's worried that they're gonna ban diaper changing.

878
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,060
You know, he's out in the park and he seems like

879
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,620
he's got a pleasant girlfriend who disagrees with him

880
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,460
on this issue, but they still like,

881
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,060
and she says, but you know what, he doesn't,

882
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,740
he's courteous with the smoke.

883
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,620
And even though we disagree on this,

884
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,460
this couple I'm reading about as Disneyland bans

885
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,460
or restricts to smoking areas, this is what he's,

886
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,100
this is, it's odd to say, this is like,

887
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,980
he's mad that they might, like, what if they make diapers

888
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,940
be changed in specific areas?

889
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,620
It's like, well, they kind of are.

890
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,940
Yeah. But usually.

891
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,500
Not always. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,860
Sometimes accidents happen, but there are these things

893
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,540
called bathrooms that are specific areas.

894
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,540
With changing tables, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

895
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,820
But he is correct, however, when he says,

896
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,300
where does it stop?

897
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,300
This is a slippery slope that happens.

898
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,300
And slippery slopes usually apply to evil arguments.

899
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,660
Yeah, yeah. To stop any incremental progress

900
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,180
from being made on anything.

901
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,300
It's kind of interesting seeing a slippery slope thing

902
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,220
happen on something that's like for the public health,

903
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,380
but not necessarily a good and evil.

904
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,220
And he's right.

905
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,260
Where did it stop?

906
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,620
It stopped with, now you can't smoke at Disneyland anymore.

907
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,860
So Bill was right.

908
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,820
Right. How old do you think Bill was back?

909
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,780
Does it say? 57.

910
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,620
Oh, you said it, okay.

911
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,100
It says the Los Angeles Times.

912
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,500
So Bill is, if he's alive, maybe he lived to see

913
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,940
what he was afraid of, and then it didn't end up, yeah.

914
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,220
Or Bill quit smoking, maybe.

915
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Possibly, yes.

916
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,540
Maybe the societal change, yeah, where does it stop?

917
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,060
It stops right in here, he says, pointing to his heart.

918
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,300
Yeah, it did.

919
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,060
They gradually got rid of it.

920
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,780
I wonder if the people, when they started doing it,

921
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,220
that was, I mean, I guess that is how

922
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,740
incremental legislation happens, really, in the government,

923
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,100
is it starts here, and we'll get here,

924
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,660
and we'll get here eventually.

925
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,420
We have Obamacare, we couldn't get

926
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,860
the universal health care, it's because it's incremental,

927
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,300
and it's gonna be a slow walk to get to universal health care.

928
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,660
That's what we were told.

929
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,500
Yeah.

930
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
But I'm just saying, we're still walking.

931
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,660
It was this guy, Joe Lieber.

932
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,620
It was mostly a scumbag from New England.

933
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,020
It's the Mitt Romney health plan

934
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,700
from when he was governor, yes.

935
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,060
But, so I guess that makes sense that you start smaller.

936
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,700
Boy, don't you wish on a lot of these things

937
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,300
that the slopes were a lot more slippery?

938
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,140
Certain slopes.

939
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,980
Oh, yeah.

940
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,420
Boy, I wish we were slipping and sliding.

941
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,860
Were so slippery.

942
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,580
Flat walls would be nice.

943
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,620
It would be, yeah, straight, yeah.

944
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,500
I think smoking got done pretty quickly

945
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,500
because of the demonstrably clear health problems

946
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,180
that come from it, and that it smells like shit,

947
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,580
and it's nasty.

948
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,740
It's like really nasty.

949
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,180
Yes, I think that is what, sort of the public consciousness

950
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,660
was just like, yeah.

951
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,860
It took a couple years for it to fully happen,

952
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,220
but everyone was like, yeah.

953
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,540
More people agree with, yeah, and I think it's more possible

954
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,260
to enjoy your own cigarette that you were smoking

955
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,140
than someone else's.

956
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,660
You're not expecting it.

957
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,500
Oh, yeah.

958
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,340
Much more likely to say it.

959
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,700
I understand smoking is occasionally like a little pick-up,

960
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,540
you know, and it's relaxing.

961
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,380
It's meditative.

962
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,580
It's a repetitive action.

963
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,980
I said before, I liked when I managed to ride

964
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,060
smoking one cigarette a month, it was kind of nice.

965
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,100
It was a nice, I ended this, but I was always worried

966
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,540
from what you're saying, Jason,

967
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,580
there's so much fear-mongering.

968
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,180
I'm like, when is the part where I get hopelessly addicted?

969
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,340
Isn't that what just happens?

970
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,860
That's going to happen.

971
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,940
And my whole career, I kept it at that one a month.

972
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,780
Yeah.

973
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,500
Maybe it was more like one a week at some point,

974
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,980
but it went slippery slope.

975
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,820
Where does it stop?

976
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,660
Then it became more hard.

977
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,500
Now I don't do it anymore.

978
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,140
What was the year that you cut it off?

979
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,460
I don't even remember.

980
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,100
Oh, so it was over a decade?

981
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,780
Probably.

982
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,260
Not over a decade, but I don't know, late 2010s?

983
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,340
When was the last cigarette you had?

984
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,220
Yesterday.

985
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,020
Oh, wow, you prepared for the episode?

986
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,420
And you're calling it nasty.

987
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,500
Interesting. It is nasty.

988
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,660
Oh, it's so gross.

989
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,860
And then you got all this ash and the little.

990
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,700
From the pack.

991
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,540
Butts.

992
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,380
From the pack.

993
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,220
The special pack.

994
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,300
What kind?

995
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,140
Parliaments.

996
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,060
Is it a special pack?

997
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,820
Yeah, you have a special pack you go to once in a while.

998
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,740
Because I went to a wedding a while back,

999
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,740
and sometimes I took one to take.

1000
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,860
Because sometimes it's like a social thing to do.

1001
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,300
If you're out there, you offer someone one.

1002
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,860
It gives you a chance to get away.

1003
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,540
If it's too noisy or it's a little overwhelmed.

1004
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,380
That's true.

1005
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,540
That's a nice thing about it.

1006
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,460
I feel like the whole.

1007
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,460
I mean, the entire time that I smoked, still very sparingly,

1008
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,180
it felt like it was always about getting away,

1009
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,980
getting outside, taking a little break.

1010
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,820
Yeah.

1011
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,820
So realizing that people were mad about smoking areas,

1012
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,860
I almost found odd because.

1013
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,300
Oh, I thought that was part of it though,

1014
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,220
was like it's a chance to step outside.

1015
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,740
And well, to get some fresh air

1016
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,780
and then get some nuts of fresh air.

1017
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,340
But I guess I, you'll sense my naivete a couple times

1018
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
as we talk about this.

1019
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,540
But the idea that people were mad about smoking areas,

1020
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,220
but don't you want, isn't that part of it?

1021
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,260
You don't want to be like smoking indoors is unpleasant,

1022
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,100
right?

1023
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,940
But it wasn't too, a lot of people.

1024
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,780
Really bad.

1025
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,780
Yeah, no, smoking indoors is really nasty.

1026
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,100
A lot of parts of Vegas where it's like,

1027
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,140
oh, it kind of sucks in here.

1028
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,980
Yes, yeah.

1029
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,660
I think so, but I don't think everybody feels that way.

1030
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,020
No, and I think they've invested in like

1031
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,140
the most expensive air filtration you can get.

1032
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,700
So it just sucks everything.

1033
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,420
It smells stale in Vegas though.

1034
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
It smells a little stale.

1035
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,180
I'll say this, in college I did not,

1037
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,580
I mean, I've smoked maybe three cigarettes in my life.

1038
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,380
But in college you would go to the bars

1039
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,940
and it wasn't like after,

1040
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,300
like after 30 minutes you get used to it.

1041
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,740
After 30 minutes you kind of were like,

1042
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,900
yeah, that's the smell of partying.

1043
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,500
Like that's the, it's a house party at an apartment.

1044
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,020
And it wasn't like something where I would be like

1045
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,700
thinking about it the whole time.

1046
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,540
Sure.

1047
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,300
Because all of a sudden you would just get used to it.

1048
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,140
Yeah.

1049
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,580
So it wasn't like when it wasn't on the table

1050
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,900
to ban everything, I was like,

1051
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,660
this must go away or anything.

1052
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,420
But yeah, again, in hindsight it's like, yeah, of course.

1053
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,660
Yeah, probably, yeah, better than not, I suppose.

1054
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,900
But here's what I was starting to get at was, okay,

1055
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,580
so it's a movement that really takes root through the 80s,

1056
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,940
big restrictions in restaurants start coming into play

1057
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,820
in late 80s, 95 California bans smoking

1058
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,980
in enclosed workspaces.

1059
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,180
And that equals restaurants,

1060
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,020
exceptions just for like it's a tobacco store.

1061
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,580
So we gotta be able to smoke in here, right?

1062
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,780
Cigar shop or whatever.

1063
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,260
I, and I don't know if you guys know the number,

1064
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,780
but did you have any sense of when did you think

1065
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,540
Disneyland started the smoking areas?

1066
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,340
And instead of you can just smoke

1067
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,020
as you walk around this place.

1068
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,500
Did you know before you looked into it,

1069
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,340
did you have a sense?

1070
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,180
Yeah, I did not know.

1071
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,060
Or do you know what now?

1072
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,100
No, no, I didn't know before.

1073
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,460
You're saying before the research for the episode.

1074
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,300
Yeah, no, I didn't know.

1075
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,780
I didn't know that like when they stopped selling tobacco,

1076
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,060
I didn't, maybe we even talked about that and I forgot,

1077
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,700
but that's kind of shocking to me too.

1078
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,500
Well, there was a cigar shop at Disney Springs

1079
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,100
that closed like a month ago.

1080
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,940
Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure.

1081
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,780
Really?

1082
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,860
That was pretty popular.

1083
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,700
But no, I didn't know.

1084
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,820
I either didn't know or forgot all of this.

1085
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,620
Yeah, did you?

1086
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,460
Because I don't know.

1087
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,300
I was just like, maybe it's late 80s, early 90s

1088
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,140
was my guess.

1089
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,500
Did you have any sense of it, Jason?

1090
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I looked at a 99 map and the graphic wasn't good enough.

1091
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,820
And from what I could tell,

1092
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,780
I forget which park I was looking at.

1093
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,620
I don't think I saw any smoking area signs

1094
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,100
because I feel like it was still the vibe of like,

1095
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,780
all right, as long as you're outside.

1096
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,220
Yeah, because they had the not indoor policy.

1097
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,660
You can do it on the rides and it's in the safety spiels.

1098
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,940
But this does not happen officially

1099
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,340
in the Disney parks until 2000.

1100
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,580
2000 is when, the beginning of 2000

1101
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,940
is when there are smoking areas.

1102
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,780
I don't know if I'm naive or anything,

1103
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,100
that makes sense on the timeline to me.

1104
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,020
But I truly was like,

1105
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,900
because I'm looking at park maps in the 90s and like,

1106
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,420
all right, where's the first smoking area?

1107
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,060
And I don't find them for a little while.

1108
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,420
Sure enough, not till 2000.

1109
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,260
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1110
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,860
I, for some reason, yeah,

1111
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,580
thought they stopped selling like tobacco on Main Street.

1112
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,380
And I mean, in Disney World, they stopped in the 80s,

1113
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,380
but they didn't stop in Disneyland until 90 or 91.

1114
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,460
91, the tobacconist.

1115
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,300
Right.

1116
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,820
And it's one of the first things on Main Street.

1117
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,660
Yeah.

1118
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,260
You walk into the park and it's one of the first things.

1119
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,220
91 feels crazy to me.

1120
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,060
Yeah, really.

1121
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,260
Even though that's, you know, 30s a long time ago.

1122
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,020
But, and even after that, they're still selling,

1123
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,020
you can buy cigarettes in the park somewhere.

1124
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,340
I couldn't begin to tell you where.

1125
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,580
It's not like this is the most documented thing,

1126
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,860
but more discreetly.

1127
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,060
They're not putting up big signs,

1128
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,220
but maybe it's like you're going to buy some,

1129
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,180
some film or some suntan lotion

1130
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,420
and there happen to be cigarettes there too.

1131
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,300
Certainly at hotel gift shops.

1132
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,140
Sure.

1133
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,980
For a long time.

1134
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,820
Yeah.

1135
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,020
It all happens later at the hotels.

1136
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,860
Yeah.

1137
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,820
Definitely.

1138
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,140
You could have lit up a cigarette

1139
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,260
walking down Main Street.

1140
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,980
Well, that's what we talked about before.

1141
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,140
Where would you want to do it?

1142
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,980
Right?

1143
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,500
I think we had this conversation.

1144
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,340
Yeah.

1145
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,180
And I said, I want pirates.

1146
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,020
I want to light a cigarette up on Pirates of the Caribbean.

1147
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,540
Not a jewel because of course we saw the man,

1148
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,820
that's a story of five.

1149
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,740
The story strikes back on this one

1150
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,260
where we went through the whatever Barbosa thing.

1151
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,860
And the guy lit up a strawberry plume.

1152
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,620
A big plume for Barossa.

1153
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,580
A strawberry vape plume into the mist.

1154
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,420
Which.

1155
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,240
Good spot.

1156
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,900
It is kind of, it was annoying,

1157
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,020
but also you're like, it's kind of funny.

1158
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,860
It's kind of funny.

1159
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,820
It did smell like a little,

1160
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,980
like a wet candy store for a while.

1161
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,540
Yeah, it did smell like great or anything,

1162
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,940
but yeah, yeah.

1163
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,500
That was a real, and the guy made a big show of it.

1164
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,460
It was like head back.

1165
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,340
Like he did a full, like he's a caterpillar,

1166
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,420
on Alice in Wonderland.

1167
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,140
That'd be another place to do it potentially,

1168
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,420
is to do it kind of along with the caterpillar.

1169
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,380
Oh, that would be great.

1170
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,220
Yeah.

1171
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,040
Maybe that's my answer.

1172
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,540
Although it's just smoking a cigarette

1173
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,020
next to a big cartoon hookah is pretty stupid.

1174
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,640
If you, if you, Alice, cause Alice goes outside.

1175
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,260
So if you can light up as you go outside

1176
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,180
and finish it on the way down and tamp it out.

1177
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,020
Before you get inside.

1178
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,900
Flick it into the line.

1179
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,740
Yeah.

1180
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,580
Yeah.

1181
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,860
You could, if you, in the old smoking area by Big Thunder,

1182
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,260
where they thought you were going to be lining up

1183
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,300
to go into Galaxy's Edge,

1184
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,960
if you could smoke a death stick there, that would be ideal.

1185
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,800
Sure.

1186
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,780
Wow, that's leaving money on the table.

1187
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,620
Yeah.

1188
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,580
That is, they could be set like, no, it's not a cigarette.

1189
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,220
And actually California has no rules against death sticks.

1190
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,380
No rules against death sticks.

1191
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,220
No.

1192
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,740
Yeah, Doc Andar could be really giving you

1193
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,860
like parliament style death sticks.

1194
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:20,060
And then smoking gets so much more popular again.

1195
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,140
It spins out of Galaxy's Edge.

1196
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,980
Oh man.

1197
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,380
It becomes, it's their butter beer.

1198
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,300
The milk didn't quite become their butter beer.

1199
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,580
I think death sticks would have been.

1200
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,700
They never marketed, they should have marketed on Pinocchio,

1201
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,180
the cigars for when the donkey boys are smoking.

1202
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,020
Sure.

1203
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,340
They should be selling Cruella De Ville's long smoking,

1204
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,180
like penguin style cigarette holder.

1205
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,940
And there should be a pop-up booth in that marketplace

1206
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,180
for Sleaze Bagan-O.

1207
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,020
Sleaze, of course.

1208
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,860
Yeah.

1209
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,700
What's his name?

1210
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,540
What's his first name?

1211
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,380
Is it Sleaze Bago?

1212
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,200
Is it?

1213
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,040
Is it a character in our worst.

1214
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,700
This is a character who offers Obi-Wan death sticks

1215
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,340
in the second prequel.

1216
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,180
Yeah.

1217
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,820
And then what's the other really on the nose one

1218
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,580
where isn't there a character named like Lot Dodd?

1219
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,980
Lot Dodd, yeah, in the Senate, Imperial Senate.

1220
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,780
Because it's John Lott and Chris Dodd.

1221
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,380
Because he's mad at our current do nothing senator,

1222
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,700
or corrupt to do nothing senator.

1223
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,540
Senator Lot Dodd, yes.

1224
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,780
Not as good as Senator Grubb-Leibs.

1225
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,600
No.

1226
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,740
He seems like a force.

1227
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,780
He's on top of it.

1228
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,060
Yeah, he's one of the good ones.

1229
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,540
He's about grubb-leibs.

1230
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,360
Yeah.

1231
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,200
And healing.

1232
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,020
Yeah.

1233
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,100
But no, Lot Dodd is bad.

1234
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,860
I, where, I still, I don't know,

1235
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,420
I forget if I answered before where,

1236
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,220
but you know what I'm thinking though is Mark Twain.

1237
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,380
Mark, like, that'd be pretty sweet.

1238
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,220
Yeah.

1239
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,660
There's a smoking deck on the Mark Twain.

1240
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,500
Sure.

1241
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,060
I bet it was acceptable.

1242
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,580
I don't, I bet it was,

1243
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,660
did the rule become not on indoor rides,

1244
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,860
but fully outdoor rides?

1245
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,780
Could you smoke on the train?

1246
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,460
I don't think you could smoke on rides ever.

1247
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,300
Yeah, I don't think they were.

1248
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,140
There's no confirmation of that.

1249
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,300
Just do it like operational.

1250
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,140
I think so.

1251
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:54,960
Yeah.

1252
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,800
I couldn't find anything about that.

1253
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,100
Yeah, it was for sure always inside and on rides

1254
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,300
you couldn't that were indoors, but I don't think so.

1255
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,420
This is an angle of research I didn't do

1256
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,740
is like looking at old, like warnings on the signs.

1257
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,580
Oh, right.

1258
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,260
Like when did, like was it ever spoken?

1259
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,660
It feels to me like you did not get

1260
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,300
on the Disneyland railroad in August of 1955

1261
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,060
and see any sign telling you not to smoke.

1262
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,940
It might've been understood that you shouldn't

1263
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,660
because it's a ride, but doesn't that feel like

1264
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,540
there would not have been like the circle and the cross?

1265
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,900
Yeah, that's interesting.

1266
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,980
I feel like they would have, yeah,

1267
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,080
they would have had to say not to do it.

1268
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,820
They would have had to put something there.

1269
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,500
When was the first non, I wish I had that info.

1270
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,060
When did you start seeing non-smoking signs?

1271
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,940
They would have to have done it at a certain point.

1272
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,500
All of it, do you think there was,

1273
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,940
when I bet it was something legal that caused

1274
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,220
any theme park to have to say pregnant women should not ride.

1275
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,100
There's no way that was in place in 1955, right?

1276
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,580
That's a good question too.

1277
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,420
Yeah.

1278
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,780
Were there even signs?

1279
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,420
Well, in 55, was there anything that the pregnant woman

1280
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,940
should not ride because it's too rough?

1281
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,780
Oh, maybe there wasn't.

1282
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,620
I don't know what it was.

1283
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,900
What would have been the first, like Matterhorn?

1284
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,140
Yeah, I think maybe Matterhorn.

1285
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,620
So we gotta find the first Matterhorn sign.

1286
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,100
We were looking at all this stuff.

1287
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,820
We were looking yesterday or two days ago

1288
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,280
of just restrictions for babies, one-year-olds,

1289
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,260
to get on the rides, which of course you've looked at.

1290
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,740
And I'm like, yeah, a baby can go on Pirates.

1291
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,940
A baby can go on Haunted Mansion.

1292
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,820
A baby can go on so many things.

1293
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,960
Yeah.

1294
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,940
So I'm like, oh yeah, I guess there's really still

1295
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,700
not a ton of things that are really even that restricted.

1296
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,980
Yeah, it's just anything shaky.

1297
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,500
Anything that shakes you around.

1298
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,660
Shakes and goes more than like two miles an hour.

1299
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,460
Yeah, well, no, I mean, there's the dark,

1300
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,740
or fantasy land dark rides.

1301
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,100
Do they go to more than two?

1302
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,260
I would think that'd be like two and a half.

1303
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,980
Maybe one of them at top speed.

1304
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,820
Yeah.

1305
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,480
Maybe, maybe a Toad.

1306
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,320
Yeah.

1307
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,160
I don't know.

1308
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,060
Then you just, then your biggest hurdle with baby

1309
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,380
is just the scariness factor.

1310
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,820
Speaking from I have not tried Pirates,

1311
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,180
I bet he could do Pirates now.

1312
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,260
Yeah, I don't know.

1313
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,340
Toad was a disaster.

1314
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,180
Toad was pretty bad.

1315
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,140
At what age?

1316
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,220
Two.

1317
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,060
Okay.

1318
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:08,880
Yeah.

1319
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,720
Cause one, they don't know what's going on a lot.

1320
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,560
So.

1321
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,620
Yeah, you might want to take advantage of that

1322
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,740
while you can.

1323
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,300
Yeah, one I feel like is like, oh wow, what is going on?

1324
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,100
And then two is when it's like, oh my God,

1325
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,940
what have you done to me?

1326
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1327
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,020
The humanity opinions.

1328
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,860
Yeah.

1329
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,140
Small world seems good for one year olds,

1330
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,300
lots of colors, a pleasant song.

1331
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,500
The biggest, the issue with small world is it's long.

1332
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,860
Long and you're stuck.

1333
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1334
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,020
So you, God, do I know,

1335
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,980
did Wallinor maybe get stuck on?

1336
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,300
I feel like I know somebody who got stuck on small world.

1337
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,860
Or no, Chris Cantwell maybe.

1338
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,620
So I feel like there was a breakdown.

1339
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,740
Breakdown with baby is a bad.

1340
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,420
That seems, yeah, that you just put it

1341
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,260
in the center of my heart.

1342
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,580
If it's happening, yeah, yeah.

1343
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,220
Cause it can be on something perfectly pleasant.

1344
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,460
It's not like it's, you're like,

1345
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,020
we're dangling 40 feet in the air.

1346
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,020
I think a breakdown anywhere if pee or food is not

1347
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,540
taken care of.

1348
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,180
You can bring a baby on a runway or railway.

1349
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,020
No.

1350
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,860
I really don't.

1351
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,300
There's no, there's not even like a real,

1352
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,540
like a, they're no requirement.

1353
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,780
Well, so.

1354
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,380
I think the other thing would just be being considerate.

1355
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,220
Like pirates, you're surrounded by people.

1356
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,100
Haunted Mansion, your party would at least be

1357
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,500
in its own capsule and its own doom bugging.

1358
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,140
You're saying I should be considering

1359
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,540
not bringing a baby on pirates,

1360
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,180
but I could do it on Haunted Mansion.

1361
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,820
I mean, Haunted Mansion sound will travel.

1362
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,300
So you're rolling the dice either way.

1363
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,060
But pirates, you have that long boat.

1364
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,380
There's like 20, 30 people in one of those.

1365
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,500
That's true. You're right.

1366
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,320
It's true.

1367
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,940
But I, you would not be the first person

1368
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,060
to be inconsiderate at Disneyland.

1369
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:44,900
Yeah.

1370
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,900
I, you know, I, we'll have to see what she's like

1371
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,020
in three months.

1372
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,860
We'll have to see what's going on.

1373
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,860
Are you going for it?

1374
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,980
That seems like your plan.

1375
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,940
Yeah, we're going with her at a year.

1376
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,780
Wow, wow.

1377
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,420
And it's, you know, it's for, it's for us.

1378
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,260
It's for her to take a photo with Pooh Bear and Mickey.

1379
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,060
And yeah, but yeah, we're thinking about what,

1380
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,300
we'll take her on one or two things.

1381
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,140
Storybook boats, I guess.

1382
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,980
Yeah.

1383
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,800
Oh, that's good.

1384
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,640
Yeah.

1385
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,480
Yeah. And that's exciting.

1386
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,180
Very free.

1387
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,020
She's packed.

1388
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,840
Oh, she's free.

1389
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,680
She's free.

1390
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,520
Yes.

1391
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,340
She is free because she's under three.

1392
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,180
It's practically another backpack at that age, you know?

1393
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,020
Yes.

1394
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,840
So we're gonna have to pay.

1395
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,680
They're like, bring him in, let him in.

1396
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,520
Come on.

1397
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,620
We do not have to pay.

1398
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,580
Here's this, here's this bad boy,

1399
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,460
this bad dad state that I'm at

1400
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,780
because my son is three now.

1401
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,020
I haven't talked about this in the show.

1402
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,860
But I am currently seeing how far I can get

1403
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,060
without paying for it.

1404
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,980
Because three is pretty much at every theme park

1405
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,380
when you're supposed to start.

1406
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,220
Right.

1407
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,180
Even like universal.

1408
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,940
He does not have an annual pass.

1409
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,780
He needs to have an annual pass to get in.

1410
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,420
So I am seeing how many months I can eke out.

1411
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,500
And I'm really curious,

1412
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,500
what does that confrontation feel like?

1413
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,500
When is the point where, sorry, how old is he?

1414
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,340
Oh, two.

1415
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,780
No, he's not.

1416
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,980
Does that happen?

1417
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,500
How long do they take?

1418
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:05,540
Well, he's a father.

1419
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,180
He couldn't also be a lawyer.

1420
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,260
My family did that too.

1421
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,100
For how long?

1422
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,180
Until you were 10?

1423
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,900
No, for my little brother.

1424
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,660
I think my mom was like, if anyone asks, he's two and a half.

1425
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,620
And I was just like, well, you told us not to lie.

1426
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,820
What do I do here?

1427
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,260
It presents a real, I know.

1428
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,300
My boy is proud that he's three also.

1429
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,900
I don't wanna present him with some situation

1430
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,380
where he's told that he's not three.

1431
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,220
Exactly.

1432
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,300
There's a protocol.

1433
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,420
Because believe me, you're not the only person doing this.

1434
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,860
So there must be something where maybe they say,

1435
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,900
and this is a guess, they go, look, if the kid looks five,

1436
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,140
you have to say something or you bring the manager.

1437
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,140
Maybe there's something like that where it's like.

1438
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,580
Oh, if they go to get some,

1439
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,100
if they start the process of going, get somebody, I'm out.

1440
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,260
I bet there's something like that where it's like,

1441
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,980
you gotta be pretty sure the kid ain't under three.

1442
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,660
And then it's a whole protocol of like manager,

1443
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,660
somebody, we bring in the heavy to do.

1444
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,900
It's gotta be manager, assistant manager.

1445
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,740
So they're not letting entry level people

1446
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,420
like start confrontations with guests.

1447
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,340
I bet there are six flags.

1448
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,780
Oh, maybe.

1449
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,180
Well, the managers are.

1450
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,380
Oh yeah, they're working.

1451
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,540
The entry level is 15 and the managers are 16.

1452
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,060
They won't push to charge until you're like 11.

1453
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,100
Yeah.

1454
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,500
How old is that five foot two inch kid over there?

1455
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,580
Three.

1456
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,540
Sounds good.

1457
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,820
Just buy a horrible slice of pizza and a Mr. Pib.

1458
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,340
We won't ask any questions.

1459
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,300
Pib or Pib extra.

1460
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,100
Light bribery, I'm fully in on.

1461
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:44,940
That's fun.

1462
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,180
It's called Pib now, Jason.

1463
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,020
Oh, Pib.

1464
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,340
No longer Pib, right?

1465
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,740
Pib and Pib extra.

1466
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,740
What's the difference?

1467
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,580
I don't know.

1468
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,420
I should know that.

1469
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,020
So I guess we can't gender our sodas anymore.

1470
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,300
Guess what?

1471
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,380
Guess what's next?

1472
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,820
What's the next six pack?

1473
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,220
I'm taken to the shooting range.

1474
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,060
Well.

1475
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,900
So long, Pib.

1476
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,460
Mr. Pib, I will still call you.

1477
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,380
I know what you are.

1478
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,580
That was the sand is everyone.

1479
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,140
Just cause no one knows what he sounds like.

1480
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,220
Just making sure you know what we're doing.

1481
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,580
But you know what he looks like and it's weird.

1482
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,420
Yeah, yeah.

1483
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,260
He's very nerdy.

1484
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,580
He did not look normal.

1485
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,420
Yes.

1486
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,740
Bad neck.

1487
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,860
Scott, you know, the,

1488
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,260
there was articles going around a while back

1489
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,380
cause there was, I think a world health organization study

1490
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,860
of like, well, the,

1491
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,940
one of the most dangerous substances is alcohol.

1492
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,460
Like it does shave years off some people's lives.

1493
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,380
It makes people addicts.

1494
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,860
So you're right to be upset

1495
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,660
at someone having a beer at 11 a.m.

1496
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,500
I get it.

1497
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,340
I get it, Jason.

1498
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,180
I agree.

1499
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,060
They're perverts.

1500
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,180
It's less cut and dry than smoking

1501
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,860
because there's also all the studies

1502
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,380
that come out every few years where it's like,

1503
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,660
oh, a glass of wine a day,

1504
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,340
a couple of glass of wine a week.

1505
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,380
It's good for your health.

1506
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,500
That's five years.

1507
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,740
And so like, it's like egg yolks.

1508
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,020
They're always changing their mind

1509
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,380
if they're good or bad for you.

1510
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,220
But like

1511
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,380
Couple of Jurassic waters a week.

1512
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,780
Yeah, couple of Jurassic waters.

1513
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,620
Great for your wallet.

1514
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,660
I mean, I think,

1515
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,380
I think it's probably bad for you to drink.

1516
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,780
That's seemingly more studies confirm that.

1517
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,020
But the whole thing is just that like,

1518
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,180
you're not like shooting the alcohol out of your mouth

1519
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,500
into someone else's mouth.

1520
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,340
Well, that, yeah.

1521
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,900
And it's not like going directly.

1522
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,340
You're not injecting it into your liver.

1523
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,180
Yeah.

1524
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,300
I'm just saying it's not affecting anyone around.

1525
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,140
That's true.

1526
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,980
Necessarily unless you're belligerent or something.

1527
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,460
It's around a great time.

1528
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,460
Or some spitting like a fountain.

1529
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,700
Who wants some?

1530
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,540
Yeah.

1531
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,180
If you were shooting alcohol out of your ears

1532
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,620
and it was like getting kids' mouths and stuff.

1533
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,660
I follow a few Vegas like websites and blogs

1534
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,420
about like new attractions and casinos and stuff like that.

1535
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,580
And all of the fucking nerd commenters are like,

1536
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,980
ooh, this pot too stinky.

1537
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,700
Like Vegas, Vegas smells now.

1538
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,740
Everyone's just complaining about how it's stinky.

1539
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,660
And this just comes to mind because thinking about like,

1540
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,620
wait, like you said,

1541
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,820
Vegas smells stale in a lot of places

1542
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,100
because of like old booze and cigarettes.

1543
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,940
And that is another battle front where.

1544
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,580
Stinky weed?

1545
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,980
Cities out of legal eyes.

1546
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,260
People complained like there's articles in the New York

1547
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,060
or the Atlantic and granted they're by cranks,

1548
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,420
but it's just like, well,

1549
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,100
everyone in New York stoned all the time now.

1550
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,580
And it's like now in New York City, just now they're stoned.

1551
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,260
But you're saying you're following like young influencer types

1552
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,220
and they're cranky about the stinky weed.

1553
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,060
Just general news blogs.

1554
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,340
And the blogs are always making cracks about like,

1555
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,580
well, you can't walk down the street without smelling it.

1556
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,660
Is it legal to smoke weed on the strip?

1557
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,460
Legal enough.

1558
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,980
I mean, you can get it off strip.

1559
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,860
There's no dispensaries on the strip.

1560
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,300
Is it legal to have a table

1561
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,500
that's a former three card Monte table

1562
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,860
and to be selling fake.

1563
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,860
In Vegas, fake weed in Vegas.

1564
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,620
I mean, the one website was just complaining

1565
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,100
about like the hot dog guys.

1566
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,980
Like, so.

1567
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,300
So the next battlefront here is like outdoor weeds smelling.

1568
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,140
Yes.

1569
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,260
I guess.

1570
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,820
And if you don't like stinky weed,

1571
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,660
you're a nerd in a crank.

1572
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,500
Yeah.

1573
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,580
It's people complaining about stuff where it's like,

1574
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,860
do you think people have not smoked weed

1575
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,580
in New York City for eons?

1576
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,980
Well, that's if they're all high.

1577
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,820
I don't know.

1578
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,300
I'm trying to think if I've,

1579
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,820
I guess in some parts of California,

1580
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,060
you do like feel like the smell is everywhere.

1581
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,420
Yeah.

1582
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,260
And I guess, I don't know.

1583
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,660
I guess I know it doesn't bother me too much.

1584
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,900
Scott, does it bother you?

1585
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,740
I don't know.

1586
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,780
It depends on how stinky I guess.

1587
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,900
Yeah. I guess if it's really.

1588
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,820
I haven't hit my stink limits.

1589
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,660
Yeah.

1590
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,500
Is there a stink that even when we.

1591
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,540
But that's a DeSantis thing too.

1592
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,260
That's why it came to mind.

1593
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,260
Someone asked him about like legalization in Florida.

1594
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,060
He's like, oh, it's so stinky.

1595
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,900
Did he say that?

1596
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,740
Did he say the word stinky?

1597
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,580
Did he say stanky?

1598
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,020
Why this needs, you can't throw that out

1599
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,860
and then have that not be true.

1600
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,820
I gotta find.

1601
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,660
I gotta find it.

1602
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,740
He said stinky.

1603
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,100
Did he say stinky?

1604
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,940
I think about the smell.

1605
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,500
And the reporter was trying to steer back like

1606
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,940
there would be billions of dollars

1607
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,060
in additional tax revenue for the state.

1608
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,820
And he was just like, oh, it smells so bad.

1609
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,700
You're in the pocket of big stink.

1610
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,540
Yeah.

1611
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,700
I looked to find this quote.

1612
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,540
I need this quote.

1613
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,380
I need it, yeah.

1614
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,100
I'm gonna get back on track to the smoking stuff.

1615
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,180
Okay, so it's 2000, we have smoking areas

1616
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,060
and here's what it is at the start.

1617
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,660
It is, you can do it outside the main gate.

1618
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,500
Who cares?

1619
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,420
Of course you can.

1620
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,740
You can do it Big Thunder Trail as we've talked about.

1621
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,020
Here's one we haven't talked about.

1622
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,620
The Spanish fountain near the entrance

1623
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,140
to the haunted mansion.

1624
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,260
You'd be around that fountain.

1625
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,100
That sounds pleasant.

1626
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,940
That sounds good, yeah.

1627
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,180
A little trickle of water.

1628
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,260
Splitter splatter.

1629
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,100
Are you sorry?

1630
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,380
Do you have a stinky quote?

1631
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,220
No, I don't.

1632
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,380
I'm just trying to find the map, sorry,

1633
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,620
of what you're talking about.

1634
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,460
Okay, sure.

1635
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,300
Sorry, I didn't mean to distract you.

1636
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,900
No, okay, no, I think the word was putrid, not stinky.

1637
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,740
What I don't like about it.

1638
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,500
Not the same, putrid is functional.

1639
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,620
What I don't like about it is if you go

1640
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,460
to some of these places that have done it,

1641
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,260
the stench when you're out there,

1642
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,340
I mean, it smells so putrid.

1643
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,060
I want people to be able to breathe freely.

1644
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,220
I don't know that he does.

1645
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,060
No, he doesn't want that.

1646
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,420
He wants people to choke?

1647
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,260
Choke, yeah.

1648
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,540
I think he wants a lot of people to choke.

1649
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,220
Well, that's true.

1650
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:43,140
And then there's one on the walkway leading

1651
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,020
to the Disneyland railway station in Tomorrowland.

1652
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:49,540
So it might've been under, that's like former Skyway.

1653
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,820
That's what happens to a lot of these.

1654
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,220
The ride goes away, we have this awkward little area,

1655
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,740
maybe that becomes a smoking area.

1656
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,140
And I dock them points for that.

1657
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,180
If all you do is open up a place where there used

1658
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,900
to be a ride and now it's people smoking,

1659
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,340
that's not much. Yeah, that's not good.

1660
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,380
But I'm trying to fit, something we haven't,

1661
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,100
we're talking about policies and calibrating

1662
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,500
our feelings about things and stinkinesses.

1663
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:19,300
Well, I think we need to analyze the smoking areas

1664
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,620
from are these good Disneyland,

1665
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,940
were these good Disneyland themed experiences?

1666
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,900
Right, right. Yeah.

1667
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,580
And I don't think it's across the board.

1668
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,660
And it's hard, look, these were not the most documented.

1669
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,380
People went in to smoke and then left.

1670
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,100
I don't think people are taking beautiful photos

1671
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,940
in these places.

1672
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,700
But did you guys get the sense that any smoking area

1673
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,580
out there was a good Disneyland themed experience?

1674
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,740
Well, that's a good question.

1675
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,340
I mean, there's like, for instance,

1676
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,420
but the one by the Matterhorn,

1677
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,740
there is a sign that I do give them credit for.

1678
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,580
I don't know if you found this.

1679
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,420
I think I'm looking at the same thing.

1680
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,260
Are you looking at the same sign?

1681
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,100
It's kind of a fantasy land story book sign.

1682
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,620
Yes, that's the sign I'm looking at.

1683
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,980
Like would be outside the Snow White, right?

1684
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,620
It looks like you could take it off the wall

1685
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,340
and Link could use it as a shield

1686
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,300
in one of his adventures in Zelda.

1687
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,260
Absolutely.

1688
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,180
It does, it's well themed.

1689
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,660
And I feel like it,

1690
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,900
cause it's right by the Matterhorn,

1691
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,620
it does fit that, it fits that aesthetic really well.

1692
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,460
Nice sign.

1693
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,300
So I feel like smoking around there,

1694
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,340
at the very least you would go,

1695
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,380
oh, they made a little effort to make me feel,

1696
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,900
to make my smoking area transport me somewhere.

1697
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,980
There's also, I'm gonna bring a California adventure one

1698
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,660
into the picture here.

1699
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,020
I think they initially,

1700
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,060
I get a lot of these tried to make it a bit subtle.

1701
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,340
And here's one I will show you

1702
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,260
that's in the Grizzly Peak area.

1703
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,980
And here is a nice piece of redwood,

1704
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,180
probably fake redwood,

1705
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,180
but it looks nice kind of like a naturally,

1706
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,140
that's not a square sign or a perfect circle.

1707
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,580
That's just like an odd shaped piece of bark.

1708
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,340
And then there's a yellow cigarette and a circle

1709
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,180
and an arrow saying to go this way.

1710
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,300
And that's like, that's a little,

1711
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,820
that's like how they're trying to not say the name

1712
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,900
of smugglers run.

1713
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,580
Now, so you feel like it's just like an actual

1714
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,180
shipping dock or whatever that is.

1715
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,580
Issue is probably too subtle.

1716
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,260
Probably you can't, it's pretty easy to miss.

1717
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,380
And if you're looking for where can I smoke around here

1718
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,580
and you don't find the small piece of bark.

1719
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,100
Yeah, you would have to be like a mice chat reader

1720
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,100
to know about this.

1721
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,940
So you'd have to really be in.

1722
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,380
That is literally from Mouse Planet.

1723
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,540
Yeah, yeah, you'd have to Mouseworks or whatever.

1724
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,180
Yeah, you would have to know to know,

1725
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,780
which I guess if we were smokers

1726
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,700
and also people that read the blogs,

1727
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,940
that would be like, hey, come on, check this out.

1728
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,780
I bet you didn't know this was a smoking section over here.

1729
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,580
So it would have been a cool thing to do.

1730
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,660
That little grizzly peak alcove,

1731
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,420
I think probably one of the more themed ones.

1732
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,740
But I think the stuff that links a lot of them together

1733
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:55,700
is they're kind of little quiet little areas off to the side.

1734
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,380
And I think eventually they were probably getting people

1735
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,180
going like, hey, I really like this quiet area

1736
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,620
off to the side, could you get rid of the cigarette smoke?

1737
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,740
Could this be a place for exhausted parents

1738
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,540
to sit for a minute?

1739
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,540
Yeah, I know, because these are like,

1740
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,780
sometimes I'm looking at this,

1741
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,380
like maybe this is a little perk of being a smoker

1742
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,500
in Disneyland in the 2000s,

1743
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,540
is that you get like,

1744
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,980
we have corralled this little peaceful area.

1745
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:25,260
We all like, we're always looking for peaceful spots

1746
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,020
in the parks and the smokers had some of them for a while.

1747
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,700
Yeah, I mean, this grizzly, the grizzly peak area,

1748
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,820
it is great.

1749
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,940
And a place that like you really don't know

1750
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,380
unless you hang out in California Adventure a while.

1751
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,780
I think it's because it's really out of the way.

1752
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:42,860
You're not gonna go over there

1753
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,460
because there's no ride over there.

1754
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,300
Yeah, true.

1755
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,820
Yeah, I know, I don't think I realized

1756
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,580
that this was a committed smoking area.

1757
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,660
That odd little, you're in the San Francisco zone

1758
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:54,780
and then you go right, it's a little trail,

1759
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,180
Canada nothing, but it's very pretty and peaceful.

1760
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,020
Yeah, I wonder.

1761
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,020
That was a smoke zone.

1762
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,340
I wonder if I went by there and no one was just smoking,

1763
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,420
no one was smoking there, maybe.

1764
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,580
Possibly. Maybe they didn't know.

1765
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,460
Cause this was such a little,

1766
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,140
this is such a little nook,

1767
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,780
like a special little nook.

1768
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,100
Yeah, I found it.

1769
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,740
I found it cause I like special little nooks.

1770
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,980
Yeah, you're the guy who's looking for nooks.

1771
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:16,820
And then I would go like,

1772
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:20,020
okay, that one part of the nook is the smoking area.

1773
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,380
Yeah. This was your way in.

1774
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,820
Like in, like you're,

1775
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,700
an actor's trying to find a way to love the character.

1776
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,300
And for you, it's like, well, what do I,

1777
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,220
well, I love special little nooks.

1778
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,260
Yeah. Isn't that really what smoking area is?

1779
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,460
So that became your core.

1780
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,660
Yeah, yeah. That's your whole character.

1781
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,500
From very early episode.

1782
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,540
Is this the best special little nook in both parks

1783
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,780
by this Grizzly Peak area?

1784
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,100
Full of Grizzly Peak. Could be.

1785
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,940
What do you think?

1786
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:43,780
Is there a better special little nook?

1787
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,820
You know what I really like is the,

1788
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:48,340
there's a corner, in Poo Corner,

1789
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,020
really the corner of the park in general.

1790
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:54,420
It's right next to the ride where the ride wraps up.

1791
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,260
And there's this really nice waterfall

1792
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,460
that I'm really happy they've kept intact,

1793
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,180
even as they've changed things.

1794
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:05,340
Very peaceful little, in keeping with the poo aesthetic.

1795
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,980
It's all thoughtful spots and corners.

1796
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:08,820
That is good.

1797
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,660
It might not be better, but it's one I like.

1798
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,260
That might still add some of the energy.

1799
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,980
Cause like, you know, half a block,

1800
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,620
if you went into the berm,

1801
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,620
that would have been the like entertainment area, right?

1802
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,860
They would have company picnics and serve beer.

1803
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,700
Oh, I don't know.

1804
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,580
Is there an?

1805
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,420
Didn't we talk about that one?

1806
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,460
In the early days of Disney,

1807
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,180
they had a company picnic area,

1808
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,740
and it was one of the few places

1809
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:36,420
you could get alcohol on the property,

1810
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,020
besides the hotel.

1811
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,340
Because the big sponsors were like,

1812
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,380
we wanna have our companies here,

1813
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,340
we wanna have our company picnics here.

1814
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,860
And they want beer.

1815
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,100
Ah, okay.

1816
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,860
But it was technically outside of the-

1817
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,580
So it was outside of, yeah,

1818
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,380
what we would now consider the-

1819
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,980
I think like in the,

1820
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,780
if you're looking at it from a satellite map above,

1821
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,420
it would be next to that part of the park.

1822
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,580
Oh, so it's a traditionally peaceful zone, maybe.

1823
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,420
Yeah, right.

1824
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,260
Yeah, maybe.

1825
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,660
Yeah, you know, that's,

1826
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,140
it certainly made me feel like,

1827
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,700
okay, if that was a smoker area,

1828
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,500
then like, they had it going for a little while.

1829
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,340
Yeah.

1830
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,900
That's good territory to have claimed.

1831
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,140
The only, yeah, I'm trying to think,

1832
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,620
the only more peaceful place in California Adventure

1833
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:27,180
is in the Carthay stalls in the bathroom

1834
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,180
that go floor to, not almost ceiling,

1835
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:34,140
that make you feel so peaceful and comfortable

1836
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,740
and hidden away while you're doing whatever you do in there.

1837
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,980
That would be the only other place

1838
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,860
that's a cozy little nook

1839
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,220
that I'd wanna smoke a cigarette in.

1840
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,060
Sure.

1841
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,460
On the toilet.

1842
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:48,580
We're not on the toilet, standing up in the stall.

1843
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,340
I don't wanna be crass here.

1844
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,180
I don't have to take a shit and smoke a cigarette.

1845
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,540
You don't have to justify your hypothetical actions.

1846
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,380
No, I sometimes do.

1847
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,740
That doesn't seem nice to me,

1848
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,580
just smoking a cigarette and taking a shit.

1849
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,420
Yeah, no, I thought about it.

1850
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:01,820
I imagined doing it and I also felt the same way, no.

1851
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:02,820
Yeah, that seems bad.

1852
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:03,700
Yeah.

1853
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,540
Another zone, this was not one of the original smoking areas,

1854
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:08,340
but it was, I think, a long time,

1855
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,820
but these kinda ebbed and flowed.

1856
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,980
I don't think they were very consistent.

1857
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:14,580
Certain ones were, but you know what's a really nice one?

1858
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,780
There's a little Rivers of America dockside,

1859
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,740
kind of like near Tom Sawyer rafts.

1860
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,580
Oh yeah.

1861
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:26,180
And this sign is only as themed as anything is

1862
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,300
in New Orleans Square,

1863
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,220
but it's got that nice Disney graphic design,

1864
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,060
a pleasant circle.

1865
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,020
Yeah.

1866
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,300
I think they managed to,

1867
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,540
cause then, I feel like at first it's just a smoking area,

1868
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,460
a picture of a cigarette,

1869
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,220
and then it has to start telling you

1870
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,620
that it can cause cancer and reproductive harm.

1871
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:45,900
So Disney had to make these scary warnings

1872
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,540
and eventually a specific proposition they had to list.

1873
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,540
They had to make this stuff aesthetically pleasing.

1874
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,860
I think in a lot of cases they did.

1875
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,340
Isn't this, this is like as relaxing

1876
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:59,180
as any storefront sign in New Orleans Square.

1877
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,820
Yeah, that looks perfectly themed.

1878
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,260
Yeah, I don't like it as much as the sort of shield,

1879
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,700
wooden shield look of the other one,

1880
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,660
but yeah, it doesn't stand out as a warning

1881
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,540
about a product that'll kill you.

1882
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,660
So we should pick favorites maybe.

1883
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,500
Are you thinking your favorite is?

1884
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,340
I think, I mean, I think because of that sign

1885
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,580
that Matterhorn one is good,

1886
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:23,580
but the Grizzly, maybe we haven't discussed everyone yet,

1887
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,420
but the-

1888
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,740
Yeah, we'll pull one in that we haven't talked about

1889
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:27,940
if you wish.

1890
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:30,020
Yeah, well the stand, it's hard

1891
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:33,660
because there's not a good picture of standing

1892
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,860
like by the Grizzly peak taking a smoke break.

1893
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,900
Yeah, signage maybe, but-

1894
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:44,020
Yeah, but I'm gonna guess and say that would be mine,

1895
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,740
but it sounds like it's hard to argue that.

1896
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,740
I like that little dock.

1897
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,100
I really like it back there.

1898
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,940
You hear little snippets of music from different angles,

1899
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,780
but it's pretty quiet.

1900
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,660
There's a lot of nature.

1901
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,820
You can kind of see people in the distance,

1902
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,180
but you're like set off from it.

1903
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,660
That's a good, that is a place, smoking or no,

1904
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,220
that you would like to sit and chill out at Disneyland.

1905
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,060
Absolutely.

1906
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,140
So I think for the chill factor, that's gonna be mine.

1907
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,740
Here's, I'm gonna bring a little bit of Intel

1908
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:17,140
into the mix from reviews that I saw somewhere.

1909
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,580
That one sounded very pleasant,

1910
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,620
but I'm reading that the shade was bad.

1911
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,540
Shade, you gotta factor into this.

1912
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:25,580
So if that, that might not should blow

1913
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:28,460
unless the day is so it's overcast, it doesn't matter.

1914
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,820
Tomorrowland near Autopia, you know,

1915
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:35,020
Monorail's Autopia's and trains was in by,

1916
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,180
sounds stressful on this.

1917
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,700
I don't think Tomorrowland is a good one.

1918
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,540
I don't think anybody's.

1919
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,660
I know, I think that's a bad one too.

1920
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,340
I mean, the only thing that would be positive

1921
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,180
is that that's another place where pollution is rampant.

1922
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,460
Yeah, I'd much rather have secondhand smoke than Autopia.

1923
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,940
Than gas fumes, yeah.

1924
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,740
Yeah, plumes and fumes.

1925
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:56,300
The, I also read that, okay, New Orleans Square,

1926
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,140
I always go back to that one.

1927
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,580
Night, the best views is what I saw and that seems evident.

1928
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,900
So that speaks to that.

1929
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,660
Big Thunder I'm seeing was maybe the coolest

1930
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,820
and the quietest, potentially the most relaxing.

1931
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,660
And I do like that Big Thunder trail.

1932
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,340
They only improved it with the Galaxy's Edge.

1933
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,820
I have a, when I took a friend of mine to Disneyland

1934
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,420
for the first time a decade ago, he is a smoker

1935
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,700
and he smoked there and I have a photo of him I think.

1936
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,100
Cause I thought it was funny.

1937
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,500
How did he, how did he seem?

1938
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,340
Do you remember his feelings?

1939
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,580
He seemed fine, he seemed comfortable.

1940
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,540
Okay, okay.

1941
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:36,020
I'm trying to think any that haven't been addressed.

1942
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:39,460
I, are there any, I don't know.

1943
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,580
In Disneyland proper?

1944
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,660
Yeah, yeah.

1945
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,820
I mean, feel free to pull DCA into it.

1946
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:49,820
I, when we get to DCA, I have a bit of a presentation.

1947
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,700
Oh, you do, okay.

1948
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,740
If this is a good time to give the presentation.

1949
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:53,860
Maybe that's what we should do.

1950
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:54,700
Maybe so.

1951
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,300
I remembered one more at the Grand Californian Hotel.

1952
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,140
Oh yeah, yeah, by the convention center.

1953
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,380
The fireplace, right?

1954
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,820
Oh, okay.

1955
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:03,660
Well, I think.

1956
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,300
What I read it was right by the convention center area.

1957
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,660
By the ballrooms and stuff?

1958
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,140
I think so, yeah.

1959
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,220
I'm sure there was one there,

1960
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,820
I feel like for a little while maybe.

1961
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:16,820
There was, I think a fireplace

1962
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,980
that was both inside and outside

1963
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,820
and I feel like the outside part,

1964
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,460
like you could smoke out there.

1965
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,100
Oh, okay, I can kind of picture that.

1966
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,500
That sounds nice, that sounds very nice.

1967
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,820
Yeah.

1968
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:28,860
Could have been that.

1969
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:34,780
This is, what we, when you start getting into,

1970
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,220
okay, 2000 is when the smoking areas appear

1971
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,540
and I think maybe you can,

1972
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:43,340
it's a slow ticking clock that takes place over 20 years.

1973
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:47,340
California Adventure becomes the first park over there

1974
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,460
to open requiring smoke.

1975
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,340
There was never a point where you could just smoke anywhere

1976
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,460
in California Adventure and the slippery slope

1977
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,980
that old Bill was worried about.

1978
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,500
I think you can really see if I,

1979
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,540
I have a little Google slides is what I,

1980
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,380
Wow, okay.

1981
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,860
It's just the easiest way I felt like

1982
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,620
to convey this information,

1983
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,140
but this kind of tells the tale.

1984
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,980
I found it interesting, the shuffling nature

1985
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,460
of the smoking areas in California Adventure

1986
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,900
and it having the burden of being a park

1987
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:20,220
that were smoking areas were always a part of it.

1988
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,060
Sure.

1989
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,340
So,

1990
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,020
Do you want to throw it on the TV?

1991
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,660
I thought about trying to throw it on the TV.

1992
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,060
Yeah, we do have a TV in front of us

1993
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:27,900
that we don't usually,

1994
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,860
I think the laptop will do it.

1995
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,220
But I'm still mostly gonna narrate

1996
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,860
because this is for listeners.

1997
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:38,500
So these I believe are the original 2001 smoking areas.

1998
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,620
We have a Paradise Pier smoking area

1999
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,620
and this seems kind of between,

2000
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,020
I might say the current ones,

2001
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,620
Jesse's Critter Carousel and in Credit Coaster,

2002
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,140
whatever those were called before.

2003
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,220
That I believe is Jack Jack's Cookie Num Nums today,

2004
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,260
perhaps was a nondescript area at the time.

2005
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,700
Sounds like a good one, kind of excitement,

2006
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,060
watching the coaster cars go past.

2007
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,340
You got a Condor Flats.

2008
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,940
Here's one that we haven't talked about.

2009
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:06,500
And I can't tell you exactly where this is,

2010
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,940
but it's kind of, it's similar to Grizzly Peak

2011
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,740
in that it's on a trail, it's relaxing,

2012
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,500
there's real trees and fake rocks.

2013
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,980
What better combo could there be?

2014
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,980
And we're getting close to the zone here

2015
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,940
where you're looking out for those Disneyland cats.

2016
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,940
And that's a nice off the beaten path chill part.

2017
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,620
I don't know if the cats have found this area in 2001.

2018
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,900
It probably happened over time.

2019
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,300
I think it was on the other side of Soarin.

2020
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,620
I think I read that it was by the gift shop.

2021
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,940
It was next to the gift shop,

2022
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,540
which is across the way from Soarin.

2023
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,860
Okay, I think that's what I read.

2024
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:37,700
That doesn't sound as good.

2025
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,060
That sounds like we're getting away

2026
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,220
from nature a little bit.

2027
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,220
Yeah, so that's what this, whatever blog I was reading said.

2028
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,020
Okay, that sounds less good.

2029
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,780
But if we're more on the rock and tree side,

2030
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,020
I think this is a solid one.

2031
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,060
If it was where that plane is now,

2032
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,580
where they used to do the Minnie and the Fly Girls

2033
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,860
or whatever they called it.

2034
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,100
There, that's a better thing.

2035
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:57,940
If you could smoke a cigarette

2036
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,380
and lean against that plane or something.

2037
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,580
Sure, sounds nice.

2038
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,420
Not even great.

2039
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,980
Yeah, I don't think you, now look,

2040
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:04,620
I don't think we got any props

2041
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,940
other than like a general piece of big thunder rock.

2042
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,700
Yeah, and you couldn't smoke a cigarette with Minnie.

2043
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:13,700
You could not like Saul and Kim smoke in my fantasy

2044
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:16,100
in a parking garage with Minnie Jackson.

2045
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,780
It's the core of your bond.

2046
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,380
And then in the end, after all the bullshit happens,

2047
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,660
you still got your cigarettes.

2048
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:23,500
That's right.

2049
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,340
And then I didn't know about this one.

2050
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,340
This is outside Hyperion Theater.

2051
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:29,860
So all the areas are represented.

2052
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,460
We're kind of covering all the lands.

2053
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,500
And I like that.

2054
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,700
That feels like your intermission of a real Broadway show

2055
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,220
popping out for a smoke.

2056
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,020
And then of course we got Grizzly Peak,

2057
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,100
the one that we're thinking is one of the best ones.

2058
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,220
I think a really solid beginning four.

2059
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:50,020
Now we shift to 2003 and you see little,

2060
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:52,820
it's downgrades, things go up and down.

2061
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:54,460
It's the stock market, I feel.

2062
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:57,180
In 2003, we have lost that Hyperion Theater.

2063
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,820
You cannot enjoy a cigarette after a rousing performance

2064
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:05,820
of step in time or to calm down after seeing Kelsey Grammer

2065
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,940
almost break his legs on that stage.

2066
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:12,580
It has now moved to kind of a nondescript corner.

2067
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,220
That's like between all the sound stages

2068
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:15,620
where still nothing's really going on.

2069
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:20,500
We're like between Muppets and Superstar Limo at that time.

2070
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,660
But we got some trees, seems okay.

2071
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,340
This might have been okay.

2072
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,500
I got no actual photos of it.

2073
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:28,900
But then big upgrade for the smokers.

2074
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,740
This is huge, I feel.

2075
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:30,740
Yes, I know what you're talking about.

2076
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:34,020
You have a smoking area that's where you watch

2077
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,100
the coasters launch on.

2078
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,940
Yeah, yes.

2079
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,820
I saw this.

2080
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,060
California Screamin' at that time.

2081
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:44,780
This still to this day is a spot where people gather.

2082
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,420
The spectacular Harbor View,

2083
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,740
the excitement of watching those things launch.

2084
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,820
Oh, could I do it?

2085
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:50,740
Should I do it?

2086
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,460
Oh, it factors into,

2087
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,500
are you getting on the thing or not?

2088
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,140
This is a spectacular smoking spot.

2089
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,060
This is one of the top three.

2090
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,660
And you could make an argument maybe it's number one.

2091
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,500
Yeah, maybe so.

2092
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,060
Depends on what you want out of smoking area.

2093
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:05,900
But yes, you could.

2094
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:10,020
Me, I think looking over water, that seems pretty huge.

2095
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,060
Well, we're talking criteria.

2096
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,380
Water and seeing a little bit of rides

2097
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,900
because then you're feeling that you're hearing

2098
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:20,220
some of the ride on that one.

2099
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,180
You know, these people are not locked in a closet.

2100
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,940
They're in one of the most prominent spots in the park.

2101
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:30,860
But this is awfully close to a pedestrian walkway

2102
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,180
where people might be getting it.

2103
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,020
It's incredibly close.

2104
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,420
Well, I think, and now the map,

2105
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,900
I don't remember the lay of the land at the time,

2106
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,660
but the map seems to show kind of a little trail,

2107
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,460
little like strip of brown.

2108
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,580
So maybe they're trying to corralia.

2109
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,300
Now the wind might be drifting that smoke

2110
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,460
over to the pedestrians. Yeah, that's true.

2111
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:48,220
But it might be why, spoiler,

2112
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,380
this particular one is not long for this world.

2113
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,540
Yeah, now I'm not factoring in the collateral damage

2114
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,820
of smoke getting to people when I'm saying

2115
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,820
what the best smoking area is.

2116
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,780
Oh, sure, I think I was just trying to account

2117
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,300
for why they would have pulled this one.

2118
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,140
I sound right.

2119
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,580
Smart, yes, that is like maybe a good reason

2120
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:06,420
why it went away.

2121
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,860
And then of course, Grizzly Peak

2122
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,660
and Condor Flats hold firm.

2123
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,180
These are stalwarts.

2124
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,700
And this takes us into the next,

2125
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,460
the next year I'll show you is 2005.

2126
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:18,140
We lose the, perhaps due to Jason's reasoning,

2127
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,700
we lose that one pretty spectacular smoking area,

2128
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,780
but we gain another waterfront one.

2129
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,260
This is kind of in the shadow of the sun wheel.

2130
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:30,060
So it's still, it's beachfront property.

2131
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,860
This is a good time to be a smoker in this park.

2132
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:37,100
Early 2000s, smokers are high on the hog in California.

2133
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2134
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:40,780
Guests are not faring well,

2135
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,420
but smokers have the run of the place.

2136
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,540
They're maybe just like, they're happy anybody's there.

2137
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,660
You showed up, you showed up.

2138
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,860
The most beautiful place in the park, it's yours.

2139
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,500
Smoking on any part of this water property

2140
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,340
or whatever you call it,

2141
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,460
any part of this lake, this man-made lake.

2142
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,300
Great, maybe to this day, you know what?

2143
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,540
I was having trouble thinking of where do I wanna

2144
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,780
have a cigarette at Disneyland?

2145
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:04,660
Maybe I don't, maybe I want it in California Adventure.

2146
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,500
Oh, interesting.

2147
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,860
Over in the pier zone.

2148
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,540
Interesting, and that's, I mean,

2149
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,260
I guess we don't have to save that for the end,

2150
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,740
but yeah, is that, if you could think of any,

2151
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,740
is it on-ride or is it,

2152
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,420
do we have to be reasonable in our choice

2153
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,580
of where we would want the cigarette

2154
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,340
or? No, I don't think so.

2155
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,180
I think anything's gotta be on the table.

2156
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,020
It could be completely, yeah.

2157
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,060
Can I get off the ride in the middle of it?

2158
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,900
Can you be in the middle of Paradise Bay?

2159
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,820
Sure.

2160
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,220
Let's say it's possible.

2161
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:30,060
I think we should, for creativity's sake.

2162
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:30,900
How about this?

2163
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,780
Yeah, in Paradise Bay, can you be smoking it

2164
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,740
like that picture of Jack Nicholson on the boat

2165
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,980
with the hoagie in that series of photos?

2166
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,580
There's one where he just got his head out of the water

2167
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,420
with the cigarette in the water.

2168
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,940
Oh, wow, what if you're doing a bupkis?

2169
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:43,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2170
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,780
You're doing a Pete Davidson bupkis

2171
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:46,980
smoking in the water.

2172
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,900
Yes, so yeah, you jump into Paradise Bay.

2173
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,740
That's not my choice,

2174
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,660
but I'm saying that's what you're saying.

2175
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:52,500
That sounds nice.

2176
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,940
It's on the table.

2177
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:54,780
I haven't made my decision yet.

2178
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,420
Now I'm thinking maybe I get off

2179
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:00,740
and I light up with the ultimate raspy-voiced

2180
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:04,100
smoke-smith himself, Captain Jack Sparrow.

2181
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,500
Oh, wow.

2182
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,620
If I offer him a cigarette

2183
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:09,700
and hang out in the throne room with him,

2184
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:14,700
watch, you know, maybe I bring a bottle with me.

2185
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,300
I know Mr. Depp is a fan of Red Wine.

2186
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,140
Sure he is.

2187
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,820
Yeah, hang out in there for an hour.

2188
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:22,460
See if he'll sing you the song about Hedy Lamarr

2189
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,100
that he wrote with Jeff Beck, you know?

2190
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:25,940
Who knows?

2191
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,580
I'm there, maybe it strikes a chord with me.

2192
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,780
Maybe I like it a little more.

2193
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,620
Yeah.

2194
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,660
Okay, so not only do we get that one,

2195
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:38,540
but get ready for your minds to be blown.

2196
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:41,420
We have a second beachfront property.

2197
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,260
I saw this.

2198
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,860
This is over by the Golden Zephyr,

2199
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,980
which is rarely running.

2200
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:46,980
And I don't know that they're running

2201
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,540
a lot of regular shows.

2202
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,140
This is pre-World of Color.

2203
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:54,220
So this is like, this is the Wild West.

2204
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,420
We got two smoking areas overlooking the water.

2205
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,460
The Park was there.

2206
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,460
It wasn't that popular also.

2207
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2208
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,980
So they're not worried about crowds anywhere.

2209
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,900
Right, as long as you aren't doing it

2210
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,220
just in the Soren building, you're fine.

2211
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,620
And then again, Grizzly Peak and Condor Flats holding firm.

2212
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:12,980
At this point in time, we have more smoking areas

2213
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,860
in California Adventure than Disneyland.

2214
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:15,900
And better Smoker's Paradise.

2215
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,660
I think better options.

2216
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:18,780
Yeah. View-wise.

2217
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:19,740
Much better. Yeah.

2218
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:22,380
So, and yeah, cause you got your Grizzly Peak area,

2219
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,180
which is, you know, it's a little bit more limited.

2220
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,340
It's high, but then you got your expansive water views.

2221
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,900
Like it's everything you would want.

2222
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,860
And you don't feel like you're bothering people around you

2223
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,260
because it is just like, it's just going up to the sky.

2224
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:35,100
Yeah. Right?

2225
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,900
You know, if you've got like the cover of trees,

2226
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,820
if you've got a canvas above you,

2227
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,380
that almost feels close to being in a smoky room.

2228
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,780
We're traveling in here, but we're there with open sky.

2229
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,820
Yeah. Wonderful.

2230
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,260
Smoker's Paradise Pier.

2231
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,100
That's what I call it.

2232
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,180
They were going to change it.

2233
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,100
Maybe they were going to make,

2234
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,220
they were struggling so much.

2235
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:53,980
They're considering just making this

2236
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:57,300
the first smokers area with Rod.

2237
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,100
That's sort of where smokers area land.

2238
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:03,020
If California Adventure hadn't gotten turned around,

2239
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,540
you could have been seeing like the food

2240
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:08,940
and smoking festivals going in instead of food and wine.

2241
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:09,780
Oh, damn. Oh, yeah.

2242
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:14,780
Different little pop ups where you would buy different cigarettes.

2243
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,500
Cigarillo booth.

2244
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,060
Yeah, that's right. Pipe booth.

2245
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:18,820
Pipe booth.

2246
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:23,300
California screaming is flipping to California smoking.

2247
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:31,660
Wow. And they're just doing little brown and tan paint jobs on the wooden beams.

2248
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:34,380
So that that smoking aging.

2249
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,620
That would have saved the park to as a full smoking thing.

2250
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,460
That really would have. I bet it was on the table.

2251
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:42,140
I bet concept art was drawn up with anything.

2252
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,580
Anything. I mean, blue sky.

2253
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,140
Any ideas? Bring them to the table.

2254
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,060
Well, look, before Cars Land, there was a plan for like, you know,

2255
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:53,620
oh, what if we did like a Route 66 themed area?

2256
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:58,700
And sure enough, we got to meet on Route 66, the Marlboro Man.

2257
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:01,340
Oh, perfect. Yeah, that's a great.

2258
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,780
That's a beloved character.

2259
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:05,340
And that's that was that's what Tony Baxter became about, like,

2260
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,620
you know, today's icons are right.

2261
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:11,780
It's you know, it's Indiana Jones and it's C3PO.

2262
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,780
It's the Marlboro Man. Right, right.

2263
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:19,820
And soaring over California would become soaring through big clouds of secondhand

2264
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:24,700
smoke where you just went through different types of secondhand smoke.

2265
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,260
Sample them. Yeah.

2266
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,660
Yeah. Different different flavors.

2267
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:33,940
Oh, they could have gotten a big like merch boom if they had partnered with Yankee

2268
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:39,260
Candle, which was how my childhood friends, parents who smoked like

2269
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:44,620
chimneys in their home would try to cover it up by burning

2270
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,780
blueberry candles everywhere.

2271
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,260
But it was like my friend's house.

2272
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:55,260
So now, anytime I smell blueberry candle, I think back finally to those smoky.

2273
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,820
Yeah. Nasty homes.

2274
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:00,740
This you won't call your own cigarettes nasty if you start also lighting up a Yankee.

2275
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:01,740
Can't keep that lighter.

2276
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:02,860
That's true. Yeah.

2277
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,940
I keep a Yankee candle.

2278
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,380
I should say, Scott, I am like you were.

2279
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:12,940
I am a once a month, once every six weeks, one cigarette.

2280
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:16,620
Oh, hey, you know, you also don't need to feel any shame about it.

2281
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:21,300
I was I was just I thought the reveal was funny after you right after you called them nasty.

2282
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:26,620
Oh, yeah, they're disgusting, you know, but first hand smoke.

2283
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:29,060
Oh, you feel cool.

2284
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,420
It's a real look.

2285
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,860
We know we're going to call it all at first hand smoke.

2286
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:34,460
First hand.

2287
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:37,860
Nothing feel like nothing like just breathing in some first hand.

2288
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,900
Number one, number one, baby.

2289
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,220
Hang loose. You know, you're number one.

2290
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,340
Just that it's number one.

2291
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:47,020
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2292
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,180
First hand, baby.

2293
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,820
All right. I'm going to take you out of a dark time.

2294
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:53,100
We're going to this is where I'm going to jump way ahead to 2012.

2295
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:59,140
And this is where the glory days of 2005 are over because we have now opened

2296
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,700
Radiator Springs.

2297
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:06,820
This is the first land in DCA where you cannot see the first land open without a smoking area.

2298
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,780
So the writing has got to feel on the walls.

2299
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:12,220
Just with that, Condor Flats is gone.

2300
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,420
We have lost we have lost Condor Flats as of 2012.

2301
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,700
Condor Flats is down is off the map.

2302
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,700
Grizzly Peak holding firm.

2303
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:23,420
And yet we have lost waterfront as well.

2304
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:24,540
This is a sad time.

2305
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:28,740
Like if you guys should be narrating this in more of a Ken Burns in a

2306
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,140
that we have we are ceding territory.

2307
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,100
Two brothers should be playing.

2308
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,460
One bad one smoked cigs.

2309
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,380
The other was clear.

2310
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:42,020
The the actor read the letters would be like, this place

2311
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:44,900
snuck sucks now you can't smoke anywhere.

2312
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,340
Lines are so long.

2313
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,460
The actor read letters.

2314
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:52,020
What? No, they would do like dramatic reading.

2315
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,820
I think it's Red Skelton type.

2316
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,580
Red Skelton, Red Buttons, Red Letters.

2317
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,340
That's what I thought.

2318
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:03,620
I thought it was like a civil maybe a civil war historian and then old red letters.

2319
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:05,660
The actors read.

2320
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,260
They would do the crazy voices.

2321
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,100
You know what it was?

2322
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,460
I didn't hear the S at the end of actors.

2323
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,420
That's why I think we heard.

2324
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,860
OK, the actor read letters.

2325
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,620
The actor read letters comes in.

2326
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:18,820
And if we had the S then I think it would have made more sense.

2327
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:19,300
But I was.

2328
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:22,060
Red Letter was the biggest star in America.

2329
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,500
It was like the worst man in Hollywood.

2330
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,740
I was like, Jesus, I thought I knew everyone named Red from the old days of Hollywood.

2331
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:32,060
But maybe I don't want Jason's pulling out actors all the time.

2332
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,340
I'm old. That's true.

2333
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,420
Yeah. You know, Red Letters from Ziegfeld Follies.

2334
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:40,140
He was at his estate sale.

2335
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,220
He thought so.

2336
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,260
He bought all actually all of Red Letters ashtrays.

2337
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,460
That's right.

2338
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:48,060
The smoking area has now moved to the former site of the Malibu.

2339
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,820
Which is in Clovis.

2340
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,980
Yeah, this is really a strange David.

2341
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,340
We are in a cage.

2342
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,620
Smokers are now in a coaster cage.

2343
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:00,460
They can maybe see the water through the bars.

2344
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:04,660
Yeah, 2012 must be when you know that the party is ending here in California.

2345
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,740
I'm sure. And then am I correct?

2346
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,100
Oh, I am right. OK.

2347
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,740
You know, it was never it hasn't been looking good in Hollywood for a long time.

2348
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:15,020
But now we have moved over to Dead Man's Corner.

2349
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,020
Now the smoking area is in literal corner of the park,

2350
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,980
and it's not like a nice corner.

2351
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:22,140
This is it's where all the soundstage.

2352
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:26,340
There's like a a water tower that you forget is even there.

2353
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,220
I forget. So they started doing a Captain Marvel photo op with a plane.

2354
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:32,740
There was nothing going on over here.

2355
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,300
This is depressing.

2356
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,420
This is just big soundstage walls and stucco.

2357
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,060
This this is a bummer.

2358
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:41,740
So we've we've lost our nice Hollywood.

2359
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,740
Condor Flats is offline.

2360
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:47,540
2012 is where the ship becomes unsteerable.

2361
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,740
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's depressing.

2362
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,660
And then soon enough, then we get to 2017.

2363
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,820
I can't believe I'm even saying these words.

2364
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,260
Grizzly Peak has fallen.

2365
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,740
Much like Olympus.

2366
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:02,460
So but the corner was still going.

2367
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:06,900
Hollywood Corner became the only smoking area in the park.

2368
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:11,380
And that's like like you only end up over there if you're having a bad day.

2369
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:14,460
If everything in the park has a 50 minute wait

2370
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,260
and you're like, there must be something around.

2371
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,700
Yeah. Monsters Inc. That's a little dinky ride, right?

2372
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,740
You get over there. 45 minutes.

2373
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:22,540
Yeah. How could it be?

2374
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,260
Oh, God, I'm so angry. I need to smoke.

2375
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,540
Can I get under a tree? At least no.

2376
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:30,220
You can get in the reflection of these boring beige buildings.

2377
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,180
That was terrible. That was pre-Guardians.

2378
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,860
Yeah, but it was probably a holdover from the Mad Tea Party days.

2379
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,860
The revelers need to get away from the madness.

2380
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,340
Maybe you're right.

2381
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:46,380
Functionally could have been a smoking area when you're there for the Mad Tea Party.

2382
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,020
Yeah, that's that's that's OK.

2383
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,820
Yeah, for sure. It would have to have been.

2384
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:53,820
It's where the musicians would have to go to light their special cigarettes.

2385
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,660
Alice in the Mad Hatter would have a smoke or two.

2386
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:02,300
Get a little inspired before doing an especially loopy version of Don't Stop Believing.

2387
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:07,340
DJ White Rabbit taking a couple puffs in between sets.

2388
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,780
I thought that uptown funk.

2389
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,620
Remix tonight really went over well.

2390
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:14,260
Do you come here often?

2391
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,740
You know what I'm going to do?

2392
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,500
What if we shift the the setlist?

2393
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:22,420
I'm going to do my Sharona straight into celebration.

2394
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:24,420
Oh, dude, that's not all.

2395
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:27,140
You're insane. Maybe go into watch.

2396
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,380
How will I know?

2397
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,500
Well, you're crazy.

2398
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,140
Watch like Sergeant Pepper.

2399
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,980
Why were we playing in the key of C?

2400
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,740
Watch me for the chord changes.

2401
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:39,060
Try to keep up.

2402
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,140
Oh, man. It's my last day.

2403
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:45,140
I'm doing it. I'm finally doing under the sea into Daft Punk.

2404
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,380
Get lucky.

2405
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:52,420
You're not going to know what boy, you know, I know it's standing room

2406
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,140
only on the dance floor, but everybody's going to have to.

2407
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:57,340
Everybody's going to end up taking a seat where they want to or not.

2408
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:00,540
You're going to have to get blown on their asses.

2409
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:04,100
There's too many kids sleeping in those wide strollers.

2410
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,500
I won't do it.

2411
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,340
I won't do it.

2412
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:10,700
So, I mean, it's a sad tale when you lay it out like that.

2413
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:15,060
Well, what they had in 2005 and then how little they had in 2017.

2414
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,300
And they have to paradise surely.

2415
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,900
Oh, yeah. The parking lot.

2416
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:26,020
They paved paradise, relegated people to one end of a parking lot,

2417
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,380
and then ultimately eliminated the parking lot. Right.

2418
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,900
And that's that's where we stand today.

2419
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:35,500
They would they surely knew as dire as things were in 2017

2420
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,620
that in 2019 would all come crashing down. Yeah.

2421
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,260
Same thing happened at Disneyland.

2422
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,940
I think it became only Big Thunder.

2423
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:45,500
Maybe it was down to one, but both.

2424
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:49,780
And then these these little pockets of heaven were finally gone.

2425
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:55,380
And now you just have to enjoy them as serene seating areas.

2426
01:27:55,980 --> 01:28:00,220
Yeah. Yeah. Well, pantomime cigarettes, I guess, is your best bet.

2427
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:01,740
Like the pictures of Walt.

2428
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,380
Oh, yes. Well, it's yeah.

2429
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:08,060
The way they neuter all these characters and Pecos Bill in the old movie,

2430
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,820
they scrub the cigarettes.

2431
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,140
That's what happened to everyone.

2432
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:14,140
They've they've scrubbed the cigarettes from everyone's hands.

2433
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,980
Yeah. Yeah. Too bad.

2434
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,940
I mean, I'm not a smoker, so I'm not as wistful as I could be right now,

2435
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:21,300
but I am a little wistful. Yeah. Yeah.

2436
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,060
And though still a slower decline,

2437
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,660
I think the same policy took effect at Disney World,

2438
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:30,860
which is funny because they it became a Disneyland.

2439
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:33,020
We were instituting a smoking policy.

2440
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:35,020
There will be four smoking areas.

2441
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,740
And when it happened at Disney World, it was it went right.

2442
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:44,380
Magic Kingdom 13 Epcot 23, Hollywood Studios, nine, Animal Kingdom nine.

2443
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,780
And they ended up wrapping it up at the same time.

2444
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,460
So very much more precipitous.

2445
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,860
Yeah. At Disney World. Yeah. Aggressive.

2446
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,420
People must have felt that whiplash.

2447
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:58,260
Yeah, I think so. Like, yeah, having to leave park property

2448
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,700
and it's bigger parks, too. Yeah. Very big. Yeah.

2449
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,300
You get lost. Pretty crazy.

2450
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,380
Also, wait, also another thing as of 2003, all the downtown

2451
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,260
Disney trash cans at Ashtrays. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2452
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,500
I don't know when that's that was all lol.

2453
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:13,740
There was no rules.

2454
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:16,420
You can always walk in downtown and have a cigarette.

2455
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:18,460
No problem. Unaddressed in the ordeal.

2456
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,860
But now it is the secret.

2457
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,300
So we didn't talk about the invisible sector that is where you smoke.

2458
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:26,420
Did we talk about on the Main Street was weird episode that they had their own

2459
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:30,380
like Disneyland blend of tobacco? No, no.

2460
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:31,500
That sounds really right.

2461
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:35,260
Yeah, they had Disneyland had its own special blend or mildly

2462
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,900
aromatic pipe tobacco,

2463
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:40,900
which then you could go smoke in the parks. Wow.

2464
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:43,100
So you get like any idea what

2465
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,100
no flavor and say what it was.

2466
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,420
I just said that there was own special thing.

2467
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,700
I mean, the way they make the different tobacco shops on Main Street sound like

2468
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,860
it was almost like when you go into one of those rooms

2469
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:56,940
in a fancy candy store that has imported candies.

2470
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:00,940
It feels like they had like it was like Willy Wonka's tobacco room

2471
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:05,220
and they imported stuff from places and you like you could really do it up in there

2472
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:08,780
if you wanted like nice coffee houses.

2473
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:11,780
Yeah, really like or winery.

2474
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:15,700
I mean, they really emphasize where stuff came from or what kind of grape, you know.

2475
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:19,500
Yeah. So there's a lot more stuff, too.

2476
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,940
I was reading about when I was like, well, I don't even think we

2477
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,940
covered some of the well, not mainstream.

2478
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,700
Oh, we haven't even brought up matchbox.

2479
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28,020
That used to be a big thing.

2480
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:32,060
I think Jane gave me some a few years ago that were Caribbean Beach.

2481
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:37,100
Like every hotel had their own matchbooks and restaurants.

2482
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:42,580
And that's from like the what's the the undersea restaurant at the Living Seas.

2483
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,420
Oh, yeah. Park restaurants.

2484
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:45,020
Oh, yeah.

2485
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,940
Books. Mm hmm.

2486
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:50,900
There are the apparently Sleeping Beauty was on the can of tobacco that they made

2487
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,220
at Disney specifically.

2488
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:56,260
He's they sold taking a nap.

2489
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,540
Just chill.

2490
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,940
They sold candy cigarettes called Mickey's Sweet Cigarettes.

2491
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:03,340
What? What?

2492
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:05,420
Yeah. Really? Yeah.

2493
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,780
And then Walrus and Alice in Wonderland.

2494
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:12,180
The Walrus invited the innocent little oysters to a party.

2495
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:16,060
They found out too late that the main dish at the party was to be themselves.

2496
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:20,380
Oh, I don't know why that's on the cigarettes.

2497
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:23,940
But this is the ad for Mickey's Sweet Cigarettes. Wow.

2498
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,460
But yeah, there's so much more like tobacco lore.

2499
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:29,940
Yeah. And my sweet cigarettes.

2500
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:33,660
Make sure your dad buys the not so sweet cigarettes.

2501
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,420
We're getting the kids hooked early.

2502
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:38,500
They start eating the candy cigarettes and then they start eating

2503
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,860
the real thing when they grow up.

2504
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:45,620
Light up on Main Street as long as we get into the game.

2505
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,620
If you're if we can get the most smoking mice,

2506
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,260
if you get a pack of mice, I don't give a shit.

2507
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,820
We'll fight those laws.

2508
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:57,140
You think we're going to cave the Ralph Nader?

2509
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,540
Not if I'm selling them. You get me out there up front.

2510
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:02,100
I don't want to lose any ground, any sort of fucking camel.

2511
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:04,260
It's me. I'm a big mouse. It's fun.

2512
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:06,100
The kids love it. OK. You know what?

2513
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,980
Just fucking just kill him.

2514
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,500
Just kill that fucking camel. I don't care.

2515
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,660
I don't care. You have to do.

2516
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,500
They trace back to me. I've been in jail before.

2517
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,820
I'll go back. I don't care.

2518
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,020
We can't lose ground as fucking camel.

2519
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:21,180
We make movies.

2520
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:24,140
We do three parts. We sell cigarettes.

2521
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,420
Yeah, he's cooler than me.

2522
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:31,780
Whatever. He's got a jail other jacket and a band.

2523
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:34,740
So what? Let's see him hunt ghosts.

2524
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,780
Let's see him go through the looking glass.

2525
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:39,060
Let's see him drive a fucking steamboat.

2526
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,420
What does he do? What can he do? He plays pool.

2527
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:43,140
Oh, the kids love that.

2528
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,420
Oh, he plays 12 bar blues.

2529
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,540
Big deal. I have an Oompa band.

2530
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,260
I play a skeleton. His bones.

2531
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,340
With mallets.

2532
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,940
That's what I fucking play.

2533
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,820
He thinks he's so fucking funny.

2534
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:59,620
We'll see who's funny when I'm laughing and he's dead.

2535
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:04,060
When I give a speech, it is funeral.

2536
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,740
And the speech is mostly spitting into his open grave.

2537
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:14,380
Camel spit, huh?

2538
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,340
Not anymore. I spit.

2539
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:19,940
You understand? I spit.

2540
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,420
You asked for it.

2541
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:24,260
Boy, I don't know how they managed to not sell cigar.

2542
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,420
It'd be a different way.

2543
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:28,580
Truly, smoking would be legal still everywhere, anywhere.

2544
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:30,820
If Disney had got that's true. Yeah.

2545
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:34,540
I think it's what it was probably on Waltz to do list after the Florida project.

2546
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,540
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get that going.

2547
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:39,460
And then we'll try to make sure we hold back these these damn laws.

2548
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:42,260
Yeah. That scrap of paper that said Kurt Russell underneath

2549
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:45,940
it said, let it gasoline cigarettes next.

2550
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,300
And yeah, Roy tried to make it happen, but

2551
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,260
it was too tough without Walt.

2552
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:52,380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2553
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,020
Didn't have what it could.

2554
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:57,220
Just like Eisner couldn't push through Disney's America without

2555
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,460
Frank Wells helping him out. Yeah, true.

2556
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,620
Yeah. Yeah. It's tough when you're when you're fighting the government.

2557
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:04,940
Did Eisner ever smoke a cigarette in a Disney park?

2558
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,820
Yeah, I think so. You think so?

2559
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:09,460
And they let him do it.

2560
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:11,140
Yeah, I just wondered, was there a photo of it?

2561
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,940
I wonder where was it during maybe it was in France during construction.

2562
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,740
I've always seen a photo of him smoking a cigarette.

2563
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:17,140
Maybe that's up.

2564
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,020
Sounds familiar.

2565
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:19,660
Well, if we'll post it, if we find it.

2566
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,100
OK, we'll look.

2567
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:23,860
Anything else? And I'm really glad you brought up sweet cigarettes.

2568
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,100
Yeah. Apparently. OK.

2569
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:30,060
Also, Tokyo still got them for each park.

2570
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,180
Yeah. Mostly indoors, which is kind of.

2571
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,780
Yes, it's weird. Yeah. It's like a line to get indoors.

2572
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,980
Yeah. There's this picture.

2573
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:39,220
Yes. In Tomorrowland of a really long line.

2574
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:41,460
Yes. To get into the smoking room.

2575
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,220
Yeah. Smoking room, too.

2576
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,020
Just that phrase. Wow.

2577
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:46,780
Strange. That's interesting.

2578
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:50,060
I'm trying to think of what I would prefer as a smoker.

2579
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,140
I guess I'm a smoker.

2580
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,340
I don't care about secondhand smoke.

2581
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,460
Or maybe I do.

2582
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,820
Maybe I think it's too much.

2583
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,900
It can be irritating to the eyes.

2584
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,700
That's true. Because then it's inside.

2585
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,700
Everything smells. Your hair, your clothes.

2586
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,940
It all depends on the ventilation, I guess.

2587
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,420
Yeah. But still, it's interesting.

2588
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:09,940
And Shanghai seemingly.

2589
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:11,580
No, wait, Shanghai is a ton, as you said.

2590
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,700
Hong Kong, I think, has none.

2591
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,540
And they they pin it on covid protocols.

2592
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:18,580
So I don't know if they'll ever come back.

2593
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:20,300
That seems weird to me. Hong Kong is nothing.

2594
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:22,460
And Shanghai is the most anywhere.

2595
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,140
Yeah. Very interesting.

2596
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:26,180
Mm hmm. So who knows?

2597
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,820
What will happen? Who knows?

2598
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:30,100
There was a sub request when this topic

2599
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,740
one and was suggested.

2600
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:35,740
And I feel like I have to give it a little a little time.

2601
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,820
That is from Gunnar 420. Of course.

2602
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:42,300
Thanks for subscribing to Club 3 Gunnar 420.

2603
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:45,060
And and his reply was there.

2604
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,100
I don't know.

2605
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,900
The reply was a contrast that with where the current cool spots are

2606
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:53,140
for vapors and weed smokers to go in the park currently.

2607
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,620
L.O.L.

2608
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:58,860
Um, so I did try to think about this a little bit.

2609
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:00,460
And I did a little bit of research.

2610
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:04,100
I watched a video called Getting Lit at Disneyland

2611
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,500
on the channel Plugplay TV.

2612
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,820
This is part of a series called Hijacked.

2613
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,340
Apostrophic A apostrophe D.

2614
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:14,100
The host of the show is life being dest.

2615
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:20,420
And I learned from this, first of all, that this particular host was really

2616
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:23,940
getting hyped to get into the park because she

2617
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,980
she was going to try to bring in her blinkers.

2618
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:29,540
Oh, bring in my blinkers.

2619
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,940
So does that mean?

2620
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,420
Not sure. Not sure.

2621
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:37,980
But if if this person is considered a vape

2622
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:40,540
fluencer, then,

2623
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:46,220
you know, maybe blinkers are popular or easier to hide or something.

2624
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:51,860
And from what I gleaned from this video and I encourage everyone to watch all

2625
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,420
19 and a half minutes.

2626
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:57,940
Oh, my God. Of this Getting Lit at Disneyland video.

2627
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:03,100
I think if this video is correct, the current cool spot for vapors

2628
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,340
is the bathroom. Really?

2629
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,460
OK, bathrooms.

2630
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,220
I think it's just still the bathrooms.

2631
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:11,580
Yeah, because ultimately, you know, I mean, unless you're really just

2632
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:15,060
throwing it out there. But, you know,

2633
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:18,180
life being dest doesn't want to get kicked out of the park forever.

2634
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,340
You know, she's still being discreet.

2635
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:23,860
She did refer to smoking in the rides, too.

2636
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:28,940
I think if you're vaping in a ride, it's pirates as the guy that we referred to.

2637
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:31,660
Yeah. I don't know where you do it now in a post Barbosa era.

2638
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,500
But I think maybe Haunted Mansion, you're saying.

2639
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:37,340
We're talking dark rides, I think.

2640
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,300
And I don't take this from me because I can't. I wouldn't.

2641
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,980
I don't think I would get away from get away with it.

2642
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:46,500
But if you also if you're like, if you feel like you're discreet,

2643
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:50,340
if you're a pro YouTuber vape person,

2644
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:53,140
then you could probably like spit those out, suck it in really fast.

2645
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:56,140
You got you got to be dexterous with the pens, I think.

2646
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,940
Yeah, yeah. I think.

2647
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:01,700
Well, first off, if you're getting the pens through the metal detector at all

2648
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,940
and second, I think that's maybe that's what's up with the blinkers.

2649
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:08,180
Yeah. Maybe blinkers can't get detected.

2650
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:13,100
And second, it seems like if you are making a YouTube video about it,

2651
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:17,300
you're ignoring the first rule of just be cool about it, man.

2652
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,380
Like, maybe keep it to yourself.

2653
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,900
Well, that's what, you know, she didn't to her credit.

2654
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:25,140
She didn't film when she did it on the rides.

2655
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:28,100
Now, is this more of a light issue? Possibly. Yeah.

2656
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,580
Still stopped and did some cool poses in the bathroom.

2657
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:35,660
Just because you're in a bathroom stall doesn't mean you can't take great selfies.

2658
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:40,380
And if it's in the California stall, a perfect place for it.

2659
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,140
Yeah. Well, that would be yours.

2660
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,500
Maybe that's where you vape.

2661
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,460
But I think I think I would vape in that stall. Yeah.

2662
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:49,780
I would do. Yeah. So you have your fruity pebbles.

2663
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,380
The vape food.

2664
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:53,180
I'm not nicotine fruity pebbles.

2665
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:56,460
Oh, well, you're just thinking about a bowl where you see you were

2666
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:00,660
sneaking an illicit sprite before eleven thirty in the morning.

2667
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,580
Yeah. Yeah. It would be that stall.

2668
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:05,580
A bowl. I'm not smoking a bowl. Eating a bowl.

2669
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:07,820
OK. Fruity pebbles.

2670
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:08,700
That's how Mike played.

2671
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:10,460
But you still are discreet because you're well.

2672
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:11,540
I brought this in from. Yeah.

2673
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:15,180
Yeah. So I don't want to get caught for your fruity pebbles YouTube channel.

2674
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:16,860
Not a bad idea for you.

2675
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:19,180
No, look, it might happen.

2676
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,340
Might be no other option.

2677
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:21,180
Might come to that.

2678
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:23,660
So that's my best guess for 20.

2679
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:24,420
But I don't know.

2680
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,020
I don't know if I can really judge things off of the hijacked series.

2681
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,780
I wouldn't do it on the rides.

2682
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:33,100
I don't even like sitting next to someone holding their giant phone on rides.

2683
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:34,980
Or their baby, apparently.

2684
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:37,100
Or, uh, no, no.

2685
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:39,060
I I'm at Disneyland.

2686
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,860
I know it's the children's place.

2687
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:42,780
Like they they own the place.

2688
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:46,180
But you said you told Mike, make sure you're courteous.

2689
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:52,020
Well, I think it's if you know your child is scared of boats and darkness.

2690
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:54,220
It's like, don't take them on dark boat ride.

2691
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:57,020
That's all I'm at being courteous to the children,

2692
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:00,060
because I've seen plenty of parents force their kid on something

2693
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:00,860
they're terrified.

2694
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,300
Yeah. And don't do that.

2695
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,340
Very common.

2696
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:07,100
But I also I've seen people live streaming from the parks.

2697
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:11,140
And I know it's a thing where you talk to the chat.

2698
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:15,140
But if you talk to the chat when you are on a ride, you are a psycho.

2699
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,580
That is weird.

2700
01:40:16,580 --> 01:40:20,580
You seen that? I have seen that in person or on on on YouTube.

2701
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:23,340
OK, like Jesus Christ, no one wants to hear.

2702
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,180
Stop talking.

2703
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:25,380
Wow. I'm on camera.

2704
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:27,940
We want to see the ride. Who are you talking like?

2705
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:30,460
What's what's Gunnar 420 saying?

2706
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:31,980
Oh, we got a oh, we got a boulder coming.

2707
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,420
I missed it. OK. Oh, shoot.

2708
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,060
I wasn't filming. I'm sorry.

2709
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,700
Thanks for catching Gunnar.

2710
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:37,820
Make sure you shout it out a little.

2711
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:39,500
You could give me a warning.

2712
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,940
Hey, tell me ahead of time next time, Gunnar.

2713
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,860
So I mean, do we I think we covered it pretty good.

2714
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:51,100
Unless there's anything floating out there of like, what's the dream smoking spot?

2715
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:55,980
I genuinely think mine now is is Captain Jack.

2716
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:58,780
I'm going in a little cubby with Captain Jack.

2717
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,740
That's probably right.

2718
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:02,420
Just, you know, living on the wild side.

2719
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2720
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:06,700
I'm trying to think. Yeah.

2721
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,740
Jason, you have one off the top.

2722
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:12,620
I do. And it would be the rare instance where I would choose the non swinging

2723
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:17,860
Mickey's fun wheel cars, the stationary Mickey's fun wheel cars,

2724
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:20,860
because you just go slowly up and down swinging.

2725
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:22,660
Or non smoking or not.

2726
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,300
Yeah. Oh, yeah, exactly.

2727
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,460
Well, that would then you would get four.

2728
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:30,620
Like if you had to pick swing or non and then you had to pick non smoking or

2729
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:33,580
smoke like that, that might get confusing.

2730
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,500
And it already takes a lot of load.

2731
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,380
Everyone on and off there.

2732
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:42,380
But I'm just saying, I think it would be too dangerous to do on a swinging car.

2733
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:47,780
But on a stationary car, you'd be taking that first wheel to flavor town, you know,

2734
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:51,700
because you burn yourself on the swinging car.

2735
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,020
Yeah, you burn yourself or you light a small fire, burn your shirt.

2736
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,100
You know, that would be a big problem.

2737
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:57,700
Yeah.

2738
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,340
I think that I'm going to say

2739
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:04,500
I would like to smoke in the pre show on Guardians of the Galaxy

2740
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,260
in the room with Rocket.

2741
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,500
Get you amped up a little high.

2742
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,820
I don't know, because he's like a gruff character.

2743
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:14,260
I feel like if we all were in the little room smoking together.

2744
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:16,340
Would make your voice sound like like his.

2745
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:18,340
Yeah, it would be more right.

2746
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,340
Yeah. Enhance your rocket impression.

2747
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:24,180
Yeah. So and then you feel more like the guard.

2748
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:27,140
I know the Guardians don't smoke and Marvel characters don't smoke anymore.

2749
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:30,300
But a lot of Marvel characters used to smoke Wolverine.

2750
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:33,700
I mean, he does in the first X-Men movie, but Wolverine's a cigar guy.

2751
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,660
Yeah. Nick Fury, too. Nick Fury, cigar guy.

2752
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:39,060
These are gruff characters.

2753
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:41,460
Rockets had a cigar or two in his days.

2754
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:43,140
Yeah, but I bet he stole them.

2755
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,140
Well,

2756
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:45,140
sure.

2757
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,460
So, yeah, I want in the pre show on Guardians, I think.

2758
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,340
That's I mean, it's a nice little study.

2759
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,380
I don't think I think you got it.

2760
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:55,860
I think you cigar it in there.

2761
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:57,940
That's what I got to not to force you're right.

2762
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:00,940
Yeah, I think when I when I think study, I think cigar.

2763
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,700
Yeah. Marvel care.

2764
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,860
Again, all these Marvel characters, I said cigars.

2765
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:06,060
They're all cigar guys from the old days.

2766
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,140
You find them down into the haunted mansion ballroom also

2767
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:11,420
and kind of like the seat next to like certain

2768
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:14,180
try to like have one sided conversations with some of the ghosts.

2769
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:18,340
Yeah. If it's like a stogie with the ghosts, there's like, you know,

2770
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:22,500
the Arnold Schwarzenegger thing where he's got the largest phallic cigar possible.

2771
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:26,260
That he smokes like one of those, I think. Yeah, it could do.

2772
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,220
Yeah. And you know what else?

2773
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:32,340
I mean, like if you could have a celebratory cigar with the fast gang after.

2774
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:36,060
Oh, God. A cigarette on the way in and a cigar on the way out.

2775
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:36,700
Yeah. Yeah.

2776
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:38,980
Cigarettes to give you the like amp you up a little bit.

2777
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,700
Party. Cigar to celebrate.

2778
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:41,900
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

2779
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:43,820
That's good. Wow.

2780
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:47,260
Yeah. So I mean, because they say that you're part of the team.

2781
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:49,460
But are you really until you've smoked a cigar?

2782
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:51,780
No cigar to Corona.

2783
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:53,100
Dominic Toretto's drink.

2784
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,260
They should really just hand it.

2785
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,020
There should be a little component on the part,

2786
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:58,900
like a little compartment on the party bus where those pop out at you.

2787
01:43:58,940 --> 01:43:59,620
Yeah. Yeah.

2788
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:02,900
Yeah. People you've never that you could never close that right.

2789
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,860
If that happened. Yeah. No.

2790
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:06,900
They should let Jack Nicholson smoke

2791
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,860
court side because he's back at the Lakers game.

2792
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:10,700
And I couldn't be more thrilled about this.

2793
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:13,980
Yes, that was very exciting when that was two games up to now.

2794
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:16,380
But they should let him light up.

2795
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:18,340
Yeah. Court side.

2796
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,820
Yes. Only only him.

2797
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:22,660
Only him. But yeah, I like that you can't you can't do it anywhere in the arena

2798
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:25,500
unless you were one man at the dead center.

2799
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,340
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

2800
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:30,540
Agreed. Well, that's our smoking policy.

2801
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:32,820
And that's our exploration of smoking policies.

2802
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:34,940

Topics for June, please.

2810
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:54,420
And if they provoke a certain story, then they do.
