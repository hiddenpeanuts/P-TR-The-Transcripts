1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,920

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,240
it's a very merry podcast the ride.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,320
["The Ride Theme Song"]

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,320
["The Ride Theme Song"]

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,760
Welcome to a special holiday podcast, The Ride.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,840
It's a podcast about theme parks hosted by

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,920
we three kings of boring your partners

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
when you tell them about the show.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm Scott Gardner, there's Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,040
Yes, people say go off, King, when we start telling them

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,980
about, I don't know, Randy Gerber or the new ride system

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,000
coming soon to Universal Japan's Donkey Kong land.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
How many times have there been those partner conversations

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,160
where like, okay, I've wrapped my head around

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,700
that you listen to this theme park podcast,

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,400
but how come everything you tell me about it

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,920
is not about theme parks?

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Why are there stories about Randy Gerber?

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,960
Who is Randy Gerber?

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
Well, the show exists in a universe

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,880
where everyone on the planet is deeply aware

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
of Randy Gerber lore.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,840
Yeah, well, that's, I think the partner,

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,240
if they're a good partner,

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,760
they are at least paying attention

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,480
that these topics seem to be off topic

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,040
for the premise of the podcast,

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
if they're paying attention.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,760
Yeah, yeah, but in a way,

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,360
it's like it's all usurped it as the topic.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Yeah.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
Jason Sheridan, a jolly,

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,880
Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,560
Jolly old elf Jason Sheridan.

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,520
I say this, Parsha,

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,240
because you are wearing a green stocking cap

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,600
just when I turned to.

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,200
Yeah, this was actually

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,320
when I was doing this Sleepy Time Bear

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,040
for the holiday party.

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,160
It was in a two pack.

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,680
It was a red one and a green one.

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,800
Brett, can I get that image I sent you?

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Oh, and this is a good time to point out,

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,800
this is a video episode.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
It's a video episode.

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,560
We haven't done this in a while,

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,520
a little special thing for everybody

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
for the end of the year,

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,600
a holiday special.

59
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
You can find this on the Forever Dog YouTube.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Uh oh.

61
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,000
And Jason, we've just pulled up,

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
or we've encountered an immediate error.

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,160
There's a big queue on it.

64
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
That's what Jason wanted to show us.

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,880
He wanted to show us that we're approaching a storm.

67
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
The truth.

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,560
Uh oh, Jason.

69
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,760
Yeah, the storm is coming.

70
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,960
Jason's big reveal at the end of the year

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,720
is that he's a queue guy now.

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
There it is.

73
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,400
Ooh, yay.

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,880
This kind of put me over the edge

75
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,720
of buying this sleeping cap package,

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,960
this insane looking old man wearing it.

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,040
So wait, when you say put you over the edge,

78
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,640
it meant you're like, I have to have it

79
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,960
now that I saw this older man?

80
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,440
We're looking at a very Benny Hill type,

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
like leery, that's how I read it,

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,320
is a like ooh, hummina hummina kind of old man.

83
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,360
But I don't mean to apply the sexual nature to him.

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,560
He's really just like,

85
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,000
he's excited about having both red and green stocking caps.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Yeah, so it also looks a lot like,

87
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,520
almost like a pirate,

88
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,680
if it wasn't to have the big ball at the end of it.

89
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,640
It would be very pirate style.

90
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,600
He's the old guy on the pirate ship.

91
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,440
Yeah.

92
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,520
Yeah, he's the...

93
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,000
So you wanted to, you used this guy, Jason,

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,640
as your style icon.

95
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,480
Yeah, as my guiding light, as my newer star, if you will.

96
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,760
Beautiful.

97
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,640
Well, there is the first use of the visuals,

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,120
which I think will come into play,

99
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,600
and again, go to the Forever Dog YouTube channel

100
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
to check this out.

101
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,040
Thought it'd be fun to do at the end of the year,

102
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,720
especially because it's gonna be a very clip-oriented show,

103
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520
and beyond that,

104
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,320
everybody's dressed in their holiday finest.

105
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,240
That's right, yeah.

106
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,840
Jason's cap has been covered.

107
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,040
I am wearing, I've got a Santa hat,

108
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,920
I've got a light-up Christmas light necklace or something,

109
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,760
which I got from this weird thing I went to with Eva last night.

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,120
I can't, okay, Frosty's Christmas bar.

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,440
I was saying to her, I will never remember what this is,

112
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
despite being at it right now.

113
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,760
It was called Frosty, this is in Hollywood,

114
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,480
it's on Hollywood Boulevard, called Frosty's,

115
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,200
but there's no presence of Frosty in it.

116
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,960
You never meet a Frosty.

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,640
You do meet the Grinch, even I met the Grinch,

118
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,360
so I'm still reeling from that this morning.

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,560
It seemed like there was a lot of Grinch stuff,

120
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
there's a walk-around Grinch,

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,000
but also the drinks are named after the Grinch,

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,240
so it feels like they wanted to maybe call it something

123
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Grinch-related, because there's so much Grinch stuff,

124
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,400
but they were worried about a lawsuit from the Sears estate.

125
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,680
That might be right, yes, yes.

126
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,320
So it's a little off-brand, maybe tech,

127
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,520
they do say it out loud, but it's more about,

128
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
you can't copyright a green fuzzy room,

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
that's a thing they have, is a green fuzzy hallway.

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,200
Oh yeah, that's really Grinch-like.

131
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,160
Yeah, yeah, yes, it's like being inside his,

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
well not his, I don't know if he's furry on the inside,

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,160
it's at least like being in the Grinch's butt crack.

134
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,600
You think, oh, okay, right, in the crack,

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,120
you think it's fully Grinch fur.

136
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,280
I guess probably. At least some of it,

137
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,320
or does the fur. Unless it's like he's like a baboon.

138
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,560
Oh yeah, wait, there'd be spots, I guess.

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,280
Maybe it's like you're being squeezed

140
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,400
between the Grinch's legs, that's what it's like.

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,680
Okay, yeah.

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,960
You think the Grinch is baboon,

143
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,160
do you think he has the big red ass, like a baboon?

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,200
Well, we do see his butt, I guess,

145
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,160
now that I'm thinking about it,

146
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,800
so I guess he doesn't have a red baboon ass.

147
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,760
Do you see his butt, does he turn around

148
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
in the Jim Carrey movie?

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
You see his little bottom?

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Yeah, he's not wearing pants.

151
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,160
He kind of has a little duck tail.

152
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,480
I guess you see a lot of it,

153
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,960
but I can't imagine there's a part in this film

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,120
where he like spreads.

155
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
Yeah, I don't think you know

156
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,080
what's really going on deep in there.

157
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,920
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,480
I'm so glad I brought this up.

159
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,000
Really glad, yeah, can we add it in me saying seat

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,360
instead of ass, because it's Christmas time?

161
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,760
I should have said his little seat.

162
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,600
Okay, yeah, so is there a part in The Grinch

163
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,520
where the Grinch spreads his seat

164
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,880
so you can see his little seat hole?

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
His potentially. Hole, hole, hole.

166
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,760
I don't think, I don't remember it.

167
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,960
If it was in there, I don't remember it

168
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,200
is what I'm saying.

169
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,240
I wanna point out one more thing about my wardrobe.

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,000
I told everybody, let's all dress like a little holiday,

171
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,760
and I was like, do I have a good holiday sweater?

172
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,200
And I think I do, it's like a red and black sweater,

173
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,280
but beyond that what it is is this is an official part,

174
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,560
this is an official employee sweater

175
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,720
of my beloved Fry's Electronics,

176
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,800
which was given to me by listener Eric,

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,040
awesome, generous listener who we met in Vegas,

178
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,080
who gave us all this awesome stuff.

179
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,160
Thank you, Eric.

180
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,880
A highlight of the year in general,

181
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,120
meeting so many great folks, people who came out to our,

182
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,040
who traveled to our live shows,

183
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
so I wanna thank everybody who did that,

184
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,040
and Eric, it fits great, perfect excuse to wear it.

185
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
Mike, you're wearing something

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
that brings us into the topic.

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah, I have my Ninja Turtle Christmas sweatshirt on.

188
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,880
It's got all four of the brothers,

189
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
and they have Santa hats on,

190
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,040
and they just look very jolly.

191
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,280
I think I forgot that that's a way to refer to them,

192
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,320
is the brothers.

193
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,560
They're four brothers.

194
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,920
Yeah, wait, yeah they are, I never think about that.

195
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,520
They are part of the same.

196
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,800
They're the same, yeah.

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
I mean, I don't know.

198
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,960
Are they though?

199
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,240
Do we know, were they just four baby turtles

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
who were around each other?

201
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
I don't remember if there's a specific canon

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,480
that says all four of the baby turtles were related,

203
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,080
but they're all raised as brothers.

204
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,280
If people were adopted, they're still brothers.

205
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,600
That's true, okay, okay, yes, absolutely.

206
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,200
Depending on what turtle,

207
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,120
I mean, the original Ninja Turtles figures,

208
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
all four of them had different colors, shades of green.

209
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,880
They were all different greens?

210
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
Yeah. Interesting.

211
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,960
But not in the movie, they all are sort of the same color.

212
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,800
And then the comic.

213
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,760
So you're saying that when they started to produce

214
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
some of these things,

215
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,880
such as a straight to video Christmas special,

216
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,080
maybe it made more sense to just like,

217
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,000
hey, make eight suits and paint them all,

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,040
and we will put different masks on them,

219
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,080
and that is how we will accomplish this video.

220
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,840
It's possible some things were practical.

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,000
Like, also practical was initially,

222
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,400
turtles were all red bandanas.

223
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,640
They all wore four red bandanas in the comic.

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,480
And then I think it was Playmates toys or the cartoon

225
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,480
are like, how kids gonna tell these turtles apart?

226
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
And they're like, I don't know,

227
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
four different color of bandanas?

228
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,080
And they're like, yeah, right, fine.

229
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,960
So I need, that was not even a full meeting

230
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,240
to figure that out. Probably not.

231
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
So I'm just saying, you probably different continuity

232
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,720
has different answers exactly

233
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,640
if they were all four related, technically.

234
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,640
One of my friends of my grandmother many years ago

235
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,240
was really into making ceramics, like as a hobby.

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,640
And she gave, she made Ninja Turtle ornaments one year.

237
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,640
And my brother got the red bandana, which is Raphael.

238
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,480
And I got the yellow bandana, which is not real.

239
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,480
But even back then I knew,

240
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,360
you just tell a kindly old lady, thank you.

241
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,320
Was it not even close to orange?

242
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
No, it's bright, yeah.

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
I think it was supposed to be orangeish maybe,

244
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,880
but it's pretty much yellow.

245
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,240
This is a cut one, that's Rembrandt.

246
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,120
Yeah, that's pretty good.

247
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,840
There is somebody who wears the yellow now,

248
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,440
I believe in the comics.

249
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,320
I believe the character's name is Jenica.

250
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
And we're gonna cut this out if I'm wrong,

251
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,400
so no one will overhear it.

252
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,560
But also on the original arcade machine,

253
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,160
Michelangelo's bandana was much more yellow

254
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,440
than it was orange.

255
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,000
And it did bother me.

256
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,840
It was very annoying to me as a kid.

257
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,880
So maybe it's a pseudo Michelangelo.

258
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,480
So this lady maybe went to a bowling alley

259
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
and saw the Ninja Turtles arcade,

260
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,120
and she was like, what colors are the four brothers?

261
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,760
And she was like, ah, yellow, got it.

262
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,400
So maybe she was right in relation to that.

263
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,480
Yeah, based on physical media,

264
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,160
that's a place she could go.

265
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
30 years ago, where was she going to see the turtles?

266
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,600
She doesn't have the internet.

267
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,440
That's true.

268
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,400
And if her film is not in theaters at that moment.

269
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,840
What's she gonna do but go to the local bowling alley

270
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,880
and write down the colors.

271
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
Having a Paul Maul and a Tom Collins

272
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
and looking up turtles, but dirty turtles arcade cabinets.

273
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,800
Dirty turtles arcade cabinets, yeah.

274
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,440
You're right about Janica, by the way.

275
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
Thank God. So no need to.

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Because I am behind all my newer turtle comics.

277
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,640
Oh boy.

278
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
Well, yeah, well, I think we're all very 90s focused

279
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,440
in our turtle awareness.

280
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,000
The basics, the brothers, as we say.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,280
And what we're doing today.

282
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,760
So we've done this kind of thing for the holidays

283
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,640
here and there, and I always enjoyed doing it.

284
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,200
I think in the first year of the show,

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,120
we did kind of a pile of clips from Christmas specials.

286
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,640
We did a live show that was of that nature.

287
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,800
And that's kind of what we're doing here,

288
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,920
but maybe a little bit more guided.

289
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,600
A guided meditation on all things surrounding

290
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,520
and centering on a very special moment.

291
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,920
I think that came up the very first year that we did this.

292
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,960
One of, I think, the best things that ever happened

293
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,320
in a Disney World Christmas special.

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,160
We're going to talk about something from the 1990

295
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,400
Walt Disney World Very Merry Christmas Parade,

296
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,920
which is a special performance of Santa Claus

297
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,800
is Coming to Town, led by the Ninja Turtles,

298
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,200
who are all, the brothers are all led in this performance

299
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,080
by the great Alan Thicke.

300
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,160
I'm sure we talked about it in the first year.

301
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,960
Maybe we've covered this nine times.

302
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
It's possible, yeah.

303
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,280
I think we proposed this as one of the greatest moments

304
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,600
in Disney World history.

305
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
When we discussed Disney World 50.

306
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,240
It is.

307
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,080
And I stand by that.

308
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,680
It got trounced in ultimately the poll

309
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,480
by you tugging yourself with your mom

310
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,360
while Gloria Estefan,

311
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,480
well, from a Gloria Estefan music video.

312
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,520
So that's ultimately number one,

313
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,000
but I don't think it was in there.

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,240
They got votes.

315
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,840
Yeah, so yeah, no, it's the most exciting.

316
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,040
Obviously, we're men of a certain age,

317
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
as I said on our episode when we were talking

318
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,520
to Trevor Zammet, who runs the Ninja Turtles line at that time.

319
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,680
Men of a certain age.

320
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,320
We were talking to a Turtles person.

321
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Specifically, a formative time in our childhoods

322
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,920
seeing the Ninja Turtles at MGM Studios was insane.

323
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,280
I know, something we still,

324
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,320
we have not actually done an episode about is whatever,

325
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,800
I don't actually know what the show was

326
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,240
at Disney MGM Studios when the Turtles entered

327
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
that incredible fold.

328
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,080
When you see that photo, oh my God,

329
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,640
it's Little Mermaid and Eric and the dinosaurs

330
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,040
and whoever else was in that big group, the Muppets.

331
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,800
I mean, it would have been a stellar lineup

332
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
without the Ninja Turtles,

333
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,560
and then that just pushes it over the edge.

334
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,120
It's a cascade of nostalgia at that point.

335
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,480
And we did two very recent attractions.

336
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,240
So now it's time to go way back, 23 years.

337
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
Yeah, we did it.

338
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,920
We covered things from this decade.

339
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
33 years, what am I saying?

340
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,320
Now we're, yeah, now we're back on our shit.

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Back to the 90s.

342
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,000
Before we do that though,

343
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,040
we're cozy in our Christmas sweaters and Christmas caps.

344
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,920
I also threw out if you guys wanted to provide

345
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,640
any sort of holiday snack, not to the listeners, obviously.

346
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,200
Although, you know what, let's curate it.

347
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You can get whatever you want at home.

348
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,160
You know, Jason has selected something

349
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
and you could go buy this and follow along with us.

350
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
So you're experiencing what we're experiencing

351
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,080
clip-wise and taste-wise.

352
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,360
And I believe you brought something

353
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,640
that came up in a second gate recently,

354
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,840
the one, the normal Today Show episode that we did,

355
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,800
Today Cafe.

356
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,000
These are Goldfish, limited edition elf.

357
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,520
It's the 20th anniversary of elf.

358
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,080
Right now these are maple syrup grams.

359
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,960
And the thing is these taste pretty good if you like maple.

360
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,240
But I ate about six of them

361
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,280
and I have not been able to stop smelling maple on my hands.

362
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,680
Oh, so you're saying it permanently stains your hands

363
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,520
with maple.

364
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,280
Yeah, you really gotta scrub your hands.

365
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,760
Well, I did notice, we started recording,

366
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,160
before we started recording,

367
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,680
you reached into the bag and got some snacks

368
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,720
and then were licking your fingers immediately after.

369
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,400
Well, I was trying to get it off.

370
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,280
That was less about savoring the taste

371
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,920
and more about like, I have electronics to operate.

372
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,480
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
Oh, so we're all screwed then.

374
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,280
All right, you know what, maybe I'll try to,

375
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,160
I'll take mine with my left hand.

376
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah.

377
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,400
I'll leave a clean hand for the laptop.

378
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
I don't want this, now I don't want this.

379
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm scared now.

380
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,880
You've turned me off to them.

381
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,440
We can take a bathroom break to scrub our little grabbers.

382
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh my God, Jason calling our hands our grabbers too.

383
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,240
It's a real creepy Christmas so far.

384
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,400
Please, bus our seats and hands our little grabbers.

385
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,440
Little grabbers.

386
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,240
The way I'd been eating these at home

387
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,120
was I was pouring them into a rocks glass

388
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,600
and then drinking them essentially.

389
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
And then I would forget.

390
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, by drinking, I see.

391
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,840
You drank the crack.

392
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,840
You drank the anniversary goldfish dessert crackers.

393
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,040
Baked graham snacks celebrating a classic holiday film.

394
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,880
Wow.

395
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,960
Wait, when did Elf come out?

396
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,040
He said 20 years.

397
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,920
20 years ago, winter 2003.

398
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,080
It was 2003, not 2002?

399
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,920
I don't know.

400
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,560
Oh, wait, let's see.

401
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,120
Oh wait, I think maybe you're right.

402
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,960
Okay, I wanna make sure they were cracked on there.

403
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,800
They're not gonna put our goldfish

404
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,080
limited edition crackers unless it's a 20th anniversary.

405
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,400
We're hallmark cards.

406
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm doing it for a 21st.

407
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,080
We're all dead.

408
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,800
Elf is dead to us at 21.

409
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,120
Yeah, who gives a shit?

410
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,720
We love it.

411
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,560
All right, you know what?

412
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm gonna pop these.

413
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,160
I'll weigh in on these.

414
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,520
Now that I know the risks of eating them,

415
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,840
I'll do it mid-clip and I'll try to do it away from the mic.

416
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,840
So anyways, we're going to micro-target focus

417
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,520
on this moment from the Disney special.

418
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,760
Do you want my snack?

419
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,040
Oh wait, oh, there's another snack.

420
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,880
I didn't realize.

421
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,560
Oh my God, I'm starting to neglect.

422
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,680
Christmas crunch.

423
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,520
Family size.

424
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,600
So matter of fact.

425
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,960
Captain Crunch's Christmas crunch.

426
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,600
Wow, he's in a scarf.

427
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,960
There's fun holiday shapes.

428
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,800
What do we got there?

429
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,620
We got trees, we got hats.

430
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
This is quite festive.

431
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
I got bowls here.

432
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,080
We got the whole thing ready to go.

433
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,280
Where can listeners find these particular snacks?

434
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,600
Are they at your local Target or CVS or something

435
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,080
or must they consult Deal Vibes to attract the snacks?

436
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,520
I did not get any Deal Vibes things

437
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,840
that I could quickly get procure.

438
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,520
So I think these are just normally at a Target.

439
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
This is a family size.

440
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,080
That was the only option.

441
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,400
If we wanna just rip through this family size box

442
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,840
over the next hour and a half, that's fine.

443
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,880
We can.

444
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,160
It seems like a lot, but I don't know.

445
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
Luckily we'll have plastic spoons here

446
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,560
so we don't have to get the Christmas crunch

447
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,440
stained on our little grabbers.

448
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,280
So that's good.

449
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,640
I was okay so far, but the grabbers were not so active,

450
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,480
I would say.

451
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,200
I tried to go for the palm and my palm,

452
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,280
no, I smell a little bit.

453
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,560
I smell a little on the palm.

454
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,640
Yeah.

455
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,200
Might also be the open bag.

456
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,160
Mike, don't forget your maple.

457
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,680
There's gonna be, hold on, hold on.

458
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm scared of the maple now

459
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,360
because I feel like dogs in the neighborhood

460
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
are gonna chase me.

461
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,360
It's a good thing this is our last one for the year

462
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,440
because if you get mulled right after we record this,

463
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,280
it'll be tougher to keep going.

464
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
This is vitamin D milk too,

465
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,400
so we'll be getting rich vitamins, nutritious vitamins.

466
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,120
Do you wanna, camera wise, are you being blocked

467
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,160
by the box and are maybe you comfortably comfortable

468
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
being blocked by the box?

469
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,760
I don't know, Brett, am I being blocked

470
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,040
by this Christmas crunch box?

471
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,920
Oh no. Oh no.

472
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,200
We gotta adjust the camera for it.

473
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,400
Ah.

474
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,800
All right, we gotta wind it up.

475
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
Our thanks to Brett Bowen at Forever Dog

476
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
and everybody at Forever Dog,

477
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,720
especially for getting a video one going here.

478
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,280
Is this all stuff that we leave in?

479
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,920
I was gonna say, he could, we could end up canceling.

480
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,640
Oh, hey, it's Brett everybody, Brett's here.

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
We could leave it in, we could not leave it in.

482
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,720
See how it plays.

483
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,800
It's up to us, I suppose.

484
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

485
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,160
Leave some, cut some.

486
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Well, you know what, distribute your spoons and all.

487
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Well, we'll cut this, we'll come back with some clips.

488
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,880
Wow, we're back, we have our bowls.

489
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,080
These are so much fun.

490
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
I'll try to tip it toward the camera.

491
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Look how much fun we're, it's not just the boring

492
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,440
yellowish beige of typical Captain Crunch.

493
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,560
Right, so it's not the normal crunch berries

494
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,720
with blue and purple, it's red and green.

495
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,320
Yeah, yeah.

496
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,880
So this is great, we're doing something the listeners hate,

497
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,920
which is eating on microphone.

498
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,120
Maybe I won't touch it again for a minute.

499
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,320
And we're gonna do some clips,

500
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,600
something else people might hate because it's audio.

501
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,280
We'll make it work for audio too, it'll be fine.

502
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,360
Okay, oh yes, go ahead.

503
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,800
I'm gonna have, I just spooned out one of these goldfish

504
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,560
and the maple is, the smell is insane.

505
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,920
Boy. It is like a Yankee candle.

506
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,640
It is, yeah, it is like a candle store at the mall

507
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,880
during Christmas time.

508
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
Rolled away from the mic so you could eat Christmas crunch.

509
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Only condensed into one goldfish

510
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
and I would eat it without touching my little grabbers.

511
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Wow, so it smells a little crazy

512
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,360
when you spooned out the fish.

513
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,240
It's like, oh my God.

514
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,040
Did you eat a whole bag of these before?

515
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,080
I haven't finished the first bag yet.

516
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,760
You see, I did a Target pickup

517
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
and they duplicated some of the stuff.

518
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,440
So I ended up with like two razors,

519
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,960
two chocolate chip cookies, two elf things.

520
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,480
Whoa, and a partridge in a bear tree.

521
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,600
Two lemme rinse.

522
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,760
Two what?

523
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
Oh, lemme rinse.

524
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,120
It's a dishwasher.

525
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,120
You put it in with the soap, the detergent powder,

526
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,320
if you have hard water and it helps not get white stains.

527
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,960
The lemme, it's called lemme rinse?

528
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,920
It's called lemme rinse.

529
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,240
There's a whole line of lemme rinse.

530
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,080
Okay, maybe we need that.

531
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Is there a cute character or anything

532
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,720
or is it just pretty functional?

533
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,800
I know, unfortunately not.

534
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,960
Or at least that I can say.

535
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Well, lemme rinse your band from the show.

536
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,160
You don't qualify for more discussion.

537
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,920
All right, let's get into this moment,

538
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,480
this performance that we like so much.

539
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
And by the way, as with many great things

540
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
that we talk about and are aware of on the show,

541
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
we want to thank Doug Jones

542
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,480
for bringing this to our attention.

543
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,200
We're using the clip of it

544
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,640
that he pulled for Everything is Terrible

545
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,200
and on his channel, Oh My 80s.

546
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,280
So thanks, Doug.

547
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,320
Merry Christmas to ya.

548
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
So to set the scene a little bit,

549
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,920
this is from the 1990 Walt Disney World

550
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,520
Very Merry Christmas Parade.

551
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,760
Some of the other things happening

552
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,560
on that particular parade.

553
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,920
Urkel gets a special sneak preview of Splash Mountain.

554
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,600
Jeffrey Katzenberg, a young, on the way up,

555
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
Jeffrey Katzenberg introduces a preview

556
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,520
of The Rescuers Down Under.

557
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,960
Lee Greenwood sings a tribute to our Soldiers in the Gulf.

558
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,800
We get a little behind the scenes preview

559
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,120
of the Super Bowl halftime show for that year,

560
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,400
which is being produced by Disney.

561
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,760
They did like a It's a Small World themed halftime show

562
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,200
culminating in a performance by New Kids on the Block.

563
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,560
Do they do the song or do they do their own songs?

564
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,600
I think, all I, you know, I'd have to watch,

565
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,440
we gotta watch it.

566
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,640
This has occurred to me as something we should maybe,

567
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,880
actually listeners have said,

568
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,920
maybe tackling, tackling these Super Bowl halftime shows

569
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,440
that were produced by the Walt Disney Company

570
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,440
might be a fun thing to do for Super Bowl week.

571
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
So we'll talk about that.

572
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,200
Now as with many Disney holiday specials,

573
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,960
of course you've got Joan London

574
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,480
and you've got Regis Philbin,

575
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,440
who you think of as the ultimate Disney parade host.

576
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
But he's not the host, he's not up in the booth.

577
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,200
He's relegated to like man on the street bits,

578
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,280
really stealing the show, I would say,

579
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,600
to where it's like clear in the near future

580
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,200
they're gonna have to make a change,

581
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,080
make Regis the main guy.

582
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,640
And I feel like nobody else really,

583
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,360
they tried to go down a generation,

584
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,080
Melissa Joan Hart and Ben Savage,

585
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,680
and I think the audience spit it out.

586
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,520
They revolted.

587
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like two maple-y of goldfish grams.

588
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,560
I will not be eating another goldfish.

589
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,400
No, yeah.

590
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,560
The two might be, yeah,

591
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,320
my maple intake for the day is maybe set.

592
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,000
But anyway, why is Regis not hosting this thing?

593
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,760
Well, there's somebody occupying the chair

594
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,160
who's occupied the chair for a couple years

595
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,440
up to that point, and that is Alan Thicke.

596
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Alan Thicke, you probably know best

597
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,960
as the dad Jason Siever, I believe,

598
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,880
on the late 80s ABC sitcom, Growing Pains,

599
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,440
a Canadian performer.

600
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,680
You might also know him as the father of Robin Thicke,

601
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,120
who was on The Masked Singer.

602
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,640
He was on the Disney Christmas special

603
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,560
this very year, in fact.

604
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,800
So there is still a thick presence at Disney.

605
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,000
There's a very thick presence

606
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,800
for the Disney holiday specials to this day.

607
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,400
Yeah, he's saying an altered version

608
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,160
of his popular song is called Duck.

609
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,200
Oh, wait, fuck, I forgot that joke I was gonna make.

610
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,880
Oh, I'm so curious, can we get there?

611
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
Blurred lines.

612
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,560
If it's blurred lines.

613
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,400
You were doing a blurred lines joke?

614
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,240
Duck line?

615
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,320
I was gonna say duck lines,

616
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,080
and you're surrounded by all the duck, the ducks.

617
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,920
Duck lines. Duck.

618
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,760
I thought it was better.

619
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,080
You mean like when ducks walk in a line?

620
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,640
Well, like, yeah, so it's like Donald, Daisy,

621
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,440
Huey, Dewey, Louie.

622
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,000
It's not, you weren't going for turd lines,

623
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,920
like a bunch of real ducks in the park,

624
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,200
all left turds on the ground.

625
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
Oh, that's good.

626
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,680
He's following with a broom and cleaning them up.

627
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,320
Here's another. That's more thoughtful.

628
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,400
Here's another one that Disney would not allow

629
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
a little joke about the theme park's long lines.

630
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,120
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

631
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,960
Well, they don't hear lines at all.

632
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,360
I hate these long lines.

633
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,480
Yeah, uh-huh.

634
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,920
No, yeah, they wouldn't refer to it.

635
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,240
I think the whole calling them cues is a workaround

636
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,400
for even having to think of them that way.

637
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
Sorry, I do have to correct myself.

638
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,960
The company is called Lemme Shine.

639
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
I was using the rinse.

640
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,880
Lemme Shine Rinse.

641
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,760
So, you have hard water out there.

642
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,760
Look at the Lemme Shine.

643
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,200
New sponsor, fog it.

644
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,000
You have a coupon code.

645
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,800
Sometimes there's unpaid sponsors.

646
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,320
Coupon code shared in 20 for 20% off.

647
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,600
It goes right to your account.

648
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,440
Every time you use it, I get $20.

649
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,880
I was wondering why you brought it up.

650
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,720
I get it now.

651
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,680
Okay, you just get an extra one when you go to Target.

652
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
That's the perk.

653
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
Yeah, I just keep getting it.

654
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,160
Two.

655
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,720
My water could be twice as hard and it would work.

656
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,240
So anyway, just a little reminder about Alan Thicke.

657
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,600
And he's like, you know, he's this very like,

658
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,000
kind of like a cheesy, like, you know, cocky,

659
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,880
kind of like born to be on TV kind of fella.

660
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,360
Very dad energy, usually clad in sweaters

661
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,520
and kind of like 80s puffy hair.

662
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,560
Looks a lot like my father at the time.

663
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,200
And he's mainly up in the booth tossing out one liners.

664
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
Very dad, I'd say his style is very dad joke.

665
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,320
Right, he's what?

666
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,160
It's a dad vibe.

667
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,480
I think he's maybe around 40 at this time.

668
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,600
Not sure the exact age.

669
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,200
But anyway, there's a break in the broadcast.

670
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,840
They go back to the booth and he is, he's missing.

671
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,280
And unfortunately it's not, Regis doesn't rush in

672
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,880
to fill the empty chair, not yet.

673
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,840
We find out very quickly why he's missing.

674
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,600
Let's go to the first clip, Brett.

675
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,120
Alan Ninja Turtles won to see how this thing kicked off.

676
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,640
And I'm afraid I'm all alone right now.

677
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,000
Alan Thicke has temporarily disappeared,

678
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,520
but I suspect he might reappear,

679
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,000
where we least expect him very, very soon,

680
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
because we've got a great show planned

681
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,640
for the remainder of the morning.

682
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,520
In fact, right now I think I hear some familiar dudes

683
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
rolling in on Main Street USA.

684
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,360
That's where I would least expect him to be with dudes?

685
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,200
Yeah.

686
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,320
Oh my.

687
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,280
Al Bunga, it looks like the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles

688
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,480
who's joined the party.

689
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
See a familiar van.

690
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,640
They're in the party wagon, they're in the turtle van.

691
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,480
Wow.

692
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,560
It looks a little different than I remember it.

693
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, it's decorated for Christmas.

694
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,320
That's snowman on your head.

695
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
That's white.

696
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,160
There we go.

697
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,640
People is there too.

698
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,240
April is just minding her hour.

699
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,560
She doesn't get to be part of it.

700
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,400
Right.

701
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,600
Freak out.

702
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,320
I know that like the back of my head.

703
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,280
That's right up there with the like the splash mountain.

704
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,880
Well, you know it is a thrill when you go down.

705
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,520
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.

706
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,720
You know, that's got some viral love a couple of years ago

707
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,880
and I just wanna make sure that this one

708
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,120
is getting its proper due.

709
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,440
Oh yeah.

710
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,040
Cause that's, and I need to get it out of my brain

711
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,200
cause it'll be there forever.

712
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,680
You better not shout, don't pout, freak out.

713
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,360
What else to say for people just listening?

714
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,640
I mean, you're getting a lot of martial arts

715
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,240
influenced dancing, a lot of kicks involved.

716
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,080
I think they're doing great.

717
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,360
The suits are a very like pleasant,

718
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,640
cartoony variety of turtle suits, I would say.

719
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,800
It's like, it's the cartoon version.

720
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,640
Yeah, more so.

721
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,080
I mean, there were so many different suits around this time.

722
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,120
They did not, they were not on the same page maybe

723
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
with what the turtle should look like in real life.

724
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,080
Obviously the Jim Henson suits from the movie,

725
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,920
first two movies were expensive

726
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,680
and perhaps not worth traveling down to Disney World

727
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,160
and break them and then not be able to use them for.

728
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
They're for the movies.

729
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,760
These have to be functional and out on the streets

730
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
meeting the folks.

731
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,800
But then there's also the couple different suits

732
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,720
they use for the Coming Out of Our Shells tour,

733
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,040
which are a little better than that,

734
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,280
but also creepier than that.

735
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,360
You also, you have the possibility

736
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,640
that the mouths get stuck.

737
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,000
So if you just decide that you're gonna have mouths

738
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,840
that don't move at all, then maybe you're covered.

739
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,720
Yeah.

740
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,880
There was an auction I saw a few years ago

741
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,480
of the Leonardo costume for the third Turtles movie.

742
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,600
And due to its rotting nature,

743
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,120
the mouth was slowly peeling back

744
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,160
and the teeth would just look to bigger and bigger.

745
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,080
Oh, those teeth, that's always,

746
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,880
that's kind of a choice that has to be made

747
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,520
about physical manifestations of the Turtles.

748
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,240
How toothy do you go?

749
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,440
And they're very toothy if you were to take away the skin

750
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
on their beaks, their snoots.

751
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,360
You can see their full big teeth.

752
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,080
I find it impossible to call these snoots.

753
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,960
Turtles have snoots, don't you think?

754
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,800
Guess so.

755
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,360
Look, I struggle with snoot to begin with

756
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,560
as opposed to snout, but you have to have the little nose,

757
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,400
don't you?

758
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,480
I don't know if these are snoots.

759
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,440
More like a nubbin?

760
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,280
A nubbin?

761
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,120
A nubbin.

762
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
You know that that works.

763
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,800
I know what it is, I'm just saying.

764
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
It's a cute word.

765
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,640
A nub?

766
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,160
The Turtles nub, they smell out of their nub.

767
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,920
T-Change Mutant Ninja Nubbin.

768
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,760
T-Change Mutant Ninja Nubbin.

769
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,600
T-Change Mutant Ninja Nubbin.

770
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,560
Nubbin, N-U-B-B-I-N-N.

771
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,520
N-U-

772
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,560
I don't think a nubbin is what people call a nose.

773
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,880
I mean, no, I'm saying, but it looks like a little, like,

774
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,720
did a.

775
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,480
Well, when I looked it up, it's nubbin,

776
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,200
additional nipple occurring in mammals.

777
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,640
Third nipple.

778
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,040
All right, now you have some things to answer for.

779
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,320
I used to start it as like a little nub, a little bump.

780
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,960
I think you were trying to discreetly,

781
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,440
you're slipping in your product placements

782
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,560
and you're slipping in.

783
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,160
Slipping in my nipple synonyms.

784
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,440
Third nipples.

785
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,200
And in England, a nubbin is a word

786
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,840
that I won't say in front of.

787
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,160
Oh, okay.

788
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,200
In front of easily bodied out parties.

789
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,040
Oh, nice.

790
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
But you look up snoot,

791
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,080
and the definition of snoot is a person's nose.

792
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,120
So that is a pretty wide ranging.

793
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,360
We all have snoot.

794
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,200
That's what it says.

795
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,520
It says, and then here's an example,

796
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,320
a remark that might warrant a good smack in the snoot.

797
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,360
Does anyone here have, we all have snoots,

798
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,560
does anyone here have a nubbin?

799
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,680
Confess to the audience, do you have a nubbin?

800
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,360
Well, I'm not a. One of these sweaters.

801
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,920
I don't have mutant in my name, you know?

802
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,200
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

803
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,960
they could have any number of nubbins.

804
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,640
Jason's not answering the question.

805
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,480
He's not answering, actually.

806
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,320
Deflecting, deflecting.

807
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,000
All right, my whole back's covered in nipples.

808
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,160
All right, it's out.

809
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,840
That's for Patreon only.

810
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,320
The other thing to mention visually

811
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,920
is the manner in which Alan is dressed.

812
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,280
Leather jacket, sunglasses, red shirt.

813
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,080
He himself, it's not quite martial arts,

814
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,080
but just kind of a lot of fist pumps,

815
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,840
and points, and looking cool.

816
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,040
In my head, it's always like,

817
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,720
is he trying to be the Terminator?

818
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,120
Is that what it is?

819
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,320
But then I think, I saw it somewhere else point out,

820
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,360
oh, maybe he's trying to look like Michael Knight

821
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,200
from Knight Rider.

822
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,440
Those are the two things I thought.

823
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,280
Okay.

824
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,680
It was Michael Knight, or it was the Terminator.

825
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,760
Yeah, I wanna be the Terminator.

826
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,480
I wanna look like the Terminator, can you help me out?

827
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,080
Give me a little Terminator, give me a little,

828
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,680
give me some term, shorten it,

829
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,520
I'm familiar with that term.

830
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,240
So he looks cool, great new lyrics,

831
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
great new rap lyrics.

832
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

833
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,640
They've improved on the original.

834
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,160
I think genuinely so, because I have kind of a bone

835
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,760
to pick with this song this year,

836
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,520
because I put on the Beach Boys version

837
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,040
of Santa Claus is Coming to Town with my son in the car,

838
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,440
and just played it, didn't think about it anymore,

839
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,760
then looked back when we were done with the drive,

840
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,400
and he is about to just burst into tears.

841
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,240
Wow, really?

842
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,200
I think what came out of his mouth,

843
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,160
I think it was like, Santa says don't cry,

844
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,080
and then he cried and cried and cried.

845
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,040
Basically, the song is that Santa is watching you,

846
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,600
so don't cry, and we had already communicated to him

847
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,400
that crying is a great way to express yourself

848
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
and work through your feelings,

849
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,800
and now a song is telling him that Santa says no, no, no,

850
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,120
it's kind of a bad message.

851
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,960
You better watch out, you better not cry.

852
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Yeah, yeah.

853
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,200
And he's listening very intently, I guess, to the lyrics.

854
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Yes, yeah, more than I.

855
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,240
And absorbing it.

856
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

857
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,920
Wow.

858
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,200
Because these are like instructions.

859
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,880
He's hearing this for the first,

861
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
that is like, that's like a PSA,

862
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,120
that's like the president came on the radio.

863
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,960
Right.

864
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,040
And issued this to him, do not pout.

865
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,480
Listen, three-year-olds, don't ever pout.

866
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,880
He's got like a notepad out, he's like, all right,

867
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,040
here they, okay, let me, I'm gonna take a note to myself

868
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,200
what I'm doing to get my presents this year, all right,

869
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,560
what did the Beach Boys say?

870
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,040
What?

871
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,760
Yeah, his newly favorite band,

872
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,000
that's working out spectacularly for me, by the way.

873
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,640
For him, I don't know if it'll make him so relatable.

874
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,200
Oh, it's apparently making him sob uncontrollably.

875
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,520
Yeah, yeah, that was a bad meeting

876
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,760
of Beach Boys and my son.

877
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Wow.

878
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,560
So, yeah, well, luckily Santa wrote him a letter

879
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,600
and said, it is okay to cry.

880
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,440
Okay.

881
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,760
And you're a good boy and you'll get plenty of presents,

882
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,080
I'm gonna cry talking about this very kind letter

883
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,840
that we got. That Santa sent.

884
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,600
That Santa sent to, like that was Brian Wilson

885
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,800
singing a made-up song that means,

886
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,640
that is not an official statement from Santa Claus,

887
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,840
not my perspective.

888
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,560
Did Santa get that in the mail that night

889
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,080
or was it like later, maybe?

890
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,760
I think it took a few days.

891
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,600
Okay.

892
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,120
I had to find the right stationery.

893
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,040
I'm sorry, what am I saying?

894
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,120
I'm saying he, Santa had to find the right stationery.

895
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,040
Yeah, was he, have you shown him this one?

896
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,960
Cause I feel like if I was a little kid

897
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,080
and really processing,

898
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
I don't think I honed in on the phrase,

899
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,120
be good and keep it neat.

900
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
Be good and keep it neat.

901
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
What does that mean?

902
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,120
It's a little softer, I'd say,

903
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,720
than be good for goodness sake.

904
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,360
Keep it neat's cool.

905
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,560
Yeah, be good for goodness sake

906
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,720
feels like an exasperated mother.

907
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,560
Yeah.

908
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,600
Like be good for goodness sake, oh my God.

909
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,160
And that's the most that the mother is willing to swear.

910
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,680
Right, exactly.

911
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,640
Yeah, no, I think it softens it.

912
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,760
Wait, and what's the, wait, I'm missing one of the lines.

913
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,160
You better watch out, dude, I'm talking about your mood.

914
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760
They don't say don't cry.

915
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,680
Yeah, that's true.

916
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,080
So it solves my problem.

917
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,960
It's a cool rap, it doesn't say this thing

918
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,600
that made my son cry.

919
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,000
And Alan Thicke's bringing the heat.

920
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,480
Let's see a little bit more.

921
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,000
Santa Claus is coming to town.

922
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,560
Santa Claus is coming, the dude's all around.

923
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,160
Santa Claus is coming, he's back in town.

924
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,840
You better not shout, don't pout, freak out.

925
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,840
You better not cry because Santa Claus is coming to town.

926
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,480
Santa Claus is back in town.

927
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,520
Almost pick him up at don't.

928
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,240
Yeah, he just leans back slightly.

929
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,960
They support, it's like a quarter of a trust fall.

930
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,080
Yeah, April's got her camera out now and she's crouched.

931
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,600
She's like taking a video of them.

932
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,680
Yeah, sometimes they go to her perspective.

933
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,360
Also the camera's doing a lot of like spinning around

934
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,440
and tilted, it's great.

935
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,480
Actually, it's so much.

936
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,680
I think they did it like, they just told every camera,

937
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,920
spin and spin.

938
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,800
It's great, it's energy.

939
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,240
I like the arrangement.

940
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,120
I think it's in keeping with the character

941
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,280
of the theme song of the show.

942
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,040
Doesn't it feel like a completely in the musical,

943
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,080
the sound font, a word I just learned.

944
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
It's in the sound font of the theme song.

945
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,960
The high energy, sort of the rapid lyrics.

946
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,360
Then kind of the orchestral.

947
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,760
You're a little bit in James Bond territory.

948
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,720
Like stepping down, yeah, half steps down in the song.

949
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,840
I don't think there's anything, sometimes you will see

950
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,320
these things that miss the character of the property.

951
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,840
I think this is right on the money.

952
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,160
I got no complaints here.

953
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,320
This is on brand.

954
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,920
Well, I mean, growing up it was sort of a mixed bag sometimes

955
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,320
if you would get real world versions that were accurate.

956
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,560
Like Mario, for instance, of course the movie,

957
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,080
which left everybody confused and upset,

958
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,000
a lot of us upset.

959
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,760
Or this was a second gay, right?

960
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,080
Where we talked about Mr. Belvedere's bones.

961
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,320
Which is a little, I love it, but it's a little,

962
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,400
ha ha, oh yes, don't mess around.

963
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,680
I mean, he's playing, Mr. Belvedere was playing King Koopa

964
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,480
in an Ice Capades show.

965
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,720
Hamaraba!

966
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,600
Yeah, which is. Koopa Paratroopa!

967
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Oh right, Luigi had a cannon.

968
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,840
Yeah, they all explode the Koopas.

969
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,440
Yes, now that was more accurate than the movie.

970
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,080
Yes, it was much, much closer.

971
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,760
And closer to the spirit of the eventual movie from this year.

972
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,000
When the hell did that movie come out?

973
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,840
That was this year.

974
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,660
Was it this year?

975
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,500
Yeah, probably.

976
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,580
So yeah, the turtle van looks like the turtle van.

977
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,500
I mean, they never had a turtle van

978
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,980
in the first three movies.

979
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,820
Yeah.

980
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,140
So there was still the iconography from the cartoon

981
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,260
and the comics that I wanted in the movies.

982
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,300
But yeah, we're seeing it here.

983
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,340
Mm-hmm, it's April in the jumpsuit.

984
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,860
She never wore the yellow jumpsuit in the movies either.

985
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,180
That's right, wow, wow.

986
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,660
We didn't get some of that iconic stuff.

987
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,180
This is the truest live action version

988
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,700
of the Ninja Turtles, possibly.

989
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,140
Yeah, April's not wearing the yellow jumpsuit

990
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,460
in the Shells tour either.

991
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,300
Wow, wow.

992
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,260
So this is like one of the only live action.

993
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,100
They got it right.

994
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,840
It's really all about what we're learning in general.

995
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,460
It's all about either shades of yellow

996
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,100
or being careful about shades of yellow

997
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,360
that are not accurate.

998
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,200
Right.

999
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,900
The turtles have to mind their yellows

1000
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,700
to be on the money or not.

1001
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Yeah, yeah.

1002
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,980
Now obviously it takes a leap

1003
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,780
by adding Alan Thicke dressed like Michael Knight.

1004
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,940
But I think it improves it.

1005
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,780
I wish he was in the,

1006
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,100
they should have added him to the movies after this too.

1007
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,640
I think, well, I've said this on the show before.

1008
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,700
I wish that so many movies that we liked when we were kids

1009
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,380
had that Land Before Time style 10 sequels.

1010
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,220
Yeah, sure.

1011
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Because then that gives you room for a Turtles directed,

1012
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,860
which maybe we'll talk about things

1013
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,540
that were directed to VHS for Turtles.

1014
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,300
But Turtles meet up with Alan Thicke in a movie.

1015
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,580
There's less pressure on it to perform at the box office.

1016
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,980
Just the VHS you could go get at the library.

1017
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,660
You keep it cheap and yeah.

1018
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,580
Well, and all the money goes to him

1019
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,300
and his songwriting royalties.

1020
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,140
Yeah, and he could.

1021
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,980
That's where you put the paint.

1022
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,300
It could be a full musical.

1023
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,900
It could have been a full Thicke musical with the Turtles.

1024
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,540
This is the type of thing I may be happy about AI creating

1025
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,580
in the next 50 years.

1026
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,960
If you could put into a prompt Ninja Turtles movie

1027
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,860
released in 1993,

1028
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,780
starring Alan Thicke with original songs

1029
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,580
in the style of Alan Thicke,

1030
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,660
and you could pump out something that felt right.

1031
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,540
Pretty good argument for AI, I think.

1032
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,620
It's not taking a job away from anyone necessarily.

1033
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,660
Because how is this ever gonna exist besides?

1034
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,980
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1035
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,340
So you're saying it's not the future of entertainment.

1036
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,940
It's the future of past entertainment.

1037
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,780
Yes.

1038
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,100
Like back to the future, but they meet Alan Thicke.

1039
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,980
Back to the Future 7 released in 1995

1040
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,860
starring Alan Thicke, Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Lloyd.

1041
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,700
Wow.

1042
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,240
Is he a character or is he just himself?

1043
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,460
He's himself.

1044
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,180
You know what?

1045
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,040
He's Napoleon.

1046
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,740
They travel back and they meet Napoleon played by Alan Thicke

1047
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,120
and then they have to fix a problem or something.

1048
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,480
Whoa, whoa, what's this fancy space carriage we got?

1049
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,360
I don't know, what be this devilry?

1050
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,480
Yeah, that sounds good.

1051
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,360
Can you open my war efforts?

1052
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,120
And in the AI you have to specify this movie is bad.

1053
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,360
This movie is bad.

1054
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,200
Please make a terrible movie.

1055
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,840
Make sure it's bad.

1056
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,400
1995 Alan Thicke Napoleon raps.

1057
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,600
Yeah. For sure.

1058
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,440
That's a good movie.

1059
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,680
And the AI's like, I'm sorry,

1060
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,560
but you're saying that would be bad?

1061
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,480
Worse than Bullworth rap.

1062
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,320
Yeah.

1063
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,720
If we could, maybe that's a fun online X prompt,

1064
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,680
which put in your series of words you want

1065
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,520
of a directed VHS sequel of a popular movie with,

1066
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,680
it doesn't have to be Alan Thicke,

1067
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,440
but you can add anyone you want.

1068
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,440
Batman Forever 2, more Chase Meridian,

1069
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,600
and Neckline goes down 5% more.

1070
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,440
Okay.

1071
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,400
Not anything risqué. Nothing crazy.

1072
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,040
Yeah, yeah, don't go nuts AI.

1073
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,680
Don't be dirty here.

1074
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,080
Right, yes, that's great.

1075
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,520
Yeah, yeah, stuff like that is what we want.

1076
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,960
Well, I think that there is a way in this episode

1077
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,600
that we can kind of like fuzz together these things

1078
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,920
and make it feel like there was more

1079
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,240
Alan Thicke Ninja Turtles.

1080
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,360
Sure.

1081
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,880
Granted, this is via separate pieces,

1082
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,760
but I think all told it'll end up feeling

1083
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,880
like we got to experience a bunch more of them.

1084
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,960
And I'll tell you why.

1085
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,320
At this point in the show, you might be wondering,

1086
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,720
how is there going to be an entire episode

1087
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,760
out of this one performance?

1088
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,720
And of course, there is a plan.

1089
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,800
We have a plan.

1090
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
What we're going to do now is figure out

1091
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,880
how we got to this point by looking both forward

1092
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,000
and backward and viewing, analyzing the separate

1093
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,480
discographies of both artists involved

1094
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,720
in this great performance, both the Ninja Turtles,

1095
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,760
the brothers, as I can't stop calling them now.

1096
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,600
They're the four, yeah.

1097
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,000
And Alan Thicke.

1098
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,120
We're going to view their separate musical bodies of work

1099
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,920
and discover how they were able to come together

1100
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,640
for this great Christmas moment.

1101
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,480
Right.

1102
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,000
So we're going to bounce back and forth a little bit.

1103
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,040
We've got some turtle clips,

1104
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,320
and we've got some Alan Thicke clips.

1105
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,080
Full disclosure, this is a PhD thesis

1106
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,040
that I have been wanting to deliver for years now.

1107
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,320
I think we were close to doing it last year,

1108
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,720
but then we had to celebrate Avatar.

1109
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,000
It was the way of water season.

1110
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,160
It was Felice Navidad.

1111
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,640
Yeah, but does anyone even remember

1112
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,440
a character name for that movie?

1113
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,240
What character?

1114
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Made more money in 2023 alone than Disney's other movies

1115
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,600
and almost everything else they released.

1116
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,080
Okay, so now I have to contain myself.

1117
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,240
I have to calm down as I finally get to go into this.

1118
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,240
The Alan Thicke discography.

1119
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,600
Do you guys feel like you've seen any of what

1120
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm about to show, or can you not place

1121
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,600
any other Alan Thicke musical number?

1122
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,880
I know a little bit,

1123
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,680
but I really don't actually know a lot.

1124
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,640
Okay, great.

1125
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm so excited to educate you.

1126
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,640
Because if you enjoy that,

1127
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,440
if you enjoy that Santa Claus performance,

1128
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,840
and there's a lack of irony there, I think.

1129
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,640
I think there's a sincerity.

1130
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,000
There is just diving in.

1131
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,800
Alan Thicke is a comedian and a comedic actor

1132
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,680
who has musical abilities.

1133
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,080
He was a songwriter.

1134
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,440
I'll get into that a little bit.

1135
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,120
But basically, I think a lot of comedians

1136
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,200
feel like they have to like,

1137
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,280
okay, I want to sing and stuff,

1138
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,520
but I gotta couch that in a little bit.

1139
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,360
I have to seem like removed,

1140
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,320
or like it's a little bit funny or something.

1141
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,880
Not Alan Thicke.

1142
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,320
He just dives in full throttle.

1143
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,560
I'm a singer-songwriter.

1144
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,400
You're gonna love it.

1145
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,320
You're gonna be entertained.

1146
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,120
I'm gonna dazzle ya.

1147
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,400
And I think it's something

1148
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,040
that we need a little bit more of.

1149
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,120
I think the, it's,

1150
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,120
you're seeing the lines get,

1151
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,880
ironically, yes, I am heading towards the statement.

1152
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,120
I think the lines are getting maybe blurred again

1153
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,040
by the fact that Jimmy Fallon this year

1154
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,040
has a not comedy Christmas song with Meghan Trainor.

1155
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,280
Right, yeah.

1156
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,600
But that said, that's not so much to my liking.

1157
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,440
My Meghan Trainor thoughts have been said on the show.

1158
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,480
I guess my Jimmy Fallon thoughts have been said

1159
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,560
before on the show.

1160
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,200
But I guess I like it as a,

1161
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,240
I'm like, okay, we're heading somewhere good here

1162
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,640
with the host of The Tonight Show

1163
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,400
is just making not comedy music.

1164
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,520
And it's not the socially accepted show tunes track

1165
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,760
that Neil Patrick Harris or Seth MacFarlane

1166
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,600
do in their spare time. You're right.

1167
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,080
That is, except why do we, yes, what are those,

1168
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,480
again, these blurred lines.

1169
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,080
I hate these blurred lines.

1170
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,920
Yeah.

1171
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,040
Why do we allow crooning?

1172
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,960
Huh, does that, maybe that just harkens back

1173
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,160
to like Rat Pack era where that was the deal.

1174
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,760
You sang in that style and then you'd be in a sloppy

1175
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,080
comedy sketch as well.

1176
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1177
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,440
And look, prompt, the AI prompt,

1178
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,440
Jay Leno, 1996 Christmas album of original songs.

1179
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,360
Oh man.

1180
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,840
Sings baby it's cold outside.

1181
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
All original songs.

1182
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,440
Oh, I thought he was gonna sing it to like

1183
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,120
a Studebaker or something.

1184
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,720
That can be your AI prompt.

1185
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,560
Yeah.

1186
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,200
Yeah, well that's, I mean,

1187
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,280
my Santa is a Studebaker.

1188
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,400
All The Tonight Show's.

1189
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,840
It's its own, it's reindeer is its gas tank.

1190
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,360
Is that what Jay Leno's singing would sound like?

1191
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,200
Yeah, maybe.

1192
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,120
That's a hard prompt to do, only AI could do it.

1193
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,960
Right, right.

1194
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,560
Cracked engine block on Christmas Eve.

1195
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,840
Do you think, does any of those cars,

1196
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,320
does he have to deal with hard water on any of his cars?

1197
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,160
Oh, good question.

1198
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,960
Well, you gotta watch out for that mineral buildup.

1199
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,280
You know, it's harmless on dishes,

1200
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,640
but it leaves unsightly white stains.

1201
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,600
Probably applies to a car somewhere.

1202
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,080
Well, he should use Lemmy Wash.

1203
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,920
Lemmy Shine.

1204
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,080
Lemmy Shine, sorry.

1205
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,920
You missed it.

1206
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,740
Sheridan 20.

1207
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,580
I know, I need Lemmy Shine.

1208
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,760
Sheridan 20.

1209
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,240
Okay, so, you know, that's the thing.

1210
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,000
I don't think it does kind of come from this tradition.

1211
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,640
He's like a variety show guy.

1212
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,240
Did you know, Mike, that he, one of his first jobs

1213
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,920
was writing for a Paul Lind special?

1214
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,000
I actually did not know that.

1215
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,400
I only recently found that out.

1216
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
Actually, he was on a podcast that you like a lot.

1217
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,520
I know the Gilbert Gottfried podcast,

1218
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,640
and he talks about some of the things

1219
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,480
we're gonna talk about.

1220
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,320
I haven't heard that one either.

1221
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,600
Yeah, he talks about Paul Lind.

1222
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,080
Gilbert has some questions and accusations

1223
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,240
of Mr. Lind that are.

1224
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,720
Oh, there's been some stories that paint

1225
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,320
Paul Lind is a terrible person

1226
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,160
on the Gilbert Gottfried podcast.

1227
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,600
I won't go into those now.

1228
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,720
He's fishing with Alan, Alan gives him nothing.

1229
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,440
But I do feel like Alan is, you know,

1230
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,280
I don't wanna like lure you away from,

1231
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,000
I know Paul Lind is your true love in this area.

1232
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,840
Uh-huh, sure.

1233
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,680
But I do think that Thicke brings Paul Lindism

1234
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,680
into the 80s in a big way.

1235
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,500
Yeah.

1236
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,160
In terms of this sincerity and like,

1237
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,600
is it funny, is it legit good, is it hokey?

1238
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,080
How, what is the level on which I'm enjoying this?

1239
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,300
All I know is I'm enjoying it a lot.

1240
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,400
So a kind of known fact about Alan Thicke

1241
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,200
before he was known as a TV performer,

1242
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,400
he wrote for Norman Lear shows

1243
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,520
and then Mr. Lear just passed away

1244
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,000
and he employed him to write some theme songs.

1245
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,040
Alan Thicke wrote the theme songs

1246
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,200
to different strokes and facts of life.

1247
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,320
So that's pretty major pedigree.

1248
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,400
Those are iconic songs.

1249
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,040
So as he gets this like, the sitcom stardom

1250
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,680
from growing pains, he's asked to host things

1251
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,320
and you really get the feeling that he,

1252
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,040
on day one he's like, well you know I could sing.

1253
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,280
I'd love to sing something.

1254
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,360
In fact, I'll do you one better.

1255
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,840
I'd love to write you something.

1256
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,960
Can I write you something?

1257
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,480
I wrote facts of life, you know?

1258
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,240
So there's all of these things

1259
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,200
that have original Alan Thicke songs,

1260
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,440
which again, so yeah, do your covers or whatever.

1261
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,280
But originality is what we want

1262
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,800
because really that's where you get

1263
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,860
like the true essence of the person.

1264
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,980
And with all that said, I am so excited to share.

1265
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,260
Brett, can you pull up?

1266
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,620
Oh, I'm excited to ask for you to pull up a clip.

1267
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,460
Sweaty and Hot won.

1268
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:15,100
So this is from one of the great events ever televised,

1269
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:19,300
the 1988 Crystal Light National Aerobics Championship.

1270
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,660
Alan was the host of an aerobics championship.

1271
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,860
This entire event is 80s to the power of 80s.

1272
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,420
It's so bonkers.

1273
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,500
It's spandex unitards and pink and purple

1274
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,620
and turquoise and zebra print.

1275
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,860
And the set is like neon trapezoids.

1276
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,580
It's so good.

1277
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,260
This special is kind of known.

1278
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,020
It's like there's viral clips from it in its own fashion.

1279
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,060
I recommend watching any of it, all of it.

1280
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,020
But this special was the basis of a key and peel sketch

1281
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,340
called aerobics meltdown,

1282
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,420
where Clint Howard is putting up cue cards

1283
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,460
telling these aerobics people

1284
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,140
that your wife and child are in the hospital,

1285
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,780
but he has to keep doing aerobics,

1286
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,740
which is a great sketch.

1287
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,180
I actually hadn't seen it really till recently.

1288
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,980
But Alan Thicke hosted the thing,

1289
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,940
opening monologue with all aerobics-oriented jokes.

1290
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,100
Like, you know, the dinosaurs had two basic food groups,

1291
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,540
men and women.

1292
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,020
I'm sorry, wait, I didn't explain the lead up.

1293
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,100
I should have said the lead up first,

1294
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,180
why dinosaurs came in the picture.

1295
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,660
All right, here's a joke.

1296
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,580
Jogging began when the caveman spotted his first dinosaur.

1297
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,540
Sprinting began when the dinosaur

1298
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,220
spotted his first caveman.

1299
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,900
Then the follow-up.

1300
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,460
Dinosaurs had two basic food groups, men and women.

1301
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,660
Okay.

1302
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,100
So you're getting Thicke one-liners,

1303
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,420
but then more than halfway into the special,

1304
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,140
almost like they were trying to bury it or something,

1305
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,100
there is a big musical number

1306
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,540
where he's surrounded by aerobics dancers,

1307
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,660
and he does this original song, Sweaty and Hot.

1308
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,620
["Sweaty and Hot"]

1309
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,140
Here's Alan Thicke.

1310
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,260
Said my mind was what you wanted

1311
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:20,900
Said turn you on, things going on in my head

1312
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,220
I'm like a cool windbreaker.

1313
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,060
Top scholar.

1314
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,500
And see the great big hunks

1315
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
The way they've bought it

1316
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,500
But what you saw in me

1317
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,100
Was something unique

1318
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,860
It says it on the internet

1319
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:40,860
But now you've met some new guy at the gym

1320
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:46,860
And you have a giant with a Schwarzenegger neck

1321
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,940
Schwarzenegger neck.

1322
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,780
Schwarzenegger neck.

1323
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,420
He's been getting fresh

1324
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,500
Don't you let him ready or not

1325
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,100
I'm coming baby I've got some muscle for you

1326
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,020
Sweaty and hot

1327
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,500
I'm pumping iron

1328
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,340
And when I'm done

1329
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,540
You're gonna beg me to have some big time fun

1330
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,220
Oh darling

1331
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,940
I work my body out just for you

1332
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,460
I'm gonna work my body out just for you

1333
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,620
And he's just kinda like stepping back and forth

1334
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,500
while the aerobics people do the heavy lifting.

1335
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,060
Yeah, step on a platform.

1336
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,340
I know I'm not still 24

1337
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,980
Cause if you're keeping

1338
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,500
Cause I have had my nights

1339
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,580
And I have plenty more

1340
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,860
Plenty more

1341
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,860
Spectacular

1342
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,620
Cardiovascular radio nuts

1343
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,380
I'm coming

1344
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,980
What are we thinking?

1345
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,940
Cardiovascular

1346
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,380
Spectacular

1347
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,580
Cardiovascular radio nuts

1348
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,100
I love the song

1349
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,180
If this was available on every karaoke machine

1350
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,100
I would never do another song

1351
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,620
I'd be sweaty and hot every time

1352
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,420
This aerobics love song

1353
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,380
But what do you guys think?

1354
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,140
I mean his outfit

1355
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,700
Let's deconstruct all of it

1356
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,020
He's got like a cool windbreaker on

1357
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,260
Collar popped

1358
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,780
Sleeves rolled up

1359
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,780
Gray slacks

1360
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,980
And then puffy white sneakers

1361
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,340
Yeah

1362
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,140
He really reminds me of my friend's dad growing up too

1363
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,660
Like it is he really has like

1364
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,020
Your dad just got up here and is singing a pop song

1365
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,500
Exactly

1366
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,420
If my dad at 40 or 41 was just confident and like

1367
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,860
Yeah I'll do it

1368
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,980
Yeah you know hey the kids will love it

1369
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,980
Also fashion being circular

1370
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,180
Going in cycles

1371
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:34,900
Cyclical

1372
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,900
Cyclical

1373
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,260
This is all very cool again

1374
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,060
I would love

1375
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,140
It would cost thousands of dollars

1376
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,060
I love this jacket

1377
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,420
Yeah I love that

1378
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,820
It's almost like it's not as far as

1379
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:51,180
It's like one step down from vanilla ice

1380
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,420
Andrew Dice Clay

1381
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:52,700
Yeah

1382
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,740
If it was like big in the shoulders

1383
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,940
Although I'd like that too

1384
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,060
I'd wear an Andrew Dice Clay jacket

1385
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,940
Would I pull it off?

1386
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,820
I don't think so

1387
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,820
Does Alan pull this off?

1388
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,140
I don't know

1389
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,540
It's like he shouldn't

1390
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,100
But he just charges in with confidence

1391
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,020
What's interesting about this performance and this song

1392
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,100
Is you're seeing more vulnerability from him

1393
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,540
Than I'm used to

1394
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,260
Because he's admitting that he's like I'm a thinking man

1395
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,220
And I don't have the Schwarzenegger neck

1396
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,460
He's saying

1397
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,500
And look let me try to clean this up

1398
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,460
He's saying he can't bone like a 24 year old anymore

1399
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:28,940
But he still

1400
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,020
It's all a metaphor for that

1401
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,860
He still has good nights

1402
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,140
And a lot of them ahead

1403
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,540
And I'll have plenty more

1404
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,340
Yeah

1405
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,060
But even in his performance I feel there's a vulnerability

1406
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,340
Whether he's meaning to do it or not

1407
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,900
He looks if you watch the video

1408
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,420
He seems like he's like

1409
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,300
You can see his bashfulness, his shyness

1410
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:47,740
Yeah

1411
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,300
It's not full on cocky

1412
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,860
Like he comes off in almost every interview

1413
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,340
Where he seems like Will Ferrell's Robert Goulet or something

1414
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,580
He is like that

1415
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,380
Absolutely

1416
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,220
I haven't even warmed up the pipes

1417
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,900
God I've been like there's been something

1418
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,500
I mean I've been thinking he's a little Troy McClurey

1419
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,380
But then that doesn't quite

1420
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,460
That doesn't satisfy the smooths

1421
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,860
Because he's a little more laid back than Troy

1422
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,420
Robert Goulet was not

1423
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,300
I don't think it was more like Will Ferrell's Robert Goulet

1424
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,340
Than Robert Goulet was

1425
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,140
Than actual Robert Goulet?

1426
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,340
Yeah I think so

1427
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,660
Yeah

1428
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,980
And just to confirm

1429
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,540
It's been a while since I've seen it

1430
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,580
The premise of Growing Pains

1431
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,340
Was that the parents were little ex hippies

1432
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,380
Little crunchy

1433
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,580
And Kirk Cameron was a Republican

1434
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,940
No this is family ties

1435
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,780
That's family ties

1436
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,740
The premise of Growing Pains is

1437
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,220
Not something that I know because I don't care

1438
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,140
I only care about Alan Thicke's musical numbers

1439
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,940
Oh okay great

1440
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,460
I literally know nothing

1441
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,900
I know it launched Leonardo DiCaprio

1442
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,940
He was their cousin Oliver

1443
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,620
Let's

1444
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,380
Brett can we pull up Sweating Hot 2

1445
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,660
In which there's a little like bridge breakdown part

1446
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,900
If you thought he was vulnerable before

1447
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,020
Here we go

1448
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,300
Here we see

1449
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,220
He gets real soft

1450
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,540
Real soft

1451
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,980
I got the cutest little gluteus

1452
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,500
Oh my gosh

1453
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,940
I got the cutest little gluteus

1454
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,180
I got the cutest little gluteus

1455
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,340
And for the listener he's like

1456
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,620
He's making these coy eyes

1457
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,540
He's like bouncing back and forth

1458
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:26,180
I got the cutest little gluteus

1459
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:30,300
I have no concern with is this good or cool

1460
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,980
I don't know

1461
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,060
He thinks that's cool

1462
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,260
I mean I think he thinks it's funny and cool

1463
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:34,980
I think so

1464
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,660
And I think he thinks that the songwriting is very clever

1465
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,780
Something I think about a lot of what I'll play here

1466
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:46,660
There's like a Christopher Guest sort of thing about it

1467
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,620
Or like often he's doing these songs that are like

1468
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,500
What Martin Short makes fun of

1469
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:52,860
Yes

1470
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,900
Where like it's almost like it doesn't exist in reality so much

1471
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,100
These kind of like showbiz hams with these like overly written

1472
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,660
How clever my lyrics are

1473
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,100
And that's like exactly what he did

1474
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,740
Yes but then it's like couched

1475
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,860
Because it wouldn't be as

1476
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,060
I bet you wouldn't like it nearly as much

1477
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:13,300
If it wasn't couched in the production of the 80s

1478
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:13,980
Oh yeah that's

1479
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,700
You know what I think that is like

1480
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,580
Yeah this same sensibility in the 60s or whatever

1481
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,380
I don't care

1482
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,540
There's parts of this that I think are like legit good

1483
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,300
We'll hear one later that I'm like

1484
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,860
Yes that is completely my musical taste

1485
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,340
Alan you have nailed it

1486
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:32,180
Is that one he also just lists off various muscles

1487
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:37,180
Yeah what did he miss

1488
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,300
All of his songs after this point were very muscle based

1489
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,140
I'm working on a seven pack

1490
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:48,940
My quads are today worked them too hard last night

1491
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,380
Let's see a little finale if we could

1492
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:58,300
Let's go to sweaty and hot three just to make sure we close it out

1493
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,060
And here you know and here he's kind of

1494
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,540
You can tell he's like getting winded

1495
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,980
He's like yeah you know he doesn't have it like these aerobics folks do

1496
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,140
How old is he 40 or so here?

1497
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:07,980
I think 40 or so

1498
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,100
Yeah this gives me hope by the way

1499
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,180
As we approach

1500
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,740
As you head into the age

1501
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,500
Yeah you could be a thicc

1502
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,100
Yeah I think so

1503
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,140
It's what I want to be

1504
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,380
It's what I'm actively seeking

1505
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,740
I'll be a toned up sun tan guy

1506
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,940
I'll have Jane Ponder's part

1507
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,660
I'm working out just working

1508
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,980
Ready or not

1509
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,660
Oh my

1510
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,740
He collapses to flirt with some of the backup dancers

1511
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,460
Let's be honest

1512
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,420
Can I collapse on you?

1513
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,620
You mind if I need to do the collapse gag?

1514
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,140
You mind if I

1515
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,260
This guy he got around for sure

1516
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,540
Oh yeah

1517
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,220
Robin tells a story about like waking up one morning

1518
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,660
Going downstairs to the kitchen and then Gloria Steinem is in the house

1519
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,300
Went out with Gloria Steinem

1520
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,820
Sure

1521
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:03,540
He also by the way when Robin's music was blowing up

1522
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,180
Isn't it by the way now that we've seen this

1523
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:11,260
Isn't it insane that he had a son that people considered like sexy and cool

1524
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,380
For at least a brief time

1525
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,380
You're just saying the chances of it happening after you see this performance

1526
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,980
You would say oh that's kind of low

1527
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,500
You just think like the family wouldn't have it maybe

1528
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,060
Yeah yeah yeah

1529
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:21,940
There's an inherent cheesiness

1530
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,780
Which there is obviously Robin Thicke time has not been kind to that song

1531
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,260
Yeah yeah

1532
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,300
In multiple ways but there was a minute where like you know he's really cool and hot

1533
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:30,700
Sure

1534
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:36,100
Robin Thicke and during that time there was a sound bite where he had a song called Sex Therapy

1535
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,540
I don't know that off-hand but Alan said you know I love Robin's music

1536
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,900
You know my wife and I play Sex Therapy while we're doing it

1537
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,380
It's a fucking weird shit

1538
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,020
Really weird

1539
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,540
It's at least it wasn't his birth mother so it's only half weird

1540
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:59,940
It's just a woman whose husband is putting on her own stepson's music while they have sex

1541
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,300
That is so disturbing

1542
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,260
It's a little odd

1543
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:06,500
You know he was furious about his son's like he was so jealous

1544
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,100
Because he got everything that he actually

1545
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,300
Exactly the full legitimacy

1546
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:10,540
Yeah

1547
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,940
I had to be a clown

1548
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,620
I had to clown around to please the people

1549
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,220
I was with the Ninja Turtles

1550
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,700
I couldn't just flash my baby blues

1551
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:23,780
Robin didn't have to be on some stupid variety show pretending to be excited about people in costumes

1552
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:27,300
You got to chase the models around

1553
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,540
Emily what's her name?

1554
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,700
The hottest babe in the game and she was all his

1555
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:40,300
Okay so oh and then also but he remains that's the thing he's very proud of this thing

1556
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,340
I found an interview where he talked about this special

1557
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,340
They said let's talk a little about the song

1558
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,500
He said I was particularly proud of the song I wrote for that occasion

1559
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:53,740
Only because I think I'm the only person in history to have rhymed the word cardiovascular in a rock tempo song

1560
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,180
A rock tempo

1561
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,180
One of those rock tempos

1562
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:01,140
So you could do it slow but try doing it fast and do aerobics at the same time can't be done

1563
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,300
Wow

1564
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:08,100
So that's that in the interest of giving equal time fairness

1565
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,980
I think we should bounce back and forth between Alan and his duet partners the Ninja Turtles

1566
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,340
And for this we talk a little bit about this Ninja Turtles Christmas special

1567
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,140
Can you tell us anything about that Mike?

1568
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,820
Well it looks like there were a couple like just VHS released

1569
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,020
I'm not actually sure if it aired anywhere

1570
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:32,820
There's all this stuff that is just like I've discovered this in the last couple years and it's viewed many thousands of times

1571
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,220
So it's not like oh my god covered it or anything

1572
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,820
Yeah, yeah

1573
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:40,420
But there's something called like turtle tunes is one VHS

1574
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,020
I don't know turtle tunes

1575
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:46,620
Yeah I actually didn't know until I started looking back into the the turtle Christmas

1576
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:56,900
But this is like a half hour tape with original songs and you know twists on the old favorites with

1577
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
Like what? Like rock around the clock?

1578
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,100
Yeah I think a lot of that's maybe I'm

1579
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,300
Rock around the shredder's corpse

1580
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:13,700
I'm mixing up turtle tunes because turtle tunes is a lot of like just taking the melody from farmer in the dell and changing the lyrics

1581
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,500
The farmer in the dell dude

1582
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,580
Yeah

1583
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,980
He totally plants totally awesome crops

1584
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:28,980
There's a there's one in the other turtles tunes where they're like on a carousel and that's set to like farmer in the dell

1585
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,780
But it's new lyrics about how much they like riding the carousel

1586
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,780
But these are

1587
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,380
They're like skip to my loo dude

1588
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:42,380
These are like super cheap looking rushed out VHS things I'm sure to capitalize on

1589
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,260
I was very confused I thought I knew about some of these turtles Christmas songs

1590
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:52,260
But I thought they were from the stretch of the cheaper Saban TV show from later

1591
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,860
But no they're weirdly they're from 94 so they're between the movies and the much cheaper Saban show

1592
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,660
They exist completely on their own

1593
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,460
So I'm sorry the tape is I believe we wish you a turtle Christmas

1594
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,660
Yes yes yes

1595
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:10,860
And yeah it's like I was trying to figure out if maybe like the splinter costume was reused from the shells

1596
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,740
Coming out of our shells from their live tour yeah

1597
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:18,540
Which is it looks similar the turtle costumes themselves look similar, but I still think they're like different, but maybe I'm wrong

1598
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:26,400
And yeah, these are these are quick these are quick tapes. I guess in a way like trying to like

1599
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:33,860
You know have some turtle live-action content after they stopped making the movies right right 93 just keep something out there

1600
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,380
but they are

1601
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,740
I get they're bad, but

1602
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:44,020
There's enjoyable things about them. They didn't have Alan they didn't have a lot

1603
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:49,060
They should hire me you don't hire me and you get junk. Yeah, I don't know if they could have afforded Alan

1604
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,740
necessarily, but

1605
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,260
It's interesting pony up that facts of life money, and you get me mm-hmm

1606
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,980
There's still there's so much turtle stuff around this time

1607
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:02,520
I'm shocked that I didn't have this because I was a tur I was obsessed with turtles

1608
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,540
Up into like a later than most of the average kid and when I say later

1609
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,540
I mean until this age right now

1610
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,420
He was gonna say was

1611
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:18,580
What I mean my I've did I say this before we found a bit like an old home movie where I'm

1612
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:25,560
Where my mom is like the cameras off she thinks she's talking to a neighbor about how I don't know anything about sex

1613
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,760
And I don't like I'm not interested in any of that or like girls

1614
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:35,420
But I'm still into those ninja turtle toys and now when is this from like fourth fifth grade or something well

1615
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:40,020
Yeah, I don't know that you well sure I hear you

1616
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:44,580
But I mean like is she reading like she's reading headlines about like the kids today. Yes

1617
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:49,840
She's not saying the fourth graders are doing it right, but not my good boy. She's probably saying yeah

1618
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,260
There's something I don't know what the first part of that conversation was but then it's like oh, yeah

1619
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,840
It's not even into girls or anything. He's not into any of that

1620
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:01,660
He's still into those like I think she says she's he's still into those ninja turtle toys

1621
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:08,220
Well, I'm good she got practice saying that sentence because she got to say it again. I assume up through like age 20

1622
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,100
Yeah, yeah, no longer probably yeah

1623
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,500
But yeah, I didn't know I didn't know what these were Wow there's even a thing

1624
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,100
We haven't and there's no time to do it

1625
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,420
But there's like this weird like video made by like some Transit Authority

1626
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,260
Using similar suits. I think whoa like there's just so many weird little things that popped up here and there with the turtles

1627
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:35,260
Let's keep going with turtles. Yeah, fine. Yeah, what do you want to get a hit of here? That's a good question

1628
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,700
We got we got some Christmas things

1629
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,260
But but you you you call this call your maybe I'll just do this

1630
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:46,420
This isn't necessarily Christmas, but they like made up a new theme song for these two videos

1631
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,100
Brett the stuff I sent you Brett the turtles one if we could play that

1632
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,340
And I was interesting

1633
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:58,620
I wonder if I like wonder practically why they would not just use the original with the Chuck Lorie

1634
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:02,100
Written original it's the logo and it is the logo

1635
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:07,780
They don't want to pay Chuck anymore if Chuck was maybe commanding a large fee or something. I don't know but yeah play it whenever

1636
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,300
But it's like yeah

1637
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,620
I

1638
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:38,660
Guess they had to explain that they're singing. Yeah, that's why they needed I guess you're right. You're right. Good point

1639
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:46,700
Getting the origin story in here making some real turtles being some goo. Yeah

1640
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,700
I

1641
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,060
Might be the

1642
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:01,620
You laugh laughs interesting I gotta find out more about these guys who laugh

1643
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:11,620
But if you can roll into the second clip actually now that I'm thinking about it

1644
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,140
I think maybe Scott you have this as well

1645
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:19,760
They come so the voice acting on this one is very interesting too because they lean heavily into the turtles are all like New Yorkers

1646
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,180
But this is a baffling first choice for this for this first

1647
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,940
I don't know. Did you see this? Yeah, yeah decorating a Christmas. They're decorating a Christmas tree

1648
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:35,040
There they look they look scary. These are scary looking. Well, yeah there

1649
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:41,220
I was saying there's the possibility when you have open mouths. It's really possible that the mouths can just remain open

1650
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:45,060
Yeah, yeah, the gums are already receding on these teeth

1651
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:50,940
Yeah, and they have the rot you were describing on the auction item has begun as soon as these three brought it

1652
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:56,660
They have gums. Yeah turtles of gum. So yeah play this and we'll we'll see what decisions

1653
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,620
the people making this made

1654
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,220
Oh

1655
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,540
So much teeth listeners, there's so much

1656
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:30,900
They're like chat their mouths are chattering to like a little like set of fake teeth they're like whatever you call those

1657
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:39,780
Yeah, it's enough I mean we have you get the gist so this is immediately there's a first thing in the whole special

1658
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,780
Oh

1659
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:51,420
Cut to Jamaican accent. Yeah reggae reggae man

1660
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:57,560
Adrian Brody's reggae man. Maybe that's where he got it. Yeah

1661
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:05,160
So that's that's the start of the special Wow, and I don't know. Yeah nowhere to go but down from there

1662
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:11,920
Yeah, that's a pretty high a pretty bold choice to start and then yeah, so yeah why it's kind of unprompted

1663
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:18,720
Why why do you need to do that island voices mon? Yeah, that's not the song. That's not how the song is generally

1664
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,720
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's uh

1665
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,960
That's the start of the special

1666
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,540
I think where I was my premise at the beginning was they're gonna be that like, you know

1667
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,580
Showing how these two Titans both brought something different and great to the table

1668
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,860
Yeah, but now I'm finding that if because this happened after that performance

1669
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:41,620
I like they needed thick was the like thick was the fifth beetle. Yes. Yes. I think that's right

1670
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:47,380
But yeah, these are not these songs are not on the level of pizza power or

1671
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,300
Fantastic coming out of shells. Yeah

1672
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:57,460
Which are also done before yes, they were they were ruined after yeah. Yeah. Yeah, why even try anymore?

1673
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:02,140
Will never reach his level and there are better songs in the special than that, but yeah

1674
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,900
Well, we'll get to you know, we will build to what I think is the crown jewel sure

1675
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:10,540
Yeah, yeah song but let me really prove the legitimacy of mr. Thick

1676
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,060
with this one

1677
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:17,580
If we let's just you know, let's let's ready the theme song of

1678
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:24,020
Alan Thicke's early 80s talk show thick of the night. We can pull up thick of the night course

1679
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:30,540
So, you know we said a lot about how like he's corny he's got a dad energy. He's not cool

1680
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:35,900
He's not sexy but important context for Alan Thicke in America

1681
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:41,200
Is that he arrived on a wave of there is a cool guy coming from Canada

1682
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:48,820
He is gonna hit the late-night scene. He's gonna rock your socks and he's not old man Carson with his golf swing

1683
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:53,920
This is a rock and roll talk show host get ready to meet this guy

1684
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,980
This is this seems like kind of what the energy was before he came on the air

1685
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:04,500
I mean already like everything's just late night the tonight show

1686
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:12,060
He's the first one bold enough to get his name in there the brilliant pun or something thick of the night

1687
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:18,540
He incorporates that very famous phrase. We all use. Yeah, of course. We'll always talk about well, it's just you know, it's so late

1688
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,120
I'm in the thick of the night. It's like the humidity that Jason and I love so much

1689
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,360
The thickness of night. Yeah, that's how you so when it's when it's night in Florida and you're leaving

1690
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,600
Canoodles piano bar, whatever. What is it called? Jelly Rolls?

1691
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,360
Was there ever anything called something similar to canoodles canoodles on property there was a new resort

1692
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:45,000
Walkway at the boardwalk there was spoodles. That's what I'm thinking

1693
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Italian

1694
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,400
Canoodles canoodles is not Mediterranean

1695
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,920
Anyways, that's when you're in the thick of the night, but so

1696
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,940
Alan comes in with this this wave and this hype

1697
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,200
You know this guy might take Carson down

1698
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,720
this was kind of the feeling at the time and it starts with the song because

1699
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,480
We know Johnny's theme

1700
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:15,520
That's all that we knew is what a talk show theme could be Letterman's on at this point

1701
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,880
But it's just kind of like generic blues rock still instrumental

1702
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:26,000
Alan is like no we are yanking the talk show theme into the 80s

1703
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:32,800
We're doing it with vocals my vocals. Here is the theme song to 1983 is thick of the night

1704
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,480
Oh

1705
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,480
I

1706
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:39,360
Don't know if I don't know the context of if they played that entire song or not they should have yeah

1707
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:45,080
I I mean like I'm of two minds here one. That is a very silly thing to do

1708
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:50,760
That's a very silly meathead II vibe of the theme song of what ultimately is a show. We're like

1709
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,400
Tonight we got conservative

1710
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,040
columnist Wally George

1711
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:02,660
Richard Belzer joins us today like I don't think the show justifies its own yeah grit

1712
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,360
But so I feel on one hand that way on the other hand

1713
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,500
I love this song. This is so up my musical alley

1714
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,680
Like like I've listened to that legitimately just because I want to hear it

1715
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,660
Am I insane is that is that the lamest thing you've ever heard? No the lamest thing I've ever heard no

1716
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,680
Couldn't even imagine what the lamest thing we've ever said on the show is no no this song is fun

1717
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:35,000
That's good. It's uh I'm trying to think what it reminds me of I can't think of it off the top of my head

1718
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,640
But is there something very similar that that it reminds me?

1719
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,320
I know there's like I think there's an early Bon Jovi song that has some of that

1720
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,840
The chorus part with the like

1721
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:53,120
ascending and descending it's got a little bit of Papa don't preach in there my

1722
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:59,440
Papa don't leave there is it mama I don't remember

1723
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,440
The light on

1724
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,080
We're you know I'm much more a fan of Papa knows what's best for you the response

1725
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:14,080
We never played that leave Danny a yellow Danny a yellow played Madonna's dad and the Papa don't preach video

1726
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:19,540
And then he was unhappy with how it came out and the message that it sent so you made his own song Papa

1727
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,200
Papa just once was what's best for you?

1728
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,640
He just wants you to do

1729
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
He

1730
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,960
He wants you to do

1731
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:36,040
That is a really funny song you know how when you're in the biggest pop stars

1732
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:42,880
The biggest pop star in the world's music video, and then you write a fuck you response shouldn't have done it

1733
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:50,080
I thought they'd include my moral and message in the video, but they cut all that I love favorite of music

1734
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,080
I left my notes for her

1735
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:59,040
Ed Asner was in a Lady Gaga music video, and he wrote a song called what's with those crazy get ups oh?

1736
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,080
AI prompt no

1737
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:09,320
If it Asner had appeared yeah, yeah, yeah his well his song is his song meat ain't clothes

1738
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:19,280
You know that's on display at the park MGM the little Lady Gaga's store an exhibit that meat was taxidermied in

1739
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,440
Burbank really

1740
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:28,340
The meat well the meat was in Vegas. No they had to preserve it for the dress the preserving process

1741
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:33,840
We'd already heard she was not wearing loose meat. She was not wearing fresh loose meat no I

1742
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:39,900
Think it was preserved so it wasn't raw Jason you hearing that it wasn't loose fresh meat does that kind of like

1743
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,160
There's no Santa Claus

1744
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,240
Yeah, I

1745
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:49,360
Would be very funny of someone worse like stinking game to a red carpet

1746
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:56,040
Well, there's still somebody's got to sit next to her. I don't know what what awards it was, but you know now like

1747
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,360
Christopher Plummer is yeah

1748
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:03,600
It's like all the Oppenheimer actors showed up for the London premiere

1749
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,640
And then the clock strike struck midnight

1750
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:12,320
They all left because the actor tried kicked in if they all put on their stinking meat outfits and walked out

1751
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:19,400
Like you're calling the stinking the stinking meat outfits thinking me yeah the stinking meat outfit

1752
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:24,240
You've got a premiere that you're coordinating require dollar. I make a dime this stinks

1753
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,760
Brett can we play I have to play the other part too thick of the night too

1754
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,640
because most talk show themes don't have lyrics about being like a

1755
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,320
sidewalk

1756
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,640
superstar

1757
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,680
Wow, but most that was in the make me a sidewalk superstar

1758
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:45,320
But then also most talk show themes don't have bridges emotional bridges

1759
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,480
so here's the the

1760
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,580
Midpoint of thick of the night great

1761
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,640
I

1762
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:14,560
Magic leave a little love some nice little plunks like little synth plunks in that bridge, too. I

1763
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,140
Love it. I love all of it. Fly me over heaven on a midnight moonbeam

1764
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:26,020
That's what that is the cut. That's what's in my heart. That's what I feel inside Alan

1765
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:32,840
Got it out of me this by the way this song the same song is a collaboration with my literal favorite

1766
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:39,240
70s 80s session musicians Jay Graydon who played the guitar solo on Steely Dan's Peg and David Foster

1767
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,400
listeners might know David Foster, he was the producer of

1768
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,160
Whitney Houston's I will always love you

1769
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,480
But he's maybe better known now for who he's married to

1770
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:54,820
He was he used to be married to Yolanda Hadid from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills

1771
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:58,000
mother of Gigi and Bella right um

1772
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,340
If you've ever seen a guy very just very cocky older man

1773
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:08,240
Being interviewed in front of a piano with 16 Grammys on top. That's David Foster

1774
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,640
He now is married to Kat McPhee from the show the show smash

1775
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,520
Oh, yeah, that old guy. Yep, you got married to now and they were on the parade

1776
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,920
Oh, I was so happy to see them on the Thanksgiving parade voice in

1777
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,760
Luminous the story of us Catherine P. Really? Yes

1778
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,240
New Epcot show Wow Wow you finally said something musical that excites Jason

1779
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:41,920
I haven't watched the show yet, and I have no idea why she is a voice actor in it or what her Disney connection

1780
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,000
I mean she's it's a wonderful voice very talented

1781
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,020
I think an American Idol alumni yeah

1782
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:52,520
But it's I think a lot of people are kind of creeped out by the fact that she is 39 and he is 74

1783
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,840
And they are married it is a bigger age gap than me and my father

1784
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:05,360
And so yeah if yes if you like Jason have seen like oh that that that lady with the nice pipes

1785
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,360
And why is that old man playing piano?

1786
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:14,240
Anyway, I could do I could probably do a called shot episode about David Foster if I I gotta really consider

1787
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,480
What's my birthday called shot David Foster is a big?

1788
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:24,160
Candidate obsessive David Foster really quick a non comedic point the people who made that so if you thought the thick of the night song was good

1789
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:30,600
You know how sometimes there's these like Twitter things like 10 movies to know me or yes 10 albums

1790
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,680
I can boil it down to one song

1791
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:37,580
It is a song by the people who made that a band called airplay and the song is called nothing

1792
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:43,580
You can do about it if you want to understand Scott Gardner listen to nothing you can do about it

1793
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,920
That's all I have to say highly recommend one of the best

1794
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:50,960
In the genre of yacht a or and thick was right there with him

1795
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,960
He was running in the thick of the night with how champions is the game is

1796
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:02,200
It was maybe the problem with Alan and in this song that like I feel like late night talk shows

1797
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,520
Have we had an actual like truly like cool host?

1798
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
Arsenio yes

1799
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:15,640
That's right Arsenio who was on thick of the night a lot as a like I think network going like maybe

1800
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:23,240
Somebody else could go in there. Yeah, but he who's also cool like your Alan and then and then several years later

1801
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:30,720
He becomes like the real guy who the only guy who's I mean Letterman was like cool, but not cool chevy chevy

1802
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,540
But was chevy cool by that point. Oh, yeah

1803
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,880
He came out and missed basketball shots before his monologue

1804
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:43,480
Which mainly consisted of him sticking his tongue out and making faces what year did Chevy become not cool?

1805
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,280
He was

1806
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:50,640
Yeah, it was not I don't think he made it out of the 80s cool

1807
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,880
That's the last thing I really love of him is well

1808
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,960
I mean any I like the I like Christmas vacation too, but yeah, he's these

1809
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,440
Goofy dad you know by the time and that's that's what you like him for you know nobody thinks

1810
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:10,320
Anybody was cool for a few years yeah, he was the original drummer for Steely Dan, so you bet he was cool

1811
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,560
Isn't that weird?

1812
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,280
Yes

1813
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,440
Is anyone lost they're cool that

1814
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:25,600
Well from being the like that like that there was no model for the hot SNL star because the SNL was new he's the first

1815
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,480
Yeah, they anchor. He's like there's never been there's no

1816
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:35,940
There's never been that this breakout right and I don't think people on TV were below 30 very often

1817
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,480
It's just interesting cuz like it really like

1818
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,240
There's no

1819
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:46,180
Who's the coolest late-night host that's been around in the last so many years?

1820
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,520
Gordon

1821
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,960
Technically I think actually yes

1822
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,800
Ferguson maybe is cool like kind of cool, but he's goofy and like it's not I wouldn't say like cool

1823
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,480
Joan Rivers was always funny was she ever

1824
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,320
She was already sort of like of another gender

1825
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:10,300
I'm not saying your definition of cool is hanging out at the Playboy Mansion in the 2010s

1826
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:16,960
Then we got to give it to our bud. That's true. You're right. That wasn't what I was considering cool, but

1827
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,560
It's interesting because maybe maybe some of it is like

1828
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,880
Late night. It's like uh hey here. I am I'm the coolest guy and people like no

1829
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,120
Thank you like there's something about that turns you off the guys to be a little cheese

1830
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,520
I think there are people who think that Jimmy Fallon is cool. I know I'm not sure

1831
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:41,040
Yeah, even Alan himself on Gilbert's podcast is like he's he regrets things like this this theme song and doing the legitimate

1832
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,680
attempting legitimate music because he's like

1833
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,760
You know I like I should have been goofier with it. I should have been more moved now Jimmy Fallon

1834
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,880
He understands it, you know, he does it all for comedy

1835
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:58,440
But that was before he blurred the lines with Meghan Trainor right did Alan thick hear like idiot boyfriend and stuff on Jimmy

1836
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,280
Fallon's like comedy album from 2005 or whatever he might have

1837
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,040
Yeah, young buck. He's cooler than me and so is my son

1838
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:13,160
But only them at least I'm still number three. He sounds wistful on this interview though like he really regrets

1839
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:19,280
By the way, just confirm Kirk Cameron was on growing pains, but he was a troublemaker

1840
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,780
Michael J Fox was the young Republican and I meant my only Fox was the

1841
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,840
I didn't I knew they were not in the same that was the country

1842
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:37,200
The the Wikipedia description is like it was examining the shifting culture from the liberalism of the 60s

1843
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,920
They're the conservatism of the 80s. I didn't watch any of the either of those. No, no

1844
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:48,280
Again, I also like family ties for theme song and closing theme. Yeah, yeah sex closing theme

1845
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:53,320
Actually, let's tie it all together, but can you pull up a clip called NHL Awards? These things just keep coming

1846
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,320
There was another thing in the same era

1847
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:03,000
1988 Alan thick host something called the NHL Awards and he does a musical tribute to Canada and you will understand why I'm bringing it

1848
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,760
He will reference something that Jason just mentioned for the listener

1849
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:13,680
He is performing in front of a bunch of people with placards that are all turning around and forming different words or forming in this case

1850
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:18,840
The Canadian flag the maple worse. There's this song who got some chest hair going. Oh, yeah

1851
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,420
And then all the signs become the big word a

1852
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:06,460
And he makes a little he puts his hand down like to illustrate a short person Michael Fox's are Peewee Herman

1853
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,460
What does that mean Michael?

1854
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,840
Not Michael

1855
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,800
Canadian

1856
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,220
Yeah, I've just never really put them in the same category no

1857
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,360
You hear me? It's a fictional character. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that short is I don't know how short Paul

1858
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:32,700
Side but it's just that they're both short. Mm-hmm shorter guys. We're weird up here America

1859
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:37,600
You love Peewee Herman, but ours is Michael Fox the guy who dresses normal and acts normal. Uh-huh

1860
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,600
Really we're gonna get

1861
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:45,680
Michael Magic Johnson has moves or something, but so does grits

1862
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:53,760
Love these songs. They're all like they really remind me of like especially there's the Gufman music, but then there's

1863
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,600
The songs that Katherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy sing in best in show about their dogs

1864
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:06,760
Yes, this is like big budget versions of those songs. There's a specific kind of quote-unquote cleverness

1865
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:10,800
Yeah that you have to put in if you're parodying something like this

1866
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:16,800
Yeah, that it's like kind of clever, but it definitely feels like grandma would be like, oh how clever?

1867
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,300
You never laugh you just go not a laugh. It's not a laugh. Shake your finger

1868
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:27,440
You wear you do a happy wag at the song, but this one has even less cleverness. I think than the last one

1869
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:32,160
Yeah, now there is a big bombastic finale here, but I think we should take a little turtle break

1870
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,000
Yeah, can we get a quick hit unless you've got something like?

1871
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,320
Can we get a hit of I believe the file is turtles?

1872
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:46,560
12 days of Christmas. Yeah splinter has arrived. We're jumping around in the order of the tape, but

1873
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:52,520
You gotta have splinter singing. Yeah, that's the one of the best parts of coming out of our shells

1874
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,080
It's the way being stoned talks in that in the old style the old men's style, but then

1875
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,520
I'm skipping stick. He sings like Alan Thicke

1876
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:07,320
Skipping stone. Yeah, we'll get back to Ellen this really singing an up-tempo love song to fiber soon enough

1877
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,360
This does really look like

1878
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,600
This does really look like the shells. This might be the same

1879
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,760
It is the turtles as well. Yeah, as I've said before that the making of any actual performance have different suits

1880
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:24,880
For that tour for some reason. Yeah, well different outfits as well. What is the splinter get up to here?

1881
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,520
Ten yellow yo-yo nine

1882
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,240
Chopsticks seven seven more no six

1883
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,320
five video games

1884
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:49,440
Stolen for man the city people are falling in all Christmas

1885
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
I'm possible that's just one tape

1886
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,800
Yeah splinter totally stole four man all covers

1887
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:23,600
The city's gonna have to totally pay for new ones people kids might fall in there

1888
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,720
You can fall in and visit us they do which is what happens actually kids

1889
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,400
Visiting them at the end of this it's the only way we can make friends

1890
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,200
Brett can you pull up my turtles five?

1891
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:40,640
I think the whole premise of the special is they're looking for a gift for splinter

1892
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,600
Two comic books was real stocking stuffers back then they cost like a dollar

1893
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,160
And one of the terms folks you saying you cheaped out well saying now

1894
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,160
It's like four or five bucks a comic

1895
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,160
Well the market is wrong

1896
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:59,080
They hold up that my beloved

1897
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,120
Archie published Ninja Turtles adventures comics

1898
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:09,000
Oh, yeah as well which I sure maybe the most important work of fiction that I ever read in my entire life is these 70

1899
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
issues of this comic

1900
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,280
So yeah, whenever whenever you want. I think this is the right clip hopefully

1901
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,800
Oh

1902
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,280
Oh

1903
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:55,120
Now wide open they cannot do that how many syllables are in this song

1904
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Kid on rollerblades

1905
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,960
There's some dancing there's some choreography here a

1906
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,320
Lot of

1907
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:21,120
One of them's got a dynamic voice scarf winter's not athletic

1908
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,440
Nasal yeah, so

1909
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,840
Look splinter can kick ass

1910
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:45,640
So saying that athletic I mean he's an older rat at this point, but teenage assholes

1911
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,160
Ass if he has to yeah

1912
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:56,760
They're ninjas they can break into any shop. They want to get any item Brett put up seven real quick. Sorry, but yeah

1913
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:01,720
The sorry I'm gonna roll here or hopefully I'm right about the numbers now screwed it completely up

1914
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,400
What is the explanation from Michelangelo having?

1915
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,560
Charles Lindbergh white aviator scarf on oh

1916
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,440
When you say a white scarf do you think Charles Lindbergh?

1917
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:18,400
Aviators always wear those long like no, but it looks like a white. No, I know what you're saying

1918
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:25,080
I hear you but I just say it's funny that you thought that immediately just with a white scarf

1919
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,840
I'm 80s centric Jason is 20s centric

1920
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,200
That's what I'm saying

1921
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:35,840
If you're flying across the Atlantic where you're going to old-timey Hollywood premiere

1922
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:41,440
You know what to help you in the sky protect from all that wind yeah one thin scarf one the start of this

1923
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:48,240
They actually find the grave Rob Charles Lindbergh's grave, and they steal his famous white scarf

1924
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:53,600
That's actually the I didn't play that clip. Oh, okay. That's why Michelangelo has a scarf on because it's brutal. He looks bad

1925
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:58,200
Yeah, oh yeah, so that is as rotted as a corpse can be posed. I think when did he die?

1926
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,680
Stinks dude yeah, he's been dead for a hundred years

1927
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,740
Yeah, so play this whenever I think this is the right one, but maybe it's not who cares

1928
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,200
Jump cuts yeah

1929
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,320
So this is the gift wrap here we go okay, this is why they wrap

1930
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,560
I think they're the first to realize those two words are the same I think so

1931
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,200
It takes a lot of care

1932
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:09,520
Like the shot to the like I like the zoom's in and out constantly back and forth back and forth big backlight just

1933
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,800
Feels like the ooze from which they came yeah, this is the best directing

1934
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,940
They tried to slap hands with each other, but it was hard

1935
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,680
Little grabbers yeah

1936
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:33,600
With the low-quality video also it looks like there's only two different colors for the bandanas. It looks like yeah red and blue

1937
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,280
but that's

1938
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,280
This is a rap rap so

1939
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,120
I

1940
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,740
Kind of like rap rap honestly. It's not the best song I've ever heard you know I overlooked it

1941
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:49,000
I didn't even deliver this as a clip, but now that you put it in front of me

1942
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:54,360
It's kind of got some you know got some late 80s. Yeah, yeah smart minimal

1943
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,560
So it's an outdated kind of rap

1944
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,200
I

1945
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,360
Little

1946
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:13,080
Few too many teeth sure yeah, you really got a good view of the teeth here if you want to see their teeth watch rap rap

1947
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,320
and

1948
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,480
all

1949
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,840
You get to see real good close-ups of their little grabbers rubbing on each other's little grabbers

1950
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:26,700
Like they keep flashing shots of them like slapping threes

1951
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:31,280
Grabber on grabber reaction so

1952
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:36,500
Turtle grabbers grabbers you got to go to the video for that that's on the

1953
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,600
Eating gum lines and grabbers mm-hmm

1954
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:48,920
No nubbin shots no nubbin shots in this did ugly Sonic have worse teeth than the turtles here

1955
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:53,600
I can't remember is his I think that seeing ugly Sonic's

1956
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,640
Teeth in the digital clarity made that made it worse in a way

1957
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:05,040
Yeah, maybe that's right VHS fuzz got literally softens how just how many teeth are jammed into right into Sonic's mouth

1958
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,160
So those are the best songs in the special is those are the best songs

1959
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,560
That you're gonna get in

1960
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:18,840
This special yes, that's there's nothing the nothing nearly as good as any of these Alan thick 80s song

1961
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:23,920
I guess we I didn't mean to pit them against each other, but I guess that's what's what's ended up happening

1962
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:29,480
Well, but we also this is a definitely we're not putting up the best turtle songs also no no no we've because we've covered the best

1963
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:33,880
Turtle song yeah, but you know we would I wanted to do some Christmas. Yeah, so so they're you know

1964
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:39,480
I give them some credit. Yeah, they tried to do Christmas songs, but again without Alan

1965
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:43,640
I don't know they put in their best effort. I'm gonna play one more thing here

1966
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,200
And this this is a whole can of worms

1967
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:51,480
We maybe don't have time to get into the whole thing, but can we please pull up the clip sky dome one?

1968
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:58,780
This is where as I've done this YouTube archaeology over the years this was the point where I realized oh my god if Alan

1969
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:04,440
Thicke is singing in it. It's one of the best things that's ever been on TV, and this is no exception

1970
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:09,320
I've seen this suggested by listeners as a full episode, and it could be so I'll try to keep it brief

1971
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,200
But this is from a special called the opening of sky dome a celebration

1972
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:20,760
Sky dome is not something from Ninja Turtles. It's not where shredder operate. It's not a technodrome. No no no it's not sky drone

1973
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:26,240
Sky dome is now called Roger Center. It's the Toronto Stadium where the blue Jays play

1974
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:34,240
It's at the base of CN tower opened in 1989 with this spectacular special clearly the pride of Toronto the pride of

1975
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:39,800
Canada which we know Alan is so fond of his native home with that great song that we heard earlier

1976
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:47,040
Who else could host such a celebration this entire thing is so up our alley that it's two hours of

1977
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:54,440
sloppy live television celebrating an arena the main feature of which is a roof so that it can operate

1978
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:02,200
In right Sun or in rain, so it's two hours of hitting that point about wow

1979
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,400
We've got a stadium now

1980
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,640
We've got a dome and it has a roof

1981
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:12,980
And we've got something so specific something almost as specific as aerobics and Schwarzenegger necks or Michael Fox being RP

1982
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:19,000
We Herman there's only one lyricist who can thread that needle. It's Alan Thicke, but he's joined by a special

1983
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,600
guest another

1984
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:25,800
Canadian royalty member let's play this

1985
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,240
100,000 yes for the listeners the scope of this is so great

1986
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,920
Black tie red dress for her

1987
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,360
Better than skyfall they gotta go

1988
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,640
I'm just fearing miracles

1989
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,640
Why not get right to the point

1990
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,640
Oh my god

1991
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:24,280
Grab your phone you're in resident. You're not going anywhere. We got a sky dome to open now

1992
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,960
approximately

1993
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,680
1,000

1994
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,680
women in their 40s run out in

1995
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,880
silver sparkly

1996
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:41,160
Jumpsuits and leggings, there's so many people filling the entire arena floor

1997
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,160
Oh

1998
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,280
The scope wow

1999
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:08,440
Stare at this frame isn't am I right? It's a thousand people. It's an army of silver dancers. Probably. Yeah a lot

2000
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:14,200
Yeah, it's bigger than some Super Bowl halftime shows. I got really back then they were not as many of those things

2001
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:20,720
The scope was not as big. This is gigantic stage even like that stage is something crazy

2002
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:27,420
Ramps, I think it allows like motorcycle stunts to happen later because again, this is two hours impact

2003
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:30,600
Yeah, I do this. Maybe we maybe we do the entire thing

2004
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:36,640
Well in that case should I not say how it ends say oh it is I?

2005
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,840
Mean I don't want to oh, I'm so torn do I bury or do you hours of material?

2006
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,680
Maybe it's up to you. Um, okay, then I have gifts for you. We can end with oh, well, that sounds nice

2007
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:54,120
Okay, you know what then I won't say maybe we do have to more fully address this thing. Let's get one more little hit though

2008
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,840
Let's play

2009
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:01,640
Skydome 2 because this opening number alone could be its own episode because there's a bunch of like

2010
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:08,760
Skits and numbers essentially and of course we're dealing with you know, this is a this is an arena

2011
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:15,940
We have to talk about baseball and football and all the sports that are going to be played here through the majesty of song

2012
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:19,580
So here's a musical number about an arena roof

2013
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,600
sung by

2014
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,600
football guys

2015
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,800
I

2016
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:51,880
Slide in let the roof slide in let not let the sunshine in let the roof

2017
01:41:54,120 --> 01:42:00,000
I was based by other baseball guys baseball guys. I was wondering if you were like, oh my god, Scott. No

2018
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:04,760
I've been close with such mistakes before I'm just proud I got blue Jays, right?

2019
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:07,520
I thought they said let the roof son in

2020
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,000
Yeah, they could they could have been that I'm so, you know

2021
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,940
Well, you know, this will just be a good tease then for something in 2024

2022
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:18,020
That's why I story of how this plays out is spectacular. Yeah

2023
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:22,880
And oh and it's the you know, Al Alan thick shined on this project

2024
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:28,160
He gave him his his is a thick amount of luck and as he did on everything

2025
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:30,160
I can't think of a better

2026
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:34,840
You know, it's certainly been a gift to me to get to go through all these Alan things

2027
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:37,480
I hope it's a gift to you. I hope yeah joy to the world

2028
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:43,480
They say and what's the best way I can bring joy to this world than with the music of Alan thick

2029
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:48,400
I say that and I also to tie it back in to you know, our full

2030
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,360
the duet

2031
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,320
partners, I

2032
01:42:53,320 --> 01:43:00,600
Just think like there's there's Christmas songs and Christmas moments TV special moments, especially that are a little like played out

2033
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:07,840
We've seen Bing Crosby. Yes, David Bowie together a number of times and you know that that's held up as I was this

2034
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,480
multi-generational duet unexpected, you know, like

2035
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,520
Unexpected bedfellows for the holidays and if they can get together and briefly pretend they don't hate each other

2036
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,840
Kind of although you can see it on their faces

2037
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:25,160
You know then there can be harmony in this world forget them they're in the past the real the greatest

2038
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,160
Meeting of minds for the holidays. I say Alan thick and the Ninja Turtles

2039
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:34,600
I was so happy to talk about it and grow that you know, the the

2040
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:41,660
Family tree the Christmas family tree that comes out of that musical number. I think yes, I completely agree

2041
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,740
I have such fondness for this

2042
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:50,840
I want to say you're welcome to the audience who thought maybe we were talking a little more about MGM studios and then realized

2043
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:56,780
That it was like getting one of those cadbury eggs maybe and it's actually just an Alan thick episode

2044
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:06,800
There too we got no I got turtles Christmas I think it's great

2045
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:13,360
In the MGM studios installation, yeah, we'll do that another time, of course, well now there's some we got

2046
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:19,860
We got the list is growing of what we can what we can do next year and we're looking forward to next year a lot

2047
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:27,280
But I guess and I apologize. I don't I don't have gifts ready. Oh, it's okay. I have I just had I had some things

2048
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,840
I just wanted to quickly give out on the on the air here

2049
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,300
Jason I got this for you. It's a large box a large box

2050
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:37,600
I saw the back of your car earlier when you gave me a ride

2051
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:42,520
It looks like Michael did a bit of a wrap wrap. He did a wrap wrap. I was running very late

2052
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:46,340
So that's a really poorly wrapped giant box. God. This is your I do it

2053
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:50,160
Okay, and I know I got myself a fun a fun thing too that I wrapped as well

2054
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:54,900
And I'll open it up. I just wanted I didn't want to be left out opening up a gift in case

2055
01:44:55,220 --> 01:45:02,540
We weren't like a pleasant ASMR. Yeah, let's do Jason you go first. I think is it be careful how close we go

2056
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:06,340
Well that might be awful. I think I'm not going terribly close

2057
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:11,500
I am a professional if forever dog wants to do an ASMR show with Jason

2058
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:16,700
I think he would be interested if we can broker that deal for now run your little grabbers

2059
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,700
He's Jason's gonna be eating maple

2060
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:23,180
Jason's gonna be eating maple cookies on the mic and

2061
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:28,660
It's Magneto's helmet. I got Jason a full-size Magneto's helmet

2062
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:32,540
That he can wear if he wants he doesn't have to wear it

2063
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:35,400
Maybe I should have given it to him at the start so he could have worn it all show

2064
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:40,720
I have a question. Yeah, where'd you find that? Where did I find it? You find the the helmet?

2065
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,720
In conjunction with Disney

2066
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:50,500
I did not my question is because I noticed that there were a lot of

2067
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:56,980
Fancy helmets available on deal vibes the embattled Twitter account. It's possible magnitude

2068
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:02,840
I did get I look I did not this retailed for a hundred dollars. I did not spend on two dollars

2069
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:08,880
I spent much less on it, and it is because one of my accounts told me about the discount well

2070
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,940
Thank God you didn't get that account into the mess with the Minotaur yes

2071
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:19,140
Few so yeah, so anyway it might have been deal vibes. I don't actually remember it could have it could have been deal

2072
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:25,380
Account that I follow that has yes on helmets. Yes, I couldn't tell you what it is and I did a lot

2073
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:30,180
I don't want to get into it too. I have with coupons and discounts and red card

2074
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:35,900
I got that thing at such a good price. I love it that makes it that much sweeter

2075
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:40,340
It's so sweet, and I said Jason's Jason's request is not expensive gifts

2076
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:45,740
It's gifts where the most money possible was saved in the acquisition. I knew he would appreciate that aspect as well

2077
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:47,540
But he's gonna be wearing this helmet a lot

2078
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:51,540
I have a feeling around the house can you get it on before no there's too much packaging

2079
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:53,540
I was gonna say you can get it on before the end of the episode

2080
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:57,740
I'll try to get a picture though. I'm sure there will be a Marvel episode

2081
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:02,580
Next year where that will need to have Jason wear the Magneto helmet yes

2082
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:09,140
It starts he has it on wow it's Magneto then we say one thing to Jason and he goes what?

2083
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,060
Repeat that louder you men

2084
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,100
Scott are you?

2085
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:23,500
Avatar way of water visual dictionary this you will now know what everything in avatar is called

2086
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:30,440
In four these can you even name what the fruit baskets are called in the avatar yes?

2087
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:34,700
I can they're pandoran fruit baskets. Yeah, I guess that's kind of instinctual

2088
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:42,480
Yeah, can you can anyone even name the knives in avatar? Why yes k-bar mk13 combat knives damn it

2089
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:45,560
That's gonna look there's gonna be a lot more avatar coming soon

2090
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:50,680
Well some sort of experience coming to Disneyland they keep saying experience experience

2091
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,840
Experience it's not necessarily an attraction or a ride

2092
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,760
It's an experience, but we'll need to know and you're gonna be our expert with this book

2093
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:02,720
Do you think props for in the movie and recreations of sets?

2094
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:09,520
Hey Jason, I don't want to speculate because that would just kind of ruin the fun for people going into these six years

2095
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:16,360
There's a full spread of both showing the full bodies of both Captain mix scores be and dr. Ian Garvin there you go

2096
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:21,480
Yeah, the two mean whale hunters Garvin isn't well right what's that?

2097
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Jermaine is not me he's conflicted

2098
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:29,720
Yeah, but he goes along with it. You know if he was really nice you wouldn't have the job to begin with yeah

2099
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:35,200
So and then I got myself something you know what Mike get we're in the turtle spirit, so I you know obviously I know

2100
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,280
What's it? Oh? Yeah?

2101
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:42,100
Okay, I remember the turtle spirit, and you know I just got myself a little something that

2102
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:48,780
Hmm you seem surprised what what is this?

2103
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:55,880
That's not a turtle thing. That's a power rangers power rangers. What is what kind of animal is that?

2104
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:00,800
It's a mighty morphin what it says mighty morphin mighty minotaur

2105
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:02,520
Whoa

2106
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,400
Mike

2107
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,160
Do you need to drop that you need to throw it down?

2108
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:11,700
I don't know if you can I'm worried about you holding a little minotaur what now

2109
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:15,980
I have a little minotaur that I need to whoa display and have in your home

2110
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,400
Are you sure we're happy to take that off your hands Mike I?

2111
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,440
Think I need to keep it whatever happened whoa

2112
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:29,080
It's like you need to box you need to live with it as the ultimate test of your metal. Yeah

2113
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:33,760
Well under if the person who got this and replaced what I had in the package

2114
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:38,320
Got this on some sort of a deal Twitter where it was only $11 marked down from its

2115
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:47,000
Provisional 30 something Wow price you are saying that deal vibes themselves offered a deal on a minotaur

2116
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,120
I think so yeah, that's what I'm saying well the heralds that is

2117
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:54,360
2023

2118

Came to a perfect close didn't it it really did

2119
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:59,780
Oh perfect yeah

2120
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:08,500
Wow wow we fused minotaurs and deal vibes in a way where like Alan Thicke and the Ninja Turtles they're inseparable now

2121
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:12,660
You want to get that baby out of the bars that do you keep that in the box you want to bust him?

2122
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:16,940
Well, there's no window. There's no packaging window. There's no point. There's no point keeping in the box

2123
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:19,860
Okay, unless you're gonna resell it, but no I don't think so

2124
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:24,780
Well, I don't like that they got rid of the packaging windows for a lot of toys

2125
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:31,580
But they've I think corrected of that a lot in a lot of different releases so yeah, geez let's meet him

2126
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,700
Unboxing

Okay, well you work on that maybe away from the microphone and well I wrap things up

2129
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:48,340
I believe with that tie together you have survived podcast the ride for

2130
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,620
2023 this is the last

2131
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:56,540
Main feed of the year and I can't think of a better way to do it than watching a big pile of clips with you

2132
01:50:56,540 --> 01:50:58,540

Hmm. Are you scared? Yes?

2137
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,700
I'm just I'm projecting confidence like Alan Thicke would

2138
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:17,260
But I'm terrified inside

2139
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,860
If you give him a goldfish cookie, he'll smell smell like me

2140

Ever oh yeah, yeah have him devour some of the have him stick his neck into that maple syrup

01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:20,480
Might sound a little bit long

2152
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:25,040

2161
