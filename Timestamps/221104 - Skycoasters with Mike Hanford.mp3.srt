1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Dog.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Record, it's Podcast the Ride.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about rides, except sometimes it's not, and also

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
it's often just speculation about rides that we haven't been on because we're too scared.

6
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

7
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Yes, I am here and I am scared still to this day as I enter my late 30s.

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Well, I've been in my late 30s for a little while.

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
But yes, you know what's funny?

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,640
You remind me now, I looked at some of our reviews on whatever Apple podcasts because

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I haven't done that in a while.

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,640
And there are, they're so nice people, are so nice five, oh, this is wonderful.

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
We love the good boys, whatever.

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
But then you get like two stars.

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,640
What is this?

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
This isn't about rides.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,640
These guys just go, it's 10 minutes of tangents.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
What are they going to get to the topic?

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,640
And I go, oh, I guess we have to allow for that part to get figured out.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah, just there.

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
They might not even dislike it.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
They're just processing what all the listeners deal with at some point.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
I'm not even mad at them.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
I'm not like they're not mean.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
It's not like they wouldn't be on like a Jimmy Kimmel mean social media bit or something.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
They're just confused.

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
And I understand it.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
I get it.

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,640
It's an adjustment that you have to make.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Look, in this case, look, we are talking about a ride and Jason Sheridan hasn't been on the ride.

31
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
But I feel like you might you might go on this ride today.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Yeah, I would say this definitely a ride.

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,640
And one I would consider.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Consider at least consider at least once I got over the hurdle, not a fear of being like however high you are in the air, but the fear of the dreaded add on the dreaded charge.

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
The price that we get you.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Yes.

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Jason's biggest fear.

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
Could you scale it?

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,640
But now I can chalk it up to research when I was like 18 or 19.

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,640
You couldn't write off your theme park add on or your tourist site, your gorge add on.

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Yeah, in theory.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Sometimes this ride appears at gorges.

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,640
This is an attraction that is everywhere.

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Maybe you don't know the name Skycoaster offhand, but they exist all over the place.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,640
It's in every continent except Antarctica, which Antarctica.

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Why are you sleeping on it?

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Get a sky coaster going.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,640
It's a big like harness and cable based attraction that is an add on many theme parks everywhere.

49
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
And we're going to delve into it with somebody who's done it.

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:18,640
And if you are a fan of today's guest and you're looking at this and thinking this is a long overdue guest, you don't know the half of it.

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,640
The birthday boys from the sloppy boys.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Mike Hanford.

53
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Hey, hello.

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Hello.

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Thank you for having me yet again.

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Does the audience know what happened last time?

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
They don't know.

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,640
I have maybe have like alluded to it, but I don't think they know the full.

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Yeah, we haven't explained it.

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,640
We had a wonderful conversation, a long two hour conversation.

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
It was great.

62
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,640
People were being informative, funny stories were being told.

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Particularly good.

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,640
I think I'm not patting myself on the back.

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
You were great.

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Of course.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
I mean, like, oh, I hope I have something to say.

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I don't know much about rides.

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,640
These guys are the experts and we had a great we had a great conversation.

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,640
We did all about sky coasters.

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
It was sky coasters.

72
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
And then it fell into the pit.

73
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,640
It became the very first podcast, the ride that was ever completely lost.

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,640
The only one aside from we lost a city walk saga, but then we just re recorded it.

75
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,640
This is this one, you know, in a much broader sense, just disappeared.

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Mike, I feel like you have to my Carlson.

77
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,640
I think you have to go back into your stress of that because you had to deal with it first and most.

78
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Yeah. So we were using a little zoom recorder and it was a hot day.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,640
We hadn't figured everything out maybe about how we were recording outside.

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
We were just to do it in person.

81
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
And it was last year.

82
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I don't know Los Angeles.

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I mean, probably everywhere.

84
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,640
But lately, Los Angeles has gotten so morbidly hot.

85
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Yeah. August and September.

86
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,640
So it was a nice like backyard chat, which I like to do that was over a year ago.

87
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Yeah.

88
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
You know, we were all having fun.

89
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
It was hot facts.

90
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Summer. Everyone was acting like, you know, just living life to the fullest.

91
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
What summer? Hot Vax.

92
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
So hot. Oh, that's right.

93
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Yeah. Oh, yes.

94
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
When the Vax came and changed everything.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Gum companies were doing ads saying like, go out and kiss strangers after you're vaccinated.

96
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
As long as you chew Trident gum.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,640
We have the vaccine in the gum now.

98
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Yeah, we have the vaccine in the gum.

99
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Trust us.

100
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Only us.

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Yeah, I do look at my Vax card and it's like, you know, they got the date and it says Trident next to it.

102
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Yeah. Poverty, Procter & Gamble. Yeah.

103
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,640
So we were in the heat and I noticed it like toward the end of recording that I was like, oh, this should be like in direct sun light.

104
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
That's not good.

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,640
So I didn't cover it, but I think it was too late.

106
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah. Because then I was went to stop it and do everything.

107
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,640
And then it like it was loading forever.

108
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Then it shut down.

109
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,640
It was the dreaded like we were done and then it was like, oh, great.

110
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Thanks. Thanks for having me.

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
And then like you were like, hold on.

112
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Yeah. In a tone that just meant.

113
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm reliving it now and I feel the stress coming back.

114
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,640
It's like the muscle memory of the stress.

115
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
I feel like you had to, unfortunately.

117
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Well, yeah, I am the one who hits record.

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,640
I have to pay attention to it when we're not doing it in the studio.

119
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I know how you feel.

120
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,640
It's not your fault at all, but I know you just because you were the closest to hit the record button.

121
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
It's on you. You feel what it's not.

122
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
It is. Well, it is.

123
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,640
It's like in Apollo 13 doesn't one of them feel maybe Kevin Bacon feels the guilt the most.

124
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Yeah. What happened to you is that he pressed the buttons.

125
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Yeah. You're Kevin Bacon and I'm Kevin or whatever the real astronauts name was.

126
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Yeah. Well, we don't know that.

127
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
We just know Kevin Bacon.

128
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
We don't know that's been lost.

129
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
There's no way to look that up.

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,640
So Jonathan space, probably.

131
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Yeah, yeah, probably.

132
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:47,640
I think what we learned was that like the Zoom recorders are pretty rugged in terms of hot and cold, but the direct sunlight will just destroy them.

133
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Because as that was happening, my phone was also like a Brit.

134
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,640
My phone did that Apple overheat thing.

135
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
And I went, that's weird.

136
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Those screens. Yeah, those.

137
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Crazy.

139
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,640
So but anyway, you could have been nicer about it, which is great because look, it's oh, that's that's great.

140
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I'm glad the time was valuable because you're doing it again.

141
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I'm not convinced this is being recorded.

142
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
We had an issue with I can't hear anything.

143
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
My headphones. If you're watching the video, I'm not wearing these.

144
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,640
I was wearing some of us or not.

145
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
There will at least be video recorded.

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I think we'll be able to dub it over.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
For some reason, the audio isn't working.

148
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Now we have to bring you in and make you dub over because we have videos.

149
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
You can just go.

150
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
You've done 80 hours.

151
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
All right.

153
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
So just watch your mouth for the next 90 minutes.

154
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Remember all your time.

155
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
I don't memorize what I say.

156
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Let's all do that.

157
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,640
So you do get the superlative of being on the podcast.

158
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
The ride lost episode.

159
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
But you might also be our cooler.

160
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,640
You know, the guy that you know, said to like, he's on a run.

161
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Send him next to it.

162
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
That is William H.

163
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Macy.

164
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,640
There was also then because then I saw you the next day or so because you

165
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,640
organized a bar hang and it was that I gave you the official verdict.

166
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Are you so are you sure?

167
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
I tried.

169
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
I tried to retrieve it.

170
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I was online.

171
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Yeah, you had like little hack notions.

172
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Yeah, you told you told me and I instantly said two shots of anything you got

173
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
behind the bar.

174
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,640
We need to erase this from our memories right now.

175
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
That's right.

176
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
That's the spirit.

177
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,640
But then that was at eventual podcast, the right topic.

178
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Tam O'Shanter with the guest for that episode, Tim Calpacus, who the next

179
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,640
morning we all got texts from saying I have covid and we may have everyone may

180
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,640
have and you two didn't feel well because you both did shots of creme de

181
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
mince.

182
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Yeah.

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Mike Woodard from behind the bar.

184
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
He said anything.

185
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Anything.

186
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Whatever is closest.

187
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
The nearest bottle.

188
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
The durian blue chorus out, please.

189
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
My favorites.

190
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
But then anyway, you immediately said let's do it again.

191
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
I said, oh, yeah, maybe we could talk about something different.

192
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,640
And you said, no, we're doing skycoaster.

193
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
The only thing I know.

194
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
No, because it did.

195
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
It was when you asked me to do the show, I was like, oh, what would be a ride?

196
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
I know specifically.

197
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,640
And this kind of was the only one I could think of that was like I've been on it.

198
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,640
I because I've been on roller coaster before.

199
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
I don't remember the loops and the twists.

200
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I don't remember any of it gets very to we don't talk about a lot of roller

201
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
coasters.

202
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Sure.

203
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I get into like, well, and then the G's and the like, it's sort of becomes very

204
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
dry and factual.

205
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
I got a funny roller coaster story.

206
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
I'll tell you as we get into it.

207
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Oh, great.

208
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Since the last recording.

209
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Oh, I was wondering, yeah, if anything had transpired related to our show in

210
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
last year.

211
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,640
But skycoast, you're you're committed to skycoasters, although in the

212
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
intervening time, I think we all forgot what these were called.

213
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Yeah.

214
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Yes.

215
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Yes.

216
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Yes.

217
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Yes.

218
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
You texted and said, are we still doing the giant swing?

219
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
And I didn't know either.

220
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Those things could be named that on the, you know, some signage.

221
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
It could be called giant swing.

222
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I think that's it might be a more accurate title because skycoaster the listener,

223
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,640
if you haven't seen one of these, you might not be picturing what we're talking

224
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,640
about because coasters, the biggest keyword when you think coasters track, I

225
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
would say.

226
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
And there's wheel on track.

227
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Right.

228
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
And we also do.

229
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Yes.

230
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
What the word coaster translates from.

231
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Yeah.

232
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
It's from the Latin origin.

233
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Yes.

234
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:29,640
But it's not it is just it is like a it's adjacent to bungee bungee jump.

235
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Jumping bungee.

236
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Dives swing.

237
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
I mean, you see there's bungee swings.

238
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Yeah.

239
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,640
But then it's not bungee because it was invented to be a better bungee.

240
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
They were trying to read the bungee.

241
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
And something that's more of a free fall.

242
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Yeah.

243
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Well, without the snap back, because that seems like the unappealing part of no one

244
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
here has done a bungee dive.

245
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
I'm afraid of I'll be honest.

246
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm afraid.

247
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Seems like if it's it just seems like a apparatus or an event that will happen

248
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,640
sort of off grid, if that makes sense.

249
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
So I just safety protocols are there.

250
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah, it feels like it.

251
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Because like at Disney, for the most part, you know, you they've gone through sort

252
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
of you assume safety checks every morning.

253
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
In fact, yes, there's too much money to be lost at Disneyland.

254
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
But the thing like the ones who you seem like on a bridge.

255
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Yeah. Is that permanent?

256
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I don't know. Right.

257
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Are they just tying it up there?

258
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Like that seems like the MTV sports version when people like do their own like this is

259
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
I have my own bungee equipment.

260
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
I do this.

261
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,640
And then we opened up as stands or like then it felt like who's checking this stuff.

262
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Who's regulating?

263
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640
We get five bungee deaths since 2015.

264
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
That's not in America.

265
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
But deaths are better.

266
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Death is death.

267
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
Death is not.

268
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
I think we all agree.

269
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I think we all agree.

270
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Death is bad.

271
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Is that can I read the summary of like what the creators I just think this is so odd what

272
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
the creators had in mind.

273
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Yes.

274
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
They invented this.

275
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Mm hmm.

276
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:03,640
They wanted to find a way to let others experience the thrill of jumping out of a plane or the

277
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,640
thrills of bungee jumping but with the safety factor of a merry-go-round.

278
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
How do you get to that point?

279
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,640
How do you get to the point where you're like so this and this but then it's as safe as

280
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
getting on a little carousel.

281
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,640
I think yeah that seems tough to do but it seems like I think they were kind of after

282
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,640
what we're talking about where if you're worried about like this bungee jump operation seems

283
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,640
like two guys who have a bridge that nobody's told them to leave.

284
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Right.

285
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Could we get it seems like almost what they wanted more was like theme park infrastructure

286
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,640
and safety and also that this could be kind of like rubber stamps in a lot of different

287
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
theme parks.

288
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Which it is in like a lot of big ones and six flags and you know the chains.

289
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,640
And it's so easy it's just like an arch or two sticks and put a swing between them.

290
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Yeah pretty much yeah it's like a there's like a there's kind of like a loop or an A

291
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
frame.

292
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Yeah.

293
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,640
And there's another big stick that you are pull that's the technical term and it's you

294
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,640
are pulled back by that one and then released.

295
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Is that right.

296
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Yeah.

297
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
And I think you pull it yourself.

298
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
The one I did.

299
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I yeah I forgot.

300
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
So I've talked about this.

301
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
I did it in I think sixth or seventh grade.

302
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,640
We did like a school trip the end of the year and we had to borrow money from a cool teacher

303
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
who there were like three of us who wanted to do it.

304
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
We're like oh well we don't have any money.

305
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,640
And our cool teacher was like I'll pay for you guys if you pay me back tomorrow.

306
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Done.

307
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Money exchange with the teachers.

308
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Wow that is weird.

309
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,640
It felt like this is not your what you need to do for us right now.

310
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
But we did it and you go up.

311
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
We were in threes.

312
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
You could do it probably these days.

313
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,640
They probably have them as much as six or seven.

314
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
That seems like a bad idea.

315
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Six or seven people can be up on that thing.

316
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,640
But it's like a bit is like kind of a like a sack almost.

317
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Yeah.

318
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
You get in this blanket.

319
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Yeah.

320
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
You lay face down.

321
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,640
I think we put these like you know when you go to the dentist and you put it they put that like they do x-rays they put sort of a smock.

322
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
A lead vest.

323
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
A lead vest.

324
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Do you like that as a nap fan or is that like oh it's a little relaxing.

325
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
I do find it a little comforting.

326
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
I mean weighted blankets are very popular.

327
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,640
I don't think I would like that much weight on me when I slept all night.

328
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
But you do like wearing a lead vest.

329
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,640
I kind of like I've never liked going to the dentist.

330
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,640
I really didn't like it when I was young.

331
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,640
So like having a little comfort having a little you know safety blanket.

332
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Well I don't like it because I mean that means they're giving me the x-rays and they're putting a plastic in my mouth and I'm a gagger.

333
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Me too.

334
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
And it's got to be just so they keep like moving around.

335
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:49,640
And you got to make sure breathing your nose and like I'm just like this I'm like it's like clockwork orange for like 10 minutes and I'm like that's the way to do it.

336
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
It always goes through my mind too.

337
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,640
It's like we got this laser shooting right in my head and we're just covering my body with the lead.

338
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Yeah they're shooting your brain.

339
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I need a lead helmet.

340
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Oh that'd be cool too if they gave you some big like you know.

341
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Tron helmet.

342
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Yeah yeah or honey I shrunk the kids.

343
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Oh yeah yeah sure.

344
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Or more of a because it's just your mouth so it's just it should be more of like a Roman helmet.

345
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Yeah.

346
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
That kind of goes like Magneto's helmet.

347
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Yeah yeah yeah.

348
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
With like a little cut out here maybe.

349
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,640
With the little nose ridge I like that on a helmet.

350
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Yeah yeah yeah.

351
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
When it would be at a super villain or a soldier.

352
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,640
It's funny to think of a Roman soldier with that little nose piece.

353
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Yeah.

354
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Those things aren't held on their head so tightly that like if you get hit in the nose that whole thing the whole helmet is going to pop off and.

355
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Yeah.

356
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
The arrows is getting hit.

357
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Or spin around.

358
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Yeah that's the worst thing.

359
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Oh right and then it's jutting into your back.

360
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Yeah.

361
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Yeah.

362
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Look there's a reason the empire collapsed okay.

363
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
They paid too much attention to ornamental nose pieces.

364
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah.

365
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Nose ridges.

366
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Wait where were we?

367
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Oh the blanket the heavy blanket.

368
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Oh yeah so they kind of put you in this smock thing if I remember correctly.

369
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,640
And then the three of you three of us got into this like other harness thing that went in front of us.

370
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,640
They sort of lay you down on your you're looking at your facing down and they pull you up and then one of us had to pull the string.

371
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Pull the rip cord and then we away we go.

372
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
And I think they counted it off like from a megaphone.

373
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Here we go one two three.

374
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,640
I the making you do it I hate.

375
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Oh my god.

376
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,640
This is an element that I don't skydiving the jumping off the stratosphere in Vegas.

377
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,640
They make you jump and I don't like a ride that forces me to start it.

378
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Right right right.

379
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Because there I can't do it.

380
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Even like rides I like I bet I wouldn't be able to.

381
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Yes I know what you mean.

382
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Pull a big lever.

383
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,640
If like the times I've jumped off of like a high dive or a high cliff into a lake or something.

384
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
It is always that like okay I'm going to go.

385
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Yeah I mean count from down from 10.

386
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,640
After 10 I'm now going to count up to three and I will do it on three.

387
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
I promise you all.

388
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Yeah I can't.

389
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
I can't do it.

390
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,640
This might be a weird thing to equate it to but now that you and I have both had children doesn't it feel like the ultimate.

391
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Like we have to pull the rip cord and I feel like the way both of us do it was like we still didn't quite do it.

392
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
It was kind of like to do what we'll see.

393
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
We'll see.

394
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
They have kids.

395
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Yeah to decide to do it.

396
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
It still felt like not a full pull of the ribcage.

397
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Like I don't know maybe it'll happen.

398
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
I don't know.

399
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Let's not think about it.

400
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Well you want it to be.

401
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Maybe it won't.

402
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
It probably won't actually won't and then we want to.

403
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Well we.

404
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
I mean this is too intimate.

405
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I mean it happens real quick for us.

406
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
We were very lucky.

407
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,640
But yes I don't think that's too intimate.

408
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Well to me.

409
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,640
I'm covering up.

410
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
This is so personal.

411
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,640
I just don't want to reveal so much about myself.

412
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,640
But but yeah well to some degree it's such a big deal.

413
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I mean I have said before I almost wish like we just like during the pandemic especially I was like I wish we just had the kid already.

414
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Like I wish it had just happened somehow.

415
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,640
So there are big life choices where you're like OK this is going to be intense but we got to do it.

416
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Could somebody else just do it for me.

417
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Yes.

418
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Could somebody else just decide.

419
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
This happens all the time.

420
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
That's kind of what happens.

421
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
You let.

422
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
We let God decide.

423
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Whatever you want to define the ultimate decider.

424
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,640
This is the best we can do because we're too afraid to go on this thing and pull a rip cord.

425
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Well metaphorically we've still not pulled rip.

426
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
I want to go back and talk about the rip cord.

427
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
But after talking about having children it seems silly.

428
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Here's one more thing about the piece of nylon you actually do have to know.

429
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Mike's under a lot of stress at this moment with sleep.

430
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
This is what he needs is to think about something else.

431
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Yes.

432
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Sixth grade ijinks.

433
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Week five.

434
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
We're in the shit.

435
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Oh you're very.

436
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Yeah.

437
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
You look great.

438
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Thank you.

439
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
You get to sleep.

440
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
You could never tell.

441
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Thank you.

442
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
So going back to the rip cord.

443
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Somebody has to pull it and it's one of those things.

444
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,640
You know we were like little seventh eighth graders so we didn't have the big muscle man muscles we have now.

445
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,640
So it's inevitably it's that thing where someone like pulls it a couple of times and you're like is that it is that it.

446
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,640
And then it gets you on one you don't even think is coming because like they pull it three times it doesn't work.

447
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,640
And then they give a one real big pull and then you go down.

448
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
So you don't even really get to like savor the moment.

449
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
You're kind of like when's it going to happen.

450
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Oh yeah.

451
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Oh gee.

452
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
It happened.

453
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
It just suddenly.

454
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Yeah.

455
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,640
That feels to me like the the vests because there's a cord that you're pulling on the airplane vests.

456
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Yeah.

457
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
If there was an emergency.

458
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Right.

459
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
And I've always been so sure I would not get it.

460
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Like it sounds simple.

461
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
Yeah.

462
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,640
They probably make it simple but aren't you like positive that you would fuck it up.

463
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
You're here.

464
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
You're grabbing the seat cushion before you even try.

465
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
I think so.

466
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Just to be sure.

467
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm getting my phone and my iPad and get that above water.

468
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Putting my hands up.

469
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,640
I haven't listened to the the like safety warnings on a plane in years because you know what's going on.

470
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,640
And if something did happen I'm like fuck I what are we doing.

471
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
I haven't been listening to this in a long time.

472
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
I've updated on this.

473
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
I've forgotten everything.

474
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
It's also crisis wise.

475
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
I just don't know how I'll perform.

476
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I don't really know.

477
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,640
I've been in like a minor you know minor crises where I'm late to record a podcast.

478
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
But.

479
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,640
I thought I did something wrong today because I pulled up and you were both standing outside.

480
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
I was like oh what the fuck did I do now.

481
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
We were mad.

482
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Am I going to get yelled at.

483
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,640
I've only been awake for an hour and 15 minutes.

484
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
I couldn't have done anything yet.

485
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Oh I definitely was like getting ready at nine today.

486
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,640
I was like is it 10 we're doing this or was it nine.

487
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Nine nine's too early to rip core.

488
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,640
It's really get caffeine get the juices flowing before you talk.

489
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Well so then so the rip cord is pulled then you're then you're swinging then you're free falling.

490
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,640
How was the experience you're doing the old Tom Petty plunge as they call it.

491
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,640
You go down you swing and then you swing way out above the whole theme park and every were you also.

492
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Darien Lake Darien right outside of your buffalo.

493
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
OK.

494
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,640
And they've one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in my life happened there.

495
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I'll tell you about that in a second.

496
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
We flew you fly way out over the park.

497
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,640
You kind of maybe wave to people so people are looking up at you and you go back and forth a few times and then you're done.

498
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
And it's not that exciting.

499
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
It's not.

500
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
It doesn't make a mark on your life really.

501
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Other than.

502
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Hey I can talk about this on a podcast one day.

503
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
What's a podcast.

504
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:29,640
I remember last time that towards the end I was trying to do some like like so what's for the listeners would you recommend the sky coaster expand you.

505
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
You did say no.

506
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
I think there's a skipper wall.

507
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
You get your thrills in other places.

508
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,640
But the also during like they had the Superman ride of steel which was kind of new at the time.

509
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
This was a six flags also yes.

510
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Yes.

511
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Then became a six flags but they had the predator was a cool roller coaster wooden roller coaster anyway.

512
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
When it became a six flags we went back.

513
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
So this was after eighth grade.

514
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
There was Superman I see it goes.

515
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:02,640
I don't know if there's different versions of it but it's one of those ones that like it ends when it ends it's just like the cars come in really fast.

516
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
It's like stop right there.

517
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
Yeah.

518
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
And we were waiting in line.

519
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
We were the next right up.

520
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,640
The thing comes back in and this guy was in his seat who didn't really enjoy the ride and was like get me off this ride.

521
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Not now right now.

522
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,640
That is that is lived in my brain rent free as they say for many years.

523
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:28,640
The difference between now and right now is not enough right now.

524
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
But I got it.

525
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
He was a big guy.

526
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Just funny to think of like his kids were around him and just like we had fun.

527
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Give me off this thing.

528
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Wow.

529
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:43,640
That six six flags for some reason you will hear more memorable quotes from strangers I feel like than any other theme park.

530
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Because like when we geo and I went to fright fest it was like there's like 10 quotes of like random like when like when we heard the dad go watch your brother I got to go take a shit.

531
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Which I might not have exactly right.

532
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
But that's the gist of it.

533
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Everyone kind of cuts loose at a theme park and you even your language gets a little loose.

534
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
But see a six flags everyone's comfortable.

535
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
They're not.

536
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Yes.

537
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,640
So uptight and black tie affair.

538
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,640
You know I have to use the lavatory watch your your my son and my daughter of which you both know each other.

539
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Six Flags you know you could have a beer and a little pen and really cut loose.

540
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,640
That's what I wanted to do.

541
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:31,640
I went to a six flags not right after we recorded the episode last year and they I didn't know Magic Mountain had a sky coaster.

542
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Oh and I took a picture of myself very sad and mournful in front of the sky coaster due to the incident.

543
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
But I didn't get I didn't want to wait in that beer pen.

544
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,640
Did you line how much was the sky coaster.

545
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Do you remember.

546
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
I don't think I got close enough to see.

547
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
OK.

548
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,640
We sloppy boys were just on tour and we went past the on the five past the Magic Mountain.

549
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,640
And I was like oh we should do this for an episode like go there and basically what you guys do.

550
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
But I looked up tickets they're like eighty six bucks.

551
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,640
I was like that's crazy off off season like Magic Mountain.

552
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Well I don't know maybe I just don't know prices.

553
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Prices.

554
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,640
You need to get the annual pass is like ninety five dollars.

555
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Yeah.

556
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
And it pays for itself in one.

557
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
Yeah.

558
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
It's like it doesn't make sense to go once.

559
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Yeah.

560
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
Yeah.

561
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
You have to go five times.

562
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,640
But then I did that and then I was like oh maybe the annual pass will make sense.

563
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:29,640
I thought that before I went in and then after spending two hours there I was like I would do not want to be back here.

564
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,640
There's also so many I feel like deals are much easier to get for six flags than.

565
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Yeah.

566
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Yeah.

567
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Pepsi.

568
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Yeah.

569
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Yeah.

570
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
In the car like scrounged around in the trunk.

571
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
I bet you could sneak in.

572
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
I bet it's not that hard.

573
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Yeah.

574
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,640
It is just kind of like at least that one's just sort of like against the hills.

575
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't think anybody's.

576
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Yeah.

577
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Yeah.

578
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
And you can jump fence.

579
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Yeah.

580
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Yeah.

581
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Did I talk in that six weeks episode about the flume ride that I went on one of the only

582
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,640
things I did that were that had like a kind of like a wheel that was powering the ride

583
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,640
that where they just slathered on a bunch of tar and I could have so easily stuck my

584
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,640
hand in that tar and just had my hand.

585
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,640
There's no barricade or a sign telling you not to.

586
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,640
It's just my strongest memory of the day.

587
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Like it was like a cake frosting.

588
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,640
That's why you go to six flags for that for those memories.

589
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Yes.

590
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
For the tar for the dad yelling at his kid for.

591
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Yeah.

592
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,640
That and you go by the midway and you see every like booth has a hose and they're just

593
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,640
cleaning the walkways with hoses and it's like why are you just doing this.

594
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
There's no one here.

595
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Surely a broom could do the same thing and not waste water in this barren Valencia.

596
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
Especially there.

597
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Yeah.

598
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Such a dream.

599
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,640
So well so you was like fine but then not.

600
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Did you feel like you wasted the teachers money.

601
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,640
No because it was fun at the time but just looking back at it like if I saw one now it

602
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
would be like oh yeah I got you a thrill.

603
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
It's a quick ride.

604
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
That's the thing.

605
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
It's very quick.

606
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,640
It's like a roller coaster is longer.

607
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Yeah.

608
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,640
So it's like yeah like once you do it it has to last like what under a minute.

609
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Yeah because it's the initial drop and then a few swings.

610
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,640
It's not a lot of like swinging back and forth especially if you're a light little kid.

611
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
It's very short.

612
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
You just kind of like whee and you flip.

613
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Just sort of go back down like a leaf.

614
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,640
You're on your belly which I don't like.

615
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
This is another thing I don't like.

616
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,640
I haven't done the Superman coaster or what's the other one?

617
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Tatsu.

618
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Tatsu.

619
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
This is a thing I maybe will conquer one day but I am afraid.

620
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
This is left on your fear list.

621
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm afraid to be on my belly.

622
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,640
It's like you know we're doing for the baby what they call it tummy time.

623
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,640
You put the baby on to get the baby to get its head up and I hate tummy time for me.

624
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
For yourself.

625
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Or on the coaster.

626
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
Whatever.

627
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
You like it I know.

628
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Yeah I'm like very.

629
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
You're a pro.

630
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
You're a belly boy.

631
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
I'm a belly boy.

632
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Well I can't fall asleep on my stomach but as I'm trying to fall asleep I'll do it for

633
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
a minute or two and then I'll wake up.

634
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Yeah I like sleeping on my stomach.

635
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Don't get me wrong.

636
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,640
I like sleeping on my stomach but I can't convince myself to fall asleep on my stomach.

637
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
I can convince myself to fall asleep on my stomach.

638
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Yeah.

639
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,640
It's not a good thing for my neck maybe but yeah I know it makes me uncomfortable.

640
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
The legs dangling makes me uncomfortable.

641
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Belly time on a roller coaster makes me uncomfortable.

642
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Do you share any of this?

643
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Do you understand any of this or these particular or would you just kind of go on whatever?

644
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
I've been on Tatsu I think.

645
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Yeah.

646
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
That was fun.

647
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Yeah.

648
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,640
It's like when will this thing just open up and we fall into the little forest down there.

649
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,640
If they would give me like a little extra something to hold onto like a little like a

650
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,640
train like that loop on a train that I could hold onto or something like just in case.

651
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Yes.

652
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Even just because I have to put my tension somewhere.

653
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
I have to like grind into at least little handles or something.

654
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,640
If it was like or I got like a parachute.

655
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
Yeah.

656
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,640
In case it opened up then I can just parachute safely down.

657
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,640
Like something.

658
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,640
I don't think I have a proclivity one way or the other.

659
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,640
I can ride them all but I just haven't ridden a roller coaster a long time.

660
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Actually no.

661
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Remember earlier I said I was going to tell you.

662
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Oh yes.

663
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
What's this?

664
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,640
At Coney Island this summer I was there with Jace and I'm sorry Nick Cirelli in New York.

665
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Oh yes.

666
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
We did it.

667
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Nick and I did a 10K down there on the boardwalk and then ran a little 10K race and then we're

668
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
there for the afternoon.

669
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
You're good.

670
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,640
And it's so funny those coasters down there they had a brand new one called the Phoenix

671
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,640
and it's one of these ones where you're sitting but your legs are dangling.

672
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Yeah.

673
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,640
And the thing comes down around your chest and you can hold on to the two grips in front

674
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
of you but it's so short.

675
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
It was like you go up.

676
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,640
I was like I think there's a loop in this one and it's really just like looks like a loop

677
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
but you're just kind of going sideways.

678
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
This whole ride was probably 25 seconds.

679
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Yeah.

680
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,640
But the thing that I love the best was we got on and I was wearing Crocs and I didn't

681
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,640
have the back strap done and I was wearing sunglasses and the guy came up who would check

682
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,640
our seats and he's like hey take your sunglasses off.

683
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
I said okay.

684
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,640
And he's like and just switch your Crocs into sport mode.

685
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
I was like what's that?

686
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,640
He's like put the loop around the ankle or the heel.

687
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,640
I was like oh sport mode right if you want to get into some sporting stuff.

688
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
That's a phrase.

689
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
That's correct.

690
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,640
And then this other guy the other guy came around he's like it's not that rough.

691
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
You'll be fine.

692
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Sport mode not needed.

693
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Is that a popularized?

694
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Yeah really.

695
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
What is the sport mode on Crocs?

696
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,640
Sport mode is the heel strap is locked in.

697
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,640
When you actually put the strap around your ankle rather than wear them like a pair of

698
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,640
clogs is this weird official Crocs website.

699
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Yeah I haven't thought of Crocs as being plastic clogs but that's what they are.

700
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
That's all they are.

701
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,640
It is funny because like you could I could see where a lot of things like it's easy to

702
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,640
things have flying off of you on some of these coasters.

703
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Yeah.

704
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Like Jason I did hang time and I think I said this already once hang time is it not.

705
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
It's someone that goes straight vertical.

706
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Well first which scares the shit out of me and I'm like clinging to the thing in front

707
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
of me.

708
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Well when we're doing it I stupidly had my phone on me.

709
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
They tell you to leave your phone.

710
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,640
But I remember going oh how does this not happen all the time.

711
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Oh my God there must be underneath that roller coaster that spot there just must be like

712
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,640
every night money and phones while I'm going vertical I move my phone to like my butt

713
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
pocket.

714
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Yeah.

715
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,640
And I'm sitting on it at an angle so I'm already terrified of the 90 degree or whatever it

716
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
is.

717
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Yeah.

718
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
And then you're uncomfortable.

719
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
I know that feeling you're like I put it in my pocket and like try to get my pants as

720
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
tight as possible there so it like sticks the.

721
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Yeah and I was at least wearing jeans at the time.

722
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Now I'm wearing these what are they called joggers and things fly out of them all the

723
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
time.

724
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Sure.

725
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
So I get why he would say like those Crocs are going to fly off.

726
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
Put them in sport mode.

727
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
I understand it.

728
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,640
I do appreciate when you're on a ride and the seat back in front of you has like a netting

729
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
that you can like lock in.

730
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Yeah.

731
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Yes.

732
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
Velcro netting.

733
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Yeah.

734
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
It feels like it shouldn't work like something will shake it loose.

735
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Yeah.

736
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
None of us were strong.

737
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:19,640
I when I was back in Jersey I went on that gill for surriller coaster that I talked about

738
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
on the hometown parks episode.

739
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,640
And I gave my mom like my glass and hat to hold and she's like oh you don't want to take

740
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
your phone.

741
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,640
I was like no I want to take a picture in the law and I was fine.

742
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,640
I pants are really tight and you did.

743
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
My pants are tight.

744
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
I was tight.

745
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Yeah.

746
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,640
And then I get out to the line and there's be there.

747
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,640
There's like bins on this cart with wheels on it and they're like empty your pockets

748
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,640
and I see you have to empty your pockets in this bin and then someone is wanting you like

749
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
metal detector one there.

750
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,640
I was like there was like eight people loading this ride.

751
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,640
I was like this is the most efficient thing and I was like I just have a phone and he's

752
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
like oh just put it in there.

753
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,640
We wheel that on like next to the car.

754
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Yeah.

755
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,640
But he's like no we wheel it and then it's next to the car.

756
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,640
No they wheel it like you go past like a turnstile and he's like yeah we wheel it around to that

757
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
and no one gets to those besides the people in the car.

758
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
So I was like OK.

759
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,640
That is surprisingly like you guys have your shit together more than some bigger parks.

760
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Is it just so like they're wanting you for you know a set of keys so they don't fly out

761
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
and well so they don't fly out.

762
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Yeah for sure.

763
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
And they don't hit someone or they don't get lost.

764
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:45,640
But then it was like a lot of like back and forth and vertical cord screws and yeah I

765
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
probably would have lost everything.

766
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,640
I would have been broken man.

767
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,640
He keeps his life savings on him at all times.

768
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Yeah.

769
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,640
When they luge you off they're like did you lose it.

770
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
And I'm like yeah.

771
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,640
They're like all right the barrels with straps on them are right there.

772
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Put it on brother.

773
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,640
There should be an arm rest like storage on coasters.

774
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Yeah that's a good idea.

775
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
Like in a car.

776
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
That would be good.

777
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Just put them in there and close it.

778
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
You ever been on a jet ski before?

779
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,640
No.

780
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Too scared.

781
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,640
They have little two or three times I've been on they have a little pot you know compartments

782
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,640
you put your phones and stuff in and then it's supposedly waterproof.

783
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,640
But I'm like I don't know who owns this jet ski.

784
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Is this waterproof?

785
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
I don't want water on any of my stuff.

786
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Did you try it?

787
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,640
I did because I'm not going to leave it at the jet ski place.

788
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,640
So you rented a jet ski and then it's just it's like it's exactly like in a car.

789
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Yeah it's like between your legs.

790
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Right in front of you.

791
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Yeah.

792
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Okay.

793
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
And I'd recommend especially if you're in the right area.

794
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,640
I was down in where was I Sarasota Florida.

795
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
My parents had a vacation place there.

796
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
I went down to visit them.

797
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Oh cool.

798
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,640
And boy we the three of us were on two jet skis and at first dad was like okay just one

799
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
jet ski.

800
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Like we're getting two jet skis and the three of us are not going to be on a jet ski together.

801
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
That's an odd mom dad son.

802
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
And I'm not sharing with anyone.

803
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I am getting the lone jet ski.

804
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,640
It's like a jet ski built for three like three different handles.

805
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,640
The family that is excited about that possibility.

806
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Yeah.

807
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Real time together.

808
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
All of us in tandem.

809
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,640
Well that kind of goes back to when you asked me if I had a picture of me on the swing.

810
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Oh yeah.

811
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
On the skyrocket.

812
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
I forgot it was that long ago.

813
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
Like of course you know I didn't know.

814
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
I forgot it was less fine.

815
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Yeah.

816
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Well when you asked me I was like no no I don't I don't get pictures on roller coasters that

817
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
was like Hanford.

818
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,640
Like no way we're spending extra money to get a picture of us on the thing we were just

819
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
on.

820
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Sure.

821
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
So just the same thing with the jet ski.

822
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,640
It's like oh yeah all three of us in one.

823
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,640
No we can splurge now that we're full of dolls.

824
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
Yeah.

825
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
I'd say so.

826
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Do you do coaster add?

827
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,640
That seems like also that seems like a thing your parents would teach too.

828
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Once or twice.

829
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Like I have one a real old one on a Scooby Doo roller coaster and then I have one on the

830
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Incredible Hulk with my dad.

831
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Oh well that's.

832
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
From like 2003 and that's nice.

833
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
Oh okay okay.

834
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,640
And that was the most surplus plastic frame so like as soon as I like tried to take to

835
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,640
my college dorm room like a chip a chip came out of the corner of it.

836
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,640
As soon as I put it in a box it was like oh the cardboard made the plastic chip.

837
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Were you just you were displaying that in your college dorm?

838
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Well yeah it's a mixture yeah picture family and stuff.

839
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
It was also cool it had the Hulk.

840
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Cool logos.

841
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,640
I'm not saying the family thing is weird I'm saying like you have a big like Hulk.

842
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Like you know like Hulk display from the Universal.

843
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
I mean it was just up on the bookshelf you know.

844
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Out of the way no one's getting hurt here.

845
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Was it the East Tower?

846
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Yes it was sure.

847
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
You know you were there.

848
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Oh right oh yeah I forgot.

849
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,640
We were there for a couple years.

850
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,640
We called that room yes okay so you were the one with the Hulk picture because we were

851
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,640
like god that whoever's in that Hulk's room is pulling on some chicks man.

852
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Oh unbelievable.

853
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Do you think the chip in the plastic is gonna hurt his chick chances?

854
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
Nah the chip's gonna be fine.

855
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
The chicks don't care about the chip.

856
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,640
No he put that massive dictionary his mother gave him like with his graduation gave him

857
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,640
that massive paper dictionary that you would never need again.

858
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,640
You were sent to college with a big dictionary?

859
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Yes yeah a new alarm clock and a big dictionary and it held up the alarm clock.

860
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I had a picture in my room so when I moved into I think junior year in the Emerson suites.

861
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Yeah the air-conditioned one.

862
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Yeah.

863
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
With your own bathrooms.

864
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
Did you guys overlap in dorm rooms?

865
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
No.

866
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Not rooms you'd remember if you were roommates but yeah buildings rather.

867
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
My grandmother.

868
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Do we say Ithaca is Ithaca right?

869
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Yeah.

870
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,640
My grandmother was with us with me to like as I moved in I don't know why she couldn't

871
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,640
help but she was there and there was a we took a picture in the dorm room just her and

872
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,640
I and then that picture got developed put in a frame and given to me at like Christmas

873
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
so then I had that in the dorm room.

874
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,640
Like Thanksgiving yeah it was like so here's a picture of me and grandma right we were

875
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
right here.

876
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Yeah we would talk about that.

877
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
And I still have that picture it's a lovely picture.

878
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Yeah it's beautiful.

879
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
I love the grandma.

880
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,640
We would talk about that to her we'd be like have you guys been to the puzzle dorm room?

881
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,640
Have you been to the MC Escher dorm room where there's a picture of the dorm room?

882
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,640
That guy sucks.

883
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Picture within the picture.

884
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Who's he trying to impress?

885
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
He's smarty pants pictures.

886
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
He's impressing nobody standing by the door.

887
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,640
Hey anyone want to see the crazy ride?

888
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
Come see the crazy picture.

889
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Picture taken right in this spot.

890
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Alright what else can we say about these things?

891
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
Oh well here's the thing.

892
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,640
Okay so the biggest one of these see if you recall any of this from a year ago because

893
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,640
there were a couple of colorful characters who appeared.

894
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Yeah there were a couple of weird I didn't quite remember them myself but.

895
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,640
So the biggest one of these that exists is at Fun Spot which is in Kissimmee.

896
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Sort of near all the parks down there Disney World.

897
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
It's 300 feet tall.

898
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,640
So that's the craziest one of these sky coasters you can do.

899
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,640
And when it opened somebody one of the ultimate daredevils that ever was.

900
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Was at the opening inaugurating it.

901
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
And there's a picture Jordan if we have it.

902
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,640
This is 82 year old water skier Banana George Blair.

903
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
There he is.

904
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
Remember this at all.

905
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
There's Banana George.

906
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,640
He's an old man who in this photo is water skiing barefoot.

907
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,640
And holding it with his mouth.

908
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
And he's holding two bananas.

909
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
He's in an all yellow jumpsuit.

910
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,640
And he's holding bananas in both hands.

911
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Wow.

912
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
I'm just reading this stuff on it.

913
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
It's starting a new movie.

914
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,640
Yeah with Ernest Borgnine and Artie Johnson from Laughing.

915
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
Yeah.

916
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,640
He also yes this is a headshot that he signed in 95.

917
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,640
So he's in his 70s maybe here.

918
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
He water skied a lot at Cypress Gardens.

919
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,640
And at the time yes he seems to have been promoting a new film.

920
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Captiva Island with Ernest Borgnine and Artie Johnson.

921
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,640
What is that number there 84 over 12?

922
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Is that a fraction?

923
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
What is that?

924
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
He puts the date.

925
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,640
He just signs it Banana.

926
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Like his name is Banana.

927
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
No he's got Fred up there.

928
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,640
And then the date and then 80.

929
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,640
Oh maybe that's his age.

930
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
Yeah 80.

931
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
But he's 80 and 412.

932
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
That's got to be it right?

933
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Reduce this down to 1, 2.

934
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Well he doesn't know math.

935
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
He doesn't know fractions of fractions.

936
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
He knows water skiing.

937
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,640
He does it because he's in the fourth month of the 12 is for the.

938
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
Yeah I get that.

939
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
I get why that's easier.

940
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,640
I sort of do it with my toddler but it's weird to do it with an old man.

941
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
But it's kind of neat.

942
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,640
It created a little mystery we had to solve.

943
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,640
This guy is pretty interesting in general.

944
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,640
Even regardless of the Ernest Borgnine film.

945
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Which seemed too dreadful even to look at.

946
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Even on this podcast.

947
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Oh I'm so done.

948
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
I said Fred.

949
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Fred is the person he's making it out to.

950
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Oh right right.

951
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Got you.

952
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
I thought it was Fred Banana.

953
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Oh I kind of missed the Fred too.

954
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
He was in the darkness of the trees.

955
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Well he did that I think because it's like I want all the glory here.

956
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Put banana on the white Fred up in the dark part where he can't read it.

957
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
This isn't about you.

958
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
It's about me.

959
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Banana.

960
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
And my 80 and 40 year old's birthday.

961
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Look at him.

962
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
He's holding on to that.

963
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Isn't that wild.

964
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Regardless of the age of the man.

965
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I don't think I realize people did this water ski with their mouth.

966
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Yeah.

967
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Only gripping the.

968
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
We've talked about various things we're afraid of.

969
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,640
And then we're watching an old man all hanging on by his teeth.

970
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Yeah wow.

971
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
That's impressive.

972
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
His chompers.

973
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Yeah I've seen an old man pull a car with his teeth but waters?

974
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,640
I've only seen an old man eat with his teeth.

975
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Some of them can't even do that.

976
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
But I still got his auger.

977
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Hey good eating.

978
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
I just want to remember this.

979
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Put it next to my grandma in the dorm.

980
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,640
All the fresh water and salt water for this guy.

981
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,640
He looks much better than Evil Knievel did in later years.

982
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Did Evil Knievel live harder perhaps?

983
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
I think he did.

984
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I don't know everything.

985
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,640
I don't know much about him but that would be my guess from his vibe.

986
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,640
I don't think Banana here was falling from a great height very regularly.

987
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah I guess not.

988
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,640
So but he encountered a tough life for Banana.

989
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,640
The reason that he took up water sports and daredevil kind of stuff.

990
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Because he had back injury for many years.

991
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Oh now you take it back.

992
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Because in the Great Depression a gang of violent hobos threw him from a moving boxcar after an argument over some beans.

993
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
No.

994
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Shut up.

995
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
This is in a copy and pasted this.

996
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
When did that happen?

997
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
During the Great Depression.

998
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,640
When he was alive and I don't know what age.

999
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,640
That's just I mean I guess I accept that there were a lot of hobos in the Great Depression.

1000
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,640
But that the fight we know that the fight wasn't over just anything.

1001
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
That it was over beans.

1002
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,640
So the ape Simpson and the guy who actually created it, itch and scratchy through this water skiing man.

1003
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
This pre water skiing man.

1004
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
These flintzes are lousy.

1005
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Hey Banana.

1006
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Wow.

1007
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
This is a.

1008
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Yeah yeah yeah and he overcame that and still and got to inaugurate the sky coaster.

1009
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
And that's how he had his back injury?

1010
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Yeah yeah so up through his 40s he was very inactive.

1011
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,640
So he got beaten by the bindles?

1012
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,640
You could guess that I would assume.

1013
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Yeah yeah.

1014
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:43,640
I mean unless the hobos are stronger with kicking than the bindles are going to be.

1015
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,640
But I don't know you can get a lot of force with those.

1016
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,640
I'm guessing loose boards loose planks were used.

1017
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Oh maybe.

1018
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
That's what I just pictured.

1019
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
There's probably a lot of those around during the depression.

1020
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,640
For boarding up businesses that are closing.

1021
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Jason how are you picturing this hobo assault?

1022
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,640
I just some low blows some dirty shots you know.

1023
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Constant low blows.

1024
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Low blows.

1025
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,640
So like kicks from behind.

1026
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
Kick to the knee you know.

1027
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,640
And probably like a big kick to the butt to send him out of the box.

1028
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
No foreign objects.

1029
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
No honor you know.

1030
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,640
No foreign.

1031
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,640
Well no maybe some foreign objects you know.

1032
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,640
I just wanted to see how you saw it since you were since you lived it.

1033
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Since I was going to the boxcar show.

1034
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
Nice first one up.

1035
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Can I amend mine?

1036
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Now I'm picturing a big katana blade.

1037
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Sort of he pulls it out of the sheet.

1038
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
It glints in the moonlight.

1039
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,640
And one swoop loses his head.

1040
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,640
That's exciting.

1041
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,640
Yeah that's what I'm picturing now.

1042
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,640
Oh and then an oozy.

1043
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,640
One other question about it maybe is that it was an argument over some beans and you think like hey those are my beans.

1044
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,640
But what if it was an argument over which beans are best?

1045
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
Oh okay.

1046
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Beans weren't there.

1047
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Pinto kidney.

1048
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Pinto kidney.

1049
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
I like peas.

1050
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
Get em.

1051
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Is pea a bean?

1052
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
Peas gotta be a bean right?

1053
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
What's that?

1054
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Pea is a bean.

1055
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
Maybe technically at the end of the I mean.

1056
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
Is it a pod?

1057
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Maybe not.

1058
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
I don't think it is.

1059
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
No I don't think it is.

1060
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
That's why I got it.

1061
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
We'll look into it.

1062
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
They're green.

1063
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
They're green that's for sure.

1064
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
This we know.

1065
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
No fighting needed about that.

1066
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,640
We do have a there is a clip here.

1067
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
If you want to throw your headphones back on.

1068
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,640
This is a clip of Banana George Blair appearing on Regis and Kathy Lee.

1069
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Oh wow.

1070
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
It's a little quiet I know.

1071
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
It's mainly about what we're seeing.

1072
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:53,640
What is he water skis onto the show.

1073
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,640
Oh my goodness.

1074
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,640
He's in a full yellow suit and then cowboy hat.

1075
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,640
And then listen really closely for what he says to Kathy Lee.

1076
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
Okay.

1077
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
I knew you were gorgeous.

1078
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
I didn't know you were dynamite too.

1079
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
We could stop it there.

1080
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
I knew you were gorgeous.

1081
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,640
I didn't know you were dynamite too.

1082
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,640
And he takes you know what's good about that is he doesn't throw it away.

1083
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,640
He makes a real meal out of it.

1084
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
He pauses.

1085
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
That's what freaks me out.

1086
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,640
He really if you aren't looking at this he really locks eyes with her.

1087
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,640
Waits for the audience to die down.

1088
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Look into my eyes.

1089
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,640
I couldn't hear but the whole exchange was intense.

1090
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Yes.

1091
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,640
My headphones don't work.

1092
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,640
Menacing it was menacing.

1093
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,640
Yeah.

1094
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,640
Hey me and George got sort of a same color scheme going on here.

1095
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,640
Oh that's right.

1096
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
Yeah.

1097
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
Banana Mike Cantor today.

1098
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,640
I can water ski.

1099
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,640
I should try it.

1100
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
I should take off the mantle.

1101
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
Oh that's right.

1102
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,640
Yeah.

1103
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,640
I'm kind of doing an homage to Banana George Blair.

1104
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
And now he's shoeless because he came out of the water skis.

1105
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,640
Yeah.

1106
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
That's true that he does all this with bare feet.

1107
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,640
Yeah.

1108
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,640
Boy oh boy.

1109
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,640
He looks the hat looks like almost like it's well I guess I was going to say it almost looks like a Wisconsin like cheese hat or something.

1110
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,640
But yeah it's like a brighter yellow maybe verging on orange.

1111
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,640
Mm hmm.

1112
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,640
But yeah he's his whole gimmick is banana.

1113
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:28,640
Did you guys ever have in high school or something grade school or middle school like a teacher who had a thing like we had a teacher who liked like pigs.

1114
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,640
So she had a bunch of like pig ornaments around like a stuffed animal pig on her desk and like that was her thing.

1115
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,640
Did you guys ever come across anyone like that who just like their thing was.

1116
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,640
Oh.

1117
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
I mean there's like beanie baby people obviously.

1118
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,640
Yeah.

1119
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:49,640
Somebody who's like I remember being at a church once and the head of the church like liked frogs and there was a little area with like stuffed frogs and stuff.

1120
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,640
An altar.

1121
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,640
Secondary to Christ on the cross.

1122
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,640
What kind of church is this.

1123
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,640
I think I had a teacher I'm trying to think like panda bear like maybe my third grade teacher like those panda bears.

1124
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,640
Yeah.

1125
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,640
There was like an identity like somebody's really trying hard to have an identity.

1126
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,640
And it's like you can always get that person a gift if it's like oh yeah pig coaster.

1127
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,640
Here you go.

1128
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,640
Happy birthday.

1129
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,640
Yeah.

1130
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,640
Yeah.

1131
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,640
I mean there was a teacher in high school who got him.

1132
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,640
I didn't get him this somebody else got him a pen that the ladies clothes would fall off.

1133
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
So his thing was he was like a creep.

1134
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,640
There were a couple of those guys in high school.

1135
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
I like pornographic pens.

1136
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,640
They were escorted out some days and I never saw them again.

1137
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,640
You know what I started to get off here on a tangent.

1138
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,640
The one to do it.

1139
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,640
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

1140
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,640
There was a teacher who was like after you all graduate we all go out to Hooters together.

1141
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,640
Whoa.

1142
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,640
And then like we were like well ha ha ha ha yes.

1143
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,640
And then nobody went because we were like this is so weird.

1144
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,640
But he went and then one of our friends went and he still denies he went.

1145
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,640
We go like you went with him and he's like no I didn't.

1146
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
We were like you did go.

1147
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,640
We know you went.

1148
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:11,640
And then that teacher I've heard may have been arrested for stealing a credit card and calling like a porno line from school.

1149
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,640
I think I don't know if this is real.

1150
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,640
I've not confirmed this story or not.

1151
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,640
But it makes sense because he was also saying inappropriate things about our female friend at the time.

1152
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
He was made sort of makes sense.

1153
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,640
I guess if you think about it it all adds up.

1154
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,640
He would be like guys you've got a beautiful woman.

1155
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,640
Why don't you put her in your movie here?

1156
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,640
And he said it like loudly in front of the class.

1157
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,640
It was like he was teaching like film in high school.

1158
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,640
Oh no let me teach you how to light a beautiful lady.

1159
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,640
Yeah.

1160
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,640
And there was one time when it was like you have to cast a movie or something and I think I cast Jessica Alba and he goes I want to congratulate you sir.

1161
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,640
He like shakes my head and he goes for putting Dark Angel the Dark Angel in your script.

1162
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640
Whoa.

1163
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,640
I got wait I think I have ten more stories now that I think about this guy.

1164
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,640
Wow.

1165
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,640
Oh keep him coming.

1166
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,640
That's insane.

1167
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,640
He would say well I think the issue with kids and the sex is that we need more dances.

1168
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
You need more high school dances because that gets the energy like.

1169
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,640
Whoa.

1170
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,640
And I was like I don't think that's actually.

1171
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,640
First of all sir you don't need to have an opinion about high school sex at all.

1172
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,640
Don't put those words anywhere near each other.

1173
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,640
The question is when is the half day over tomorrow.

1174
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
Okay one more one more.

1175
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,640
Yeah.

1176
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,640
It's the senior brunch.

1177
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:39,640
We're just about to graduate and he comes over to sit at the table and he's talking about the same female friend and he goes all right guys I'm just going to say it.

1178
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,640
And now this person's name is hot.

1179
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,640
What.

1180
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
And we were like oh.

1181
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,640
And she was there.

1182
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,640
She I think she had gotten up.

1183
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Okay.

1184
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,640
I go I go.

1185
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
Yeah I go this is her boyfriend right here.

1186
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,640
Whoa.

1187
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,640
And he goes well I'd like to shake your hand sir.

1188
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,640
Why shaking hands.

1189
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,640
He gets a lot of congratulations in his handshake.

1190
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
I am uncomfortable with the handshaking.

1191
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
Yeah.

1192
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,640
It's physical content as much as he's able to do with the high schoolers who he clearly wants to do more with.

1193
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,640
There were so many people that should not have been teaching.

1194
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:16,640
Did he seem like a person who was just like so off the wall like had no idea like not to excuse any of this behavior but just like oh I have no idea how to talk to anybody.

1195
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,640
This is how I speak.

1196
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,640
I know all these.

1197
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,640
Or was he like oh I'm going to be a or I'm a creepy guy.

1198
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,640
He didn't know he was being creepy.

1199
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,640
He thought he was one of the boys.

1200
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,640
He thought he was being cool.

1201
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
He thought he was being cool.

1202
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,640
Which is by the way the person I'm talking about is also so inappropriate.

1203
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,640
I'm talking about this show too the female.

1204
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
What?

1205
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Oh Jesus.

1206
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Does she know all of this?

1207
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,640
I'm pretty sure she does.

1208
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,640
I think we've told this many times.

1209
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,640
Does she know she knows she is who this is even though her name was not said.

1210
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,640
I'm sure she does.

1211
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,640
Apologies.

1212
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
It would be hard.

1213
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,640
You got up from the table at just the right time.

1214
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,640
Good job.

1215
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,640
The best glass of punch you ever got.

1216
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,640
Yeah yeah.

1217
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:54,640
I mean she that she would have been well within her rights to just look him dead in the eye and just say gun.

1218
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,640
What?

1219
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,640
Gun.

1220
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,640
Like no one would convict you for the court of law for making a threat to this man.

1221
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
Oh sure sure.

1222
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,640
That's such a terrifying move you just listed.

1223
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,640
I know you just scared the shit out of me.

1224
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,640
That's what you thought we were going to do when you pulled up this morning.

1225
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,640
Yeah I was.

1226
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,640
Gun.

1227
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,640
I have like.

1228
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,640
I think I hold on.

1229
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,640
I think I do really need to make the point.

1230
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,640
I do not condone this.

1231
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,640
When I was like is he this or this?

1232
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,640
I'm not making any excuse.

1233
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,640
Well it all depends.

1234
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,640
You're right.

1235
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,640
I felt like I need to make that.

1236
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,640
It can't be too careful.

1237
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:32,640
It's interesting to see where these people are coming from because I literally can I think 70 percent of the teachers I haven't had in high school grossly irresponsible.

1238
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,640
Right.

1239
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,640
Saying crazy stuff and most of them I would just say were completely out of it.

1240
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,640
Like had just been doing the job too long and maybe never should have been doing it.

1241
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,640
But yeah everyone's got their own like where they're coming from spot.

1242
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,640
Like this guy seems like any job he would have he would be behaving that way.

1243
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,640
Yes.

1244
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,640
You know what I mean.

1245
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,640
Yes.

1246
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,640
And also these teachers are performers and they're fun expressing themselves.

1247
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,640
Right.

1248
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,640
To and a lot of the believe it or not a lot of people's ideas are bad.

1249
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,640
Yeah.

1250
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,640
You'd be right.

1251
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,640
A lot of people.

1252
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,640
Yeah.

1253
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,640
We had a teacher who we knew we could manipulate into just putting on a movie and dropping everything you know for the thinnest of reason.

1254
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:21,640
And my friends and I in high school were getting into like let's find kind of the weirdest videos we can find at the at the VHS rental place.

1255
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:29,640
And thus we in school got the teacher to put on a movie called The Sex Machine.

1256
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,640
This is and it's crazier even than just like a guy.

1257
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,640
And yeah I'm the sex machine.

1258
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,640
It is about a literal sex machine.

1259
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
This is a movie.

1260
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:43,640
This is a an Italian sex comedy from the 70s that we found dubbed.

1261
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,640
And it's a movie about an apocalyptic future where we're running out of fuel.

1262
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:55,640
But a brilliant doctor figures out how to harness the electricity the friction of sex.

1263
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Oh wow.

1264
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,640
And use so that all of our sex fuels like all the world's electricity.

1265
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,640
And I remember the teacher that we put it on.

1266
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,640
Did it work?

1267
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,640
It worked but it went too far.

1268
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,640
He grim by the end he's grimacing at the world he created where people.

1269
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,640
I think where it ends up it's actually kind of smart.

1270
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,640
It ends up at like no one.

1271
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,640
People only have sex in a functional way.

1272
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,640
No one does it for fun.

1273
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,640
Good good good.

1274
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
This is what Mike wants.

1275
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,640
Good yeah.

1276
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,640
Well see your dream world in The Sex Machine.

1277
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,640
I remember that the teachers the first time that there was there were naked breasts.

1278
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,640
Again this is my doing.

1279
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,640
I apologize.

1280
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,640
I got naked breasts to be shown in this high school classroom in this movie.

1281
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,640
And the teacher said is this pornography being shown in my classroom.

1282
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,640
And then proceeded to keep the movie going.

1283
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,640
I just I just am curious.

1284
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
I don't want to go.

1285
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,640
Which I was look I love I recommend you can find The Sex Machine.

1286
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,640
This is genuinely a brilliant film actually.

1287
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,640
I love it.

1288
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,640
You kids are getting a kick out it.

1289
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,640
So am I.

1290
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,640
I'm just making sure this is pornography.

1291
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,640
And if so great.

1292
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:13,640
This is all mine looks very wholesome now because I had a seventh grade geography teacher who went to the University of Tennessee and clearly really loved it.

1293
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Because he had so much orange Tennessee Vols the Tennessee Volunteers is their their football team.

1294
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,640
He just had so much on the walls.

1295
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:35,640
He had sweater vests he had sweaters he had windbreakers he had and then his son it was like a year behind me started wearing Tennessee Vols stuff.

1296
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,640
And looking back I'm like where did you get all this stuff.

1297
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,640
You couldn't order it online.

1298
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,640
Like I know there's college supply.

1299
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:53,640
There are college sports stores but I was like it's just impressive because then he pull out a new coffee mug or a new hat and I'd be like how much is there.

1300
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,640
Wow.

1301
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:05,640
Well you it's an interesting point about the Internet like not being able to order online because it's like yeah somebody who likes the pigs or the Vols or the frogs like when you see something you're like I got to get this thing is I might not come across it every time.

1302
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,640
Traveling or something you got to grab it.

1303
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,640
Well we were all taught by a bunch of weirdos.

1304
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,640
Straight up lunatics.

1305
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,640
Clearly.

1306
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,640
I could do an hour on it on all those stories.

1307
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
This guy yeah.

1308
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,640
No hold on to him let's keep talking about him.

1309
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,640
We need a code for this professor Hooter.

1310
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,640
Oh yeah.

1311
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,640
He's also not the funniest one of all.

1312
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,640
He's maybe like three or four on the list.

1313
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,640
The Hooters thing is so funny too.

1314
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,640
The funny thing too is like no we're not going to Hooters with you and also we don't want to hang out with the teachers at all.

1315
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,640
No.

1316
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
Yes.

1317
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,640
At least of all at a Hooters but even at a Denny's.

1318
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,640
Although a student teacher came over to watch wrestling with us once.

1319
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,640
Oh but that's not there's nothing.

1320
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,640
He was 22.

1321
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,640
Okay.

1322
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,640
Look how close.

1323
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,640
17 18 we were.

1324
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,640
Okay.

1325
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,640
In the interest of having actual things about.

1326
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:08,640
Well you mentioned the fun spot Orlando one and I believe that one was originally at the MGM Grand adventures in Las Vegas.

1327
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,640
Oh yes.

1328
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,640
And it moved when that shut down in the early 2000s.

1329
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,640
Uh huh.

1330
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,640
Uh huh.

1331
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:21,640
Yeah that was at the the MGM Grand theme park that used to be in Las Vegas and I think it's it outlasted the theme park.

1332
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Yeah.

1333
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,640
They kept it up even when the theme park closed.

1334
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,640
I have a commercial for but the sound was pretty bad to begin with so I'll just describe what happens in the commercial.

1335
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,640
There is a guy it's like heavy heartbeat.

1336
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,640
The guy is rising up and like beginning his sky coaster journey.

1337
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,640
I forget what they called it there.

1338
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,640
But the doesn't matter any of the name.

1339
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,640
So he's like getting ready to go on this thing.

1340
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,640
Could be.

1341
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,640
Okay.

1342
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,640
Yeah maybe.

1343
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:04,640
So anyways the guy looks nervous and the voiceover is saying you've got a house you've got kids you've got a minivan.

1344
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:09,640
But right now the only thing you want is your mommy.

1345
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:19,640
And then he drops and then you watch this guy fly much higher than the MGM Grand which is a very tall hotel.

1346
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:25,640
And if this thing is at most 300 feet there is no way that it is higher than the MGM Grand.

1347
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,640
But that that mommy thing that's that's fantastic.

1348
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,640
That's great like extreme.

1349
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,640
That's a great like 90s.

1350
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,640
Yeah.

1351
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
You like your mommy.

1352
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,640
Yeah.

1353
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
Yeah.

1354
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,640
That could be an ad for that or like wild cherry Pepsi.

1355
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Yeah.

1356
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,640
That attitude too is very 90s commercial like that kind of cadence.

1357
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,640
Yeah.

1358
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,640
Right.

1359
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,640
Like so like nasal to like the way maybe the devil might be.

1360
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,640
Or a bug maybe.

1361
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Yeah.

1362
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,640
Well yes he's the king of that sort of voice.

1363
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,640
Yes.

1364
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,640
You know.

1365
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:10,640
I watched a video just someone's home movies on YouTube and they were they were riding it in Wildwood.

1366
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:20,640
I think there was one or two on the boardwalk or on a pier in Wildwood New Jersey and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are playing the entire time.

1367
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
Perfect.

1368
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:27,640
I feel like that's that's what's got to be playing when you get which song one of these.

1369
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:33,640
I think it was like.

1370
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,640
All right.

1371
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,640
Got it.

1372
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,640
I know which one.

1373
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,640
I don't want to say it's about California but the course is about California but it's not Californication.

1374
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,640
Is it Danny?

1375
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,640
Danny California.

1376
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,640
Yeah.

1377
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,640
I couldn't remember the name.

1378
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:58,640
So that's playing and then the people holding it are are kind of narrating and it's just very nice to hear someone from the tri-state area going like oh I want to get on that for a million dollars.

1379
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,640
I'm not getting on that John.

1380
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:08,640
Listeners if you don't know your regional lingo John in around Philadelphia New Jersey.

1381
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:15,640
John means any item anything can John just one thing thing like that John.

1382
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,640
Can you hand me that John over there that feed the Fiji John.

1383
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,640
What is it.

1384
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,640
What are they.

1385
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,640
John's.

1386
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,640
The situation you just put me in.

1387
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,640
I could you really needed to add more.

1388
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
Oh this system doesn't work at all.

1389
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,640
Fiji John.

1390
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,640
There's a bunch of items over where you're planning.

1391
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
How do you live like this.

1392
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,640
John.

1393
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,640
Yeah.

1394
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,640
But when you only said John I didn't know what to do.

1395
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,640
Is this something that you say but you got rid of it when you came out to LA.

1396
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,640
I never say John.

1397
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:50,640
I don't think I learned it until like like teen pre teen or teen years and then I started clocking that I've never heard of thing John.

1398
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,640
Have you ever heard.

1399
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,640
No.

1400
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,640
And I'm wondering what it's like J.O.N.

1401
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,640
J.A.W.N.

1402
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,640
John.

1403
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,640
Is that I'm wondering what that is coming for like a shorter version of something.

1404
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,640
I I don't know the origins.

1405
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:15,640
I should look it up but I mean it's it's to the point where like if you're at the field day off the airport you can buy Eagles or flyers shirts that say like John.

1406
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Eastern Pennsylvania used to refer to a thing place person or event that one need not or cannot give a specific name to.

1407
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,640
Huh.

1408
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,640
Yeah.

1409
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,640
Yeah.

1410
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,640
I mean I get it like oh pass me that thing over there and like you're pointing.

1411
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,640
Yeah.

1412
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,640
You just can't think of the word or something.

1413
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,640
Yeah.

1414
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,640
I guess it could just stand in for anything.

1415
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,640
But it only kind of works with that accent though like if I was like oh could you pass me that John.

1416
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,640
Yeah.

1417
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,640
That wouldn't.

1418
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,640
Yeah.

1419
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,640
Yeah.

1420
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,640
It doesn't sound fun.

1421
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,640
Like wrestlers will say like gimmick give me that gimmick right there.

1422
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,640
Give me that gimmick.

1423
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,640
An item is a gimmick.

1424
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,640
Yeah.

1425
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Like Steve.

1426
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,640
I don't know what we're doing in this podcast.

1427
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,640
Uncle Steve Austin gimmick right there.

1428
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,640
Huh.

1429
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,640
Uh huh.

1430
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,640
I don't what are we trying to get around by not naming the item.

1431
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,640
Seems pretty easy to just say what you want.

1432
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,640
There's so many versions of this like do dad or like.

1433
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,640
Right.

1434
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,640
Right.

1435
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,640
Right.

1436
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,640
Thingamajig.

1437
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,640
I guess I get what I just never heard that.

1438
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,640
Yeah.

1439
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,640
I never heard either.

1440
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,640
And I've known this guy for a long time.

1441
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,640
Yeah.

1442
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,640
He's never said it.

1443
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,640
He's never he's never enlightened me about it.

1444
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,640
I don't think.

1445
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,640
Yeah.

1446
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,640
We didn't really say it in my house.

1447
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,640
It wasn't until like middle school or high school where someone's like John you know

1448
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,640
what John.

1449
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,640
I want you to start using it.

1450
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,640
OK.

1451
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,640
All right.

1452
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,640
Oh yeah.

1453
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,640
Try to just slip one in in the rest of the episode.

1454
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,640
Just try to refer to something as a John in the context that.

1455
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,640
Oh sure.

1456
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,640
Pennsylvania would.

1457
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:38,280
But but watching that video and then watching you know they of course have it at Six Flags

1458
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:42,280
Great Adventure in North Jersey and your beloved Wisconsin Dells.

1459
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,640
It's there.

1460
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:48,360
And the thing that don't know me is like if something goes wrong the last thing you will

1461
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:55,000
see is Six Flags or the Wisconsin Dells or the Jersey Shore and take that as you will

1462
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,600
because I think some people would be like thrilled at that like well there's worse worse

1463
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,360
things to see when you're going out.

1464
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,360
Thrilled to die in the Wisconsin Dells.

1465
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,680
I mean there's worse ways to go I guess.

1466
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,200
So yeah I guess.

1467
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
No.

1468
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,720
Now you say that but this they are proud of the sky coaster people are proud there has

1469
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,560
never been an accident with one of these.

1470
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,520
They've really think that they seem a little precarious.

1471
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,680
Yeah.

1472
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,680
It's incredibly.

1473
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,680
We're better than bun.

1474
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,280
Yes we looked it up five deaths just since 2015 never with the sky coaster.

1475
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:30,800
That's that's some information that comes courtesy of the inventor of the sky coaster.

1476
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,560
Maybe you recall talking about this guy last time.

1477
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,560
We have a photo.

1478
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,560
Hey.

1479
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,560
It's nice to look at.

1480
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,680
I would never have expected the person who made a amusement park swing look like that.

1481
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,560
To be so professorial.

1482
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,200
Yeah.

1483
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,920
This guy's got sort of a funny look to it.

1484
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,920
He's very scholarly.

1485
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
It's like a Sears portrait studio.

1486
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,920
Yeah.

1487
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,920
Yeah.

1488
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,960
I mean I like him and I love this.

1489
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,960
Coat fits him well.

1490
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,960
Nice tie.

1491
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,960
Yes.

1492
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,000
Yeah they go together color scheme wise.

1493
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,560
You know you look at this esteemed person not only the inventor of what we're talking

1494
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,800
about sky coasters but also the inventor of.

1495
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,060
There he is.

1496
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,480
Let's look closer into his eyes.

1497
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,240
This is the inventor of indoor skydiving.

1498
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,240
Wow.

1499
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,240
Wow.

1500
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,760
The company started the company sky venture that eventually became I fly which is the

1501
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,760
thing we did at City Walk with Paul Scheer.

1502
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,200
You ever done that you ever indoor.

1503
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
No those look fun though.

1504
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
They're pretty fun.

1505
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
Yeah.

1506
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Yes.

1507
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Yeah.

1508
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,200
Is it hard to get.

1509
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,200
It's pretty hard to like.

1510
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,200
Yeah.

1511
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,880
I think we're maybe all proud that we got like two seconds of unassisted.

1512
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,880
We are actually.

1513
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Yeah.

1514
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:45,880
Yeah.

1515
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,880
You were Mike is a tall man was a little hard flailing.

1516
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,880
Yeah.

1517
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,880
Yeah.

1518
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,880
The guys are really good at it.

1519
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,880
They're like zooped that.

1520
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,880
Yeah.

1521
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,880
That's wild.

1522
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,880
Yeah.

1523
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,880
The people get to do it all day like the experts.

1524
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,880
Yeah.

1525
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,880
Of it.

1526
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,560
The experts are good and then I think we saw like a kid like a 12 or 13 year old kid go

1527
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:08,040
in and like old like an old hand just went in and started flipping around going up high

1528
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,880
and it's like oh my god how long has this kid been doing this.

1529
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Yeah.

1530
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,880
Yeah.

1531
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,880
You got to commit to it like you have to take classes.

1532
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,880
Yeah.

1533
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,880
Yeah.

1534
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,880
To get to actual enjoyment.

1535
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,880
Yeah.

1536
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:19,880
I think you.

1537
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,880
Yeah.

1538
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,680
You do have to like you could tell there were people there even when we did it at City Walk

1539
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,680
who were like.

1540
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,680
Pro.

1541
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,880
That was like yeah that was there like maybe more than once weekly.

1542
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Yeah.

1543
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,880
Yeah.

1544
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,880
Yeah.

1545
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,880
So where did the sky coat.

1546
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,480
How did this guy get into the industry.

1547
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,520
He didn't do anything close to ride design.

1548
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,120
It just he went skydiving and he liked it and he thought is there a way in his words is

1549
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,240
there a way to simulate skydiving without having to jump out of a perfectly good airplane.

1550
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,240
Perfect.

1551
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,240
Perfect.

1552
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,240
Yeah.

1553
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,240
He doesn't want to waste airplanes.

1554
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,240
I guess.

1555
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,240
The wear and tear.

1556
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,240
The sky looks so nice why clutter it up with airplanes.

1557
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,240
And people.

1558
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,880
A bunch of junk up there.

1559
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:01,680
So he drew on a dinner napkin an idea of like this very simple as we've referred to it's

1560
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,360
like it's one stick and another stick and he built a little model of it and here's his

1561
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,300
quote my girlfriend at the time looked at it and said you've gone crazy you don't know

1562
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:15,220
anything about amusement rides and even if you did nobody would do that.

1563
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,220
Oh no.

1564
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:20,060
Nobody would get on that John for a million dollars.

1565
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:24,820
So I got rid of the girlfriend and built the ride which became one of the fastest selling

1566
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:25,820
rides in the world.

1567
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,820
Yeah.

1568
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,820
If you're with someone who's not going to support you it will just shoot your idea down.

1569
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,820
That's true.

1570
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:32,820
Yeah.

1571
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,820
I like this guy.

1572
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:34,820
I don't want him.

1573
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,460
Maybe he had other like crazy ideas leading on other napkins at other dinners.

1574
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,260
He's like this is the hot dog you can ride to work.

1575
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,140
No one's going to do that.

1576
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,140
That's stupid.

1577
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,420
It's a modern bindle that will solve any arguments about beans.

1578
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:51,020
Why did the bindles disappear in the 30s?

1579
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,460
That just may have been her stock response.

1580
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:53,460
Like he's drawing.

1581
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,460
Yeah no one's going to do that.

1582
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,460
You're crazy.

1583
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,460
A pile of napkins.

1584
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:57,460
200 high.

1585
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,460
You know nothing about theme parks.

1586
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,460
All she'd do is write down ride ideas and you don't ask me how I'm doing.

1587
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,460
She's like a famous author.

1588
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,460
Yeah.

1589
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,660
And rice.

1590
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:18,660
So yeah this rogue renegade man went on to invent all this big stuff.

1591
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,660
He looks like he will not take no for an answer.

1592
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,660
Yeah I think so.

1593
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,660
He's no non-sense.

1594
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:29,660
And yet he did, maybe you guys remember this from before, he did find himself in a precarious

1595
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:30,660
situation.

1596
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,660
Not all is well in the world of Bill Kitchen.

1597
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:40,060
And apologies for not having the, if the sound is a struggle here, but do we have the clip

1598
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,060
which I think I called Kitchen Robbery?

1599
01:06:43,060 --> 01:07:04,960
It's a lot, even if you guys didn't hear that, a lot to look at here.

1600
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,960
Bill Kitchen in a, under the big news phrase, ninja robbers.

1601
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,860
The inventor of sky coasters was involved in a ninja robbery.

1602
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:14,860
Yeah.

1603
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:19,860
Is there any confirmation these were actual ninjas or were they just dressed in black

1604
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
and head to toe?

1605
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,860
That's a question.

1606
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:22,860
Right, right.

1607
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:23,860
Were they, were they?

1608
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,860
And can you call yourself a ninja?

1609
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,860
Do you have to complete a series, like how do you get designated a ninja?

1610
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,860
Are there modern ninjas?

1611
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:36,860
Yeah I feel like being seen and captured on camera, you're automatically out.

1612
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,860
Like you are not a ninja.

1613
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,760
We got you from a couple angles pal, like you're supposed to be invisible.

1614
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,760
Oh wait that's right, yeah we see his eyes in the security camera, that's instant not

1615
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,760
ninja right there.

1616
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,760
Wait is he wearing, the ninja wearing a hat?

1617
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,760
Yes.

1618
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,760
That could have been Kitchen's hat though, he could have been like, hey I'm taking this,

1619
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,760
boot, put your hat on.

1620
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
Give me everything in the house.

1621
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,760
Like that hat, hey give me that.

1622
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,760
My hands are full, put that fedora on my head.

1623
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,760
Yeah he's wearing like a fedora.

1624
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,760
The ninja, first of all it looks like the ninja's wearing like a black sweatshirt and

1625
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,760
like a ski mask.

1626
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,660
They look a little more maybe out of shape than I think a ninja would be.

1627
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,660
Then you think yes.

1628
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:15,660
Cause I picture ninjas doing like kind of acrobatic type moves around to get to the

1629
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,660
shadows.

1630
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:18,660
Yeah yeah, finding the shadows at all.

1631
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,660
I think Bill is more in the shadows than the ninjas are.

1632
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:25,660
Did Bill say they were ninjas or is this the news editorializing again?

1633
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:28,660
It might be them trying to like, do a little fun.

1634
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:33,660
Get clicks you know, make it more sensational cause ninja robbery jumps out.

1635
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,560
But aren't ninjas, I don't know, don't they fight for what's right?

1636
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,560
Well not the foot plan are they ninjas?

1637
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
Depends on what clan you're aligned with.

1638
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,560
I know a lot about ninjas.

1639
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,560
I'm wearing a shirt, I have a lot of toys.

1640
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,560
If these guys were dressed in like red, the headline would be like,

1641
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,560
this kitchen got robbed by Santa Claus' today.

1642
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,560
The exact opposite of what they usually do.

1643
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,460
Green mocap suit wearers.

1644
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,460
Was it Andy Serkis?

1645
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,460
They just fill in like the CGI character on the news.

1646
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,460
Jar Jar Binks robbed Bill Kitchen today.

1647
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,460
Is that even Bill Kitchen? Who knows?

1648
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,460
He looks like his arms are bound behind him though.

1649
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,460
The hat?

1650
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,460
No, that's not ninja behavior.

1651
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,460
Sort of like Tommy Bahamas style.

1652
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,460
It's an island casual hat on top of a ninja.

1653
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,360
Did they chop him at all or did they give him a kick?

1654
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,360
That would maybe suggest ninja.

1655
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,360
Was a high yaw involved?

1656
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,360
Yeah, I don't think.

1657
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,360
This is again, this is a news media run amok.

1658
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:43,360
This is something that is not good for the people to consume.

1659
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,360
This is getting clicks.

1660
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,360
And we fell for it, we love it.

1661
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,360
We do love it, yeah, that's true.

1662
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,360
They're propagating the myth of ninja robbery.

1663
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,360
Yeah, yeah.

1664
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,360
It's like Danny from the Ninja Turtles 1 movie.

1665
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,360
The kid from Ninja Turtles 1 who gets taken in and the foot clan.

1666
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:01,260
I don't even think it's their Danny level.

1667
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,260
I don't think.

1668
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,260
Sub Danny.

1669
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:07,260
Danny California.

1670
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,260
My ninja name is Danny California.

1671
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,260
Anyway, Bill Kitchen is still at it.

1672
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,260
He's trying to build a thing called the polar coaster.

1673
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,260
Do we have a photo of the polar coaster?

1674
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,260
Just imagine it coming out of the wind.

1675
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,260
Whoa.

1676
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,260
This is something he's trying to make happen.

1677
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,260
Actually, let me be clearer here.

1678
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,160
On the right is the polar coaster, on the left is the sky spire.

1679
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,160
They're similar, they're big towers.

1680
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,160
But one I think is a leisurely observation deck.

1681
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,160
You know, these exist.

1682
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,160
We've all done these where you go up in an elevator and look at the city from a pod kind of thing.

1683
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,160
But one, you get a cooler ride on the way up.

1684
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,160
So the one's very casual and the other one is a daring high octane coaster.

1685
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,160
That's sort of, if we know this guy uses cocktail napkins, the design is very cool.

1686
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,160
And the other one is a very cool.

1687
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,160
And the other one is a very cool.

1688
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,160
And the other one is a very cool.

1689
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,160
And the other one is a very cool.

1690
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,160
And the other one is a very cool.

1691
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,160
And the other one is a very cool.

1692
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,060
The design of the right feels very cocktail.

1693
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,060
It looks like he just scribbled wherever.

1694
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,060
And then they go this way and have a loop and like, oh my god.

1695
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,060
And then like, poof, and then they go back up again.

1696
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,060
And then they go this way and have a loop and like, oh my god.

1697
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,060
How does it get up?

1698
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,060
Do you go in the middle there? Is it like a vertical climb?

1699
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,060
Or maybe you get up, maybe it goes both ways.

1700
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,060
Or maybe you get up, maybe it goes both ways.

1701
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,060
You could get up from the ride.

1702
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,060
No. How?

1703
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:21,060
Do you get down from the ride? Do you take an elevator up?

1704
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:23,060
I bet it's an elevator.

1705
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,060
Maybe it's a circular...

1706
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,960
track that is connected.

1707
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,960
It's unclear. Because you'd have to really launch to get, to have the force to get up from the start.

1708
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,960
It's unclear. Because you'd have to really launch to get, to have the force to get up from the start.

1709
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,960
Like if you use the same track.

1710
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,960
Oh, and for to keep climbing and keep...

1711
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,960
Well maybe the coaster goes down, but look, there's kind of a double helix on the sky spire.

1712
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,960
Yeah.

1713
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,960
And so maybe one is up and one is down.

1714
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,960
The sky spire looks more obviously practical and just like a better ride.

1715
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,960
The sky spire looks more obviously practical and just like a better ride.

1716
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,960
There doesn't look like there's too much going on with the...

1717
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,960
There doesn't look like there's too much going on with the...

1718
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,960
I don't know, it's just kind of up and down.

1719
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,960
It's very confusing.

1720
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:55,860
I like it.

1721
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,860
I will invest.

1722
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,860
He'd be happy to hear that because I think he's been trying to get these going for a long time.

1723
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,860
He'd be happy to hear that because I think he's been trying to get these going for a long time.

1724
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,860
He's proposed these for a lot of big...

1725
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,860
What he's trying to do is like, you know, you have a mall in your town.

1726
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,860
You have a big JCPenney that closed.

1727
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,860
Let's build one of these on top of it.

1728
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,860
Because that's a big question is what do we do with all these vacant retail spaces?

1729
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,860
Because that's a big question is what do we do with all these vacant retail spaces?

1730
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,860
He's tried to do this in San Diego when it hasn't taken off.

1731
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,860
He's tried to do this in San Diego when it hasn't taken off.

1732
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,860
This looks like Vegas or Dubai to me.

1733
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,860
Yeah.

1734
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,760
I bet it is you load it at the top on the Polar Coaster.

1735
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,760
I bet it is you load it at the top on the Polar Coaster.

1736
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,760
And then the car just probably goes back up without people on it.

1737
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,760
That's got to be what it is.

1738
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,760
You would think the one you call Polar Coaster you would have the blue on the top.

1739
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,760
You would think the one you call Polar Coaster you would have the blue on the top.

1740
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,760
Not the purple.

1741
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,760
Yeah, it could be called the purple coaster.

1742
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,760
It's a very confusing pitch. I think that's why he's not getting any of his seed money.

1743
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,760
We have some notes, Bill.

1744
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,760
I feel so guilty criticizing him now that we're looking at him again.

1745
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,760
I feel so guilty criticizing him now that we're looking at him again.

1746
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,760
We'd like to have Bill on.

1747
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,760
Bill has to know about us.

1748
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,660
He's got a lot of popular theme park podcasts around.

1749
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,660
He's got to have his eye on us.

1750
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,660
Bill, if you want to explain yourself, make yourself known to us.

1751
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,660
Show yourself, as they might say.

1752
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,660
And show us that winning smile.

1753
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,660
And then we'll talk about ninjas and we'll talk about the Polar Coaster.

1754
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,660
And then we'll talk about ninjas and we'll talk about the Polar Coaster.

1755
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,660
I really like that striped yellow John he's wearing.

1756
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,660
I really like that striped yellow John he's wearing.

1757
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,660
There it is.

1758
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:13,660
Wow, a handsome John.

1759
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,660
Bill Kitchen.

1760
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,660
He did get a ride installed recently.

1761
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:19,660
He has another type of ride called the Polar Coaster.

1762
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,560
He has another type of ride called the Unicoaster.

1763
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,560
And like all of his rides, they're confusingly named.

1764
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,560
When I say Unicoaster, you probably can't picture what that might be.

1765
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,560
When I say Unicoaster, you probably can't picture what that might be.

1766
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,560
Unicycle car of some kind?

1767
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,560
No, that would make sense.

1768
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,560
There's already single rail coasters.

1769
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,560
I don't think there's any one aspect to it.

1770
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,560
Universal coaster.

1771
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,560
Universal coaster.

1772
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,560
It's not at Universal Studios either.

1773
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,560
There's no crew.

1774
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,560
All the way around.

1775
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,560
No, it's kind of a centrifuge.

1776
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,460
It spins and you're in a pod that also flips around.

1777
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,460
It spins and you're in a pod that also flips around.

1778
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,460
You're going around and around, but then you're flipping around.

1779
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,460
You're going around and around, but then you're flipping around.

1780
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,460
And this has been built or this is something?

1781
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,460
This has been built.

1782
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,460
It's called Jimmy Neutron's Atom Smasher.

1783
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,460
And you can find that at one of our favorite places.

1784
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,460
The American Dream Mall.

1785
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,460
Which is out in New York.

1786
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,460
Which is out in New York.

1787
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,460
Have you heard about this place?

1788
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,460
We've talked about it a bunch.

1789
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,460
It's a huge mall that's been in slow motion for a while.

1790
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,360
It's been in slow motion failure mode for many years.

1791
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
It's across several rivers in New Jersey.

1792
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,360
It's across several rivers in New Jersey.

1793
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,360
When we were out there, I went.

1794
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,360
And it was an absolute disaster getting there.

1795
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,360
It took me two hours to get a lift out of there.

1796
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,360
So not a recommend.

1797
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,360
I wouldn't say.

1798
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,360
But if you ever see a big ugly building.

1799
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,360
If you're in the New Jersey area.

1800
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,360
If you're in the New Jersey area.

1801
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,360
If you're by the Meadowlands.

1802
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,360
I'll check it out.

1803
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,360
There should be a roller coaster into it.

1804
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,260
And out of it.

1805
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,260
It's hard to get in and out.

1806
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,260
I haven't been there.

1807
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,260
But a roller coaster that's a mile away.

1808
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,260
That takes you in and then a roller coaster takes you out.

1809
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,260
But still has some loops and dips and stuff.

1810
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:01,260
Oh yeah.

1811
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,260
Scott discovered that the ride chair is an escape room.

1812
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,260
Scott discovered that the ride chair is an escape room.

1813
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:07,260
An inadvertent escape room.

1814
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,260
An inadvertent escape room.

1815
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,260
That I failed.

1816
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,260
You're a failure if you take more than an hour.

1817
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,260
I think to get out of an escape room.

1818
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,160
You have to figure out 30 minutes in.

1819
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,160
You have to walk to the Valero.

1820
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,160
Boy yes.

1821
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,160
The hardest escape room ever.

1822
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,160
Well what else?

1823
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:30,160
What have we not addressed about this ride that swings back and forth a couple times.

1824
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,160
Will you three, if you come across one,

1825
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,160
will you do it now that you've learned so much about it?

1826
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,160
I guess the three of us would have to do it together.

1827
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,160
I guess the three of us would have to do it together.

1828
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,160
I guess the three of us would have to do it together.

1829
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,160
I guess the three of us would have to do it together.

1830
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,160
Oh that would be fun.

1831
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,060
That would be the after fried picture of that.

1832
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,060
All of us in a big weighted blanket together.

1833
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,060
I'm in baby mode, but a big swaddle.

1834
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:56,060
The three of us getting swaddled in a blanket by a Six Flags employee.

1835
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,060
On our bellies. For tummy time.

1836
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,060
The weight limit was like 850 or 900 pounds.

1837
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,060
So I think we're well under that.

1838
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,060
Well under that.

1839
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,060
I think we are under that, yes.

1840
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,060
I think that's okay.

1841
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,060
It doesn't seem like a risk, yeah.

1842
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,960
For that photo op, yes.

1843
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,960
I don't know how soon it's going to happen.

1844
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,960
We're working on some other things to get brave about.

1845
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,960
We're working on some other things to get brave about.

1846
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,960
Especially haunt season.

1847
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,960
I've been working on these gentlemen to get in the mazes.

1848
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,960
I've been working on these gentlemen to get in the mazes.

1849
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,960
So I think that's step one.

1850
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,960
Oh well, you know what, talking properties.

1851
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,960
It's very rare that these things are themed.

1852
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,960
It's very rare that these things are themed.

1853
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,960
There's over a hundred of these sky coasters.

1854
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,960
There's only one that maybe ever

1855
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,960
you could consider having

1856
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,860
even still not a narrative.

1857
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,860
I guess just a theme.

1858
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:47,860
This might have come up oddly with Justin McElroy recently

1859
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:49,860
that Kings Island

1860
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,860
where they had to theme things after

1861
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:53,860
properties while they had a paramount license

1862
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,860
and then immediately change all of them

1863
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,860
when they lost the paramount license.

1864
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,860
The one in Kings Island was named after

1865
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,860
the movie Drop Zone.

1866
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,860
It was called Drop Zone.

1867
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,860
Can anyone produce any facts about Drop Zone offhand?

1868
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,860
Does anyone know what it is?

1869
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,860
Only that we recently talked about it.

1870
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,760
And then it was already called

1871
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,760
In-N-Out.

1872
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,760
I never heard of it at the time.

1873
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,760
This is a movie where Wesley Snipes

1874
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,760
free falls into the daredevil world

1875
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,760
of skydiving to track down

1876
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,760
a cadre of techno-terrorists.

1877
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,760
Including

1878
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,760
Gary Busey as

1879
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,760
renegade skydiver Ty Montcreaf.

1880
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,760
I mean that's a killer name.

1881
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,760
That's a killer character name.

1882
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,760
So

1883
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,760
I don't think they were

1884
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,660
doing the instructions.

1885
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,660
So remember to place a polar ripcord

1886
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:45,660
and take it from me Ty Montcreaf.

1887
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,660
You might not want to listen to Ty.

1888
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:51,660
He might be leading you astray.

1889
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,660
Oh there it is.

1890
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,660
Drop Zone.

1891
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,660
Leave that up for the next

1892
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,660
recording please.

1893
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,660
Why are we being advertised

1894
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,660
Drop Zone today?

1895
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,660
Well anyway

1896
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,660
talking about this for a while

1897
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,560
made me feel like a real Ty Montcreaf.

1898
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,560
You must have felt like Ty

1899
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,560
doing it.

1900
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,560
Well I don't know.

1901
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,560
Any final thoughts about this?

1902
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,560
Maybe we do it. Maybe we give it a try.

1903
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,560
Will you ever again?

1904
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
While you were talking about maybe I go with the sloppy boys.

1905
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,560
That's a trio.

1906
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,560
After talking about it I'm going to do it again.

1907
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,560
Nelton arms race.

1908
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,560
Do we three ride it first or the three sloppy boys ride it first?

1909
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,560
I wonder who

1910
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,560
will get to it first.

1911
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,460
Who has more opportunities to do this type of thing?

1912
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,460
The only thing stopping you guys is that you aren't always

1913
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,460
in the same place all the time.

1914
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,460
When we are it is at an amusement park.

1915
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,460
Well if it is

1916
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,460
update us.

1917
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,460
Send us photos or videos.

1918
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,460
And for now

1919
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,460
Mike Hanford at last you survived.

1920
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,460
Well we don't know yet.

1921
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,460
In theory

1922
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,460
you survived.

1923
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,460
At the risk of making this too long of an episode.

1924
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,460
I don't want to keep it going.

1925
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,360
I came on last time the whole initial thing was to

1926
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,360
sort of

1927
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,360
bridge our friendship again.

1928
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,360
Because I was talking.

1929
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,360
I don't even remember the story now.

1930
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,360
Because we buried the hatchet.

1931
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,360
And now I put it out of my mind.

1932
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,360
But we I think we were outside of a bar once.

1933
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,360
Across from Tam Oshancha.

1934
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,360
At the Griffin.

1935
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,360
Then Griffin.

1936
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,360
And people were talking about Disneyland.

1937
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,360
And I said Disneyland is not good.

1938
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,360
Disney is not good.

1939
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,260
And we were like oh Hanford would be great to have on.

1940
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,260
And then you shot the dream down.

1941
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,260
I said Disneyland.

1942
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:43,260
But then I said.

1943
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,260
Because I see it as and I like this.

1944
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,260
I see it as just a get people in.

1945
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,260
Make their money off them.

1946
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,260
And shoot them out.

1947
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,260
Well you should know it has become since you did the show last.

1948
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,260
It has become

1949
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,260
200% more that.

1950
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,260
Boy they are getting crazy with the add ons.

1951
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:01,260
And maybe you get these.

1952
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,260
The magic man the wrists.

1953
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,160
And you pay for individual rides.

1954
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,160
So no disagreement.

1955
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,160
I love how it is like the most magical place on earth.

1956
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,160
And I like going there.

1957
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,160
I really enjoy being there.

1958
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,160
It is fun and you see all the characters and the rides are fun.

1959
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,160
But you know it is just taking all your money.

1960
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,160
So it is at once the most evil thing.

1961
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,160
And the most wonderful thing.

1962
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,160
You like that you are just watching the dance.

1963
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,160
I love it.

1964
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,160
I think when I said Disneyland is bad.

1965
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,160
That battle.

1966
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,160
Fists were up.

1967
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,060
The subtlety.

1968
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:37,060
Now I see the whole opinion.

1969
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,060
But then that is all you hear.

1970
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,060
When you have a couple of drinks in you.

1971
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:43,060
I like to push buttons too.

1972
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:45,060
You are a rabble rabble.

1973
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,060
I like to get people.

1974
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:49,060
What did he just say?

1975
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,060
This is Eric Bogosian over here.

1976
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,060
Doing talk radio.

1977
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,060
So I wanted to be controversial in the moment.

1978
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,060
And then it came to be where I came on the podcast.

1979
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,060
And we did figure out the water under the bridge.

1980
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,060
But that is what started this.

1981
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,960
To bring up the chili peppers again.

1982
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,960
Full circle.

1983
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,960
But I do like Disneyland.

1984
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,960
I think I made that point on the last.

1985
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,960
The Lost Podcast.

1986
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,960
So you wanted it on record here.

1987
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,960
And on record that you don't approve of that teacher's actions.

1988
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,960
Right.

1989
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,960
You don't forget.

1990
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,960
That is bad. Everything that person did was bad.

1991
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,960
No excuse.

1992
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,960
I am glad it is all on the record.

1993
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,960
And glad we don't have to have a big bendel war.

1994
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,960
We don't have to have a bean fight.

1995
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,860
We can all just hold hands.

1996
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,860
Clash hands.

1997
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,860
And go to Big Rock Candy Mountain together.

1998
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,860
I'd like that.

1999
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,860
What does that mean?

2000
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,860
It is an old folk song.

2001
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,860
It is in the Old Brother We Are Not Thou.

2002
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,860
About hobos luring children to a mountain of candy.

2003
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,860
Wait.

2004
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,860
So we don't want to go there.

2005
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,860
Do we?

2006
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,860
People are being lured to children.

2007
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,860
It is candy.

2008
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:58,860
But lured is a bad word.

2009
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,760
It is like Pleasure Island in Pinocchio.

2010
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,760
That is a bad place too.

2011
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,760
But there was a ride.

2012
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,760
There was a boat ride.

2013
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,760
But vapor monsters.

2014
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,760
Not smoke monsters.

2015
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,760
Vapor monsters in the Zemeckis movie.

2016
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,760
To turn them into donkey slaves forever.

2017
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,760
Like the Valencia teens.

2018
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,760
Like the Valencia teens riding the skycoasters.

2019
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,760
I have seen you tweet about the Pinocchio.

2020
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,760
I haven't watched Pinocchio yet.

2021
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,760
I plan to.

2022
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
It doesn't seem like it is going to be.

2023
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,660
There are dozens and dozens of bizarre facets to it.

2024
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,660
So again, mixed ride.

2025
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,660
Would I recommend it?

2026
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,660
It is a boy made of woods.

2027
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,660
Of course there are going to be weird facets to it.

2028
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,660
It is a little out there for me.

2029
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,660
It is pretty twisted.

2030
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,660
But,

2031
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,660
Mike, let's exit through the gift shop.

2032
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,660
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2033
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,660
I will plug the Sloppy Boys podcast

2034
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,660
and albums.

2035
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,660
I will also plug this.

2036
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,660
Since the last time we have done a podcast together.

2037
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,660
The book, Devil in the White City.

2038
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,660
It is an old book.

2039
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,660
Have you read it?

2040
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,660
Fantastic book.

2041
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,660
I am so late.

2042
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,660
It was like New York Times top seller like 20 years ago.

2043
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,660
I read it since the last time we talked.

2044
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,660
It is fantastic.

2045
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,660
It is about the Chicago World's Fair coming together in 1892.

2046
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,660
Something like that.

2047
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,660
It was an early running thread on this.

2048
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,660
I think I just read it as we were starting the podcast.

2049
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,660
I was just so jacked off.

2050
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,560
Early theme park connections.

2051
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,560
All the big historical figures who pass through.

2052
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,560
The big ride.

2053
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,560
The big thing that shows up.

2054
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,560
The way they reveal that.

2055
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,560
Oh, I have said too much.

2056
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,560
A John.

2057
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,560
A big John shows up.

2058
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,560
There is captains of industry.

2059
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,560
There is murder.

2060
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,560
It is all happening.

2061
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,560
We should.

2062
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,560
It is always good to encourage us to read.

2063
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,560
Mike and I.

2064
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,460
If you want a shorter read, I would like to plug an article.

2065
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,460
I found mid episode.

2066
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:02,460
Mel magazine.

2067
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,460
Which I like in general.

2068
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:06,460
Which is about sports.

2069
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,460
Oh wow.

2070
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,460
This is also from Mel.

2071
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,460
Jordan has put up.

2072
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,460
The difference between peas and beans.

2073
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,460
And why it matters.

2074
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,460
That is wild.

2075
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,460
There is an article.

2076
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,460
I have an article about sport mode.

2077
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,460
This was written about.

2078
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,360
They have a nuclear.

2079
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,360
What is it?

2080
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,360
A nuclear and mechanical engineer.

2081
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,360
Discuss why sport mode matters.

2082
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,360
With crocs.

2083
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,360
And the benefits.

2084
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,360
What could happen to you if you don't properly activate sport mode.

2085
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,360
There is a lot of websites out there.

2086
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,360
There is infinite content void.

2087
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,360
There is an article about everything.

2088
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,360
Think of anything.

2089
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,360
And then further plugs.

2090
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,360
From us.

2091
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,360
Thanks to Jordan Katz.

2092
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,260
For producing this episode.

2093
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,260
And showing that article about peas and beans being different.

2094
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,260
Thanks to forever dog.

2095
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,260

At patreon.com.

2100
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:12,260
And I update my documents since a year ago.

2101
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,260
Because we have a new tier.

2102
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,260
Club 3.

2103
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,260
Where you get ad free episodes.

2104
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,260
And a bonus episode on top of that.

2105
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,260
Every month.

2106
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,160
There is an innovation.

2107
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,160
We just started this new tier in the last year.

2108
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,160
It is an 8 dollar tier.

2109
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,160
Your top tier is something else.

2110
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,160
Would you like to discuss?

2111
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,160
We have a top tier.

2112
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,160
It is the pay pig tier.

2113
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,160
You can pay 100 dollars a month.

2114
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,160
And you get the satisfaction of giving us 100 dollars a month.

2115
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,160
And that is all.

2116
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,160
That came from.

2117
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,160
I think that is a tier on like.

2118
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,160
Only fans.

2119
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,060
That is a tier 2 thing.

2120
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,060
Where you get off on the idea of.

2121
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:56,060
You are paying too much money.

2122
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,060
Losing everything.

2123
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,060
We put that up there as a joke.

2124
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,060
And we have a few.

2125
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,060
We have a few pay pigs.

2126
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:06,060
We have encouraged people.

2127
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,060
On the podcast.

2128
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,060
If you are a pay pig.

2129
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,060
Make sure you know that is auto renewed.

2130
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:14,060
And maybe take your.

2131
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,060
I do not want to do that forever.

2132
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,060
We love every.

2133
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,960
We call them Patron's.

2134
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,960
We get kind of funny with that.

2135
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,960
We are a cocktail podcast.

2136
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,960
We love all those people.

2137
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,960
It warms my heart that someone.

2138
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,960
Likes the podcast.

2139
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,960
Pay pigs.

2140
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,960
The thing to get obsessed with.

2141
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,960
If you are a pay pig.

2142
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,960
You get all the stuff.

2143
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,960
You do not just get mocked.

2144
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,960
For your monthly money loss.

2145
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,960
It does sound like it is a sex thing.

2146
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,960
It comes from.

2147
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:49,860
I am saying only fans.

2148
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,860
It is a kink.

2149
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:53,860
Ruin me.

2150
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:55,860
Take all my money.

2151
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,860
Gun me.

2152
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:59,860
Jason really quick on the answer.

2153
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:01,860
Ruin me.

2154
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:03,860
It is more unnerving.

2155
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,860
I feel like I have seen it.

2156
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,860
You usually just type it.

2157
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,860
I do not really just type it.

2158
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,860
To a Vomititions.

2159
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,860
Captain's of Industry.

2160
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,860
Bill Kitchen.

2161
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,760
No never.

2162
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,760
What if we step into Professor Hooters mind.

2163
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,760
That could be a ride at the Universal's Hornet.

2164
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,760
Professor Hooters will be.

2165
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,760
House of Horrors.

2166
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,760
Alright bye everybody.
