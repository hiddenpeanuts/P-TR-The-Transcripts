1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Warning, the following podcast contains Eating Meals While Robots Watch, Stomach Scrapes,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,520
Wayne's World Land, and one of the hosts reveals the childhood love of shuffleboard?

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,280
Which host could it be?

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,040
Eliza Skinner joins us to talk Kings Dominion and much, much more on today's podcast, The

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,680
Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,360
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast where sometimes we are so despondent

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,440
about the state of the world, we wish we could hide underground in the land of the dews.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm Scott Gardner.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't you feel that way, Mike Carlson?

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,920
Yeah, I was just saying this to Lindsay last night, that that's exactly where I would like

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,640
to go.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,000
There are a couple places in the place we're talking about today that I think you could

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,800
hide though.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,680
I won't say the specific one that Jason Sheridan, who's also here, is very excited about.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,120
Yeah, this is a big park for me.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:23,320
And I don't want to contradict what you said, Scott, but researching vintage Kings Dominion,

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,720
maybe the most at peace I have felt during the pandemic.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,040
Except I will say this is the only theme park to give me a semi-permanent physical scar.

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,240
Whoa, really?

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,600
Yeah, it's like your action park.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,360
Kind of.

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,560
Well, not quite.

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,720
Yeah, not on that level, though.

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
It's pretty minor.

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,160
I think it's faded at this point.

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
Okay, so faded, but there.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,400
And I believe that our guest is a big fan and enthusiastic about this place as well.

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,720
She is the producer of Earth to Ned on Disney+, and she has an album out called

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Regarding My Lovers.

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,440
It's Eliza Skinner.

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,280
Yay, it's me.

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,760
It's me.

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:18,120
I forgot to get even the like, slight amount of memorabilia to set up my...

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,400
Wait, yes, you have a hat on that you didn't have when we

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,200
began.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,040
Whoa, Kings Dominion.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,360
It says...

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
My co-Kings Dominion hat.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,000
I have a bun on so I can't really wear a hat.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,040
That's a really like, world brightening aqua color as well.

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,480
That's a beautiful shade.

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, it's corduroy.

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,760
Like you want your summer wear to be.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,280
Your summer hats.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,480
You want them in a nice corduroy, nice wooly corduroy.

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Yeah, that looks...

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,960
You have that summer heat up there.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,100
Yeah.

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,800
Yeah, in this quarantine, as I have been putting on quarantine weight, I've been replacing

52
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,880
the clothes that fit me with oversized t-shirts from old theme parks.

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,880
Why am I having such a problem talking?

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,720
Bush Gardens and Kings Dominion.

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,560
Jason has just shared his screen with maybe what you're talking about.

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,440
This one is shipping to me as we speak.

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,840
Because I did that too.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,300
Yeah.

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,800
Yeah.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,760
It's a very mom shirt.

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,800
It kind of, yeah, I mean it's very 90s.

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,360
It is of course a Paramounts Kings Dominions, which was how I knew it.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,360
I predate that.

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
You predate it.

65
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,160
I'm going for the Hanna-Barbera stuff.

66
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm going for anything that looks like the animal that would have been attacking me

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
in the world of that ride.

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,200
So like your Grizzly, your...

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
This is mostly the Grizzly because everything else is.

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,920
The Shockwave, Avalanche, the Rebel Yell, which have they renamed that?

71
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,720
They should rename that.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,160
They have renamed it, yes.

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Yeah, it's called Racer 75 now and is still standing.

74
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,000
And they did the rename not even recently, like not even in the last year as part of

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,520
everyone should do these kinds of things.

76
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,520
It was several years ago, seemingly completely voluntary and out of nowhere.

77
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,480
So good for them.

78
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,040
Has Billy Idol changed the name of his, the Rebel Yell song?

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,160
Do we know?

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,080
Yeah, I think it's Defund the Police now.

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh, okay.

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,200
He's pretty progressive.

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,700
Wow.

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,360
I'm glad he in England is tapped into our issues.

85
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,120
I guess it's their issues too, probably.

86
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,760
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,900
That's great.

88
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,720
So, all right, so you were on Doughboys and you were talking about King's Dominion on

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,840
there, which caused a listener on Twitter to set up an arranged marriage between us.

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,000
You must have Eliza Skinneron.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,640
Why haven't you had Eliza Skinneron?

92
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,040
And my only answer is because we haven't met.

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,000
But if we...

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,840
Let's meet quickly and then we could do this.

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,320
And we did it.

96
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,200
We've made progress.

97
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,680
So you're welcome, whichever person that was.

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:10,940
Yes.

99
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,820
Yeah, I'm very pleased to be here.

100
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,700
Wonderful.

101
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:22,380
And now I've not had a chance to listen to that Doughboys, so I don't know your specific...

102
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,980
Oh, it's mostly me shit talking this podcast.

103
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,900
So yeah, you should have listened.

104
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,260
It's just, what do these guys think they know?

105
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,820
What a bunch of doinks.

106
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,320
Yeah.

107
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,180
My biggest fear is of what they think.

108
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,140
It's why I avoid it on the regular.

109
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,060
I turned it off at that part.

110
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,100
I was like, I should circle back around to this, but I don't know if I have time.

111
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,020
Yeah.

112
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,380
I mean, it's kind of a way of getting more podcast bookings.

113
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,380
I just neg other podcasts on each podcast appearance.

114
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,780
And by the way, never not funny.

115
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
More like never funny, you know?

116
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,980
Get rid of the not.

117
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,380
Hopefully they'll book me.

118
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,300
That should get them.

119
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,180
Talk to them next week.

120
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,220
Okay.

121
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,500
But so you did grow up with Kings Dominion.

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,300
So you're from that area, Virginia.

123
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,340
I don't know where it is.

124
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,100
This park is close to Richmond and kind of close to DC.

125
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,980
Yeah, I'm from Richmond.

126
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,300
So it felt like...

127
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,900
So Kings Dominion was the closest, but it felt to me as a child,

128
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,780
like I was just right between Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens.

129
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,140
And that's pretty much how I classified my place in the world.

130
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:41,180
Was this like your number one park as when you were a kid, or was it like just low?

131
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,820
It was close.

132
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,940
This a little of both.

133
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,420
I mean, I did Busch Gardens.

134
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Williamsburg seemed like the fancy one because it's themed European.

135
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,220
So like each place you're going to is a different country.

136
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,500
And it's like, ooh, but Kings Dominion

137
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,700
you had more rides for your inch, square inch.

138
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Also, as a little kid, they had a much better kids area.

139
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,220
So they had like a bunch of kids rides and a kids roller coaster that sort of like

140
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,020
could transition you into the world of roller coasters.

141
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,780
The Scooby Doo.

142
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,540
The Scooby Doo, yes.

143
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,780
A big favorite of mine.

144
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,660
Yeah.

145
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,020
Kind of big.

146
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,140
It was like a, it's not exactly a super small kiddie coaster.

147
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,460
No, yeah.

148
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,020
It is a decent sized wooden coaster, but that's what I rode a number of times

149
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:45,820
to work my way up to the Rebel Yell now Racer 75, which is very large.

150
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,540
Yeah.

151
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,020
Yeah.

152
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,820
No, yeah.

153
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,300
It's not like those kiddie coasters that you see on a boardwalk that'll just be like,

154
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,780
oh, they're going around in a circle, a little up and down.

155
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,420
It's a legit coaster that just got shrunk down.

156
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,540
Slightly and doesn't have any loops, but yeah, I felt like a real grownup

157
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,300
once I was riding the Scooby Doo.

158
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,980
There's not a ton in that genre, like the step up, like the PG 13 of roller coasters.

159
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,460
It's a kind of a, it's kind of a bear area.

160
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,540
It's not as either just kiddie or full tilt, super scary one.

161
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,140
Yeah.

162
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,380
Yeah.

163
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,620
So I feel blessed, honestly.

164
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,020
Big Thunder's a little bit of one.

165
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,220
Yeah, I would agree.

166
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,660
I was maybe the type of kid who Big Thunder was a, was an R or even an NC 17.

167
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,100
Whoa, really?

168
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,300
Then I, yes, I would say that's scandalous.

169
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,180
But then I was a very wimpy kid.

170
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,100
Can I ask what age you were when you went,

171
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
do we talked about this before when you went on Big Thunder?

172
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,620
Oh, maybe not until 13.

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,860
It wasn't, I guess, well, I guess so maybe you classify it as a PG 13 for that.

174
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,580
Yeah, for comedy's sake, I was hoping you said 17 or 18.

175
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,500
It was last week.

176
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,620
It was recently.

177
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,340
That would have been good.

178
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,540
But I can't remember.

179
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,980
I threw, got scared.

180
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,620
Just waving your arms up, please.

181
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,420
I can't, I can't, no.

182
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,460
Can I be airlifted out, please?

183
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,180
Dear God.

184
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,660
You threw clothes on the track to like trigger the sensors to turn it off.

185
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,340
You only have so many tools at your disposal.

186
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,260
You have to sort of MacGyver it.

187
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,580
Yeah.

188
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,420
I don't have that many things on my person.

189
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,560
Right.

190
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,900
Anyways, so yeah, Scooby Doo was like a kind of bridge the gap.

191
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,220
But there are some pretty like mighty coasters in this place.

192
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,740
How were you, Eliza, on that spectrum?

193
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,180
Are you afraid of these things?

194
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,460
Were you down for any of them?

195
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,740
No, I was very into it.

196
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,460
Very into them.

197
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,860
I mean, when I was before the Scooby Doo, I was terrified of all of them.

198
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,860
But then I got really into them, rode all of them.

199
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,260
Definitely had ones that I preferred.

200
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,060
Did not enjoy the shockwave, which I believe has been replaced because it murdered people.

201
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,300
But that's the mark of a good park to a degree.

202
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,620
Almost every park at some point in time, you try to avoid it,

203
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,780
but it shows that they're taking big swings.

204
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,220
Yeah.

205
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,340
I mean, fewer people than a highway and people are on those all the time.

206
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,780
So yeah, that's true.

207
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,860
It is.

208
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,660
I think we've done this podcast now for a couple of years,

209
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,260
and we'll talk about some dark topics like that once in a while.

210
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,860
But it is funny to just remember that we are building giant steel contraptions

211
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,780
to whip human beings around.

212
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,380
Like the this is very strange.

213
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,540
It's strange enough that we've done this podcast for years,

214
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,220
but think about what human beings have created

215
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,900
and continue to make new, faster, crazier versions of.

216
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,140
Yeah.

217
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,060
And I mean, I think that's the fact that more people aren't gravely injured on them.

218
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,340
That's kind of the amazing thing.

219
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,300
Yeah.

220
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,660
The ratio is pretty good.

221
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,220
It's a point.

222
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,540
Yeah.

223
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,980
And hopefully there isn't some turn where suddenly I guess during COVID,

224
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,940
they just let everything rust over and then they opened everything back up

225
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,460
and never worked again.

226
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,340
Yeah.

227
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,300
Trump Trump deregulated like some sort of code for rust on tracks,

228
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,300
which honestly, like not that far out of the realm of possibility.

229
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,820
Like we're ending the rust,

230
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,460
we're ending the stoppage of rust on roller coasters.

231
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,140
That is I know the supervillainy is such that yeah,

232
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,420
he might be pro roller coaster accident.

233
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,660
I don't know.

234
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,420
Nothing would surprise me anymore.

235
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:35,820
Yeah.

236
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,820
As long as we're as long as we've taken this turn into comically awful,

237
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,780
it would feel wrong for that not to be included.

238
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,940
Yeah.

239
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,580
Like.

240
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:43,900
Yeah.

241
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,500
Also, like poisonous cotton candy made out of bees or something.

242
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,140
Yes.

243
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,140
If you're dressed as a clown in a theme park, you also have to carry a knife.

244
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,060
It's just, it's a weight balance thing.

245
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,940
You'll fall.

246
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,380
You need to balance things out with a huge saber.

247
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:00,780
Mm hmm.

248
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,500
Well, and he made a point of, all right, if they're bees that help the environment that we need,

249
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,340
they should be killed off immediately.

250
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,620
But if they're key, if they're bees that surprise people and attack them,

251
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,300
especially within children's candy, we should breed them far more aggressively.

252
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,460
Yeah.

253
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,940
That's how we get stronger as a country.

254
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,180
Genetically engineered candy apples to have a razor growing inside of them.

255
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,340
From a seed.

256
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,580
From a seed, a razor seed.

257
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:25,820
Yeah.

258
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,020
Yeah.

259
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,900
And you know why?

260
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,540
Because why you can't stop us from doing it.

261
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,100
That's why.

262
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,100
Because that's America.

263
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,340
Yeah.

264
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,380
Well, these will all come true in a week.

265
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,020
Barrel like towards all of it.

266
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,780
You know, actually, just a quick side trick from King's Dominion,

267
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,820
because you also talked about, wait, it's Busch Gardens Williamsburg, correct?

268
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,060
Yeah.

269
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,500
The only time that that's come up on the show before is that we did an entire episode about

270
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,660
the Fabio goose incident.

271
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,140
Right.

272
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,380
I didn't know that that was there for a long time.

273
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,980
I just found that out kind of recently.

274
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,100
That was there.

275
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,140
We had this confusion when we had Dave Ferguson on about the Sister Park of King's Dominion,

276
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,780
King's Island.

277
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,180
I think he always thought it was there, but in fact, it was Busch Gardens.

278
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,820
So then you were if you didn't know it was there, then this was not a story that like

279
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,380
shook you to your core as a local.

280
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,460
This wasn't like heartbreaking to see.

281
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,500
Not as a local.

282
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,700
I remember hearing about it and being like, that's hilarious.

283
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,100
But I didn't remember that it had happened.

284
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,740
Maybe maybe I was still in a place where I was like, this is the whole world.

285
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,620
Virginia is all there is.

286
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,740
Of course it happened in Virginia.

287
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,380
Where else is it?

288
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,860
You didn't like call any friends to make sure they were OK.

289
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:41,900
No.

290
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,140
Yeah.

291
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:42,940
No.

292
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,660
And we didn't have that feature on our phones yet.

293
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,580
So now, obviously, if something happens to Fabio, everybody can just click that thing,

294
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,660
check in and notify your friends you're OK.

295
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,460
We all have the alert.

296
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,500
We're all concerned about Fabio danger.

297
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,300
Anyway, so with that as a sidetrack.

298
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,660
Yeah, King's Dominguez.

299
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,940
So when did you go for the first time?

300
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,180
What are like early memories?

301
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:16,940
Early memories include going with friends when I was, again, very small in the kiddie park times

302
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,940
and having to have a stack of books in the back seat of my mom's car to read on the way there.

303
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,980
So I wasn't just like so excited to get there that I was like, are we there yet?

304
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,540
Are we there?

305
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,100
Oh my God.

306
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,660
So I would like plan out my OK, you've got a couple of Snoopy

307
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,860
pendiums that you can go through here.

308
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,540
This is you're going to make it.

309
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,380
And then my sister got a job there when I was, I guess I must have been like nine years old,

310
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,020
10 years old.

311
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,020
She was in one of the shows they had.

312
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,540
OK, so one of the big things that King's Dominion did for me was give me a love of

313
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,220
eating near animatronics.

314
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,300
I just like that that stepping into a very air conditioned place with these like clicking

315
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,140
old animatronics, trying to get you like worried about something.

316
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,500
I loved it.

317
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,900
And my sister was speaking our language.

318
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,300
Oh, yes.

319
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,700
Yes.

320
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,900
We all are not in agreement.

321
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,260
Yeah, I have.

322
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,700
I mean, I've also priced old tin and aluminum statues and animatronics from

323
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,460
King's Dominion before.

324
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,780
I'm like, I'm still not there in my career.

325
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,780
Oh, really?

326
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,900
How crazy does it get?

327
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,620
Where did it?

328
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,020
Well, there's just there aren't there aren't a lot out there.

329
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,540
People are holding on to their old singing mushrooms and stuff because that was a big

330
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:36,940
feature.

331
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,860
They had singing mushrooms.

332
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,060
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,980
I have a little singing mushrooms clip.

334
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,020
We'll get to that.

335
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,740
Oh, good.

336
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Because I saw a picture of those and I was, you know, this is a big part for me, but

337
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,860
somehow I remembered quite a bit of it.

338
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,940
Did not remember those singing mushrooms.

339
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,580
I don't know how that escaped my view.

340
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:04,540
They were right by I believe they like a merry-go-round or bumper car, something that

341
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
had like a roof over it.

342
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,420
So it wasn't I think it was a station for the like gondolas, the like sky bucket.

343
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,340
That's what it was.

344
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,300
I remember the roof.

345
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,620
Yeah.

346
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,220
So I mean, I guess they're entertaining if you're standing there waiting to get on the

347
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,940
sky gondola.

348
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,140
But my sister got a job at a show inside of this jungle themed restaurant that had a

349
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,860
bunch of, you know, different animals and explorers like popping out of different parts

350
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,860
of the room being like, well, I'm a snake.

351
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,900
You better get a hamburger.

352
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,860
You know, that kind of stuff.

353
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:46,540
And the show that she was in on the stage there was a like it was like a review of

354
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,140
fairy tale princesses.

355
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,740
So sometimes she played Cinderella.

356
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,500
Sometimes she played a little red riding hood.

357
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Sometimes she played, you know, Rapunzel, all that stuff inside the jungle themed restaurant,

358
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,780
which made no sense.

359
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,820
Absolutely no sense.

360
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,140
But when you have when you're looking to make shows for a theme park, you're going to be

361
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,420
dealing with a glut of pretty teenage musical theater girls.

362
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,020
So why not write to that?

363
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,140
Why not write together some shows that are like, this is definitely we can pull this off

364
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,460
with the high schoolers in town.

365
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,180
As opposed to some jungle show, like because then you need people to play like, you know,

366
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,180
like old explorers and like the big white hats or that's that's more of a stretch for

367
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,540
a 16 year old girl, probably.

368
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,260
Yeah.

369
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,580
Yeah.

370
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,300
Or animals, you know, some sort of budget jungle book type of thing they could have done.

371
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,780
Sure.

372
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,180
Sure.

373
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,220
But then your face paint budget goes through the roof.

374
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,100
Yeah.

375
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,420
Yeah.

376
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,980
And your animatronics are doing most of that work for you.

377
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,340
So why double it up?

378
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,100
I did not learn about this jungle animatronic restaurant.

379
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,380
This is very delightful.

380
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,140
Yeah.

381
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,300
Yeah.

382
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,420
There was definitely an explorer that like popped out of a stew pot at one point.

383
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,780
Wow.

384
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,420
It was pretty good.

385
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,980
The Explorers stew pot.

386
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:10,140
What a weird old trope that I feel like there used to be like 70 movies a year that can add that.

387
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,180
Yeah.

388
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,660
Yeah.

389
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,460
And you know, I mean, obviously there's there are racist connections.

390
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,780
So it has it's good that it's died off.

391
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,060
But I also I feel like Bugs Bunny did a lot to make it stick around.

392
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,740
I feel like Bugs Bunny was just always ending up in somebody's stew pot.

393
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,260
Yeah.

394
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,300
Rabbits do, you know.

395
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:29,980
Right.

396
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,020
Was that was the stew pot like the really of six, 70 years ago?

397
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:35,980
Yeah.

398
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,980
It was well, I think actually we referred to it as that's got to hurt.

399
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,140
Which I hate to be hacky, but being cooked in a stew pot, that's got to hurt.

400
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,380
That's the whole point.

401
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,700
Yeah.

402
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,300
Look, when it's true, it's true.

403
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,060
I did your your sister enjoy her her role in this in this show.

404
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,100
Did she do it for a while?

405
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,060
She just did it for one summer and then she went to work at Hershey Park the summer after that.

406
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,420
Wow.

407
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,980
What happened?

408
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,220
Yeah.

409
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,900
She did a 1950s review.

410
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,980
So she was sometimes a nerd, sometimes a cheerleader, you know, sometimes a poodle skirt kind of Bobby Sox.

411
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,660
What was your reaction?

412
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,340
Were you like, this is awesome?

413
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,860
Yeah.

414
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,180
I was like, oh, my God, this means I get to go all the time.

415
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,980
I can go anywhere I want in the park.

416
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,260
I can get in for free.

417
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,460
None of those things were true.

418
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,660
None of them were true.

419
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,100
It was a huge disappointment.

420
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,900
I think I got to go like twice that summer.

421
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,460
And one of the first time I went, I actually won a prize at one of those games where you

422
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,980
have to hit a mallet onto a thing and it makes this little rubber frog flap onto a

423
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,180
lily pad.

424
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,100
And I won, I think it was like a stuffed alligator.

425
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,300
I was very excited about it and gave it to my sister to take home so that I didn't have

426
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,500
to like walk around with it.

427
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,540
They don't let park employees take home prizes.

428
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,940
I didn't get that alligator.

429
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,740
Oh, what?

430
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,460
Like insider trading or something?

431
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,940
Yeah.

432
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,220
Yeah, exactly.

433
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,300
So I was so upset about that for years.

434
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,100
And still, when I see that game, some part of me is like, maybe I get it back.

435
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,340
No, no, the time has passed.

436
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,740
I would be heartbroken.

437
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,220
That would never leave me if I had that happen to me.

438
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,140
That's also some ridiculous like King's Entertainment Company, like red tape.

439
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,780
That doesn't, she didn't, you won it.

440
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,100
She was like holding on to it for you.

441
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,260
But they had no proof of that.

442
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,220
And I don't know, maybe you could get really good at the games if you worked there and

443
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,340
game the system with their bad, cheap prizes.

444
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,060
I mean, it's not like they were giving out watches, you know?

445
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,660
This is not equivalent to McMillions.

446
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,540
This is not a massive.

447
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,780
Although anybody does want to invest in that type of a documentary, I'd be willing to go

448
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,740
along with that.

449
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:05,980
Yeah.

450
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,980
10 episodes minimum.

451
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:08,860
Much.

452
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,020
We haven't talked about like games, I think a lot of like prizes from Carnival type games

453
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,460
and even stuff like this where they cheap out, I feel like on plush.

454
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,860
Yeah, there's like sirefomi like crap in.

455
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,260
This was better than a lot of those like a state fair prize.

456
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:29,900
Definitely.

457
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,340
It's just like a cardboard box inside of it.

458
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,660
Right.

459
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,740
I do remember that this was probably the best stuffed animal that's ever been.

460
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,220
Was perfect and beautiful.

461
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,900
You're like half hour spent with it.

462
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,020
Yeah, yeah, that's what that's what got taken from me.

463
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,780
The best stuffed animal ever.

464
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,260
Was it the Hanna Barbera alligator?

465
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,900
What is his name?

466
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,980
No, it wasn't.

467
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,780
It was just generic.

468
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,780
No, yeah, just generic.

469
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,820
Yeah, it's really now.

470
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,980
I didn't realize we were opening up your like loss of innocence story.

471
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,540
It's OK.

472
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:02,940
Thank you.

473
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,820
Yeah, I also went camping there one time with Girl Scouts.

474
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,060
Camp there?

475
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,380
Yeah, they had a campground and they had this big Girl Scout thing where just tons of Girl

476
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:20,460
Scouts went and camped out and I was again so excited that I could not sleep and it rained

477
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,740
horribly so our flooded and I was just like, you guys, can you believe that we're going to

478
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,860
ride the grizzly tomorrow?

479
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,460
This is going to be so great.

480
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,940
And everyone was like that you're making it worse.

481
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,460
This is truly awful what you're doing.

482
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,500
But yeah, it felt like that felt like really being an insider.

483
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,020
At the park.

484
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,940
Did you ever consider also trying to perform there?

485
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,460
I mean, you're a very good improviser, musical improviser.

486
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,500
Did this?

487
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,140
Did you go, I got to get on stage here too?

488
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,060
No, I didn't because at that point, by the time I was a teenager, I wasn't really doing

489
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,020
that kind of performing.

490
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,780
I wasn't really doing musical theater stuff and it seemed like it didn't seem like my

491
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,740
sister had a great time.

492
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,540
It seemed like kind of a grind and I was like, well, I wouldn't want to turn something that

493
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,460
I love into that.

494
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,900
Plus, I didn't know that I had the chops for it.

495
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,460
I don't know.

496
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,820
I mean, interesting.

497
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,620
My sister's been Tony nominated since then.

498
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,060
Oh, I can't say that.

499
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,620
That right.

500
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,860
Wow.

501
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,060
Oh my God.

502
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,740
In hindsight, though, or right now, is there any role in a Disney park or in King that

503
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
you would go, you know what, I do this for a couple of weeks.

504
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,380
That seems good.

505
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,680
Yes.

506
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
I would definitely play the weird comedic part in any of them.

507
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,600
Like the girl who runs in and is like, what?

508
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,800
A time machine?

509
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,720
Guys, we can't do that.

510
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,280
And then someone else is like, stop it, Carla.

511
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,920
We're doing whatever we need to to go find them.

512
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,280
Hits of the past.

513
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,220
Yeah.

514
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,880
So that one is about collecting all of the greatest songs of all time.

515
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,520
Yeah.

516
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,400
For your time travel.

517
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,680
That would definitely work, right?

518
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,640
Yeah.

519
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
It seems that's pretty like what theme park shows are.

520
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:05,860
Yes.

521
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,280
Like we talked about those Disney Cruise Line musicals.

522
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
That's almost exactly what they're like.

523
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,520
Yeah.

524
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,200
Or like the Universal Studios show with all the, or I guess it's Islands of Adventure,

525
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,640
maybe show where it's like different monsters performing in a band.

526
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,680
Coming up on podcast.

527
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,400
Coming soon.

528
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,720
Yes.

529
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,800
Beeljuice's Graveyard Review.

530
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,160
Oh, yeah.

531
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,840
But they have it year round in the one in Florida.

532
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,920
It's not a seasonal thing and it's not so much about it, about the year review.

533
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,880
It's just like, hey, it's me, the bride of Frankenstein.

534
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,680
I think I could probably play guitar.

535
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,400
Oh yeah, because I'm the Wolfman and I can play drums.

536
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
And then they do a bunch of songs.

537
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,160
Yes.

538
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,840
They bulldozed it a few years ago to build a very, very poorly received Fast and Furious

539
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,520
slapdash.

540
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,480
That was that?

541
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,120
Oh no.

542
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,720
Oh yeah, we'll get into it.

543
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Yeah, we'll get into it in that episode.

544
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Oh geez.

545
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,200
Well also you have to think that being in a theme park show is the opposite of improvising.

546
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,120
I would say there is no room for improvising typically.

547
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,360
Yeah.

548
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,160
Well if you-

549
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,280
It's like whittled.

550
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, Mike?

551
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm just going to say maybe the genie in the California Adventure Disney's Aladdin show

552
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
where he's dropping topical references.

553
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,400
I do think he has a little wiggle room.

554
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,440
He does.

555
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
To throw some stuff out.

556
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
But that's the exception that proves the role.

557
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,720
Like everything else is pretty well coordinated.

558
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,640
How much wiggle room is there with the Jungle Cruise pattern?

559
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,880
That's a good question.

560
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,800
I feel like you could probably get in like a couple sentences here and there.

561
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,280
I've been on different cruises where I go, this is-

562
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,800
I've been on one where it's like exactly what you think it is.

563
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,240
And then I have been on ones where they're throwing stuff in in between the normal script.

564
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
I think you can probably get away with it.

565
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,000
You just have to be smart about it.

566
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,920
There was a strange time where they rethemed everything to the 1930s due to the Indiana

567
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,400
Jones ride and they outlawed topical references entirely.

568
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,800
If it's not something from the 30s, you cannot bring it up.

569
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,560
And audiences hated it.

570
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
The people working there hated it.

571
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,680
This was a failure across the board and I think they reversed it at some point.

572
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,480
That's awful.

573
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
Was it all just like a pre-Nazi kind of jokes?

574
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,320
Seems like something weird is happening in Germany, but look, a hippo.

575
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,040
Like in the end it was mostly about that.

576
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,160
Yeah, it was mostly about pre-Nazi turn over.

577
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,200
Movies in color.

578
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,800
Get this one to the loony bin.

579
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,240
Scott, how much improvising were you doing on the studio tour?

580
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
Because Scott was a tour guide at Universal.

581
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,480
Would you, percentage-wise, how often would you go a little off script just for to say

582
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,000
something that might have you saw and wanted to comment on?

583
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,400
I wanted to do it.

584
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,200
I did more than I was supposed to because they threatened that they would secret shop

585
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,720
you and you could get in trouble.

586
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,320
I definitely tried to, but boy, if you were feeling lazy, there was a way to do it the

587
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,680
barest bare minimum humanly possible.

588
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,360
There were certainly ones where it's like, it's too odd to be funny.

589
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,280
But my favorite thing for sure was making up false info, if I could.

590
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,520
Like fun fact?

591
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,840
Yeah, I forget if I said it on the show before, but I made this whole thing.

592
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,320
There was a montage you could show about bloopers and I made up all this stuff about how bloopers

593
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:54,720
were named after a guy named George Bloop because he was the first actor to make a mistake

594
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,160
on camera because he transitioned from the silent era to the talkie era and he forgot

595
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
that he had to say lines out loud.

596
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,240
From then on, they were called bloopers.

597
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,440
That one was so dry and what movie facts are actually like that I would watch faces at that

598
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
one like, yeah, interesting.

599
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,560
I think that one traveled.

600
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,960
The first blooper was actually, oh, shit, I forgot.

601
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,720
I have to say things, right?

602
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,000
They were, he was also extremely profane.

603
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,880
Fuck, cock, sorry.

604
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,560
God damn it.

605
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

606
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,000
Is this a clean podcast?

607
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
No, it is.

608
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,040
It is not, except that there's at various points, guilt about people's parents,

609
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,240
our own parents maybe hearing it and being shocked that we've turned to profanities.

610
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
Mine don't because they're still on like burner cell phones.

611
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,560
They wouldn't know how to get a podcast if they had detailed instructions, but other ones do.

612
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,280
Yeah, yeah.

613
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,880
Jason and my mom, Jason's mom, they don't care for the cursing.

614
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

615
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,880
No, you're fine.

616
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,360
You're fine.

617
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,520
Jason and I.

618
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,000
It's on you guys.

619
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,040
Yeah.

620
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,560
My mom sent an email about it saying like, it's not just me who doesn't like it.

621
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,080
Young people don't like it either.

622
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:32,720
And that was after she listened to a live recording of a sold out show that we had just done.

623
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,680
But were those the people who buy tickets so they can boo every time you curse?

624
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
Yeah.

625
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,200
Okay.

626
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,760
There was a little of that and I was wondering what the explanation for it was.

627
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,160
Yeah, that's what young people do.

628
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,840
It's cancel culture.

629
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,000
So the original cancel culture.

630
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,320
Yeah.

631
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,560
Tisking profanity.

632
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,760
It's a culture is mainly about getting people to stop saying crap.

633
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
I'm here and I'm a kid.

634
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,840
So sorry.

635
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,080
All right.

636
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,560
We'll be good.

637
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,280
We'll be good from now on.

638
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,960
Well, let's be here.

639
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,240
Let's be good by watching some like some very wholesome entertainment as alluded to

640
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
from the singing mushrooms.

641
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:22,160
And in fact, this is some very like parent approved material because that's exactly

642
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
what they're singing about.

643
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:31,200
And the voice that you'll hear at the beginning is a frog who is introducing some four singing

644
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,600
mushrooms who are multicolored.

645
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,320
Here's a clip.

646
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
Wake up, boys.

647
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
You're on.

648
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:48,480
I want a girl just like the girl that's very dear old dad.

649
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
She was a girl and we always grew up together.

650
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,440
It's an old barbershop.

651
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,840
I want to like the girl who married your old dad.

652
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,600
It's about wanting a woman who's like the woman.

653
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
So that's pretty wholesome, right?

654
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:11,280
I think he says he kind of grades them on the performance.

655
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,440
When I said I was moving to Los Angeles, this is what my mom dreamt of for me.

656
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,920
It's to be a frog in a top hat with a collar with like a cigar and a cigar.

657
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,400
Yeah, he's like a sleazy promoter.

658
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,160
Like he's going to get the payment run out on those mushrooms.

659
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,880
Yeah, he's a lot more mobile than the mushrooms for sure.

660
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,960
Yeah, he's like that partridge family guy, the dad who no, it wasn't a dad.

661
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Scott, are you talking about Ruben Kincaid, the manager of the family?

662
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,280
There was maybe a point in time I could remember the name Ruben Kincaid.

663
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,920
But I feel like Ruben Kincaid was not crooked.

664
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,480
That's my memory of the partridge family, but I could be wrong.

665
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,560
It would have been a much darker show, right?

666
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,360
Yeah, I mean, that's for the Gritty reboot that's coming.

667
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,080
I don't think he was selling off partridges for other purposes.

668
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,280
Ruben Kincaid.

669
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,160
You sing when I say you sing, seven-year-old.

670
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,520
He was not like Lou Pearlman, I don't think.

671
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,800
Not with them, but maybe with some other families who he felt he could exert some more control over.

672
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,040
Scott, when you work on the young Ruben Kincaid spinoff for Peacock,

673
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,040
you can do whatever.

674
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Kincaid, you can do whatever you want with that IP, okay?

675
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,480
Jesse Plemons, I think.

676
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,640
I think that's right, yeah.

677
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,400
Yeah, complicated depth.

678
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

679
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,120
You and you get the choice.

680
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,200
You get to pick which classic rock song is slowed down and whisper sung over the trailer.

681
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,880
Oh, yes.

682
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,920
Kincaid, yeah.

683
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,040
Well, it's got to be come on.

684
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400
It's got to be like Partridge Fam, like,

685
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,040
Come on, there's a song that we're singing.

686
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,240
It's got to be something like, right?

687
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,560
Come on, get happy.

688
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,060
Yeah.

689
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,640
Piano single.

690
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,160
So ironic to hear come on.

691
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,800
Piano key.

692
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,680
You're sad.

693
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,400
Yeah, one key.

694
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
From Scott Gardner.

695
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,720
Very stirring.

696
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,280
Finally, my turn to Dark Showrunner.

697
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,000
But it still involves bell bottoms, so everybody's happy.

698
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,600
That's one form of entertainment.

699
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,720
Another that I'm very fond of that I'll just throw out.

700
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,560
I'm curious if Jason or Eliza ever got to see when Paramount came in.

701
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,440
So this was not a Paramount part, much like Kings Island.

702
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,040
You can check that episode out from a couple years ago.

703
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,520
But Paramount bought this park at some point and started installing Paramount properties.

704
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,960
And I think they really announced their arrival for the first time

705
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
in a big way with Paramount on ice.

706
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,200
Did anybody get to see Paramount on ice?

707
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,680
For sure.

708
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,120
Yeah, I brought it.

709
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,920
Yeah, it comes up on the Kings Island because that has the Star Trek ice skating sequence.

710
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
Yes, which might.

711
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,840
Did we talk about in the Star Trek one too?

712
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,720
A little bit.

713
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,880
It was a big Star Trek zone.

714
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,240
It was an ice skating thing at Kings Dominion.

715
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,720
Yes.

716
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,120
Yes.

717
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,680
Yeah.

718
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,160
This is a park that is only open in the summer.

719
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,320
This is not like a year round park.

720
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,120
This is.

721
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,360
Yeah, it's welteringly hot.

722
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,720
Yeah, but like, why bomb there?

723
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,480
They've got a lake right there.

724
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,720
Make it a jet ski show.

725
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,480
That is a good idea.

726
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,080
I don't know if they had such a thing.

727
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,800
They did.

728
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,560
They had a water stunt show for a while.

729
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,320
Water skiing and yeah, just put those people in Star Trek outfits.

730
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,080
Same thing.

731
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,960
That's good.

732
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,880
They had it, I guess.

733
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
They had the facilities.

734
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,560
Wait, Jason, what were you saying?

735
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,520
Well, I was going to say, I think part of the appeal of the ice skating theater,

736
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,120
I remember going in there and the appeal of a lot of indoor places at parks located on

737
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,720
the East Coast in the summertime.

738
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,560
Virginia gets very muggy.

739
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,280
Virginia gets super hot and super humid.

740
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:30,400
So anywhere I feel like my family, yeah, we saw the ice skating show and I just remember

741
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,520
eating at Country Kitchen a lot because it had like food that you could tell was cooked.

742
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,800
Like it was good.

743
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,560
Like it was fried chicken and barbecue and everywhere else.

744
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,840
As a kid, I was very happy to eat pizza for most meals.

745
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,040
But my parents were a little frustrated by that.

746
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,320
That said, I did find a King's Dominion map where it just listed food items and like a

747
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,640
long list of like pizza, funnel cake, ice cream, hot dog.

748
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,840
And it would tell you every place you could get that one item.

749
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,360
And I don't know how that didn't become a theme park map standard.

750
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,240
Like that is a great idea to get a child to stop screaming.

751
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,040
Yeah.

752
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,920
I don't know if this was an era thing or a King's Dominion thing or what, but I do

753
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,520
remember getting popcorn shrimp for the first time at King's Dominion, which seems like

754
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,480
kind of an odd theme park food choice.

755
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,760
And it was from this stand that was like primarily popcorn shrimp.

756
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,960
Like that was, you know, they have those little round ones with the different lines

757
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,640
can come up and they just have buckets of the same kind of food inside.

758
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:42,880
Yeah.

759
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,400
Is it a popcorn shrimp stand?

760
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,720
I also remember at some point trying popcorn shrimp and it's seeming like exotic and me

761
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,560
thinking that this is adult food.

762
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,280
I bet as soon as an adult, I'll mainly be sitting on popcorn shrimp.

763
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,560
I'll move out of this whole chicken finger era that I'm still in right now.

764
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,360
Having gotten past the chicken nugget stages of my youth and eventually

765
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,360
arrive at popcorn shrimp, a true adult.

766
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,120
I could never never a full like roasted che.

767
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,800
That's for elderly people.

768
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,560
Maybe before I die, it'll be breaded up through my 50s.

769
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,680
I'll be married and have matured to the tender period of my life.

770
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,400
Very sweet.

771
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,000
I will wait just really quick before I move on from the ice show.

772
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,440
My favorite thing about the ice show is that it's a lot of I did like Shazam what some of

773
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,440
the songs were because it's not quite like Disney where you recognize the melodies.

774
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,040
I didn't know maybe other people without Shazamming it would know the theme from

775
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,160
Terms of Endearment.

776
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
I didn't know that score.

777
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,280
Oh, wait.

778
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,800
Yes, I think so.

779
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
Wait, that's a pretty famous melody.

780
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,480
Yeah.

781
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,720
I mean, if I'm right, I had a music box of it.

782
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,520
That was one of those.

783
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,440
I was a real music box head when I was a kid, too.

784
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,920
So a lot of the hits that way.

785
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,800
How many music box?

786
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,040
Great.

787
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,520
Like at least a dozen.

788
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
I started collecting.

789
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,840
I would also as soon as I had two or three of something be like,

790
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,680
I'm a collector of this thing now.

791
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,040
I must complete it.

792
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,960
And so every time I saw a music box on sale, no matter what it was, I would be like, yeah,

793
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,520
here we go.

794
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,920
You'd be surprised by what the musical contents were.

795
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,120
It's not like you bought it because it was Terms of Endearment.

796
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,400
No, no, no.

797
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,800
It would very often not have anything to do with it.

798
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,840
Like the outside and the inside.

799
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,560
Yeah, I was like, oh, great.

800
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,640
A sale Dick Tracy music box.

801
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,320
That will be what my allowance goes to.

802
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,080
For sure.

803
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,960
Do you still have that?

804
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,120
I don't know.

805
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,280
My mom contacting me recently and was like, what are you doing with these music boxes?

806
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,720
Get them out of my house.

807
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,960
So I might still have them.

808
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,720
I should I should find out.

809
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,680
It's a general stress for everybody.

810
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,400
The what do I do with my childhood belongings that the pain you're like, how do I?

811
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,880
It's hard for me to make this a priority to solve it, especially for you guys who

812
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,920
grew up across the country.

813
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
I don't like to think about even the stuff I have out here in L.A.

814
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,960
I was a collector, too, Eliza, and still have only partly shaken that habit.

815
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,720
And it's ruining my fucking life.

816
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,720
I have to do something with this stuff.

817
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,020
Yeah.

818
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,440
Yeah, I went through a big action figure phase when I was in high school also.

819
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,440
Every Christmas.

820
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,760
Just give the box away.

821
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,640
Just like, yeah, I wonder what it's like to have a really bad.

822
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,680
Actually, your problem.

823
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
I wonder what that could be like.

824
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,360
But we used to like drive around.

825
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,040
We knew which days the shipments were at different toy stores and we would like

826
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,600
drive around and look for specific short stack action figures.

827
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,840
Which figures were they?

828
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,760
Usually they were.

829
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,000
I mean, this is part of why I was into it.

830
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,760
Usually they were the female characters.

831
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,720
The short stacks would be so they would stack them in a box and, you know,

832
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,680
they would have like this size of a stack of Batman and like this many Wonder Woman's.

833
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,040
So the female characters were worth a little bit more.

834
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,960
So it would be like any any popular thing like Batman or

835
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,720
like whatever female characters in the line of that.

836
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,200
Yes, exactly.

837
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,700
Yeah.

838
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,720
Yeah, I think I had some Earthworm Jim stuff even or no, the tick.

839
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,200
I had the Queen Bee from the tick and a lot of different Star Wars things.

840
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,960
Yeah, it was it was weird.

841
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,360
But, you know, when you don't have anything to do when you're a teenager,

842
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,400
you're like, yeah, sure.

843
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,800
I'll spend Tuesday night driving around looking at the toy sections and Rite Aid and Toys R Us

844
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,520
and see if I can dig up something that feels special.

845
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,320
For sure.

846
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,400
I miss doing that during the pandemic.

847
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,520
Yeah, E-Bang and Amazon, isn't the same thing exactly.

848
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,600
OK, so one more thing about this ice show.

849
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
It's mostly like kind of love ballads and stuff.

850
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,560
But then there's a funny part with Frank Drebben from Naked Gun,

851
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,880
where which they can make it's like any ice skater with a white wig.

852
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,160
And he's like, he's doing like a parody of a romantic pairs figure skating.

853
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,040
But he keeps like falling over and tripping on stuff and pulling curtains down and like

854
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,360
yanking parts of her clothes off and her wig.

855
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,440
And it's good.

856
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,800
It's really funny.

857
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,720
Brought me a lot of joy.

858
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,880
I was like ready to judge it and dislike it.

859
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,680
But it was just very sincere or good ice physical comedy.

860
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,840
The ice clowning section of the show.

861
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

862
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,480
You got to do it because if it's all if it's too serious to

863
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,120
and or too scary with all that Star Trek stuff and those Klingons.

864
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,000
Sure. Sure. Sure.

865
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,000
I mean, a lot of is it a Simpsons joke of like a theme park show called Hooray for Everything?

866
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,920
Like that is what like theme, especially King's Dominion or Hershey Park,

867
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,480
where they're only booking for like the summer season and they have a small cast.

868
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,320
It is a lot of like ages eight to 80 sort of stuff.

869
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,120
So are you getting a lot of Brill building like classics?

870
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,440
At least back in the 90s, you were getting a lot of standards and like early rock songs.

871
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,440
And then like there might be one like 80s rock song.

872
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,200
And that's the like, oh, that's that's to switch it up a little before we get back to to do Ron Ron.

873
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,960
Yeah, exactly.

874
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,320
Yeah, we had a budget and we decided we had to decide which songs to spend it on.

875
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,840
So, yeah.

876
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
Look, if someone can think of a motorcycle thing,

877
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,720
we got a bunch of handlebars from when we did the leader of the pack song last year.

878
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,360
Oh, we still have my boyfriend's back.

879
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,440
Also, great. Can we build something out from that?

880
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:13,920
Perfect.

881
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,320
The I'm curious what was going on musically in this show.

882
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,960
Flintstone Follies.

883
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,160
I would love to know what the rest of Flintstone Follies was.

884
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,080
Huck. I mean, this is and it's not just the Flintstone Tuckleberry Hound Yogi Bear.

885
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,000
Who's Jabberjaw?

886
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,080
Jabberjaw Hong Kong, Fui Hong Kong, Fui Hong Kong, Fui.

887
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Yeah, it's everybody.

888
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,480
I mean, the whole you alluded to it at the beginning, Elizabeth,

889
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
but Hanna Barbera was was part of this park, at least in the early days.

890
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
And I got 35 years.

891
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,120
Hanna Barbera characters were there for 35 years, even after Paramount, they stuck around.

892
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,200
Why is some of us?

893
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,240
I'll be scooby doo and a convert got a Corvette.

894
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,520
Yeah, this is my favorite.

895
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,840
Yeah, I'm like luxury car.

896
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,640
Scooby Doo's posing next to it just like behind a building,

897
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,320
just like a place you'd go sneak off and smoke cigarettes and with a license plate, KD Scoob.

898
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,540
Yeah.

899
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,760
And my favorite photo in Hanna Barbera world is here's the gang, here's Scooby and Barney

900
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,400
Rubble and Fred Flintstone and a really strange flattened Yogi Bear.

901
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,320
Yeah, his head is too small.

902
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,400
That's not the proportions of I mean, he looks like a rock landed on his head and

903
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,680
crushed it down by.

904
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,320
Well, I mean, hanging out with the Flintstones, who knows, right?

905
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,920
You know what you're getting into.

906
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,520
I have I had framed pictures where my parents have had framed pictures.

907
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,040
They might have switched them out of me at different ages, one with

908
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,880
Fred Flintstone and one with quick drama grow.

909
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,120
And I believe the quick drama grow was partly because the friend that I had gone to

910
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,840
Kingsden and in with her brother was working there.

911
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,320
Her teenage brother was working there as quick drama grow.

912
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,320
So I remember talking to a guy in a suit and being like, hey, or no, I think maybe

913
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,880
she wasn't with me.

914
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,880
I just knew it because I remember going up to the some teenager in one of these suits

915
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,080
being like, are you are you Sally's brother?

916
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,320
I know her.

917
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,600
And the guy was like, yes, I can't, but I can't talk.

918
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,960
But stop.

919
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,080
He was doing a lot of shrugging and a lot of like trying to communicate no to me.

920
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:43,040
That's the theme park celebrity is a weird fleeting like it's the biggest kind of the

921
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,400
most accessible kind of celebrity when you're 12 and yet completely meaningless in the

922
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,360
broader spectrum.

923
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:56,080
And there was some local celebrity crossover in that there was a I believe Q 94, which was

924
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:03,280
the big, you know, pop music radio station booth at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower at

925
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,000
Kingston Minion.

926
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,640
So sometimes they would be broadcasting live from Kingston Minion.

927
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,600
And so when you're walking around, you can be like, whoa, that is a radio DJ.

928
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,960
Oh, my gosh.

929
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,400
What is this?

930
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,520
Hollywood?

931
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,160
Come on.

932
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,480
I bet he's he could see me and is probably talking about me eating these warheads outside

933
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,680
staring through the glass.

934
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,440
What are you showing us here, Jason?

935
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,560
OK, so this photo of a bunch of Hanna Barbera characters, you know, the whole gang, this

936
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,480
yogi looks pretty good.

937
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,680
Scooby looks like he has hives on his face.

938
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,640
But he's like, yeah, he has an infection.

939
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,440
He's like, be red.

940
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,400
I just remember as a kid, like this photo was on all the promotional stuff.

941
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,120
And I feel like I stared at this photo like I know this photo better than pictures of

942
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,720
extended family members.

943
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
I loved this so much.

944
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,640
And this might be a good time for us to talk about, because I cannot state how big this

945
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,800
park loomed in my mind as a child.

946
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,240
Like I live three hours away.

947
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,840
I checked the drive from my childhood home to Kingston Minion was just over three hours.

948
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,960
So it felt far enough away that was an event when we were going.

949
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,400
But it was close enough.

950
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,120
You could drive to it.

951
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,880
You didn't have to fly to it like Disney World.

952
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,480
Would you stay overnight there?

953
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,680
Yeah, we would stay overnight and usually make it a few day trip of a couple nights

954
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,920
at the and I found this.

955
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,120
I'm so glad I found it.

956
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,280
The best Western King's Quarters Motel just on the other side of the parking lot.

957
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,160
I am so was so excited to learn that not only is it still standing, the pictures from

958
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,440
the last few years show that it has not changed very much for better or worse.

959
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,160
Besides, I think it's a Wyndham now, but they had an arcade, they had shuffleboard.

960
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,400
It probably goes without saying I was a big time shuffleboard kid.

961
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,000
I mean, it does.

962
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,080
And yet I'm glad you said it.

963
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,800
So I was so thrilled to have an arcade and the shuffleboard and you got on a shuttle bus

964
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,680
that would take you right to the entrance of the park.

965
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,240
I believe Eliza, the campground, I think was adjacent to the hotel or was in the

966
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,200
neck of the woods of the hotel.

967
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,120
The King's Dominion was the home to one of my favorite places in the whole wide world.

968
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,320
Yogi's Cave.

969
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,240
Yes.

970
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,080
Let me try and share this picture.

971
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,720
This is what would greet you.

972
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,560
This guy right here, Yogi himself is outside fishing and unfortunately, it seems like all

973
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,320
he ever catches is a boot.

974
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,720
I believe.

975
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,440
Yeah, just up and down with that boot.

976
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,800
Up and down with the boot.

977
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,880
But yeah, Scott and Mike, I sent you a link.

978
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,160
There is a walkthrough video online of Yogi's Cave.

979
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,720
Yeah, if you want to share that.

980
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,800
Or we find out it's 35 minutes long.

981
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,840
I wish it was.

982
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,800
I could do an hour on Yogi's Cave.

983
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,520
Eliza, it's good that you're here or else I would just be telling my memories of this

984
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,280
park and telling them to shut up.

985
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,680
Is there anything particular you'd like?

986
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,040
Are we just going to enjoy this?

987
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,080
I honestly would rather see you playing shuffleboard as a youth.

988
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,560
So it's just like we're walking through Yogi's Cave here and it looks like it's fake rocks,

989
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,680
which we love on the show.

990
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,120
And there's families and there's like hieroglyphics in the cave.

991
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,320
Yeah, how he evolved and there's Yogi footprints.

992
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,360
So you could be like, I'm going to walk exactly on his footprints.

993
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,440
There's gems in the wall.

994
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,520
Did Yogi find gems on the cartoon ever?

995
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,000
Wasn't he just looking to steal someone's lunch?

996
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,160
This is just where he crashes, you know, swear him and his friends.

997
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,040
He could have been rich.

998
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,840
He actually could have been rich.

999
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,160
Yeah.

1000
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,560
I don't know.

1001
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,200
I mean, it's it also might have gotten ugly.

1002
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,760
Those do appear to be uncut gems.

1003
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,760
Oh, no.

1004
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,480
Probably just as well.

1005
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,640
So wait, Yogi then is Sandler in this metaphor?

1006
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,040
Well, he's he is the calmer version.

1007
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,640
He didn't go down that path.

1008
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,960
There are animatronic frogs in this too.

1009
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,160
So many animatronics.

1010
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,200
You can stop it, Mike, because Yogi is not actually in the cave, really.

1011
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
He's outside kind of greeting you.

1012
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,520
Those frogs move.

1013
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,800
There are more frogs.

1014
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,000
More frogs.

1015
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,520
Boo Boo is conducting them.

1016
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:54,800
Is he?

1017
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,440
Catch that.

1018
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,720
It's really quick.

1019
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,040
Yeah.

1020
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,920
Are they all playing?

1021
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,760
They're all sharing one big harmonica.

1022
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,600
They're all sharing a big harmonica.

1023
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,600
This is not actual.

1024
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,320
This is like extended Yogi Bear verse because this never appeared in any cartoon.

1025
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,720
There was never like his magical cave that was huge.

1026
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,880
He was just like a bum that would run around and terrorize the ranger.

1027
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,280
Right?

1028
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,400
Like there was never anything.

1029
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,120
But that's what they did with the E.T.'s ride.

1030
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,160
That's true.

1031
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,760
Yes, not in the original source material.

1032
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,120
I mean, yeah, in a way, I guess that's kind of what you want is to expand the universe.

1033
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,160
Show us more.

1034
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,840
Show us more.

1035
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,120
You show us more.

1036
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,640
This is also this.

1037
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,520
I watched an interview with the former head of King's Dominion and he described this place

1038
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,800
as a tilt house because it's built on a very slight angle.

1039
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,360
So you are off kilter the whole time.

1040
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:43,920
You're leaning.

1041
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,280
Yeah.

1042
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,640
And it's just a walk there.

1043
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,640
And I would just go in the this was one of the first rides where I was just go through

1044
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,080
the entrance, go through the whole thing out the exit, wave to my family and go right back

1045
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,400
into the entrance just again and again.

1046
00:51:59,520 --> 00:51:59,840
Why?

1047
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,360
I just loved it.

1048
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,280
I just loved I loved the music.

1049
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,520
I love the waterfalls and the gems.

1050
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,080
It was just like it was so great.

1051
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,440
Were you a big Yogi Bear fan in addition to this?

1052
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,760
I think everyone probably watched the cartoons and had some affection for Yogi and Boo Boo.

1053
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,520
But were you particularly big Yogi fan or was it just the actual cave itself that

1054
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,360
kept you coming back for more?

1055
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,400
I liked I liked all the Hanna Barbera cartoons.

1056
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,360
I mean, heavily syndicated when we were all growing up.

1057
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:33,440
So like it was very excited to just go into a character's house, I guess.

1058
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,440
And also this is likely an early exposure to like the theme park smells like I was very

1059
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,160
cold.

1060
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,200
The water smells like I was almost I was about to say with that waterfall part,

1061
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,600
I would remember you would get like a little mist from that.

1062
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,800
So when it was really, really hot, that was a whole reason to go through that alone.

1063
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,960
Just the cooling waterfall mist.

1064
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,680
Going into the character's house, I will say now that brought up a memory of

1065
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,520
that being like an obsessive thought I had as a kid.

1066
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,200
And I didn't have to because we went to Florida, we went to Disney World and they had like Mickey's

1067
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,920
Birthday Land, which had a little Mickey's house, but it wasn't Toontown, which I would read about.

1068
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,160
And I thought, of course, I'll never go there.

1069
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,520
We don't go to California.

1070
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,760
So I was like obsessively thinking like you're going to go into Goofy's house.

1071
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,280
I love Goofy.

1072
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,720
I'd love to go in his house.

1073
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,240
I want to see where his bed looks like.

1074
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,560
Yeah, Disney cribs.

1075
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,040
Yeah.

1076
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,760
Yeah.

1077
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,260
Yes.

1078
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,240
So I get that.

1079
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,120
So it was Yogi.

1080
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,400
It was like Yogi's crib.

1081
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,360
Yeah.

1082
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:34,960
Yeah.

1083
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,000
And Boo Boo was there.

1084
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,520
There was a couple of generic bears just kind of around too, just so they could kind of pat it out.

1085
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:48,000
But I think I just like the off kilter feeling and the yeah, just seeing some of the Hanna

1086
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,040
Barbera characters.

1087
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,440
And it's called a tilt house.

1088
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,400
That's what he called it.

1089
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,080
I'd never heard the term before.

1090
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,320
I think like fun house kind of.

1091
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,320
We just heard the term madhouse for the first time on the Europe episodes, which is like a whole

1092
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:11,360
when it, what was it described as when like the walls kind of spin and keep where you are stationary.

1093
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,240
Yeah.

1094
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,320
I'm wondering if tilt house and madhouse.

1095
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,240
I like the house genre is something we need to investigate more.

1096
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:18,480
Yeah.

1097
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,200
For sure.

1098
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,480
So like when you would see yourself walking, when you'd see people inside, when you were outside

1099
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,240
and you're getting ready to walk into it, they all looked tilted because they were

1100
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,840
tilting to like keep themselves.

1101
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:33,760
Right.

1102
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,560
Balanced.

1103
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,200
So it had kind of a like, oh, like mess with your equilibrium.

1104
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,400
Yeah.

1105
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,720
Yeah.

1106
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,360
Which was fun.

1107
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,280
And that was great.

1108
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,800
This is like in camera effects.

1109
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:45,760
Yeah.

1110
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,520
And they, I think the very first time I went, I was super like kindergarten young and

1111
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,160
would have been, we might've gone once right before Paramount took over

1112
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,720
and then Paramount took over.

1113
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,600
And that to me, it just, in my mind, it just like upped the game because

1114
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,800
I started to know like movies, studio, like I was like, oh, Disney is movies.

1115
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,000
Universal is movies.

1116
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,840
Paramount is movies too.

1117
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,960
So then when you get Hanna Barth characters, yeah, it's legit.

1118
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,640
So then I became a weird little kid who didn't want to just

1119
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,960
tell all its relatives about Yogi's cave.

1120
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,440
He wanted to tell them about the days of thunder simulator attraction.

1121
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,520
You might remember days of thunder, the 1990 Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman.

1122
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,880
Wait, that's where that was?

1123
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,880
I definitely wrote that.

1124
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,440
Oh yeah.

1125
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,160
I remember when that was new and it was like a big fucking deal.

1126
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,400
And yeah, it was all the radio commercials were like days of thunder.

1127
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:42,720
Yeah.

1128
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,360
Yeah.

1129
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:43,860
Yes.

1130
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,480
So you were excited about that just as much as you were about Yogi's cave.

1131
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,400
Days of thunder and Yogi's cave.

1132
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,480
And I really liked the motel, even though we would constantly be switching rooms

1133
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,840
because my mom would be like, we asked for non-smoking.

1134
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,200
There's ashes.

1135
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,400
There's a full ashtray that smells like cigarettes in here.

1136
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,440
You're in Virginia.

1137
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,320
Yeah.

1138
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,360
That's what I...

1139
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,520
Well, the funniest one we had, we checked in once and we're like, the floor is...

1140
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,560
Has popcorn on it.

1141
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,120
What's up?

1142
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,320
Did you not want it like that?

1143
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,680
Did you not want a popcorn room?

1144
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,080
Okay.

1145
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,960
Well, specify.

1146
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,800
Just in a bag or on a shelf or I don't know what you were expecting.

1147
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,520
Yeah.

1148
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,440
Virginia, you're going to have smoking sections everywhere.

1149
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,240
When I was a kid also, we would have more than once.

1150
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,000
Multiple times I had field trips to the Philip Morris plant and you would get to tour and see them.

1151
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,400
Yeah.

1152
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,680
See them making those.

1153
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,440
And then you would get, when you left, every kid would get this big pen

1154
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,280
that has all the names of the brands around it.

1155
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,800
So it'd be like medicine and hedges.

1156
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,440
Marlboro.

1157
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,080
So everybody's house had tons of these huge oversized novelty pens with cigarettes.

1158
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,680
And apparently, according to my sister,

1159
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,600
teenagers would actually be given cigarettes as their leaving gifts.

1160
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,240
Great.

1161
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,640
Wow.

1162
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,140
Wow.

1163
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,400
We should have done this as a topic for today's episode.

1164
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
That's a themed experience.

1165
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Morris plant tour.

1166
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,800
Yeah.

1167
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,720
You're on a factory floor watching people make cigarettes.

1168
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,280
Wow.

1169
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:13,840
Sure.

1170
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:19,200
But you did ride a little, there was a little tram that they would drive you around in.

1171
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,240
A cigarette tram.

1172
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,000
Wow.

1173
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,040
So that means in Virginia, you could go to the Philip Morris factory tour and then go

1174
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,000
to Bush Gardens and go to the beer brewery tour.

1175
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:31,520
Yeah.

1176
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:31,760
Wow.

1177
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,680
And that would have been on the way too, I believe.

1178
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,560
Well, sort of.

1179
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:36,800
Yeah.

1180
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,960
Not quite, but you definitely could do that in one day.

1181
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,880
Here's your future.

1182
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Cigarettes or beer or both.

1183
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,120
You choose.

1184
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,560
The future is bright.

1185
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,040
Or a shot.

1186
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,320
Or hang out with some Navy guys.

1187
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,760
That is, yeah, that was our full trip.

1188
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,600
We would do a couple days at King's Dominion, a couple days at Bush Gardens,

1189
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,640
and one begrudging day at Colonial Williamsburg.

1190
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,120
Boo.

1191
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,800
Which, I was a nerdy kid.

1192
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,160
I liked history.

1193
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:12,240
But when you grow up in the original colonies, it is a little, it's like, well, it's everywhere.

1194
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,000
It's interesting.

1195
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,880
I like this.

1196
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,560
But it's not a theme park.

1197
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:16,960
No.

1198
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,600
Come on.

1199
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,800
You're not going to compete with Yogi's Cave and Days of Thunder.

1200
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,680
Get out of here.

1201
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,040
Yeah.

1202
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,280
I mean, so you see somebody make a candle and that's the highlight of your day.

1203
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,200
When in the distance, you can see Bush Gardens.

1204
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,520
That would be the thing that would drive me crazy.

1205
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,280
Every time I had to go to Colonial Williamsburg for anything, I'd be like, I can literally see the fun.

1206
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,520
It's that close.

1207
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,120
Why can't we just go do that instead?

1208
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,760
My parents made a lot of, my dad's a filmmaker and so my parents made a bunch of films for

1209
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,240
the Jamestown York Down Foundation.

1210
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,400
When you go to a museum or reenactment place and they're like, this is what it was like.

1211
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,640
Here's the story of Jamestown.

1212
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,840
My dad made those.

1213
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,560
So I had to spend a lot of time there just like hanging out in break rooms,

1214
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,440
watching reenactors drink diet cokes in between their shifts.

1215
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,920
And I was like, wow, if this couldn't, if I, if any kid thought this couldn't get more boring,

1216
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,960
guess what?

1217
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,440
It can.

1218
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,520
Well, for little Scott, I was a history buff.

1219
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:29,760
I talked a long time ago about how I, there was a video that I saw at the Independence

1220
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,040
Hall in Philadelphia and my mom and I liked it so much that we bought it and made my class

1221
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,560
watch it and we returned.

1222
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,920
And it was like, this is from Scott and Mrs. Gairdner.

1223
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,120
And then it's the dullest, most morose, smoky old movie you've ever seen.

1224
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,760
So I would have loved that.

1225
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,480
What did you like about it?

1226
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:54,480
Um, I don't remember now, um, because now I like it because it's weird and sad and morose.

1227
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,920
Why would I have liked it then?

1228
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,000
I think it was like, I think ghosts were involved.

1229
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,160
I think it's like, well, John Adams walking around these grounds where I used to step

1230
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,600
and where I dreamed of democracy.

1231
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,720
Paranormal.

1232
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,560
That's a fun twist on it.

1233
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,560
Yeah, it was probably that ghosts of history appearing to me.

1234
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,880
Yeah, I'll send you a link to one of my parents.

1235
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,560
When somebody sent it to me recently and was like, Hey, here's this thing where I was an

1236
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,680
extra in your parents, um, history movie.

1237
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,200
It's it's streaming for free now.

1238
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,160
And I was like, well, okay.

1239
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:26,400
Yes.

1240
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,720
So it was like period movie.

1241
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,720
It wasn't about like, here's what James sounds like now.

1242
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,720
It was like, here's a full period.

1243
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,480
I think I would have loved this.

1244
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,880
The Skinner family output.

1245
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,680
Yeah, they made one and then they like had to do an update on it.

1246
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:45,120
And then there was at one point they also reenacted the voyage and my dad made a documentary

1247
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,040
about the reenactment of the voyage, which that was more about like, here are some modern

1248
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,400
day sailors on an old ship.

1249
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:51,920
What was it like?

1250
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,000
But my mom has even seen these things independently and she's a teacher.

1251
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,960
She probably she may have shown these things to her students.

1252
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,560
Well, my dad's day job was working for the State Department of Education in Virginia,

1253
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,160
making educational films.

1254
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,160
So they're so probably.

1255
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,660
Wow.

1256
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:08,960
Yeah.

1257
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:15,440
Any like crazy ones, but like not doing drugs or not huffing paint or morals.

1258
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,880
A lot of those, a lot of things about like, here's the new way that we teach math.

1259
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,080
Here's a like, so it would both be like things to show kids and things to show teachers and

1260
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,400
things like about what's happening in schools.

1261
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,240
I was definitely in one about something about like guidance counselors.

1262
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,400
I remember trying to be like a cool kid and being like, what do you even

1263
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,120
what's a guidance counselor even for that kind of stuff?

1264
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,400
It was your idea of what a like what the cool character is in the theme park show.

1265
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,240
I guess you have like, it's like to to really pop and be cool.

1266
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,760
You have to have this.

1267
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,280
The voice has got to go up an octave.

1268
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,680
You need a little attitude.

1269
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,800
That's that's that's that's 80s acting, I think.

1270
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,200
There's not anywhere close to like organic in the moment.

1271
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,040
It's like, hey guys.

1272
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:11,040
Also, there's a lot of crossover between just general child acting and theme park acting.

1273
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,280
That's the same style in many ways.

1274
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,880
That's the bridging the gap like Scooby.

1275
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,800
Yes, it's like it's performing and being confident, but it's not.

1276
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,840
You're not exactly doing Noah Baumbach style.

1277
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,000
Yeah, the very understated Flintstone Follies.

1278
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,120
You know, now that I say that, I'm like, why did I pick him of anyway?

1279
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,000
That basically is theme park acting now that I say it.

1280
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:42,400
I want to see a theme park show about a teenager trying to silently process his emotions about his parents divorce.

1281
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,960
The squid in the whale starring Bam Bam and Pebbles.

1282
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,960
Hey, you're no whale.

1283
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,600
He's a shark.

1284
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,600
So you guys don't like the sad theme park stories I'm getting.

1285
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,240
Oh, I don't know.

1286
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,360
What do you what do you got?

1287
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:03,840
I'm curious.

1288
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,440
We just did action park where a bunch of a ton of people died.

1289
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,280
So we're mired in it right now.

1290
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,280
This is maybe sadder than people dying.

1291
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,200
And also, this is kid rumors.

1292
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,640
I think this actually might have made the news though.

1293
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,360
They had a dolphin show right underneath the shockwave, which was the standup coaster.

1294
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,000
And those dolphins died.

1295
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,600
Those dolphins died because that's not where dolphins are supposed to live.

1296
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,080
Underneath the standup coaster.

1297
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,880
Well, I mean, similarly, there was that we haven't talked about lion country safari,

1298
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,480
a whole like lion drive through lion place that they had.

1299
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,120
And lions don't want to have cars by them or know how to deal with it.

1300
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:55,520
So eventually, like they would just start standing up on the cars and go to sleep on them for a while.

1301
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,120
So then it became a monorail through a grounded monorail through.

1302
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,080
I guess you've done this at some point in time.

1303
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,360
Yeah, I did that monorail.

1304
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,120
And I think I did it once and just hated it.

1305
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,560
And I also I do.

1306
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,840
That is one of the things that every now and then I'm like, where was that?

1307
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,920
Where geographically for the rest of the park was there suddenly a safari?

1308
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,440
I have no idea.

1309
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,280
Yeah, I was trying to remember a lot of these parks.

1310
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,120
These older parks that I went to as kids.

1311
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,040
I I a lot of times I will think back to them.

1312
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,600
And then when I find videos of them, it's like, oh, I was nearly right, but it was reversed.

1313
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,680
It was on the left side of the Eiffel Tower.

1314
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,120
Wasn't on the right side.

1315
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:45,440
Like, for whatever reason, I did remember a lot of the King's Dominion stuff when I found old pictures and videos.

1316
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:52,720
But I whatever for whatever reason, I pictured everything was to the right of the Eiffel Tower.

1317
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,200
And it's like, no, that was a smack in the middle.

1318
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,760
Some stuff was left, some was behind, some was to the right.

1319
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,000
I would guess that's probably that that was the route that you like to take.

1320
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Because for me, if I'm if I'm entering and I'm looking at the Eiffel Tower,

1321
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,240
I think everything is to the left.

1322
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,760
We said the right, right?

1323
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,400
But that would be that's because when I first started going there, that's where Hanna Barbera land was.

1324
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:16,720
Yeah.

1325
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,960
So that would always be where I had had.

1326
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,600
Yeah.

1327
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,560
And then you go through that to get to there is a lot of

1328
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,240
a lot of mountains and rocks.

1329
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,360
Like when you said you liked rocks, there are all of you, I guess.

1330
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,960
They had tons of fake rocks at this place.

1331
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,920
There were three rides.

1332
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,800
They were all inside one mountain, supposedly.

1333
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,720
That was the best.

1334
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,040
The Haunted River Smurf Mountain for a period of time.

1335
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,360
Wow.

1336
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,960
And then I forget the third one.

1337
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,120
Well, it changed around.

1338
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,480
There was Mount Kilimanjaro for a while.

1339
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:56,880
And there was the Time Machine, which I think Mount Kilimanjaro became the Haunted River.

1340
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,960
The Time Machine was one of those ones where it spins around and it sticks you against the wall.

1341
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:01,840
Yeah.

1342
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,400
And so that one didn't the line didn't move very fast for that one.

1343
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,200
And I liked it a lot.

1344
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,440
So I remember being in that line a lot.

1345
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,240
And you would go from being in the line outside to being in the line inside surrounded by all this fake rock,

1346
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,040
which is all absolutely covered by inches and inches of gum.

1347
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:25,440
That was like part of what you did at King's Dominion was stick your gum to the wall by the Time Machine.

1348
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,960
And yeah, before the Smurfs were the Smurfs, they were the Doozers.

1349
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh, yes.

1350
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:42,400
Well, from my opening joke, there was a ride called Land of the Doos, Journey to the Land of the Doos.

1351
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,440
That's D-O-O-Z.

1352
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,960
And it's so confusing because all right, Smurf Mountain, that's the Land of the Doos.

1353
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,840
Is the real Smurfs.

1354
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,160
Doozers, is that like Dooser or like Fraggle Rock?

1355
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,880
No, it is not.

1356
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,600
Oh, they were just weirdo skin people.

1357
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,160
They were just these weird little like goblins.

1358
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,920
Like you want your little things to be fluffy, I think.

1359
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,480
Right.

1360
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,680
Yeah, that keeps them up.

1361
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,000
This was not that bad.

1362
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,320
They were not.

1363
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,600
Yeah, like weird little.

1364
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,040
I was describing them to my wife as like little Ziggy's.

1365
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,440
It's a whole race of Ziggy's.

1366
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:13,920
Yeah, they didn't even have like.

1367
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,440
And a little more holbous than Ziggy.

1368
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,640
Yeah, because they were all bald too, right?

1369
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,280
They were.

1370
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:19,760
Yeah.

1371
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,720
Yeah, I think so.

1372
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,480
Like pretty hairless for the most part.

1373
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,720
And they were like weird hats and it looks like wigs essentially.

1374
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:34,880
But the point of the Doozers is that they are a tribe of creatures who live beneath the surface

1375
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,360
of the earth and they make the world work.

1376
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,320
So they crank big gears that make the world turn.

1377
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,120
They push up plants, which makes them grow.

1378
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,680
They die in the Red Sea.

1379
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,000
They manufacture water and air.

1380
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,840
They clean the Statue of Liberty's feet, which are not actually underground,

1381
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,040
which was a surprise to me when I found that out.

1382
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,400
Wait, I have a shiny thumbnail of that.

1383
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,520
They're like they're putting like nail polish on it.

1384
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,800
Do you have that available?

1385
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,080
I didn't see that.

1386
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,720
Pull that up.

1387
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,120
Hang on.

1388
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,720
I'm not into, remember, I'm not into foot stuff or anything.

1389
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,920
I just wanted to see this picture.

1390
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,840
Yeah, why are you so voracious?

1391
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,760
You're making me do work to see these feet.

1392
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,000
Oh, yeah, I did not see that.

1393
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,040
That's weird.

1394
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,720
Yeah, wait, the feet.

1395
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,080
Well, they stole the feet.

1396
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,800
They stole the fireman.

1397
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,160
They're foot freaks.

1398
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:30,660
Yeah.

1399
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,760
When you're that little, I mean, this is combining several fetishes, I think.

1400
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,120
Yeah, there are like a couple of them in the background jerking off on the feet.

1401
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,160
So at least there's acceptance.

1402
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,240
Yeah, this.

1403
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,240
So they're the proletariat is what we're saying.

1404
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,960
And forced to live underground in poor conditions and they

1405
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:58,400
don't individually get credit in the way that Professor Back and Forth does.

1406
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,840
Well, they run old faithful probably for no money.

1407
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,600
Maybe they get tossed a yogi gem every once in a while.

1408
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,920
How much can you do with that?

1409
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,200
Yeah.

1410
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,920
So yeah, when this became the I'd never like the Smurfs.

1411
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,880
So when that ride became the Smurf ride, I was like, oh,

1412
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,520
so the bad ride became the worst ride.

1413
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,080
No, thanks.

1414
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:21,940
Yeah.

1415
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:31,280
Oh, this, by the way, is some sort of design card ride design for one of the things that was

1416
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,640
at some point in that mountain.

1417
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,080
It was like a journey through.

1418
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,280
Atlantis?

1419
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,240
Early Earth.

1420
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,200
Yeah, supposedly.

1421
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,560
That's amazing.

1422
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,880
Yeah, you're showing us a real nice framed art, like concept art here.

1423
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,240
That's a well, it's a shitty frame and it doesn't.

1424
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,280
I put it in there myself.

1425
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,080
But yeah, where does that come from?

1426
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,600
How did you get your eBay?

1427
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,880
So like, it might not be real, but I think it looks cool either way.

1428
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,000
So I'm putting that up.

1429
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yes, you have delved into like Kings Dominion Merchant History.

1430
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,500
Wow.

1431
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,880
Yeah, I'm not wearing my I have a little necklace that has

1432
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,560
you remember those spoons that you would get places?

1433
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,280
They're like your novelty souvenir spoon.

1434
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,800
You know what I'm talking about?

1435
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,760
I know what you're talking about.

1436
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,480
Yeah.

1437
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,080
So on the top of those, the cheap ones, it would just kind of have a little stuck on button

1438
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,240
that was like that would say whatever it was.

1439
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,920
And they would also sometimes make jewelry out of those stuck on buttons.

1440
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,240
I'm taking a long way around here, but it's how I thought of it.

1441
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,240
I've got a necklace, a Kings Dominion necklace also that has the Eiffel Tower.

1442
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,000
It says Kings Dominion, and it's so teeny tiny that people can't tell what it is.

1443
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,120
So they're like, oh, nice necklace.

1444
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,040
I'm like, well, it's from a gift shop and it costs three dollars.

1445
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,920
And I'm a real freakazoid to be wearing this at a fancy party.

1446
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,400
That's cool.

1447
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,040
Yeah, I know.

1448
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:53,360
Yes.

1449
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,400
No freakazoid here.

1450
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,880
Can I get your thoughts on this current eBay item for sale?

1451
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,640
It's a little frog.

1452
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,560
Oh, I like him.

1453
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,480
Magnet frog that you can hang up.

1454
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,200
Yeah.

1455
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,400
How else?

1456
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,360
Kings Dominion.

1457
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,640
Are you bidding on that, Jason?

1458
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,640
No, I thought about it.

1459
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,840
I don't know what I'd do with it.

1460
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,480
I guess you're supposed to hang them on a doorknob.

1461
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,120
I kind of remember these being like souvenir things.

1462
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,040
So you would hang them on a doorknob and then you get a little bit happier all the time.

1463
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,080
Anything that can do that.

1464
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:29,120
I mean, so here's my Loch Ness Monster hat since this is a visual podcast now.

1465
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,440
What's Loch Ness Monster from?

1466
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,480
That's from Busch Gardens.

1467
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,040
That's the big coaster at Busch Gardens.

1468
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,760
Oh, gotcha.

1469
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,280
And I'm trying to see if I have this one other thing I've got to.

1470
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,320
Oh, yeah.

1471
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,560
It's the wrong Busch Gardens, but it's a Busch Gardens Tampa, Florida.

1472
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,040
A big like platter from Tampa.

1473
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:50,580
Yeah.

1474
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,640
Tip of the iceberg.

1475
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,720
I got a lot of this junk because I'm like, especially now, like,

1476
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,320
whatever will make me happy.

1477
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,120
And the theme parks of my childhood are what make me happy.

1478
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:07,040
When I was a little kid, I was just so obsessed with theme parks and no one in my family liked them.

1479
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:12,320
So I remember my school lunchbox was a Walt Disney World lunchbox.

1480
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,960
And I had never been, but I was just like, this is the dream.

1481
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,560
I would collect pamphlets from different theme parks and just like, look through,

1482
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,160
like lay them out and look through them.

1483
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,680
Be like, someday Hershey Park, super duper looper.

1484
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,760
I don't know what you feel like.

1485
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:33,520
Have you made it to all the ones you wish to have made it to or are there ones that have eluded you?

1486
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Yeah, I think so, because also once so many of them transitioned to Six Flags,

1487
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,120
I was like, not as excited.

1488
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,720
I like a standalone place.

1489
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:54,320
I haven't been to Action Park and that does, that's that that eluded me.

1490
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:59,040
But Knott's Berry Farm, that would be that's a fun one.

1491
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:05,520
Also, I like the ones that have characters and shit that aren't attached to anything.

1492
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,240
So the fact that Knott's Berry Farm, when I was like really little,

1493
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:12,080
I had a comic book of Knott's Berry Farm that was about the Knott's Berry Bears.

1494
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,720
And that was another thing I would sit and read it and be like, man,

1495
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,320
sometimes got to visit these bears.

1496
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,840
Oh, and you probably didn't make it to Berry Tales because they were they've been going

1497
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,560
for a long time. Berry Tales, though, is coming back.

1498
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,920
Yes, but in a weird, suspicious of what it is, aren't you?

1499
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,880
Well, of course, it's a 3D like CGI Berry Tales ride.

1500
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,760
But it's not going to be.

1501
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,920
It picks up the story.

1502
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:48,880
Again, it's another I guess this is quite a genre, the factory of like maybe undervalued,

1503
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,920
you know, like individual personalities are not encouraged.

1504
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,920
There's a lot of like just sad, begotten factories in theme park.

1505
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,960
I guess I'm projecting that they're sad, but I don't know those deuces.

1506
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,840
Of all the theme park factories I've seen, the deuces seem among the most miserable.

1507
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:13,600
Well, Scott, you mentioned sad factories, but it was a poor city safety ordinance that injured a

1508
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,920
young Jason Sheridan. I'm, of course, talking about Nickelodeon Splat City.

1509
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,960
I will share a picture with you guys.

1510
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:28,720
So some background, as we said, Paramount took over ownership of these parks at a certain point,

1511
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,920
and they started adding more and more stuff.

1512
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:37,120
Your Days of Thunder, your Days of Thunder, your Days of Thunder, your Days of Thunder,

1513
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,000
your Wayne's World, your Nickelodeon.

1514
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:46,320
And they added this Nickelodeon play area, which you can all see now.

1515
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,640
It's perfectly safe. I don't see what the issue could have been.

1516
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,440
Was that at the same time that they had it at the Mall of America?

1517
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:04,080
I wasn't because Mall of America has gone back and forth on Nickelodeon and Snoopy, so I'm not

1518
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:12,720
sure on the timing. But this got added by the Hanna-Barbera stuff and its big water play area.

1519
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,920
So somewhere in this maze, it's kind of a little maze you go through and you get blasted with water

1520
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:29,920
from pipes. There was a chain link fence covered in green plastic. If you can picture that sort of

1521
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:35,920
green plant, you would see it like athletic fields and stuff. And I ran by that fence,

1522
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,920
not realizing there was a jagged piece of it sticking out. And it kind of like cut me along

1523
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:52,000
the stomach. Not deep. Not deep. It cut like very fine. Like, Mike, you talked, maybe talked in the

1524
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,480
past the pro wrestling term blading, where someone hides a razor blade and does a very fine cut.

1525
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:05,840
I essentially bladed across my stomach and it caused not a lot. Okay, it wasn't a lot of blood,

1526
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:15,760
but it was just a continuous stream of blood. And I, first off, I had to get out of the water maze.

1527
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,800
So I got blasted with chlorine water a couple times before I could get out. And then I found

1528
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,120
my parents are like, oh yeah, that's not good. And we were like cleaning it up and it would not stop

1529
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:32,720
bleeding. So I had to go to first aid and they use that like liquid bandage on it. And it sealed it

1530
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:38,000
up and it did like heal pretty easily. I didn't have to go to the hospital or anything again,

1531
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,640
but this was like an inch and a half long, like white scar I had on my stomach for years.

1532
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:52,720
Wow. Really? Yeah. That's like Dr. Grant taking the velociraptor claw at the start of like,

1533
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,920
that's where I was basically. Like if an animal was going to kill you, that's where they would

1534
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:04,800
have attacked. Pretty much. Yeah. Was it a warning shot from a lion or anything?

1535
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:12,800
I think I probably started like really detailed, like, okay, so, okay, King's Dominion added an

1536
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,640
additional Nickelodeon area in addition to the existing Nickelodeon stuff. There's a busy world

1537
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:25,920
of Richard's scary cafe next to that is a water. So there's a chain link fence. Like I probably gave

1538
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,600
them the whole step by step. Yeah. It's near Yogi's cave. Have I told, I have told you about Yogi's

1539
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:41,920
cave. Okay. Got it. Ah, yes. The child date talk. Jason, have you checked, is it, you don't need to

1540
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:48,720
do it here, but have you checked, is it completely gone? The scar? I, I, I think it might be gone.

1541
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:58,400
It's hard to tell because I have a hairy belly now as a man. It's hard to see. Well, what do you want me to call it?

1542
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:05,440
I have a hairy belly. So, but for years I had that like white scar. That was always a reminder of King's

1543
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:11,360
Dominion. And otherwise I don't think we had a lot of like, oh, so and so got sick after this ride.

1544
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,560
I don't think we had a lot of like, besides just the general like heat, like, oh, I'm going to go back to

1545
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:24,800
the hotel. Like, I don't remember a lot of like friction at King's Dominion. I lost $20 in a bathroom

1546
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,320
there once. Like I left my wallet in there and I think then I got the wallet back, but it was minus $20.

1547
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:39,920
That was, that was pretty, that's the worst as a kid. That was so much money. Yeah. Yeah. I just recently

1548
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:46,960
remembered when I lost $80 when I was 16 and I remember it was like a bigger crisis than like

1549
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:55,200
anything has been in the last five years. Like nothing in having a baby was as stressful as the 16 year old losing

1550
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:02,720
$80 at the time. Yeah. It was so much money and you're so disappointed in yourself and yeah. Oh yeah.

1551
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:09,840
It's what you run through mentally. You idiot, you stupid idiot and you're ugly too. No, you're

1552
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:17,760
going to date you either. You'll never see that money again. I had an even stupider version of that

1553
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:24,240
happen. Like same about age, like 60 or 80 bucks thought I lost it and it turns out I had just wedged

1554
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:31,440
it in the VHS box that I used to constantly tape the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. And so found it

1555
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:38,000
three months later when I went to reuse that tape again. Well, that's just a treat for you then.

1556
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,920
It was a happy ending, but I was like, why would I shove money in a VHF that is what the, what was

1557
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:52,240
I thinking? You're mad at yourself now. It was just like all of us. Yeah. These are raw memories. I

1558
01:19:52,240 --> 01:20:00,400
just wanted to laugh. You know, I just wanted the money and I just wanted to laugh. To play clips of

1559
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:07,120
hypocrisy, dreaded politician hypocrisy. It can't get worse than this. I said,

1560
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:18,800
the irony. It's a different time. Jason, you brought up something and now I can't, you said the

1561
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:25,440
sweetest words and I can't not go into it now. I figured I teased it because I think it came up just

1562
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:34,080
when we were in conversation about doing this. Oh boy. The sweetest fruit of this paramount takeover.

1563
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:39,360
The outer limits, flight of fear. I'm the most mad I've ever experienced. That I didn't get to experience

1564
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:48,240
a themed Wayne's World area, a Wayne's World roller coaster. Oh my God. The hurler. I'm so delighted

1565
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:54,400
that this existed. And I think what I didn't realize until I watched a commercial with Mike

1566
01:20:54,400 --> 01:21:00,960
Myers himself as Wayne is that this was an entire themed area. That there was the restaurant too.

1567
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:07,280
There's the restaurant with the hockey player and the little speaker booths where Wayne does

1568
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,600
his hijinks. If you did it in person, you got to tell me what was up with Wayne's World.

1569
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:23,440
I was young enough that I knew Wayne's World from TV commercials, but it didn't really track for me.

1570
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:32,080
I didn't really... That was an adult movie. Yeah, it was an adult movie. I may have seen

1571
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,040
Mike Myers because they just showed... So I married an axe murderer on Comedy Central so

1572
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:43,200
much when I was a kid. That's right. Yeah. But yeah, I remember the hurler. I thought it was a funny

1573
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:50,720
name for a roller coaster. It's so good. I love that there was this and that there was a themed

1574
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,880
restaurant to go with it. It looked so perfect. There's also apparently something called the

1575
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:02,800
Rock Shop where it was decorated with huge logos of bands of your nine inch nails and your chili

1576
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:09,680
peppers. And then my favorite thing I discovered about it is that there was, for the opening day,

1577
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:22,640
they had from the cast of the film, Tia Carrera and not Mike Myers or Dana Carvey,

1578
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:33,760
but rather impersonators. Here you are looking at a fake Garth and a fake Wayne who looks like

1579
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,840
one of the Lawrence brothers. I'm not sure if it is. He really resembles him. And then my

1580
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:45,600
favorite thing is fake Wayne riding the hurler with a visibly annoyed Tia Carrera.

1581
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:54,160
So put off by this guy, which you can only... I mean, I just... The point of Wayne,

1582
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,520
Wayne seemed very good natured and sweet, but the way this guy's doing it, even just from the photos,

1583
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:05,360
he seems to be kind of a pest. And just imagine if you're trapped with this guy on a ride and he's

1584
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,400
saying, swing over and over. And you have a bar preventing you from leaving.

1585
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:16,880
And she's not playing Cassandra. She's playing Tia herself. She's not part of the cosplay.

1586
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:22,240
Yeah. She's really from the movie. She deserves better than to be palling around with a...

1587
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:27,840
You don't get the feeling from this photo that she knew that there were going to be impersonators

1588
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:36,720
there. What if she... The worst thing would be if she got on the ride, he was facing the other way.

1589
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:42,240
She's like, oh, did they get Mike to come in costume and then he turns? Oh no.

1590
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,520
He said it wrong. He said, swing. That's not it.

1591
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:57,360
This impersonator sucks. Yeah. It's... He does... While he might not be

1592
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,040
getting the best Wayne attitude across, he is getting the best

1593
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:07,440
King's Dominion goer attitude across. This just looks like every guy who was at King's Dominion

1594
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:16,880
all the time. Oh no. Yeah. Wait, were you there in teen years and wanting to date or avoid dating?

1595
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:22,400
I was there more pre-teen. By the time I was a teenager, I was a punk rap kid. So I

1596
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:28,240
was doing that instead. But when I was 11 and desperately wanted to be a teenager in love,

1597
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:34,320
yes. While there would be teenagers waiting in those zigzaggy lines to go on a ride,

1598
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,680
making out or putting each other's hands in each other's pockets or playing with the

1599
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:46,640
fringe on their fringed t-shirts. I was the weird tubby little 10 year old behind them being like,

1600
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:52,880
yeah, look at how in love they are. Someday it'll be me. Yeah. I hope somebody kisses me

1601
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:59,280
in the line for the grizzly someday. And never happened. Guys, never happened.

1602
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:07,360
Because I always wanted to go on the Matterhorn, which had lap seating. And I'd go like, when I can

1603
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:14,640
date, I'll have a girl of my dreams in my lap. And that'll be romantic and not like just strange

1604
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:20,000
for 20 seconds. Was there like, all right, the place in King's Dominion would be? I don't think

1605
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:27,040
there was a place, but definitely just like the general concept of a teenage boy in a sleeveless

1606
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:36,160
Metallica shirt kissing me up against those steel bars that you're waiting for that made the maze to

1607
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:42,720
get onto the ride. Just like there's an eight year old me going like, let's keep the line moving.

1608
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,120
Come on, we have rides to ride. I'm bleeding from the stomach.

1609
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:56,000
I believe from the stomach, the action theater is closed. I'm not going to get a chance to ride.

1610
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:03,760
Stan Lee's the seventh portal. You know, I'm not in a good mood. Don't make out against

1611
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:11,680
just anything. Might cut you at the stomach. Yeah. There was also a kid rumor that there was someone

1612
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:15,600
whose job it was, I think this might be what I said on Doughboy, someone whose job it was to go

1613
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,080
around at the end of the day every day and hammer the nails back into the grizzly. That was one of

1614
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:26,480
the two wooden coasters. As though if that person wasn't there for their job that day, we're all

1615
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:31,360
going to die. There's just nothing that could be done. It shakes the nails all out of it.

1616
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:37,280
Be like, slept in and didn't go instead of just being there but stoned as usual.

1617
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,680
Yeah. There was also an old west stunt show. That was weird. And that was way before it was

1618
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:48,960
Paramount. There was no movie connection at all, but they were still like, we're going to show you

1619
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:55,360
how people pretend to fall off of stuff. You get the like the whole side of the building falls

1620
01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:03,520
and you land exactly in the window. Not that good. That would have been too complex.

1621
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,720
There was some very odd, the Paramount stuff just got odder and odder over the years. Of course,

1622
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:20,160
the Italian job turbo coaster eventually renamed to the back lot stunt coaster. The one that sticks

1623
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:28,000
out in my mind, we were there the summer it opened. I remember my dad, he rode it himself and I

1624
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,840
waited at the exit and I just thought it took forever. Did something happen? It was just like,

1625
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:40,640
oh no, I just didn't have a watch and I didn't know how long 40 minutes was. The Outer Limits

1626
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:48,160
Flight of Fear, an indoor launch coaster, which I could not get anyone to tell me if it went upside

1627
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:54,400
down as a child, I was scared of going upside down. But this ride almost came up on the Mummy

1628
01:27:54,400 --> 01:28:00,080
Returns episode because it was the first launch coast, indoor launch coaster that used linear

1629
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:06,480
induction motors, which we admitted we do not know how that works, but was kind of historic.

1630
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:13,200
Yeah, very cool. And Premier Rides, the manufacturer would go on to make the Mummy,

1631
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:20,480
Revenge of the Mummy ride. So yeah, Outer Limits is, isn't that pretty old?

1632
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:25,200
That's a weird theming choice. Yeah. I don't know if I've ever seen an episode of the,

1633
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,360
it's like the Twilight Zone. It's like the runner up. Yeah.

1634
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:34,240
There are newer versions of it. I think there was a syndicated,

1635
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:40,480
yes there is, I Google it, a syndicated Canadian version. Okay. Like Hercules and Xena?

1636
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,200
Seemed probably. Something like that. Or Tia Carrera's Relic Hunter?

1637
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:59,120
Yes. Oh hey, came back around. Hmm, strange. I don't know, does that, does that like read those

1638
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:03,520
rides? Is that the, taking a Flight of Fear? Is that the kind of thing that would happen on the

1639
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:10,400
Outer Limits? Well, it was like an Area 51 sort of setup. And actually by making it very generic,

1640
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,040
when Paramount stopped sponsoring stuff and they had to like just rejigger a lot of rides,

1641
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,240
they were just like, ah, just drop the Outer Limits, just called Flight of Fear. Done.

1642
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,520
That one's easy. A lot of the, I was kind of, I kind of want to go back, you know, they didn't

1643
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:30,320
open this season because of COVID, but I kind of want to go back because they, Racer 75 is still

1644
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:37,280
there. Flight of Fear is still there. The Scooby Doo is still there. It is called the Woodstock

1645
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:44,880
Express now because it's all Cedar Fair owned now. So I was surprised how much is still

1646
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:51,200
remaining. What do you think Yogi's Cave is? Well, they renamed it to Treasure Cave at some point,

1647
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,360
even before they stopped the Hanna-Barbera Association. But I think it is-

1648
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,800
I'm not going to say that that doesn't make sense. It does make sense.

1649
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:05,360
Is it the same? Are there still like frogs singing? They just took all their gems out.

1650
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,640
But besides that, it's- Those belong to Yogi.

1651
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,520
The only treasure item in there. They removed that and then-

1652
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:17,680
It might belong to the ground because I think that God Bulldozed it is.

1653
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,360
When was the last time you were in that cave, Jason?

1654
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:28,720
Well, here's what happened was like after we went for a few years, my family joined the Disney

1655
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:33,920
Vacation Club. So as I am a young child going like, we got to go back to King's Dominion.

1656
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:40,640
There's a James Bond ride and Judy Dench is in it and Q's in it. And they're like,

1657
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:46,160
we just joined the- We're not going to a different theme park. We made our choice.

1658
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,640
We're going to Disney World. We made our commitment.

1659
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:54,480
But we get to see actor Desmond Llewellyn portraying you in a theme park, mother.

1660
01:30:55,120 --> 01:31:02,400
Mother, a few years after that, they'll put in a generic Stanley superhero thing that looks like a

1661
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:09,200
reboot ripoff. I've missed all this. Wait, there was a James- It was in that- So that's where

1662
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:14,240
Days of Thunder was and then they did a James Bond thing for a while. Yeah, they would slot in and out

1663
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:20,240
different 3D movies there. And some of them were just those movies that were on a circuit.

1664
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:27,280
That 3D theater, for a brief time, Dave and Buster's had 3D theaters, which is like-

1665
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:35,840
This theater was a slightly nicer 4DX D-Box sort of experience. So you could go to a Dave

1666
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,480
and Buster's and go like, hey, is that the James Bond movie that plays a King's Dominion too?

1667
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,600
And they wouldn't know if it was, but you could ask them.

1668
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,680
Oh yeah. They'd want me to stop talking about some sort of cave in Virginia.

1669
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:57,440
Yeah. Here's a- I have this fun little thing. When you're talking about mashups of the world

1670
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:02,880
of Hollywood and King's Dominion, this one really surprised me. Here's- I'm going to share the

1671
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:10,000
screen and in fact, not show the first frame because that will reveal the Hollywood talent who was-

1672
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,960
Hey, baby.

1673
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:18,160
Well, you saw that. The Hollywood talent hosting this 1986 King's Dominion commercial.

1674
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:24,880
There's just one place where 32.95 gets you a season pass. Good for an entire summer of rides

1675
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:31,520
like Rebel Yell, Whitewater Canyon, even the new Shockwave roller coaster. You actually ride

1676
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,560
standing up and for just a few dollars more take in concerts by the biggest names in rock,

1677
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,800
country, R&D. All this and more.

1678
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:46,000
Yeah. There you go. William H. Macy, chilling for King's Dominion. And I was just-

1679
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,120
I was thinking how with a shot this close of him, I just expect him at the end to

1680
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,920
put a gun in his mouth and splutter blood on the wall.

1681
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:02,800
No, but probably get caught in a frog storm of those magnetic frogs that you were considering.

1682
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,600
Oh yes.

1683
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,240
Oh yeah.

1684
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:05,920
It's raining.

1685
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,360
Yeah, it's raining Velcro frogs.

1686
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:18,400
Yes. Yeah, I had a season pass that was one year I only asked for that for my birthday. So I had

1687
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:23,520
to get it, but my parents still wouldn't drive me there. So I just had it. You would go to JC

1688
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:31,440
Penny's to get it certified or something. So yeah, I was very excited to be a season pass holder

1689
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:31,920
one summer.

1690
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,520
What was your peak? When was it the best for you? What was the-

1691
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,600
Probably when I was like 11. So that would have been like around 90.

1692
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:49,360
Sure. Sure. Right before Paramount. Or wait, are you a punk at that point?

1693
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:53,760
No, I was 11. I was a Girl Scout. So that was when I was camping out there with Girl Scouts.

1694
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,600
Had friends that had parents who would drive us there. Had enough money that I could-

1695
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:08,320
I think that was when I had my season pass. So I could pay for food in there and I had my

1696
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:13,200
little season pass. So that was probably about it. But then yeah, a couple of years later,

1697
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,280
I was just going to Fugazi shows.

1698
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,080
That's right.

1699
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:18,800
Did you reject-

1700
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,920
Who probably didn't like Jimmy Buffett play at King's Dominion.

1701
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,400
No, but I remember when Richard Marks did and I cut out that ad and had that on my

1702
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,960
bulletin board being like, oh man, how do I make this happen with my nine years old amount of money?

1703
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:39,440
How do I get myself to this Richard Marks concert at King's Dominion? What could be better?

1704
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,280
It's all the best things at one time.

1705
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,560
Did you pull it off? Did you go?

1706
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,920
No, absolutely not.

1707
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,040
When was the last time you went?

1708
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:59,600
I think, gosh, I don't think I've been since I was a kid. I've definitely driven past it

1709
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,960
because you can see the Eiffel Tower from the highway and considered it every single time I've

1710
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:12,800
driven past on tour as doing improv or as a standup being like, hey, you guys want to go

1711
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,040
to this theme park that you definitely don't want to go to? No? Okay, never mind.

1712
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,240
The pain of being the only one.

1713
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:27,680
It's a hard wall for a lot of people that they're totally unwilling to cross. I think we found a

1714
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,800
lot of people on the other side of the wall. That's what this podcast is about.

1715
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,000
I did a tour. I was on a show called Totally Biased and then when we got canceled, me and

1716
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,120
the two other female correspondents and writers did a standup tour down to Disney World called

1717
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:50,480
The Greatest Tour on Earth. We did standup shows all the way down. We drove past this

1718
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:55,840
on that and I was like, hey, so maybe, I mean, obviously we like theme parks and they were like,

1719
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:00,720
no, we don't have enough time to do this to go to a show. But further down the road,

1720
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:06,320
we did pass south of the border and we did get off. You guys know about that place, right?

1721
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,840
Wait. Yeah. What is it? Where is it? Is it in the Carolinas?

1722
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:18,480
Yeah, it's the border between South Carolina and North Carolina. South of that border is this place

1723
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:24,480
called South of the Border that's like very racist at this point. I don't know this at all.

1724
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,680
It's just like a lot of those. What is that metal that all those things were made out of like those

1725
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:36,880
mushrooms and everything? Is that tin? Is that aluminum? Whatever it is, just tons of those

1726
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:42,320
statues of different animals wearing sombreros and the main building is shaped like a sombrero

1727
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:50,400
and they have like a reptile attraction and like, I want to say maybe like a massage place

1728
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,360
because it's also a place where like it's a place where truckers could stop, you know, when you're

1729
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,880
just like a weird themed truck stop that became a place that all the kids in my elementary school

1730
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,520
loved and would talk about and have like t-shirts from and I'd never been there before.

1731
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,600
You guys should look this place up. It's nutty. It's real nutty. It's one of those things where

1732
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,560
you see pictures and you're like, I can't believe this exists. How did this ever exist?

1733
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:23,760
And how is it still existing? They should change this. Like robot, like robot animals? No, just

1734
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,160
statues of animals. They're just statues of animals. So you can like take your picture next to them.

1735
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:32,800
So it'd be like, oh, there's a kangaroo in a sombrero. There's a big snail in a sombrero.

1736
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:39,440
Didn't make a lot of sense, but. And a trucker could get a massage there. I believe so. Yeah.

1737
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:46,000
Or you could go like hold some snakes. Fireworks. A few different restaurants. Definitely fireworks.

1738
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,920
We bought fireworks. That's why we stopped. Because that's between the truckers and the fireworks.

1739
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:57,040
That's probably the genesis of it. Because suddenly once you get into South Carolina,

1740
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:04,640
you could buy fireworks. So people would go south of the border and stock up on their fireworks.

1741
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:13,040
On the Wikipedia, I like that in the very functional see also area that it says see also

1742
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:23,120
tourist trap ethnic stereotype. Yeah. Yeah. It's wild. This is a, it was our place. Yeah.

1743
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:30,960
Yeah. I don't remember it depicting any sort of cultural stuff. Like at least it wasn't like

1744
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:39,440
it is acting out any kind of historical thing very badly. It was in my memory, just animals and

1745
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:47,280
sombreros. Still not respectful, but bizarre. Wow. Certainly could have been worse. Yeah. Yeah.

1746
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:53,200
Yeah. And probably was at some point. That's fair. Yeah. I probably saw a toned down version.

1747
01:38:53,200 --> 01:39:00,800
Very fair. Almost undoubtedly. So if you could go, would you be, especially after

1748
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:06,320
all of this, this terrible time and being cooped up for so long, is this anyway, is this on your

1749
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:12,480
list of things to, would you go do this as comfort food? Now would you fit this into

1750
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:17,360
traversing of America? I don't know. I don't know that I would, that I would do Kings Domain.

1751
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:22,640
And cause I think I would probably be too sad at how different it is because of how many times

1752
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:29,200
it's changed hands and rethemed. I would probably do Bush gardens again, cause I know that that's

1753
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:38,800
still the old country. It's still just Italy and Scotland and Germany, Oktoberfest, all that.

1754
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:44,800
Yeah. So you can't, we can't go to any of those places right now. So it would be a little more

1755
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,520
like visiting my childhood that I think Kings Dominion would, I think Kings Dominion would be

1756
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:54,320
like when you see an X and they're just like completely different and you're like, oh,

1757
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,920
Oh, what was, who, who was the person that I was with? It's not you.

1758
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:08,640
Like the volcano, the mountain not being there anymore is like the equivalent of like,

1759
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,520
oh, he lost his hair. Yeah, exactly.

1760
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:18,640
Interesting. What do you do for, what's the big draw if you go to Bush gardens? What's like your,

1761
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:22,640
what do you make a beeline for? Oh, Loch Ness Monster. Loch Ness Monster.

1762
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:28,960
All time favorite roller coaster. Best roller coaster. Does a double loop. You get an indoor

1763
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:33,040
section that does a spiral thing. It's the only indoor coaster that I'm not scared of. And it's

1764
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:37,360
not indoors. Most of it's out. It does a little underwater thing. I have a phobia thing. I don't

1765
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:42,800
know, phobia makes it sound fancy, but I get irrationally scared on indoor coasters that

1766
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,480
something's going to pierce my eyeball. Something's going to like fly out of somebody's pocket or like

1767
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:54,240
a bobby pin. And it could happen just as easily on a regular roller coaster, but like, I guess I

1768
01:40:54,240 --> 01:41:00,640
would see it coming and dodge. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Yeah. That makes sense to me.

1769
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:08,000
Yeah. So, but the Loch Ness Monster is real. And it's a, it's Loch Ness Monster themed. That's great.

1770
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,880
That's, I mean, it's pretty close to a dinosaur, but it's got the urban legend aspect thrown in.

1771
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:18,960
It's very much my shit. It may be where a lot of my shit comes from. It may, that might be the origin

1772
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,960
story. The ride I used to love there though. I mean, it was never better than this, but never

1773
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,000
better than the Loch Ness Monster. But I did really like, even as an adult, cause I did go back to

1774
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:36,960
Busch Gardens more, more recently, the Big Bad Wolf, but it murdered a worker. So they had to take

1775
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:42,560
it away, but that was a great ride. It was like a hanging thing where like, so you're sort of in

1776
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:47,840
almost like a ski basket, like your legs are swinging, but you're seated. Oh, I've seen

1777
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,320
pictures of it. So it's one of those ones where you like lie down and it's not a standing up one.

1778
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:56,560
So it gives you like an extra aspect of the swinging back and forth as you're zooming around.

1779
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:04,400
Oh, my family was a big fan of the Roman Rapids, if you remember that, at Busch Gardens. See,

1780
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:10,080
I hate all water rides, but yeah, that was a pretty exciting one. My mom got so wet on it once she

1781
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,960
walked off the ride, went into the gift shop, bought an entire new set of clothes and changed

1782
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:21,840
into them. Yeah. I remember that there were lots of clothing gift stores around that ride

1783
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:26,160
specifically. I like when you were wet, cause I wouldn't go on it. So I would sit there and wait

1784
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:31,280
for people. And it was like being at the intersection of all these different t-shirt stores. So I think

1785
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:37,360
it probably wasn't just your mom. Jason, did you then put her wet clothes on? So you had double

1786
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:42,720
wet clothes because you love it so much? Jason loves wet clothes after a ride.

1787
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:52,320
Do you? Yeah, he does. That's not a joke. Oh, I hate it so much. That used to be my

1788
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:57,120
online dating profile thing. It would be like, Hey, I like movies and go to the museum. And I

1789
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:02,480
hate the water rides at theme parks. And it would filter out all the guys who were like,

1790
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,920
why you shouldn't, I love them. Or like, what's your problem? Like,

1791
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:13,600
that's not a very nice first line. Yeah. A lot of fellows do that though. And they'll find something

1792
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,440
and they think they're asking you a question about it when really they're poking at it. And it's like,

1793
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,480
you can't tell the difference. Oh, that's, that's, this is sad for you fella. Cause you don't know

1794
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:26,640
what you're doing, but you're being a dick. This is what the dynamic will be like when we date. It'll be great.

1795
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:32,000
I'll challenge you on stuff all the time. Exactly. Exactly. I'll think we're just having a conversation

1796
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:39,680
and you'll feel constantly attacked and defensive. Really like harmless things you tossed off,

1797
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:46,000
not meaning much by it. Yeah. That's like a prevalence to like just Twitter in general.

1798
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:52,320
Yeah. Yeah. Can I fight you all day about something that you don't remember? Yeah. You

1799
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:56,720
tweeted already. And similarly when you're like, I don't like this. They're like, what did you expect?

1800
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:03,920
It's Twitter. Like, yeah, not this. This isn't clearly by me not liking it and telling you about

1801
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:13,280
that. This is not what I expected. Yeah. Twitter, not as fun as Roman Rapids. And as things dominion,

1802
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:19,440
that we could escape to a little fantasy theme park for a little while though. Now we'll segue

1803
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:24,400
into the part where you maybe say your, your Twitter name. But first I will say Eliza Skinner,

1804
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:30,400
you survived podcast the ride. Thanks for being here. Let's exit through the gift shop. Is there

1805
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:37,520
anything you would like to plug? Yeah. My album, Regarding My Lovers. It's 10 tracks of standup

1806
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:46,160
comedy, five tracks of original songs and Earth to Ned on Disney Plus, which I was a head writer for

1807
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:53,200
and I like it a lot. It's very weird. And there have been discussions on Reddit from Disney fans

1808
01:44:53,200 --> 01:45:00,240
saying that there should be a Ned feature at Disney World. So I saw this on a Twitter,

1809
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:05,920
like a theme park, Twitter news place posted this, the idea of this thing, the Monsters Inc. laugh

1810
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:13,360
floor where characters are funny and interact with you. And yes, it may be could stand a refresh and

1811
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:18,320
you've got this new cast of characters. It seems to be really well liked already on Disney Plus.

1812
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:22,800
So that must've been cool to see. Yeah. I mean, except the actual article was like,

1813
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:27,920
I don't know why anyone would want this. This show is garbage, but I found a whole bunch of

1814
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,440
people who want it and I'm like, okay, we didn't need the editorializing.

1815
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:40,480
We have a lot of opinions about different theme park news aggregators and maybe even that one.

1816
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,400
But yeah, it was probably nice to see a picture of the show on your Twitter feed.

1817
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:54,560
Can I ask Eliza this show, so if the audience doesn't know, this is a show,

1818
01:45:54,560 --> 01:46:01,440
Henson show with a very cool puppet, many puppets. You said you liked eating around animatronics.

1819
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:05,360
Did you get to eat around these puppets and feel the same feeling?

1820
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:09,520
I did, but it wasn't the same feeling because they're better than animatronics. Because part

1821
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:15,600
of the thing with the animatronics is the reassuring robotic clicking, you know, like the head can only

1822
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:21,040
go this far and only go that far. It's almost the same feeling that you get, like when you have to

1823
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:25,680
put a baby to sleep and so you drive around the block with them and they're like, so it's a little

1824
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:31,600
bit of motion and excitement, but controlled, very controlled. My puppets, our puppets,

1825
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,920
they can do, well, there's a lot they can't do actually. I was going to say they can do anything,

1826
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:43,440
but that's not true. One of them doesn't even have legs, but they can definitely move a lot more.

1827
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:48,080
I did take lunch in the studio when it was cold and quiet by myself frequently.

1828
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,520
Just a lifeless mid sitting there.

1829
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,000
Yeah.

1830
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,720
Claude's everywhere scattered about.

1831
01:46:54,720 --> 01:47:02,480
Oh no, the Claude's always wrapped very carefully in their satin and like we had Claude Wranglers who

1832
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:06,160
I would be like, hey, can I see a Claude? They'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, which one?

1833
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:13,040
Which one? Hold on. I can get one for you. I don't know if we can let you hold it.

1834
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:18,960
I'm like, come on. And then they started trusting me eventually. But I took a lot of pictures of the

1835
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,600
different Claude outfits.

1836
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,640
Delicate. What do you think it says? A dews?

1837
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:29,440
Yeah. I mean, they were everything. It was weird. We had to book a lot of time with each guest

1838
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:34,240
because partly because the puppeteers have to take a rest every 15 minutes,

1839
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:37,760
because they've got their arms up or they're being smushed into some weird position.

1840
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,560
But also partly because sometimes the puppets would break and we would have to send somebody

1841
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:48,000
up with a screwdriver and poke around in Ned's mouth or like swap his head out for one of the

1842
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,920
other heads and keep on going. Yeah. So pretty much his name is covenant.

1843
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,800
So you can't reach out to people like, hey, can you hang for an hour?

1844
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,080
So like, you gotta be ready for some puppet repairs.

1845
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:03,920
Yeah, exactly. Like it might not happen and then you have a short day, but

1846
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,360
what kind of sandwiches do you want? Well, we'll have treats for you.

1847
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:15,520
All of our guests were really great because everybody's just excited to hang out with some

1848
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,240
puppets. Yeah. You know, wouldn't be.

1849
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:23,040
Talk to them and engage with them. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1850
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:27,840
yeah, everybody check that out on Disney Plus and other people have been on the show. Nick Weigert,

1851
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:33,680
Jordan Morris, great, great staff you had there. So yeah, congrats on Earth to Ned.

1852
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:40,880

I'll just say that I have a lot more questions about Jason and shuffleboard, but I will save

1856
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,080
them for a later time. That's fine. I'm sure it'll come up again.
