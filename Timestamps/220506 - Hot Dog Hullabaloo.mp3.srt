00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000

It's the Hot Dog Hula Baloo on Podcast The Wrap.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,240
Welcome to a very special Podcast The Ride that is sure to change the face of hot dog

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,080
related entertainment forever.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,200
This ladies and gentlemen is the Podcast The Ride Hot Dog Hula Baloo.

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,320
Hello everyone, I'm Scott Gardner joined by fellow Hula Balooers, Mike Carlson, hi.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,240
I am a Hula Balooer, hello.

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, this is the debut of a new exciting event.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,400
I think I said yesterday a new PTR franchise.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
I think so, yeah.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I feel good about it.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I feel good about it.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,600
There's possibilities and it's certainly open ended because we didn't, I mean we'll talk

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,080
about how the rules that we set made it so we can do more of these quite readily, maybe

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,840
leading up to some big grand championship.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,520
Well we'll explain what we're doing here exactly, but first a guy who's really going to be thriving

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,200
today, his name is Jason Sheridan.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Noblest of all dogs is the hot dog.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,520
It feeds the hand that bites it.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,160
That's a quote from Dr. Lawrence J. Peter that kept coming up as I searched the Google,

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,240
I googled the phrase hot dog quotes.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Should you do it again?

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,200
No, no, the ambulance you just heard is waiting for us because we've recently completed hot

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,600
dog eating day and we just wanted to make sure.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
They're circling the block.

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,200
Yeah, yeah, they've got the word and if you need us, we know you guys ate more hot dogs

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,440
and in two of our cases had more hot dogs in a day than you've had in two years.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,040
Yeah, the streets have been cleared, the police have cleared the streets just in case

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,920
we need to be beautiful quote.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,560
Yeah, I have another one too that kept coming out.

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Oh, great.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,960
So I always look for a hot dog wherever I go.

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,600
That's Martha Stewart said that on her episode about hot dogs.

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Wow.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,920
Our shows wherever she goes, wherever she goes and he just out on a walk in the ocean.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,820
Well let's not forget the famous line from the start of the Patty Duke show, the show

42
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,980
that aired 70 years ago.

43
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,620
A hot dog makes her lose control and who can't relate to that?

44
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,940
Yes, you know, I mean, because that could have any number of meanings.

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,060
That's what's in the theme song of the show.

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,020
It's like a hot dog makes you lose control.

47
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,260
It's about cuz identical cousins.

48
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
She was.

49
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,260
Yeah.

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,260
But yeah, for some reason, I don't know.

51
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,340
I don't think there was a common thing in the show where she would just eat hot dogs

52
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,980
like she was Jughead or something, but that's in the last in the song.

53
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
I know that.

54
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,860
Nobody correct me.

55
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,260
I know it's in there.

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
That's a fact.

57
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,900
Something tells me that the Patty Duke heads are not so, there's not so many of them out

58
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,180
in the fan base, but you never know.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,900
There's got to be one or two.

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,380
Probably hot.

61
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,100
I think we're all going to lose control due to hot dogs today.

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,060
And let me just quickly explain what is going on.

63
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,620
What is the hot dog hullabaloo?

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,500
Yesterday, as we record this, the three of us, Mike, Jason and I went to the Disneyland

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:02,900
Resort with one very specific goal to consume every hot dog available on the property and

66
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,620
the entire resort.

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,300
We're talking Disneyland, California Adventure, downtown Disney, the hotels anywhere where

68
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,340
hot dogs are available.

69
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,340
We tried every variety of hot dog.

70
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,760
I mean, maybe not every, you know, we had some rules.

71
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,360
We had to like, you know, save ourselves in certain ways, but we certainly went to every

72
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,840
location where hot dogs are available.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:34,440
We split them all into three so as to for it to still be a tasting situation, a sampling

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
situation.

75
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,960
So we three grown men kept going to places, cutting up hot dogs into three parts.

76
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Right.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
There was a lot of high jinks yesterday.

78
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
Yeah, definitely.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,280
Very high jinky day, I guess, bound to happen with what we're trying to do here.

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,080
But all of this in service of trying to figure out if you go to Disneyland with a hankering

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
for hot dogs.

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Yeah.

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,200
If you want a hot dog to make you lose control, what hot dog will make you lose control?

84
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,240
What's going to help you get your patty Duke on?

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,480
And we're going to determine that today.

86
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,960
We don't know the answer right now, but by the end of this episode, we will determine

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
what we are declaring the best hot dog at the Disneyland Resort.

88
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
Yeah, very exciting.

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,720
I, yeah, I it's interesting yesterday.

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,400
I went in with no expectations and the day was both easier and a little harder than I

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
expected.

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,760
And I don't want to say exactly why yet, but it'll come out during the.

93
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,240
I know what you mean.

94
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Yes, I think.

95
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,560
Yeah, there's the shape of it played out differently for me, I guess, primarily being that I did

96
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,240
not vomit or diarrhea.

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,320
Yes, either of those happen.

98
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
I guess none of us did.

99
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,360
I think, although I don't know how the evenings went for you.

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,920
I will reveal here now exclusively.

101
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,440
I did not diarrhea in the last 12 hours.

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,000
Jason, would you like to give us an exclusive?

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,320
I have not vomited or diarrhea per se.

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Per se.

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,120
We're a dicey territory.

106
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,200
I thought we would talk about our diarrhea later, but I guess we're going to start it

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
off hot on this.

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I know.

109
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Look, I'm not at 100 percent.

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,360
No, nor am I.

111
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
I don't feel good.

112
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,400
I feel a little logy.

113
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,480
This was exacerbated by the fact that I kind of I stated.

114
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,200
Let me explain one of my hijinks.

115
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,920
Jane found this T-shirt for me at a thrift store that just says the phrase hot dog mountain.

116
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,040
We don't know what it I mean to look up, look it up and see if I can find anything about

117
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
it.

118
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,520
I'm assuming it's a snowboarding thing or something like that, because I think you can

119
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,280
go hot dog or hot regardless.

120
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,240
So I was like, well, I'm going to wear hot dog mountain.

121
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh, wait, I'm looking at Google.

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
What is it?

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
And there's somebody in the shirt.

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh, good.

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I believe this is an urban outfitters.

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,080
It does seem like the official urban outfitters.

127
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
OK, yeah.

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,600
So you were getting a sale at a Goodwill of of this hot dog mountain.

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,120
And it's very comfortable.

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,280
And I am also wearing it today because I stayed over at Jane's.

131
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,280
It did not dawn on me until this morning that like, oh, I don't have another shirt and I

132
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
have to go.

133
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Like, yeah, I know I did.

134
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,680
As we started, it occurred to me the shirt we were looking at all day yesterday about

135
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
hot dogs.

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,080
Unfortunately, like it was just a black t-shirt yesterday and I came in wearing a black t-shirt

137
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
today.

138
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,760
Like no one would have paid any mind.

139
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,440
I got a million black t-shirts, you know, but it says hot dog mountain.

140
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
Like I don't have two of these.

141
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
I wouldn't look.

142
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,280
I wouldn't put a patch to have multiple shirts that say hot dog mountain on them.

143
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Yeah.

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,120
I mean, I could have gone home and thrown it in the wash and put it back on instead.

145
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,880
The reality is.

146
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,040
So you made the walk of shame over the hot dog walk of shame.

147
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Yeah.

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
I think you're right.

149
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,720
Also in your first guess that I'm because I'm seeing a patch that hot dog mountain is

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,200
part of Lake Geneva in Wisconsin.

151
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Oh, and there is in this patch.

152
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,960
In fact, you might enjoy this patch that it is a little hot dog in a little hat to keep

153
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
him warm and skis.

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,400
And he's heading down hot dog mountain.

155
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I love that.

156
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,240
There's also a little Playboy bunny logo.

157
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
So maybe it was there.

158
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,680
That's stranger club there.

159
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,440
I guess the Playboy bunny's friends with the hot dog.

160
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Hmm.

161
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,320
Well, this raises more questions than answers.

162
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,840
Lake Geneva in the Finger Lakes region of New York, too.

163
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,680
I didn't realize there was one in Wisconsin.

164
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,440
So we'll learn everything we can about.

165
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Wow.

166
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,400
There's 13 slopes of fun at hot dog mountain.

167
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Wow.

168
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Really?

169
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Okay.

170
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,720
Well, we're going to have to cover hot dog mountain, but that's not dog mountain.

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
We're going to cover it in the episode.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
This is hot dog.

173
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Excited to learn about it.

174
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,280
This is one of the things I was going to ask about is how everybody feels today because,

175
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,800
okay, so some total of it and this you might be imagining jaw dropping stats and I don't

176
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,000
quite have those to give, but I believe that the full count is that we went to five establishments

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and all split seven hot dogs, which adds up to I guess only a little more than two free

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
ships.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,440
When you're adding some of the crazier ingredients and that it is pretty much all we had for

180
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
lunch and dinner.

181
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Uh huh.

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Yeah.

183
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,960
I thought I was going to be feeling it more as the day went on and I kept all day.

184
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,920
I felt like I am surprised I am not worn down.

185
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,520
And then this morning I felt so bad.

186
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,680
I slept bad.

187
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,280
My body just, I could feel my body being mad about lack of nourishment and things that

188
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
it needs.

189
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Yeah.

190
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,880
I also, I mean, I was drinking throughout the day too.

191
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,440
So that combo, I think.

192
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,120
You know, while we were, you know, you, it's a, we did a B it's fairly big day, not, not

193
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,600
opening to closing or anything, but what 10, 45, nine something.

194
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Yeah.

195
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Yeah.

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,960
Um, yeah, I made some, I think I really only made one miscalculation, but I was feeling

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,480
it for a while and then got a second wind.

198
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,520
Is that your, your Liberty to say, are you about to throw up?

199
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,080
No, I'm still just having, um, the vapers, the vapers.

200
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,120
Um, the hot dogs are okay.

201
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,840
Ambulance, even the ambulance over.

202
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Also the longer the episode go, we might do it.

203
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,280
We're like, we're fine now, but we aren't at the end of a two hour episode.

204
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,560
By the end of this, we might, yeah, we might not make it out.

205
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,760
This, this floor might get puked stained by the end.

206
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,120
Full of diarrhea by the end.

207
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Yep.

208
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,800
So listeners are going to get binaural vomit in their ears.

209
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I'll bring it up.

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll bring it up when, um, when we get to it.

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, interesting.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

213
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,200
It might make sense as a progression to go chronologically with the hot dogs that we,

214
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,600
I think that might be a good order and kind of take, take everybody through our day.

215
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,440
Um, but, um, before we get into it, let's talk, uh, rules and odds and ends.

216
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Uh, well, first of all, I want to thank Aaron Gardner for, uh, not just the logo for the

217
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,200
hot dog hullabaloo, but for naming the hot dog hullabaloo.

218
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Great name.

219
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Thank you.

220
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,760
Um, let's talk about rules, rules that we put forth before trying all of these hot dogs.

221
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,320
Um, one ruling, I think no kids hot dogs.

222
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
This is going to be embarrassing enough as it is.

223
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Yeah.

224
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,040
Eating hot dogs and splitting them up all day, splitting children's dogs didn't feel good

225
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
to me.

226
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,080
And I don't think a kid's dog was going to take it all the way.

227
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Likely not.

228
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Right.

229
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
Um, we didn't go to any buffets.

230
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,000
I think we found all the hot dogs on property, but if there were a bunch of hot dogs set

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,520
out, um, at a hotel buffet or something, we don't know about that.

232
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,480
We're not going to pay 28 bucks to only get to the hot dog.

233
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,640
I'm sure Goofy's kitchen storytellers probably have some child hot dog option.

234
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,120
Also seems unlikely to me that if we, if we don't think a kid's hot dog is going to take

235
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,480
it all the way, then kids hot dogs at a buffet, almost certainly you're not going to take

236
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
it all the way.

237
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
You never know though.

238
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,920
Maybe there's an odd meaty gym in there.

239
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Yeah.

240
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Who knows?

241
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,440
Um, I took, uh, I said we should take Ronto wraps.

242
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Out of the equation.

243
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,600
We did the, the, the star wars, galaxy's edge food that we're very fond of.

244
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,240
Um, that is the ultimate hot dog.

245
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,360
We called it a space hot dog before it came out.

246
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,640
Um, I don't like a competition where we know the winner and I don't think any of the, now

247
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
we've had all of these hot dogs.

248
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,400
Would you say any of them?

249
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,040
No, go up, it could go toe to toe with the Ronto.

250
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
It would have been a clean sweep.

251
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Yeah.

252
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Too easy.

253
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Too easy.

254
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Little too, don't get ahead of yourself.

255
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,360
Don't get full of yourselves Ronto reps.

256
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Yeah.

257
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,760
You had a rule that I think turned out to be correct that I initially argued.

258
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,000
Are we sure about this?

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,520
And you were a little intimidated by the day and by the notion of doing this until I put

260
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,360
this rule forth and I think this is crucial.

261
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,960
Um, and this might not be, look, this, this is my judgment for this competition.

262
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,560
Maybe this isn't true in general, but for the purposes of this, I said corn dogs are

263
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
not hot dogs.

264
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Off the table.

265
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Now I don't agree with corn dogs are not hot dogs, but off the table for this.

266
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,920
It doesn't even sound right to me, but yeah.

267
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Yeah.

268
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,560
I think for, because imagine how we would have felt if on top of it we are eating those

269
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,960
big thick breaded corn dogs.

270
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,040
That's the day that destroys us.

271
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,120
Now I think corn dog batter would, is like, you know, when you take a fall on screen into

272
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
a crash pad.

273
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,200
I think that corn dog batter would have lined your stomach a little.

274
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,440
Oh, you think it would have been a better day if we had corn dog.

275
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,040
I think the batter might have helped.

276
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,920
I also think the batter might have helped.

277
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
The batter might have helped.

278
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,680
But it could have also like packing peanuts in a box.

279
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,880
It might've puffed up and it probably would have puffed up and filled it up.

280
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,400
I also think in my mind, the hot link corn dog at corn dog castle is one of the best

281
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,440
small meals or snacks on property.

282
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,000
And I think that would have weighed it.

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,760
I would have had trouble being unbiased and because I think it's delicious.

284
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
I didn't want that either.

285
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
I think I, cause I was such a latecomer to the Disneyland corn dog.

286
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
I didn't realize how solid they were.

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,320
And I think they are genuinely pretty great.

288
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
And again, too easy.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,240
You don't want to just like set up a competition because you know what the winner is going

290
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
to be.

291
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,320
And then hooray, we got the winner there.

292
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,360
Where we stand right now, these, just putting it in the hot dog category.

293
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I don't know what's.

294
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,680
I genuinely don't know what's going to take it.

295
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,000
And I think that's exciting.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,840
We should also say sides, sides.

298
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,560
We did have sides, but we are trying to separate them.

299
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,720
Well the, from almost the only side, the majority of the sides were cuties oranges.

300
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,680
I kept ordering cuties as the side, not the chips, not the fries.

301
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,400
Cuties, single cuties.

302
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,920
Massive L at one of the locations.

303
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
In what way?

304
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
What do you mean L?

305
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Well I'll get to it.

306
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
I'll get to it.

307
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,640
I don't want to, we'll get there.

308
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Massive L. Massive L.

309
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,800
But not all the locations.

310
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Not all the locations.

311
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Did you eat a bad cutie?

312
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
No, no.

313
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
The cuties were delicious.

314
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
And the cuties are much more preferable.

315
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh I know what you're upset with.

316
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
I know what he's upset with me.

317
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
We'll get to it.

318
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
It's okay.

319
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I agree.

320
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
That's yeah, yeah.

321
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,240
Something happens in translation to in the process to those apple slices.

322
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,800
I feel this way at McDonald's as well.

323
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,960
There's a weird like film on those apple slices now I feel like.

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,440
To keep them, to keep apple slices fresher I think.

326
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,920
I do think they're putting something on them.

327
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,800
Because if you open up, if you do an apple and you cut it into slices, leave it on a

328
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,640
plate for an hour, it's going to start to get weird.

329
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Yes.

330
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
The color is going to start to go to sort of, I do feel like there's some sort of.

331
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Out of those slices.

332
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Yeah.

333
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,000
I feel like there's some coating or some shit on there that makes it like feel like fake.

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,440
And some of them de-skinned.

335
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,240
And most of the nutrients are in the skin.

336
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,320
Is that right?

337
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
In apples?

338
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
Yeah, a lot of the nutrients.

339
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
But most?

340
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I believe so.

341
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
I don't know.

342
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Honestly, I don't know.

343
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
I can see that.

344
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
I'm not seeing it wrong.

345
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,960
Yeah, that's not a, I feel like it's only the most picky kid I feel like is like, no,

346
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,320
no peel on this apple for me.

347
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah.

348
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
That's unnecessary.

349
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I don't know.

350
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Yeah, weird.

351
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,760
But the cuties, I gotta give it up for the cuties.

352
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,240
I mean if it was cuties or bananas, like they come with their own package.

353
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
They come with peel.

354
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Like it's.

355
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
They don't know what we're talking about real quick.

356
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
That's a tiny orange.

357
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Little orange.

358
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Seedless, easy to peel.

359
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Yes.

360
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,160
In some cases, in one case serving as the stands for the hot dogs.

361
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,960
Like we stick a cutie on either end, thus it does not tip over and spill the many ingredients.

362
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,360
So now, and that's good.

363
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,920
That's environmentally conscious we're using.

364
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,560
For instead of putting some plastic piece in there to hold the hot dogs up.

365
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
So I like that.

366
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,880
And probably prevented us from scurvy, getting scurvy, you know.

367
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
That's a good point.

368
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Thanks.

369
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Yeah.

370
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,320
Those the cuties were doing a lot of work for us all day.

371
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,880
So thank you cuties.

372
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,380
Thank you cuties.

373
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,120
One other thing with Toontown closed at the moment, one location was off the table and

374
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,360
that is Pluto's dog house.

375
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,360
And I don't know the quality of the hot dogs at Pluto's dog house.

376
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,400
If quietly that is the best place.

377
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
I don't know what to say.

378
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
I've had one there.

379
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
I've eaten a hot dog there.

380
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Yes.

381
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
And I don't think it was anything special.

382
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Okay.

383
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
All right.

384
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Yeah.

385
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Which kind of kept happening.

386
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,040
If we ever heard for sure one is not something special, maybe it got pulled from the competition.

387
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,240
And when we talk about hot dogs and what makes them special, I feel like we have to throw

388
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,880
the ball to Jason.

389
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,480
I think you're the obviously the hot dog expert among the three of us.

390
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,440
The entire hot dog fascination on the show comes from you and the just the notion that

391
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,200
you have them ever at your house, which still I find interesting.

392
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Yeah.

393
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Do you have them right now?

394
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,520
I don't have any right now, but I did just finish some deli ham.

395
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Great.

396
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,680
Ham and no longer ham and no longer ham in the house because Pam was in the house.

397
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,760
Because it was on sale at Pavilions.

398
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Wonderful.

399
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,360
So, well, I don't even know what to ask.

400
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,960
I guess maybe one question is what you're looking for in a quality hot dog.

401
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Sure.

402
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,040
First off, I think interesting to note, this episode was not my idea.

403
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
This was you, Scott.

404
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,720
So I appreciate your innovation in this.

405
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
I appreciate.

406
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,880
You know, we have to set each other up to succeed.

407
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,800
If I think of a hot dog vehicle for you to shine.

408
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Yeah.

409
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Bumps that spike.

410
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,360
You know, you got to work together to win the volleyball game.

411
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,320
You know, I think overall, the very first thing you're looking for is taste.

412
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,960
I mean, if it doesn't taste good, why bother?

413
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,400
You know, after that, I think you start to get into like a presentation, you know, and

414
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:08,000
then I guess similar to taste, like elements, like do the parts of the whole, are they good

415
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
together?

416
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,200
Are they good separately?

417
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,920
Temperature is this, are these toppings making this slightly warm thing ice cold?

418
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,320
Oh, sure.

419
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,120
I don't know that hot was the strong suit of any of the entrees yesterday in terms of

420
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,320
food temperature.

421
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,640
I don't think anything came out.

422
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,800
I don't think anything was undercooked, but I think by the time we sat down to cut them

423
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,280
up hot dog is cooked by definition.

424
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,920
It is already cooked kind of just again.

425
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,000
Well, it is cooked.

426
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,280
You can eat a hot dog straight out of the package.

427
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,400
For the most part, I think you can get raw Franks.

428
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I don't think we're winners.

429
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
Whatever you want to call them.

430
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,040
I'd like to call them winners, but I feel like most of the stuff you get at the store,

431
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
you could eat it raw.

432
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,840
It'll taste like baloney and if it's cold.

433
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Yeah.

434
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Yeah.

435
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,000
And if you fry baloney, it tastes like a hot dog.

436
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Sure.

437
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
In most cases.

438
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,320
So I'm just saying everything I think we ate yesterday, I'm sure came out of a package

439
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
cooked.

440
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Cold beer quotes.

441
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,120
It just needed to be warmer.

442
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,680
It just needed to be heated up.

443
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:20,040
Have you been satisfied with the quality of hot dogs at Disneyland before?

444
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,200
Has Disneyland's hot dog game met your needs and expectations?

445
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
No.

446
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Interesting.

447
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Okay.

448
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Okay.

449
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Explain.

450
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,600
Well, for a long time, the hot dogs were pretty bland and they were served on very bland,

451
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,920
often approaching stale, like wheat rolls.

452
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah.

453
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Okay.

454
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,000
And so like, yeah.

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,480
And I think the like topping packets yesterday were pretty on point.

456
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Like you know.

457
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
They were a little diverse, I feel like.

458
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Yeah.

459
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Better in the past.

460
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,640
So those have gotten, some stuff has gotten better.

461
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:08,120
I don't think, I mean, LA still has a lot of like burger and hot dog places.

462
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:13,120
So I think we're, we do, we do pretty well, especially here in the beautiful San Fernando

463
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Valley.

464
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,680
There's a lot of places that have been here for decades that are still doing the same,

465
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,040
you know, cooking burgers and franks the same way they have for a long time.

466
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,920
Well, which if, if what you're getting at is the stuff that you can get locally within

467
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,000
two miles of where you live, that you're going to find a better hot dog in your vicinity

468
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,280
than at Disneyland.

469
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
That's how I feel.

470
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,480
I'm like, I would say none of these, nothing that we had, I would describe as being one

471
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,880
of the top 10 or 20 hot dogs I've ever beaten.

472
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,120
I don't think so.

473
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,600
And I'm not even looking for like fancy.

474
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,720
I like some of the stuff at Weiner, the local chain Weiner Schnitzel.

475
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,920
Oh, but if you drive by some of the buildings, some of them still look like the cool funky

476
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,080
like A-frame architecture.

477
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,760
And some of them look like they opened in the nineties and immediately got in a fight.

478
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,000
Like the building got beat up somehow.

479
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,240
It's an all over the map franchise.

480
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,320
It's an all over the map franchise, but occasionally very solid.

481
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
That said, Disneyland strong suit is the corn dog.

482
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,320
I think in general, that is, I think we're bringing the heat.

483
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,000
Because it has the cushion, because it's got to be the same hot.

484
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
It's got to be the same thing inside.

485
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
It might be everything we had.

486
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,400
I think everything we had is the same actual hot dog.

487
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,400
That is what I figured out, very smartly figured out by the end of the day.

488
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,680
With one, maybe two exceptions.

489
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Maybe.

490
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,640
One of them just by their definition, I think, can be different.

491
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
Yeah, that's right.

492
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
That's yes.

493
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
Yeah.

494
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,040
But it's actually the same one still.

495
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,640
It's just got a little extra.

496
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Yes, possibly.

497
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
Um, huh.

499
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Okay.

500
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,280
So we're so measured expectations already.

501
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,240
This is a guy with this is already let's let everybody know this is a competition between

502
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,760
mediocre hot dogs.

503
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I think it has gotten better, which is not.

504
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,520
It's not saying a lot.

505
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,880
I think one place that used to be worse is actually better.

506
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,440
I mean, look, I don't want to tip.

507
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
I don't want to tip.

508
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,080
I let's I think we should just start getting into it.

509
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,160
Yeah, I well, I agree that we should start getting into it.

510
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:35,040
But I think as just a little short for the feature, there is one thing that happened

511
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,640
yesterday that we need to talk about before we head into the bulk of the hull of balloon.

512
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,800
And that is what happened right before we left Disneyland.

513
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,480
Right.

514
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Let's explain.

515
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,240
So a fun day, high jink filled day in general.

516
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,800
I think the best high jinks were saved for the very end.

517
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,520
I was waiting for you guys outside of the California Adventure location trolley treats

518
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
where you were mobile ordering snacks to treats to take home.

519
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Yes.

520
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
For the what?

521
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
Have you consumed those, by the way?

522
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,600
No, those are sitting in a bag.

523
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
OK.

524
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Yeah, I was not your treats.

525
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
What did you get?

526
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,800
I got like a rainbow Mickey like Rice Krispie treat with like rainbow like not sprinkles,

527
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,200
rainbow like what do you call those that are not sprinkles, but they're different

528
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,240
decorative like cupcake things, you know, like it's like shavings, like colored shavings,

529
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
but they're not sprinkles.

530
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Hmm.

531
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
OK, I'm not sure.

532
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Yeah, I don't know what the name is.

533
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Jason Treat.

534
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:38,840
Yeah, I got what we each first off, you can mobile order treats at the candy stores now.

535
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,160
Which is actually interesting that you can mobile order at more of a take home or something.

536
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,240
It could be a take home situation.

537
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Yes.

538
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Something you got to eat right then.

539
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,720
I already have a grievances about it because the walk up menu is much more detail.

540
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,920
There's many more options than it was on the mobile order.

541
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,440
Like you were I was a little like doing it on the fly, doing it pretty quickly because

542
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,960
you were in line and Mike had already placed his and I was just trying to pick something

543
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,200
to bring back for me and something to bring back for Jane.

544
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,040
I brought her like a Rice Krispie treat on a stick that had peanut butter and chocolate

545
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,400
on it.

546
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,880
And then for myself, I mostly ate this.

547
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,760
I couldn't find the exact one on the app, but it's a more the strawberry shortcake marshmallow

548
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,880
wand.

549
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,040
It was a bunch of marshmallows dipped in white chocolate and then covered in strawberry flavored

550
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,040
confectioners coating crushed cookies and dried strawberry pieces.

551
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Wow.

552
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,840
It tasted like a strawberry shortcake ice cream bar, but marshmallows instead of an

553
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
ice cream base.

554
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
I thought it was delicious.

555
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Oh, great.

556
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,160
So that was good at night or in the morning?

557
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Little right before I came here.

558
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,400
Just a coating to cool your stomach.

559
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,160
Just a coating, you know.

560
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,400
There's also, I don't think it played out this way, but we were talking about, all right,

561
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
we're heading into the hot dog hall of blue.

562
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
We're saying like, we got to like make sure, okay, we got it.

563
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,280
We need sustenance and things that our body needs before we get there.

564
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,480
Like make sure to have a healthy breakfast.

565
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,960
And then I think we did, we said that did an episode and then on the way out from doing

566
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,800
the episode, you said, oh, maybe we can grab one of those cornbread donuts from Duncan.

567
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,720
It's Duncan's seasonal donut.

568
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,160
I did not eat it yesterday.

569
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,520
I ate it the day before.

570
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,440
I just had like a granola bar and some peanut butter before.

571
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,200
And then I showed up at Mike's.

572
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,160
We all carpooled and he offered me a donut and had presented us each with a bottle of

573
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Coca-Cola Starlight.

574
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Oh, yes.

575
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,080
Waiting in our chariot.

576
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
That's right.

577
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,560
It was my first experience with Coke Starlight.

578
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Yes.

579
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
And your last, I assume.

580
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Yes.

581
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Yeah.

582
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
It was one sip.

583
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,960
Not only would it be one sip, he wouldn't let his taste buds experience it and create

584
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,200
the antibodies that he needed to enjoy it.

585
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,720
Like our bodies have, Jason.

586
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,400
And I have Coca-Cola Starlight cans at home and I meant to throw some in my bag to present

587
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,920
and forgot it going out the door.

588
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:08,160
So I whipped it because we could have had a car full of zero sugar Coca-Cola Starlight

589
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,520
in various bottles, cans, you know.

590
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,760
It made the day better, I think, if we had had more.

591
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Which you were talking about, like, if the corndog lining might help.

592
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,160
You said during the day, well, yeah, this hot dog thing is going to be grueling, but

593
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,520
I am armed with Coke Starlight.

594
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,600
That was going to offset.

595
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,920
I also had, and I didn't go for either of them, I had a travel thing of Tums and I had

596
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,200
a can of Perrier, just in case.

597
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Little bubble water.

598
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Soothe the stomach.

599
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,960
Yeah, Coke Starlight, I did not spit it out.

600
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,640
It was not a bizarre taste to me and not so different than other, especially like zero

601
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
sugar sodas.

602
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,600
But that, boy, that aftertaste just lingered and lingered.

603
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,360
It got worse and worse.

604
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,840
It's making me thirsty just thinking about the aftertaste.

605
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Why do you want that?

606
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,360
Is this just like, because you don't really like, in the way that you, I don't think you

607
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,160
will drink just straight whiskey probably usually.

608
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,960
You need to load it up with shit like Coke Starlight.

609
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
No, no, no, no.

610
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
I will drink a straight whiskey.

611
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Okay, okay.

612
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Got it.

613
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
All right.

614
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
But either way.

615
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Direct assumption on my part.

616
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
I can handle it.

617
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
I'm tough.

618
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
I'm a man.

619
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm a traditional masculine man.

620
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:28,000
But no, my body cannot, it just did not recognize Coke Starlight as a desirable taste to have.

621
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
My tongue was so upset.

622
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
You know what?

623
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,000
I had a mini can because it's so, I poured a mini can in like a highball glass, like

624
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,640
a tall glass, and it only filled it like halfway.

625
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,480
I took a few sips.

626
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,800
It's mostly gone.

627
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,760
You drank a Coke Starlight in like a night, like a cocktail, like, well, just a regular

628
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,640
glass, like regular tumbler, like big piece of ice, clink, clink, clink.

629
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah.

630
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Hello, darling.

631
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
I'm drinking my Starlight.

632
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,640
I've only seen it like the 16 ounce bottles or the 7.5 ounce can.

633
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
And you're a fan.

634
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
I do like it.

635
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I do.

636
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Okay.

637
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Don't.

638
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
All right.

639
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
More power to you.

640
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,440
I didn't understand.

641
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,360
But so anyway, you guys are ordering your treats.

642
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,280
I was not getting a treat for myself.

643
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,600
So my attention is wandering and I realized there is a, there is a character line not

644
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,200
that far from us.

645
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Yes.

646
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,640
It is a line for Mickey Mouse.

647
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,680
And I thought, well, we did this episode about how hugs are back.

648
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,480
If you didn't hear that on the Patreon, this is a news.

649
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,000
This is a recent thing that one of the last little things unlocked about pre pandemic

650
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,040
parks is that you can hug the characters again and get up close and interact with your favorite

651
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,800
Disney characters.

652
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,880
So I see Mickey.

653
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm like, well, we got to do, this is a tweet.

654
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,080
We got to like, we got to post this.

655
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Maybe we posted it by now.

656
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,320
If you're listening to this, we all got to hug Mickey and do some kind of hugs are back

657
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
post.

658
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,320
That'll be nice.

659
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
Right.

660
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm sort of saying that out loud to you, Mike.

661
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,440
Maybe you're thinking about treats a little bit.

662
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,040
I would call you like half interested in this at best.

663
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,720
You're kind of a little glazed over your man.

664
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Like, okay.

665
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,680
Then I look over and see another character line and that line is for Minnie Mouse.

666
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Minnie Mouse.

667
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Yes.

668
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,920
I said, oh, or there's a Minnie Mouse line.

669
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:19,400
And you said, oh, Minnie, like spark, like lit up color in your face now.

670
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Flapper Minnie at that.

671
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Flapper Minnie.

672
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,200
Your posture like shut, like you were like hunched over and then you grew a few inches.

673
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,800
Yes, that is true.

674
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,400
All a hundred percent correct.

675
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,640
And also I said, oh, and I know this sounds like some sort of excuse just for my pervert

676
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,160
ness to get in line to take a picture with Minnie.

677
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,400
But I said, oh, Minnie is the one who always hugs me because this is going to be an important

678
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,800
part of the story because I've never ever gone and be like, I'm going to get my hands

679
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
on me.

680
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,760
Like that's not so many always hugs me.

681
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,440
So I said, let's do Minnie, especially because Minnie is so much more.

682
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Hello.

683
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,560
She's always got her arms outstretched welcoming you in.

684
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,560
And I said, that's going to be an easier slam done because I don't think all the characters

685
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,680
are necessarily like that.

686
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,960
They're not like Chewbacca.

687
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,680
So that's also another reason why.

688
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,320
Cruel irony coming to the.

689
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,840
Yeah, well, yes.

690
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,160
So I so my because what we're about to reveal my expectations of what happened is the thing

691
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,760
that completely threw me off and completely ruined this bit that we were talking about.

692
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,520
Oh, I don't know.

693
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
I the opposite.

694
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,280
Well, I love how this played out.

695
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
It's not fair.

696
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
I think it's played out.

697
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
No, I think it's good, too.

698
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,320
So we get in a we get in line for many and we're discussing how are we going to do that?

699
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,000
Like, do we count as one group?

700
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,840
I feel like we all need separate photos.

701
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,840
Separate hugs.

702
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,200
She can't hug all of us at once.

703
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,240
Do we give a phone to a cast member?

704
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,440
Do we want them all to be on the same phone?

705
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,720
How do we play this?

706
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,320
And then we say, well, yeah, let's all go up individually.

707
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,800
And then, Mike, in my recollection, how you describe this was, OK, well, I'll take the

708
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,120
photos and you do it and then Jason do it and I'll get I'll get your pictures.

709
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,840
And then I'll go in with many.

710
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,920
And then you guys just like, keep taking them and taking them and taking them and

711
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,840
taking them. This is what you said out loud.

712
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,720
OK, just keep going, because I'm just going to keep going at it and just like I don't

713
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,680
think I keep going at it.

714
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,760
You did not say that.

715
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,360
But that was the attitude that I felt got it from this particular photo demand.

716
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,520
Sure. Sure. That camera rolling.

717
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,880
OK, you never cut.

718
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,520
You wanted a couple angles.

719
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,880
You didn't want to end up with just one Zapruder film.

720
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,520
I wanted it. I wanted a two camera shoot, two to three camera shoot.

721
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,520
You know, good. Yeah.

722
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,800
So I go up.

723
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,440
I ask many for a hug.

724
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,640
I hug many. Jason does the same.

725
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,600
Yeah. So we have hug photos.

726
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,160
We have hug photo and you went in pretty fast.

727
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,480
And then I was like, oh, I'll go in for a hug.

728
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,800
And it felt like they were the cast.

729
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,120
I was doing it grudgingly.

730
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,920
This is what I'm saying.

731
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Grab my hand and did a pose.

732
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,120
Yes. They were.

733
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,040
The cast member was very good at doing, like, you know, pose, like,

734
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,400
you know, hands with the arm or like grab my hand and like both our hands on mine.

735
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
I sense this energy.

736
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,560
I was just like, oh, I don't.

737
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,720
Yeah, I know why I don't do this.

738
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,800
Now, I know I don't usually.

739
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
I said, I'm so very sorry.

740
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,640
This is not the mini who's hugged me in Florida.

741
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
This is not the same mini.

742
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,680
I said I I did a little like kind of gesture like this walking up to mini

743
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,640
as if like a light we may be going to the mini was not interested.

744
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,120
So I said put her arm through your.

745
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,880
Yeah. So I said, OK, I'm going to just so.

746
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,520
So I'm in general about hugging.

747
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,600
I'm not a big hugger.

748
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,520
You guys don't know me to hug you after every record or anything.

749
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,400
That's not we don't know. We did it again.

750
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,320
Yeah. No. We did it to him again.

751
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,400
Another one. I'm not anti hugger or anything, but I'm generally like I need

752
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,080
I need the person who's going to hug me to give me like five good signs,

753
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,320
five good go ahead signs and then let's hug.

754
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,160
I'm I'm I'm happy to do it.

755
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,400
This many was not giving me the the all clear sign.

756
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,800
So I said, I'm just going to shake many's hand for the first time.

757
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,040
This is the first time I've taken a photo with many in the last so many years

758
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,200
that many did not hug and smooch me.

759
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,800
You went you reverted back to your high school first date.

760
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,480
Yes, I did. Like, well, yes, I did.

761
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,240
Good luck in your future endeavors.

762
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,800
Yes. Great meeting you.

763
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,600
That is exactly what happened.

764
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
And it kind of didn't occur to me.

765
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,000
I think Jason was taking the pictures and until we broke off

766
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,280
and started leaving the park, that was the first thing I realized.

767
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,200
Wait, Mike did not hug me.

768
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,120
Did not hug me.

769
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,200
The entire point of us didn't doing this.

770
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,280
And I asked what happened.

771
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,280
And you said very sheepishly, I got nervous.

772
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,760
Well, I did. I was nervous to hug this garden grove.

773
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,480
I 23 year old.

774
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,840
I also it's also weird.

775
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,200
I feel like the suits used to be puffier than some of the new character stuff.

776
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,440
They're just wearing like a green man suit with clothes over it.

777
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,560
I'm a man head.

778
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm also biggest Herman Munster.

779
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm a Frankenstein like a very small mini.

780
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,480
Yeah. So I I'm aware sometimes of I'm not as tall as Chewie,

781
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,400
but I'm like, I don't know what this this many also had just gotten through,

782
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,320
like hugging somebody for like a minute and a half.

783
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,560
Did you see this? No.

784
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,240
You guys were I think your back was to me.

785
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,920
Many was hugging this somebody for like forever.

786
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,080
And I was like, I'm sure that's really sweet.

787
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
And that person really is enjoying this hug.

788
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,040
But like I was the performer.

789
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,120
I'm thinking about the logistics of the performer.

790
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,720
And I'm like, also, can she see me?

791
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,120
Can many see me?

792
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Like she's looking up.

793
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,600
So all of this is getting in my head.

794
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,680
And I got like nervous.

795
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,120
And I'm like, I know it's not a huge deal.

796
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,240
I go. But then I all of a sudden I kind of like blacked out a little bit.

797
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,960
And I just like shook many's hand and then took a photo.

798
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,720
And she like made she put her arm through my arm to take the photo.

799
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,000
And then I like kind of in a daze, like left and just went, I didn't do it.

800
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,200
I didn't. I didn't do it.

801
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,560
I didn't hug. No hug.

802
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,760
I'll say that.

803
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,960
That was a great I think that was great.

804
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,280
There were two very little kids in front of us.

805
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,120
They walked up to many and many spent so much time with like signed

806
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,560
autographs for both hugged both of them, took a bunch of pictures.

807
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,080
Oh, yeah. They were.

808
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,600
And there is a long line, too.

809
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,960
I think they saw they got to us and they're like, Jesus Christ,

810
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,800
we have so many people.

811
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,040
Well, they close the we are the people who are like, OK, we got to get these.

812
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,160
No, no, no.

813
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,240
They have their hand on the.

814
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,440
They have a lot of family like I there are people we I actually have to.

815
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,680
They have their hand on the bus.

816
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,840
When you see us, don't were you paranoid?

817
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,480
Like we are the thing that until the three men came, the vibes were great.

818
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,560
And then it was and that we got to start gunning it and save many from the little.

819
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,120
Self-conscious public.

820
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,360
I won't lie. I'm a little self-conscious about that.

821
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,160
So, yeah, I don't I don't.

822
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,720
Yeah, I don't think that they're like, all right, get your hands on your

823
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,040
like every cast member has their hand on their gun, like ready to go.

824
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,920
If they see us, I don't think it's that severe.

825
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,840
But I am like, they're like, OK, buddy, what is this?

826
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,920
Who is who are you? What podcast?

827
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,280
Again, I disagree.

828
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,160
There is no way that we, the three of us are the creepiest.

829
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,800
No, I know that we're going for a hug.

830
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,960
That's yes, that is true.

831
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,400
We were efficient, though, in our movement.

832
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,920
We had the camera stuff laid out.

833
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,600
We were all boom, boom, boom.

834
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's obviously.

835
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,640
What you'll probably aren't.

836
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,280
So our actual lingerers and especially if you're a face character princess, as we learned.

837
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,280
Yes, that's another thing entirely.

838
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,560
But yes, I all the things I'm telling you, sensing weird thing.

839
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,800
My general hug philosophy, my hug, the the the ghost signals I need for a hug.

840
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,040
All of those things were not working.

841
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,960
And then as I told you, I just kind of went, oh, hello, Minnie, how are you?

842
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,480
And then we took the photo and then I left and I went, well, I didn't do the bit.

843
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,080
OK, on the bright side, none of us panic fired and went, where my hug at?

844
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,000
One of the one of the worst phrases of the late 20th century.

845
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,520
Just like crime straight to jail with you.

846
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,480
They would have they would have put us in Disney jail.

847
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,640
Yeah. Hey, Minnie, where my hug at?

848
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,080
Goofy beating you up with a normal phone book.

849
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,800
They'll on us if we tell that story.

850
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,320
Yeah, it was everything.

851
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,800
The car like the Carthay area, like jazz band.

852
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,320
They put their weapons, their their instruments down and grab weapons.

853
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,960
The back of weapons in the cases still has a bunch of Anaheim

854
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,800
1990 phone books when they were like giant.

855
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,240
Just like in case they really have to teach you a lesson.

856
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,840
Yeah. Well, anyway, we have our photos and that's the story behind them.

857
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,840
Yes. Yeah. If you wonder why there was no mic hug.

858
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,360
No, look. Yeah.

859
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,600
And that's look, I'll go back to Florida where Minnie is like,

860
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,120
she's fighting to hug me.

861
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,880
She's asking for the hug.

862
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
So there you go.

863
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,600
She's forcing you. Right. Yes.

864
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,360
OK, so all of that said a sidetrack.

865
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,880
Now let's get into the hullabaloo. Yes.

866
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,080
And let's kind of step through how the day progressed.

867
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,200
I think especially this works because the first location we stopped

868
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,360
was kind of a base of a kind of just no frills set.

869
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,160
Like what is a basic, unadorned Disneyland hot dog like?

870
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,480
And that is at the downtown Disney location, Diggity Dogs,

871
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,600
where we ordered what was described as a Nathan's original all beef hot dog.

872
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,240
Yeah. Flag on the field immediately.

873
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,960
Right at the start.

874
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,600
I I don't believe those were Nathan's hot dogs.

875
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,440
Yeah, yeah, I'm not super familiar,

876
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,560
but I do recall Nathan's being an elevated brand.

877
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
And I think it's one of those where the brands gotten watered down.

878
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,120
I think it might be like when a place says they serve Starbucks or coffee,

879
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,800
bean coffee. But what does that mean? What does it read?

880
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,600
It does not like that can still be. It's it's hypothetical.

881
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,280
They've watered the brand down.

882
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,040
Scott, I think you're exactly right.

883
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,960
I think we're looking at the wholesale supplier of like the lower rung.

884
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,400
Nathan's wholesale because a real Nathan's hot dog.

885
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,560
I was yelling about this last night to Jane and anyone who would listen.

886
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,720
At midnight, it was late. Yeah, it was like

887
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,440
usually longer, skinnier, a darker color than these hot dogs.

888
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,480
Oh, you're right. Yes, they're recognizable.

889
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,720
That's like that's like Wendy's Square Patty.

890
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,840
They have there's things about.

891
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, these were exactly the same as the ones in the park. Yes.

892
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,600
I think this this is a stand that's probably very serviceable

893
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,120
for families with young children who will only eat hot dogs

894
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,920
in the middle of downtown Disney.

895
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,400
A child is screaming for a hot dog.

896
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,880
Oh, thank God there's a little stand there that sells plain hot dogs.

897
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,840
Yes. So it likely serves a purpose.

898
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,720
I want hot dog. I only eat hot dog.

899
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,080
Oh, honey, what are we going to do? We're in Disney.

900
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,400
There's a there's a stand right there outside.

901
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,240
Say diggity what?

902
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,280
Diggity hot dogs.

903
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,920
That must be hot dogs.

904
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,800
It's not a place where you get dogs or dog supplies, is it?

905
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,880
No, it's hot dog. It doesn't.

906
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,280
It seems very utilitarian.

907
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,680
It's not the like impulse buy of like the different flavor churros

908
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,440
that aren't the Disney churros or a little macro, though, like four dollar

909
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,960
macaroons. Yeah, it's a it's a good it's just a basic.

910
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,440
We went and we got this basic, which had no which came with nothing.

911
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,080
That's just like in the oil and we all got our own condiments.

912
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,640
For me, and this is this would be my go to for hot dogs in general.

913
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,840
My third I put I used relish and spicy brown mustard,

914
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,240
which the Disney variety is goldens for spicy brown mustard.

915
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,760
Go with goldens. Go with gold.

916
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,640
How did you guys with given left to your own devices?

917
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,560
What do you well, what's your OK?

918
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,360
I did I did a couple of things.

919
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,120
I tried it. I tried it plain.

920
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,200
These are small bites, but I tried it plain.

921
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,920
I tried it with yes.

922
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,760
And I'm from Chicago. This is a no, no.

923
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,640
But I do eat it with ketchup sometimes.

924
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,000
I know people say that's wrong, but I do like it.

925
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,160
So I tried it with just ketchup.

926
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,920
And then I also tried one bite with relish and goldens.

927
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,040
So I tried all three. Right.

928
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,160
Yeah. Goldens, a Sheridan family favorite, always in the house growing up.

929
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,200
And I love to see the packets.

930
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,120
Oh, always like the packets, packets widely available at Disneyland.

931
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,640
You pocketed a whole like 50 of them to take home to.

932
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,160
That does sound like something my mother would do.

933
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,760
Mix them in with with Coke Starlight in your eyeball glass.

934
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,400
They would change in older seats.

935
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Yeah. So I did

936
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,840
goldens and whatever relish I could get out of the packets.

937
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,480
I fucking I love relish.

938
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,160
I hate those fucking relish packets.

939
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,120
It is not an item to be in.

940
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,280
There's got to be a better way, like because you either open too small a hole

941
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,160
and you get mostly relish juice or as happened late in the day yesterday,

942
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,360
I opened a packet and it exploded and somehow did not explode onto me,

943
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,840
just exploded onto like my place setting in the table.

944
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,960
Yeah, yeah. They've got to be bigger if nothing else, which sometimes they are.

945
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,800
But yeah, relish packets cannot be the same size as ketchup and mustard.

946
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, as tidy as that.

947
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,280
Yeah, it's better with this.

948
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,440
I know it's messier, but it's better with some sort of squirt pump mechanism,

949
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
pump mechanism to get your relish.

950
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,200
Yeah, absolutely. Very inefficient.

951
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,440
I think they've standardized like the condiment allotment,

952
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,320
like everywhere seem to have the same sort of setup.

953
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,520
Likely, I think some of them used to have more pump setups.

954
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,240
I think those pulled at the start of the pandemic reopening

955
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,720
and now have given way to just like packets of everything.

956
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,920
I so yeah, just like fine basic hot dog.

957
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,040
By the way, this one probably the most humiliating to that's incompetent.

958
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,040
There's two moments I think were the most humiliating split ups.

959
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,800
This one was tough because they did not have knives at this location,

960
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,120
because surely we do not need to stock knives.

961
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,880
Who will be splitting up hot dogs,

962
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,120
allah, Mickey, Donald and Goofy splitting up the one bean

963
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,400
check and bean stock.

964
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,720
Never have we resembled that trio more.

965
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,560
So splitting up this plain hot dog just using forks.

966
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,400
It's very embarrassing, but nobody is around.

967
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,920
And you know what? We got to sit just in the fountain at downtown Disney.

968
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,240
A nice little bench spot.

969
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,600
The family from Jason's story had not come yet to see us do this.

970
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,440
So we didn't get embarrassed.

971
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,240
Too early for breakdown. Yeah.

972
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,760
So, you know, it was just it was it was fine.

973
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,640
There's a part of me it's like, you know,

974
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,880
maybe just a basic on a darn hot dog oddly takes it.

975
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,080
But I think I didn't like the aftertaste of this.

976
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,640
I felt I wrote down the word soupy.

977
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,640
I felt like it just kind of like just kind of a weird dirty water.

978
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,000
I wrote I wrote juicy down.

979
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,160
Juicy is maybe a bit.

980
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,360
That's a more optimistic way to to.

981
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,240
I didn't hate this dog.

982
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,600
No, I wrote juicy, looked weird, plain.

983
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,080
Not that they all don't look weird, plain,

984
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,480
but there was something about it that was a little unappealing, I would say.

985
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,920
You know, a lot of stuff steamed or boiled and then just put on rollers.

986
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:16,440
I a big points across the board deducted no grilled dogs today.

987
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,560
I feel like much infrastructure, too much infrastructure, but easy.

988
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,680
Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Big time.

989
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,600
Yeah. This you know what?

990
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:32,040
This reminded me of it was not as wet, but it's I said this before on the show.

991
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
That my favorite part of playing soccer as a little kid

992
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,240
was getting a hot dog and the soda afterward.

993
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,080
And the hot dog would be wrapped.

994
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,040
And it was just it was so wet by the end of the game.

995
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,320
Whenever they had made them and brought them over to the field,

996
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,000
the hot dog would be pretty like wet and juicy.

997
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,360
And this is it did remind me of that.

998
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,000
So I did have a little flashback to my favorite part of soccer.

999
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,760
Eating a delicious, wet hot dog.

1000
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,680
All right. Well, something about like the classic. Yeah.

1001
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
Yeah. Love it.

1002
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,560
By the way, I think we have not established how we're going to do

1003
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,240
the scoring on this.

1004
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,720
And my thought was to make this mathematical and also kind of Olympic style

1005
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,400
where we are we're going on a scale of one to ten.

1006
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,080
Us individual judges are

1007
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,360
tallying up.

1008
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,360
We do our own score and then we take like a mean of the three.

1009
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,320
Yes. That becomes the official score.

1010
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,280
And then we lock in our scores without saying them out loud to each other.

1011
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,600
So that is a surprise to us by the end.

1012
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,760
Yes. We enter it into the spreadsheet.

1013
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,720
Who won? Right.

1014
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,680
So with that said, do we think that we would you guys be comfortable

1015
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,240
from one to ten locking in a score? Yes.

1016
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,080
On any dogs? Be happy to.

1017
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,240
Then let's just we'll do that.

1018
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,560
I think I've got been locking in my score and locking my score. OK.

1019
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,680
Great. So just, you know, keeps an air of surprise.

1020
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,360
This that we will find out at the at the very end. Right.

1021
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,000
So that is our feelings about diggity dogs.

1022
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,040
Now we move.

1023
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,680
Well, first things first, we try to go for, you know, what might be the big dog?

1024
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,880
The heavily anticipated dog of the day, the one that inspired this idea

1025
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,760
a little bit, which was seeing the big junkyard, chilly dog.

1026
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,480
Yeah. At Ballast Point and sit down.

1027
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,200
Disney, downtown Disney location, Ballast Point,

1028
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,320
saw that at the at some bar seating, saw somebody enjoying that big old

1029
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,720
like massive overflowing hot dog. That thing's impressive.

1030
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,320
We got to go try that.

1031
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,680
We head to downtown Disney.

1032
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,000
It's a little after 11, not open.

1033
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,720
Ballast Point, not open.

1034
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,760
We don't know what's going on. Yeah.

1035
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,360
Website says it should be open by then. I don't know.

1036
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,960
Maybe we're going to have to check back in later.

1037
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,400
So we will check back in later with Ballast Point.

1038
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,760
Instead, we go into the park, a very late entrance into Disneyland.

1039
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,440
There's a lot of hot dog hijinks before we actually go into Disneyland Park.

1040
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,400
But on the way, we mobile order from refreshment corner.

1041
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,320
And this might be the most iconic hot dog location, I feel, in Disneyland.

1042
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,840
I think it's been a hot dog stand forever.

1043
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,120
Maybe one of the first.

1044
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,280
I don't know the history of the place.

1045
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,560
Maybe we'll do an episode down down the road.

1046
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,400
But two hot dogs from here.

1047
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,920
Let's talk about the first, which was the electric relish dog.

1048
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,680
Does anyone have the description in front of them or should I go for it?

1049
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,080
OK. Yeah. An interesting one.

1050
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,600
An interesting one.

1051
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,000
You know, I think electric.

1052
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,760
This is a seasonal return of the Main Street Electrical Parade.

1053
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,160
Oh, that's OK.

1054
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,400
So this might not be there.

1055
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,000
This might glow away much like the parade itself.

1056
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,520
So then it'll be back every constantly.

1057
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,160
Yes, whenever they need money.

1058
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,400
Lucy will let us kick the football one day.

1059
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,040
The electric relish dog, all beef hot dog, bacon,

1060
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,240
mustard cheese sauce, electric relish and sport peppers.

1061
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,400
Electric relish doesn't tell me a lot like it's an electric relish dog.

1062
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
And the ingredient is electric relish.

1063
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,160
I guess it's just there's a little more going on.

1064
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,880
You know, there's like those little like those little pops and seeds, whatever.

1065
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,440
Seeds from like pickles, but some peppers and kind of like a hoagie spread.

1066
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,120
Yeah. And pickles.

1067
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,880
Relish is already like a weird neon color.

1068
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,720
Yeah. Which I'm sure is food coloring.

1069
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,560
But it's not it's it's not like the Chicago like bright green relish.

1070
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,360
It was like more like a pepper.

1071
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,840
It was not as bright as that. You're right.

1072
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,640
Yeah. But but it's still pretty bright.

1073
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,000
Pretty bright. Mm hmm.

1074
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,560
So it is it is it makes sense with the Main Street Electrical Parade.

1075
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,440
Yeah. Yeah. Well, interesting seasonal item.

1076
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,120
I'll just say I was a fan of this one.

1077
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,240
I liked this. I will say I was also a fan.

1078
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,480
And it could very well go all the way today.

1079
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,000
This was very surprising of like, wow, this is good.

1080
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,720
Like, I like this a lot.

1081
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,880
I didn't get that it was a mustard cheese sauce.

1082
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,160
I thought it was just nacho cheese. Yeah.

1083
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,040
I didn't either. But I liked whatever.

1084
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,280
I actually missed the the ingredient.

1085
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,040
I was and I was like, is this mustard or is this cheese?

1086
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,120
But it landed in this beer cheese kind of zone or at least a theme park equivalent.

1087
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,360
And I tend to like anything in that genre.

1088
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,400
So, yeah, that's great.

1089
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,960
And that's just kind of slathered on the back.

1090
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,640
And you you you really sense that flavor separate from everything else.

1091
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,520
That really like shines through, pops through.

1092
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,840
You get just a full piece of bacon lining the entire not wrapped,

1093
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,240
but just like, you know, baking down the middle.

1094
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,920
Crispy and properly cooked.

1095
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,040
Yeah. Shocking.

1096
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,200
Yeah. Like is it for for Disney for Disney?

1097
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,800
I've had much better pieces of bacon.

1098
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,280
I've had better. Yes, you're right.

1099
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,280
I've had worse at Disney.

1100
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,760
But if you if you buy the pre cooked bacon that you can just microwave

1101
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,800
and you do it correctly and it gets crisp, that's sort of what this was.

1102
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah. So the bar kind of low.

1103
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,240
So they surpassed it handily.

1104
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,880
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

1105
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,560
I think like fun textures as part of that.

1106
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,160
Yeah. Between bacon and and that electric relish.

1107
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,160
And then the snap of the peppers as an interesting component to have on there.

1108
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,600
I sport peppers. Yeah.

1109
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,600
A nice maybe one of the more unique ingredients.

1110
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,760
I wrote disgusting in the best way.

1111
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,120
Ah, mm hmm.

1112
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,720
Because what you're after with hot dog, if you're after especially the Disney,

1113
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,240
it's not going to be a classy hot dog.

1114
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,320
If you want, like all the all the layers of like fake cheese

1115
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,320
and artificial color, whatever.

1116
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,080
If it all goes good, like it all goes together.

1117
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,000
And yes, I found it very good.

1118
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,440
I found it satisfying in in a trashy way.

1119
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,600
Yeah. If you want an indulgent kind of like carnival theme

1120
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,040
parky kind of lunch, this is this is a good a good one.

1121
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1122
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,080
Also noticed at this location, hot dogs.

1123
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,280
Unless I'm wrong. I mean, it's possible these are all the same dog.

1124
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,960
But I felt like it was a little longer.

1125
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,920
I think you maybe got it was longer.

1126
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,680
You're right. Yeah.

1127
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,120
Could it have been the same ingredients in the dog?

1128
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,200
Probably. But I don't know. Yes.

1129
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,560
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe they just they just cut them a little longer.

1130
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,960
It could have been it could have been tasted worse, honestly.

1131
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,200
All the ingredients were slopped on there and it didn't even matter.

1132
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,880
Yeah. I think you got to give it up.

1133
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,920
That's that's one way to notch up hot dog in scoring is if you feel like

1134
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,320
you're getting some value. Yeah.

1135
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,920
And a little bit of bonus every inch counts. Yes, that's true.

1136
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,680
Even if it's just a little bit.

1137
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,400
That's right. It's doing something.

1138
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,160
It's doing something.

1139
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,960
So then we move to the other dog from this location.

1140
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,200
The mac and cheese dog topped with bacon bits.

1141
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,800
That's the full description.

1142
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,200
There's no further way to the bacon.

1143
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,440
Bits always taste a little bit like dog treats.

1144
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,160
Yeah. This bacon, on the other hand, sucked.

1145
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,920
Yeah, that's not. Yeah.

1146
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,560
No. And bits coming right after a full hearty piece.

1147
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,280
Bits cannot hold up to a piece.

1148
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,240
I don't know. Yeah.

1149
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,440
It's they eat all the way.

1150
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,400
Peace all the way.

1151
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,480
Peace all the way. I don't know how they cook these bits.

1152
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,360
It seemed remarkably different.

1153
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,840
I didn't like they didn't just cook strips and pound them with a hammer.

1154
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,040
Pound them. Jason just made a pounding motion.

1155
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,160
It was not. They were bigger, but they were less flavorful and greasier.

1156
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,280
These are OK. So this is this.

1157
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,800
This is basically the same.

1158
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,080
I will sometimes have the mac and cheese cone in Cars Land with the cone.

1159
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,960
It's got the like bread kind of bowl that's in the shape of a cone.

1160
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,360
And this is the exact same mac and cheese, exact same bacon bits.

1161
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,200
And these are consistent.

1162
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,640
I don't hate the bacon bits as much as yours as you do, but they're not.

1163
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,240
They don't taste like they should call it something different.

1164
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,680
So my expectations are not set for bacon.

1165
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,920
I don't know if the meat meat bites meat.

1166
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,880
Just make it more generic or something.

1167
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,920
And I'm I don't have the expectation of bacon.

1168
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,320
Then. Yeah, sure, sure.

1169
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,200
But you OK, so you're you're OK with you like that mac and cheese.

1170
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,320
It's separately you've been OK with.

1171
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,200
Yeah. And OK is a good word where it's like, I got to eat something quick

1172
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,240
and I can walk around with it and then I can eat the cone.

1173
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,040
It's kind of nothing.

1174
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,400
It's it's like a less it's like a less good Stouffer's mac and cheese.

1175
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,800
Like it's not a lot of texture.

1176
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,440
It's just really creamy.

1177
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,080
It's it's just kind of a nonentity.

1178
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,200
I judge mac and cheese pretty harshly because I try to not have it very often.

1179
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,520
I want that to be like a real treat, really done well.

1180
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,040
If I'm going to go for it,

1181
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,240
some sort of like gastropub or indulgent restaurant setting.

1182
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,080
So if it lets me down and it's just boring and nothing,

1183
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,200
what a bummer, because I'm probably not going to use that slot again

1184
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,040
for a little bit.

1185
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,400
Scott, I'm right there with you.

1186
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,520
I like a really nice like baked or homemade mac and cheese.

1187
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,480
Or I want a Kraft Blue Box.

1188
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,520
I want the the shaky the bag of powder.

1189
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,520
Oh, sure. Milk and butter that you do to your taste.

1190
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,400
What about Amy? Do you do Amy's ever?

1191
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,320
I like Amy's. Yeah, I like those.

1192
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,000
Strong one. Sure. Yeah.

1193
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,200
Amy's good shells, I believe you can do.

1194
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,720
I've done shells. I've done the fun rabbit shapes.

1195
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,640
I can make shells like a licensed character shape.

1196
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,600
Well, sure. Yeah. Or whatever.

1197
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,160
You know, I'm one of those in a while.

1198
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,600
At some point in my parenting journey, I'm sure I will.

1199
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,600
Yeah. The whole thing about I think with this,

1200
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,120
but with this dog is maybe all of this.

1201
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,520
Something I realized about my own taste.

1202
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,040
I think I need something to cut through.

1203
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,120
And that can be a little bit of spice or something,

1204
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,680
even a little bitter or just like an interesting crunch or a texture.

1205
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,440
Like if it's all if all the components are bland

1206
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,440
and there's not like the one ingredient, if it's all base

1207
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,240
and then there's no there's nothing up high end

1208
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,280
like gliding through the base, then that doesn't work for me.

1209
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,040
And this all just felt like, you know, you need like that.

1210
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,560
I think a snap can be that there was no snapping, I would say all day.

1211
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,080
That's another big detriment to all of these dogs.

1212
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,120
That's why I was also like, this is Nathan's,

1213
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,800
like bottom of the barrel, like licensed hot dog.

1214
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,880
This is not a real Nathan's hot dog.

1215
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,920
The smallest screen that IMAX offers.

1216
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,280
Even like a true poorly prepared Nathan's hot dogs still has the spices

1217
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,800
and a little bit of snap.

1218
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,400
Does anyone make a Nathan's around here?

1219
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,600
I don't think I've ever had enough.

1220
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,160
I mean, maybe I haven't just didn't realize it,

1221
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,040
but is there a place to get a Nathan's hot dog that I've always heard

1222
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,680
so much about?

1223
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,080
Buy them at the store and pan fry them yourself.

1224
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
All right. I want to do that, though.

1225
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,000
I want someone to make it for me.

1226
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Some places do use Nathan's as their stock.

1227
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,200
OK. Nathan's are Hebrew national, I think, are the high end of like

1228
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,080
easily acquired hot dogs. Yeah.

1229
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,080
I'm a Vienna beef guy because that's like a Portillo style,

1230
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,760
which I late tried to float to Scott the idea that we were going to take you

1231
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,320
and us to Portillo's last night to finish off this.

1232
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,040
But we did not do it. You didn't tell me that.

1233
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,840
No, I did. Would you have gone for it?

1234
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,640
He'd have no choice. He's in the car.

1235
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,960
Yeah, I would have gone, but I would have opted for a cake shake.

1236
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,240
All that then a cake for all that. That's right.

1237
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,760
Yes. God, because I don't know.

1238
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,520
After we went to the Woodbridge mall, Mike and I went to a Portillo's drive

1239
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,040
through. I've never had a cake.

1240
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,400
Honestly, I demolished a cake.

1241
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,160
The cake shake was immediately so good.

1242
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,440
And I was I was like, as I as I picked it up, I was like,

1243
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,760
I'm not going to drink all this.

1244
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,960
And I think by the time I was walking to Mike's family's house, it was like

1245
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,440
finish the cake shake.

1246
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,720
You were you're a treat terminator.

1247
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,440
You can't be stopped like you just treat terminate.

1248
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,640
I do control myself because as we were walking towards the exit last night,

1249
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,080
I was like, I might get ice cream.

1250
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,160
And I was like, no, don't push your luck. Just get a treat to go.

1251
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,480
It's like you see the world through the terminator eyes and like there's targets

1252
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,960
and then like ice cream target identified.

1253
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,320
Yeah. Rocky Road.

1254
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,720
If there was going to be art of Jason as the treat terminator,

1255
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,760
like are the sort of the robot parts replaced with ice cream cones and

1256
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,720
and hot dogs and is the red is the red robot eye a big cherry?

1257
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,400
Well, yeah, you know what? I think it's that's good.

1258
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,400
But it's also like some of the robot parts are like an ice cream scooper

1259
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,680
on the end of one of the arm like it would be more like two thousand rather than.

1260
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,240
Yeah, it could be like T one thousand where he can kind of change his shape.

1261
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,760
So it could be like his arm changes into ice cream scooper or like a cake slicer or.

1262
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1263
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,560
The pizza roller.

1264
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,320
I was going to say, what's the thing that you make ice cream in?

1265
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,080
Oh, just an ice cream.

1266
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,520
Like a tumbler crank.

1267
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1268
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,240
So imagine, yeah, Robert Patrick's arms turn into an ice cream maker with a crank.

1269
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,160
This is really I leave that up to you.

1270
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,840
You want to use Arnold as a base.

1271
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,400
Do you want it to be Robert Patrick?

1272
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,120
Well, however, I just want some version of this to exist.

1273
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,920
I think somebody will help us out.

1274
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,240
I think we know we're heading with these.

1275
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,840
You want to lock in our scores for the two refreshment corner locations.

1276
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,160
Let's see. I think I know it.

1277
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,920
Yeah. Locking it in. OK.

1278
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,120
And as you guys continue to lock in now, we, I believe,

1279
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,560
move over to the hot dog that we had a sit down reservation.

1280
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,200
We reserved a spot at the Craftsman Bar, a location

1281
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,120
we really like in the Grand California Hotel.

1282
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,720
One of the great recent additions, this wonderful where you get the vibe

1283
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,400
of the hotel pool and the and the fake Sequoia

1284
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,200
vibes as well.

1285
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,120
This what a relaxing, what a great place.

1286
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,560
And I was delighted to discover that they have a hot dog of the month

1287
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,440
that rotates through their lineup.

1288
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,440
Food there, I've always found pretty solid, great place to drink to.

1289
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,240
So I was really looking forward to this

1290
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,240
and kind of delighted that they had a hot dog of the month. Yes.

1291
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,040
Do we also?

1292
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,840
Well, here, let's I guess let's say it first.

1293
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,440
With Jason, you had a little more Intel.

1294
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,960
It's a little not archived, but you found a little something about.

1295
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,920
So like on the QR code menu you had to use, it just said hot dog of the month.

1296
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,640
But I ask your server.

1297
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,960
Yeah, ask your server, which is always funny.

1298
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,200
Could you? Yes.

1299
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,040
What's your wine list and what is the hot dog of the month?

1300
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,600
But on the regular browser website, hot dog of the month

1301
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
this month, just the month of May, pretty new.

1302
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,680
The Gordito dog beef hot dog on lightly grilled flatbread

1303
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,840
with black bean spread, melted cheese, cream up pica de gallo

1304
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,560
and micro cilantro served with tortilla chips.

1305
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,840
Incorrect. We got seasoned fries.

1306
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,560
The menu said chips and we got the fries felt strange.

1307
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,080
But delicious.

1308
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:38,000
The fries were very easily some of the best fries on Disney property.

1309
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,200
Great batter. Yeah, boy, that is a yeah.

1310
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,880
But I'll be looking out for fries at that location.

1311
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,480
Now, we talked about eliminating this because it's it's kind of heading

1312
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,480
into Rontorap territory.

1313
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,800
I think the naming of hot dog of the month is what kept it in the competition.

1314
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,280
It is still a hot dog.

1315
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,640
And look, it is look, it's a wiener inside at the end of the day.

1316
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,800
It's a wiener. That's right.

1317
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,640
I this didn't work for me.

1318
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,280
No, no, no, no, no.

1319
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,440
Did Jason disagree? It was delicious.

1320
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,080
I thought it was delicious, but with some faults.

1321
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,880
OK, OK. All of those toppings.

1322
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:21,000
This is I think all those individual toppings I liked.

1323
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,800
But when you put them all together on flatbread

1324
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,520
that admittedly had been cut into three portions.

1325
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,680
Yes, we may have destroyed a lot of these with the methods.

1326
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,920
We got like a gooey or sauce or something.

1327
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,960
And with the goo goo is the word I was going to use.

1328
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,720
All of these toppings kind of destroyed the texture.

1329
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,280
It just felt like a big goo dog.

1330
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,160
But a big goo dog.

1331
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,280
I and the dog, I'm pretty sure it was just the same hot dog.

1332
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,320
I think it's exactly the same hot dog everywhere else.

1333
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,600
Yeah, this is where I would expect, if not an elevated dog,

1334
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,880
at least a charred dog a little.

1335
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,200
Yes. And because the like the pizzas at that spot are fantastic.

1336
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,360
I actually really like the food at this bar.

1337
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,360
It's not just like, you know,

1338
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,920
theme park food, but arranged better on a plate.

1339
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,120
Yeah. Lobster quesadilla. Very tasty.

1340
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,080
Man, for sharing, do not eat it yourself. You will feel bad.

1341
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,080
I learned this the hard way about two months ago. OK, OK.

1342
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,040
I but I was trying to taste some of this stuff, like even I was trying

1343
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,880
to get the pico de gallo alone.

1344
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,880
If you noticed, I was eating pieces of the pico de gallo alone and I go,

1345
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,160
I don't think this pico de gallo is very good.

1346
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,640
Yeah, I agree. I did not like very fresh.

1347
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,960
It was not individual ingredients.

1348
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,520
Yeah. And it was it was gooey and like the bean sauce was OK.

1349
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,040
And it was obscuring every other taste.

1350
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:41,040
And it wasn't particularly it wasn't anything more special than a Taco Bell

1351
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,000
bean, like which I have once a week.

1352
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So I know I know my Taco Bell beans. Come on. Once a week.

1353
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,880
Good question. Maybe it's usually at least once.

1354
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,400
And yeah, it's sort of I couldn't taste the hot dog at all.

1355
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,520
You taste this kind of like non flavorful bean sauce.

1356
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,880
Couldn't taste the pico de gallo at all.

1357
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,880
And then the wrap was just very bland and like didn't taste like anything.

1358
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,840
It wasn't like a delicious flour tortilla or anything.

1359
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,360
Yeah. And it didn't have that didn't have the char that you can maybe end up with.

1360
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,200
Yeah. Yeah.

1361
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,920
Rontos. You can't help but compare it to Ronto.

1362
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,560
I feel like. Oh, yeah. Get that flatbread as part of it.

1363
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,920
This is a good idea, I guess.

1364
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,640
But I don't the execution and the ingredients I was very disappointed in.

1365
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,440
Excited when we asked the server.

1366
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,960
I was looking forward to it.

1367
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:34,040
Yeah. I did then feel the most shame of the day when she brought our drinks

1368
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,640
and then said, and you guys are you're just doing the hot dog of the month.

1369
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,280
Yes, I yes, I also felt shame there as well.

1370
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,280
Yeah. Yeah. And we thought about ordering a second one.

1371
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,640
Yeah, but I'm glad we didn't.

1372
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,040
It was bad. Yeah. Probably better.

1373
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,160
We didn't. Wow. I didn't realize you guys felt so strongly.

1374
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,400
We were kind of pulling our punches yesterday in terms of our reaction.

1375
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,440
We all looked down. We're all staring.

1376
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,680
I feel like at the table.

1377
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,680
Yeah. Some of the reaction like you couldn't help making a comment or two.

1378
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,240
You're there. And that's facial reactions.

1379
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,920
I feel like we all had like a oh yeah.

1380
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Couldn't hold it back entirely.

1381
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
Can I talk about my error?

1382
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,160
My like yellow.

1383
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,440
Oh, I know what it is now. Yes. Yeah.

1384
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,680
So I didn't feel like ordering a cocktail.

1385
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,480
You guys had some beautiful looking ginger margaritas.

1386
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,560
How were they? Very good. Very fun.

1387
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,520
A good first like drink.

1388
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,360
A little sugary.

1389
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,480
So that's like your first one.

1390
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,560
And then you could change to something relaxing.

1391
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,000
And yeah, I didn't really feel like a drink.

1392
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,920
I cocktail cocktail.

1393
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,720
I wanted a little sugar kick.

1394
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,920
I noticed a lot of places are starting to add, you know, mocktails,

1395
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,360
non-alcoholic cocktails.

1396
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,560
I thought I would try that.

1397
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
So I ordered the coconut fruit punch,

1398
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,880
which was just essentially like a Mike style candy drink.

1399
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,480
Simply fruit punch, coconut water, simply limeade, vitamin water,

1400
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,400
energy, tropical citrus with a splash of Sprite.

1401
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,400
And then there were coconut shavings on top.

1402
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,280
This made me feel so puffy.

1403
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,040
It was delicious.

1404
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:09,640
But even more so than the multiple hot dog segments I'd eaten,

1405
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,640
finishing this whole like tall glass of fruit punch, candy juice,

1406
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,120
which is not surprisingly for a man who likes sweets.

1407
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,560
Fruit punch is not often a go to.

1408
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,560
It tasted good.

1409
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,840
It was something different.

1410
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:29,640
But I was like I was happy for the walk to California Adventure

1411
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,960
to before we had to eat more hot dogs.

1412
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,160
I would say any break in the hot dog eating was was crucial.

1413
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,280
Yes. Much needed.

1414
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,400
Yeah. Well, you know, we all had to think about how we're going to pace ourselves

1415
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,520
and what's going to help us along.

1416
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,000
Yes. Drinking a bunch of candy.

1417
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,080
Maybe not a good idea.

1418
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,920
Today, I'm feeling like having a bunch of wine and beer was not a good idea.

1419
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,720
But, you know, hey, it made me it made it go down smoother.

1420
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,240
Give me the energy I needed during the day.

1421
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,600
So no regrets then.

1422
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,480
Yeah. You know, here's what I think.

1423
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,480
I think that this this program, the Hot Dog of the Month program

1424
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,000
at the Craftsman Bar, I think a different craftsman

1425
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,800
Hot Dog of the Month could take it.

1426
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,640
I feel that they have quality in them.

1427
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,560
But I don't know that this one or just did not work for me.

1428
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,360
I think recently there was like a pig in the blanket style dog.

1429
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,480
When I was there before, it was a pastrami dog.

1430
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,240
OK, yeah, I think they're I think they're getting too full of themselves over there

1431
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,120
and they're thinking they can do anything at that kitchen and they can't.

1432
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,800
You can't put anything on it.

1433
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,000
Anything doesn't work.

1434
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,960
You know, like I think just play it a little bit more like with the with the hits.

1435
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,240
Play it a little more with what works.

1436
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,080
Pigs in a blanket. It works. Chicago dog. Sure.

1437
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,120
Always rely. I don't think I've I'm sure there's bad Chicago dogs,

1438
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,280
but I feel like just there's so many toppings.

1439
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,040
It's a great preparation of hot dog. Yeah, yeah, I agree.

1440
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,040
Not one of those yesterday. OK, well, we do.

1441
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,840
We feel good. We want to.

1442
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,520
By the way, I should put

1443
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,080
fractions, decimals on the table.

1444
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,160
I don't think it has to be a clean.

1445
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,760
I'm doing point by I'm doing point five.

1446
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,760
All right. Five. Yeah.

1447
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,480
All right. Great. Do point to twos.

1448
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,880
Do point nine one six, whatever you want to do.

1449
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,080
Yeah, I think I've locked mine in.

1450
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,560
OK, so now we keep moving to another one of the primary spots

1451
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,800
where hot dogs can be found and expectations

1452
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,720
should be high. Hot dogs being there, their bread and butter.

1453
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,640
Yeah. And that is the infamous award wieners.

1454
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,280
Well, we did something. Oh, you're totally right.

1455
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,800
I apologize. I don't mean to cut you out.

1456
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,240
No, no, you are correct.

1457
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,440
Because at this point in the day, really, what we did

1458
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,640
was go and check in again on the once closed ballast point,

1459
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,600
because that junkyard dog I saw with my own eyes.

1460
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,600
Yeah. And I really think this thing has what it takes to to take it all the way.

1461
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,680
It was a very impressive looking hot dog.

1462
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,360
We walk up to ballast point and ask if we could get a table for three.

1463
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,920
And it is a it is an attitude.

1464
01:07:54,920 --> 01:08:00,760
It is a scoff is what I feel like the idea that we could be so foolish

1465
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,240
as to think we could just waltz right up to ballast point.

1466
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,400
It was Spago table Beverly Hills.

1467
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,840
And we were like dressed in like the worst

1468
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,680
like the newspaper and like we our hair was messed up.

1469
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,240
And we were like just came from like sweeping a chimney or something.

1470
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,200
And we were like, table now.

1471
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,240
That was the attitude we got from the person at you.

1472
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,040
Ballast. Well, you want to eat here.

1473
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,120
Spago actually very accommodating.

1474
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,240
A lot of rich people look like shit in there.

1475
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,840
OK, fine. Like shit.

1476
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:34,400
And I have been it's always a pretty utilitarian.

1477
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,040
Like you can probably just walk into the bar, order the full menu.

1478
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,880
Yeah. Well, Mr.

1479
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,640
Mr. Fancy, again, trying to go better.

1480
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,800
And anyway, let's get back to my real passion. Hot dogs.

1481
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,000
Yeah. Yeah. And I was like, oh, yeah, I know.

1482
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,080
I mean, who are we to think that we could just walk up here

1483
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:57,520
at three thirty on a Tuesday and get a table to get a beer and a hot dog?

1484
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,760
I mean, this place obviously is always jammed to the brim.

1485
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,520
It's not. And by the way, and the precedent has said that like,

1486
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,480
you know, you can check for later today,

1487
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,920
but you kind of got to do it days in advance.

1488
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,600
Also, already weird, because that hostess, the host stand always there.

1489
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,840
I'd never seen anyone there before.

1490
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,960
You have. I have.

1491
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,720
Have you because a month ago,

1492
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,920
I walked up during a lunch rush and said, hey, do you have a table?

1493
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,040
I had a 10 minute wait and walked right up.

1494
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,200
And I and the time before that and the time before that.

1495
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,080
Ballast Point was becoming a go to.

1496
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,000
And I never waited more than 10 minutes, sometimes walked right up

1497
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,600
at a like a busy lunchtime and it was fine.

1498
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,520
This new thing of you got to do it days in advance.

1499
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,120
What do you mean on open table?

1500
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,920
Uh huh. Not on the kids.

1501
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,360
Do it off Disneyland dot com.

1502
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,560
There's no way to find a way to make reservations.

1503
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,800
Ballast Point. You fucked up.

1504
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,200
I was so ready to give you another chance.

1505
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,240
Yes. And if everybody doesn't know, Jason has been mad at Ballast Point

1506
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:00,120
ever since he saw in a grocery store that their beer was a dollar

1507
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,160
more than a normal beer.

1508
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,720
They're all. And you know what?

1509
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,400
There's so many more microbreweries available now, making just as good

1510
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,160
for less per unit.

1511
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,960
And another, if you if you don't remember that, I find one of the famous

1512
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,080
catchphrases of the show was born that day.

1513
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,720
I don't think we've referenced it in a while.

1514
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,440
I believe it was correct me if I'm wrong.

1515
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,360
Who gives a fuck about grapefruit?

1516
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,320
Yeah. Who gives a shit about grapefruit?

1517
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,400
Who gives a shit about grapefruit?

1518
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,560
Yeah, because we were just talking about the grapefruit.

1519
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,560
The raw anger that you were boiling, boiling like a hot dog.

1520
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,640
And it turned out Jason was right.

1521
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,280
I guess Ballast Point would come to bite us.

1522
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,240
I was ready to let bygones be bygones.

1523
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,560
I was ready like, you know what?

1524
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,120
Let's give him another shot.

1525
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,760
Because my experience has usually been

1526
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,160
the other kind of annoying where it's like you walk upstairs

1527
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,160
and it's kind of like first come first serve ever man for himself.

1528
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,400
That kind of bar thing where you just kind of have to sit and wait.

1529
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,760
Are you are you leaving?

1530
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,360
Are you like indoor or outdoors?

1531
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,240
Or you just walk into the bar.

1532
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,520
I was and I wouldn't see. I'll just take.

1533
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,160
Hey, what do you want?

1534
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,240
You know, that's that's been my experience.

1535
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,040
Yeah. What happened?

1536
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,240
This had this had become I declared this.

1537
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,400
This is my new favorite and Disney.

1538
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,320
Oh, wow. And how does it suddenly within a month?

1539
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,960
It is a line out the door.

1540
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,840
Is this shape X fault somehow?

1541
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,000
It's got to be. Got to be.

1542
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,520
Got to be. Yeah.

1543
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,320
It would be DeSantis fault somehow.

1544
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,120
I know this is California, but this might this might be

1545
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,920
retribution in some ways.

1546
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,040
Fucking with Ballast Point.

1547
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,880
So but what they didn't count on and I did.

1548
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,520
You know, I didn't make the the hostess deal with this.

1549
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,960
This isn't on her.

1550
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,440
It's on the corporation. Of course.

1551
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,080
But I say now at anyone from the corporation listening,

1552
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,840
you didn't realize that you were shooing away people with a platform.

1553
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,520
Unbelievable microphones and that you have just publicly, humiliatingly

1554
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,480
been withdrawn from consideration for the hot dog hullabaloo.

1555
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,680
You could have been had this crown like this little like trophy

1556
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,960
now on your mantle of winning this prestigious new award from our

1557
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,720
most beloved of all theme park slash food, all food podcasts,

1558
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,440
any food podcasts were the obviously the most popular one.

1559
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,400
Yes, very much.

1560
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,560
And you could have won this award from us.

1561
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,600
And yeah, maybe you were a little cranky when Jason put you on blast

1562
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,200
a few years ago, but this would have redeemed you.

1563
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,000
And now look what you've done.

1564
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,560
Look what you've done.

1565
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,440
No reason. When you when these faces walk up, you find a spot.

1566
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,840
You tell some other people to scram.

1567
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,480
Yeah. Tell some people who don't know who don't even like imagine

1568
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,800
not having a podcast. Our photos point.

1569
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,480
And they're letting non podcast havers eat up there.

1570
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,240
Any mall outside a theme park, there should be three little pictures

1571
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,680
by the podium of our three faces.

1572
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,600
The opposite of banning people from the gates.

1573
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,680
Yeah, exactly. Yes.

1574
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:52,640
Always, always allow in because we weren't going to we're not.

1575
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,480
We don't brag. We don't say look at our podcasts.

1576
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,520
Let me show you the downloads.

1577
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,520
We don't say stuff like that when we go around.

1578
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,640
We're all but humble podcasters.

1579
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,480
But that's just because we don't want to say it.

1580
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,800
We want you to be able to identify us.

1581
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,160
So we have to pretend to be likable. Right.

1582
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,160
Pretend so anyone will listen. Exactly.

1583
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,680
But out in. Oh, you should see.

1584
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,360
You should see how we have to be because if we we don't come in

1585
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,360
with an attitude, this is what happens.

1586
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,680
And I'm looking out for them.

1587
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:26,280
I don't why I didn't want Ballast Point to suffer a humiliating blow

1588
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,160
in the hot dog hullabaloo, but they did it.

1589
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,640
They did it to themselves.

1590
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:34,280
And then to make it even worse, I said, well, maybe we should just drive

1591
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,320
to Long Beach, which is where Ballast Point has another spot.

1592
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,840
Right. We were thinking about and we were with any of you know, right.

1593
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,680
And we were like, well, we're trying to help balance point out.

1594
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,360
And we looked and we said, OK, well, it's 30 minutes away.

1595
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,000
It's not so bad. It's inconvenient, but not so bad.

1596
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,720
And then we looked at the menu.

1597
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,680
There is not the word junkyard and there's not the word dog.

1598
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,840
Junkyard dog on the long beach.

1599
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,640
Ballast Point.

1600
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,720
We would have made a special trip off property and still given it to the if

1601
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,960
if it merited it, if it merited, we could have still won.

1602
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:12,120
And no, they but they don't have that dog in Long Beach.

1603
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,800
They deny they're like, you guys don't deserve cooked food,

1604
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,160
actual cooked food today.

1605
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,360
I even asked, do you do take out on Google?

1606
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,360
Less than says dine in, take out what?

1607
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,760
So lies about when they open.

1608
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:33,360
So lies about take out lies about we've always been an establishment

1609
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,160
that you must book. We that you know, that big beverage,

1610
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,560
you know, conglomerate who owns them now.

1611
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,400
Now, yeah, they're the ones jacking that dollar.

1612
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,040
Slipping a few years ago.

1613
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,960
I already saw it. Jason had it.

1614
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,080
I thought the wind changing.

1615
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,480
Would ultimately pay off here.

1616
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,600
What sort of thing doesn't happen at Golden Road?

1617
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,440
It's also owned by a massive beverage conglomerate.

1618
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,800
That's the haven't had any bad experiences.

1619
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,960
So, oh, well, well, yeah, is it?

1620
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,520
Yeah, that's I think that's what I objected to in that argument is like,

1621
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,440
yeah, imagine being part of a conglomerate.

1622
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,200
Now let's continue our show where we talk about things put out by nothing

1623
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,760
but conglomerates every single week.

1624
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:17,760
Well, that was the big lesson of the doubt that there's a deal is that all of these

1625
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:23,200
were owned by like a massive eyeglass conglomerate, a flip flop conglomerate.

1626
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,920
Like it was just so much more sinister than city walk.

1627
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,840
It's all conglomerates. Yeah.

1628
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,120
So many conglomerates.

1629
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,520
All we can do is track their boring names

1630
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,440
and try to enjoy their product, but they wouldn't let us.

1631
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,880
So you're out. You lose zeros all around.

1632
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:44,360
And thus we we took it to a place that would never turn us away

1633
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:48,160
and that takes pride in hot dogs, and that is award wieners.

1634
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:54,440
Award wieners, one of the pun based Hollywood locations that has remained.

1635
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:00,560
They it's keeping that DCA one point of spirit alive.

1636
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:07,160
The full title, they've got the subtitle of its award wieners in a supporting role.

1637
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,960
I might be missing part of that title.

1638
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,000
I like that. I think that is what it is.

1639
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,280
There's a big statue that's kind of a fake Oscar holding a hot dog.

1640
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,680
I'll make sure I have the copy totally correct.

1641
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,720
But fun play.

1642
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,320
Were you were you guys previously familiar with a best wiener in a award?

1643
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,280
Wieners best wiener in a supporting role as the full title.

1644
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,080
Were you were you guys previously experienced with award winners?

1645
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,360
Sure. Yeah, I've had award winners over the years.

1646
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,320
This the menus changed a lot over the years.

1647
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,600
I think a little better right now.

1648
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,800
A little bit on an upswing.

1649
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,640
This was unfortunately one of the L's we took.

1650
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,800
Mike Mobile ordered the dogs here real quick.

1651
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,000
We got a mountain of a lot of blame being put on Mike.

1652
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,080
No, no, I should have been.

1653
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,200
I should have been looking out.

1654
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,360
This location has something they call film strip

1655
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,240
fries, which are kind of fluffy.

1656
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:09,080
I don't know, like a potato chip shaped French fry.

1657
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,600
I don't know how to describe them. They're good.

1658
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,680
The film strip fries are good. I recommend.

1659
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,520
I think QDs.

1660
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,000
Oh, yes. Well, I think QDs were good for offsetting

1661
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,520
everything we're doing to ourselves.

1662
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,280
So I have no regrets about the QDs.

1663
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,000
I'm also the one time I went here before had those film strip fries.

1664
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,440
Did not like them at all.

1665
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,720
You did. We were on different sides of the spectrum.

1666
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,320
Those were like chalky and hard.

1667
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,080
And I, I, they were.

1668
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,840
I think I got them like fresh out of the fryer a few months ago.

1669
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,560
And and they were.

1670
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,600
Or they've up their game.

1671
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,960
I had this. I did the film strip fries years ago.

1672
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,080
Are they these? Yeah.

1673
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,640
Little curly guys. Little curly.

1674
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,520
Kind of like fair food. Don't like that.

1675
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,800
I've never had. I do not like these.

1676
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,480
You're going to have to break the tie at some point.

1677
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,000
OK, I have to get some film strip fries.

1678
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,520
Go down tonight. I'm a sucker if I see curly fries, crinkle cut

1679
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,320
frat like something that's not just a straight fry.

1680
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,880
Yeah, but these didn't do it.

1681
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,000
I OK. Yeah, I don't know.

1682
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,800
It's fair.

1683
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,640
Probably would have racked us just like the junkyard dog.

1684
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:08,640
That's part of it. Yes.

1685
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,880
Throwing off the equilibrium. Absolutely.

1686
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:16,400
I think we needed those cuties just to the cuties like slowed us down.

1687
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,520
Presumably gave it if nothing else, like the little like the

1688
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,640
the water inside them was probably good for us.

1689
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,640
Yeah, that was.

1690
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,760
The first item that we had here, the bacon street dog.

1691
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,640
That is an all beef hot dog dipped in a house made roasted red pepper

1692
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,640
ketchup topped with grilled onions, bell peppers and crispy bacon

1693
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,280
crumbles served on a toasted bun potentially with film strip fries,

1694
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,440
but not in our case with a little cutie.

1695
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,080
What do we think of the bacon street dog?

1696
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,680
Good. I liked it. Yeah, I liked it.

1697
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,600
Kind of folded Texas toast, the toasted buns.

1698
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,080
I feel like I saw a surprise to me first time I went. Yeah.

1699
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,800
Yeah, I'm not sure I feel about the Texas toast.

1700
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,000
I thought better.

1701
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,840
I thought it was more of a split top bun, like a lobster roll bun.

1702
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,320
But no, it was more like a folded piece of Texas toast.

1703
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:10,160
But not buttered, not like butter.

1704
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,040
Yes, this is the problem.

1705
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,200
Because what's the point of having all this extra bread

1706
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,960
if it's not going to be a big sweet piece of Texas toast?

1707
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,560
Well, but it held together, I think, better than the stale buns everywhere else.

1708
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,480
Well, the stale buns, yes, are bad.

1709
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,160
But I'm just saying if you're going to get a big piece of bread,

1710
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,640
that's you're getting more calories or, you know, than a normal roll

1711
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,920
or a normal bun, why would you not want it to be fun then?

1712
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,760
What's the point of having more bread if it's not a different taste or more fun?

1713
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:39,960
You know what I'm saying?

1714
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,040
Because if it's Texas toast, the fun of Texas toast is that it's buttered.

1715
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,840
Yeah, it's indulgent. Yeah, exactly.

1716
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,200
It's like almost a piece of French toast.

1717
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:48,960
Like what's the point?

1718
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,360
We may as well just have a regular, a smaller piece of toast.

1719
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,280
If you want to do a different texture, that's fine.

1720
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,640
I got to say this, though.

1721
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,400
I I'm not craving butter to be dripping off either.

1722
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,120
These are the heaviest dogs we had.

1723
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,640
No, I don't want a butter.

1724
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,280
I'm just saying there's no reason to have that much bread

1725
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,800
if it's not some fun element.

1726
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,360
You may as well have less bread because it's not like it's adding

1727
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,120
some extra fun, crazy element to it.

1728
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,360
That's all I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1729
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,640
More more bread, not of the yeah. Yeah.

1730
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,800
I don't know. I got to say I was a fan of this, though.

1731
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,560
I agree. Yeah.

1732
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,880
And as opposed to those previous bacon bits, these bacon crumbles,

1733
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:26,640
I was scraping up, I was grabbing them off the plate, the ones that fell off.

1734
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,680
I thought the the peppers were delicious.

1735
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,480
And now here we get like this is stuff that's cutting through.

1736
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,520
It's biting its spice and its texture.

1737
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,160
Yes, that mac and cheese on top.

1738
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,240
It's just it's cream on bread on like uniform meat.

1739
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,840
I need little I need like little bits that are fun to,

1740
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,240
you know, toss around in my mouth before they add down the hatch.

1741
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,280
The red pepper ketchup.

1742
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,520
The red pepper ketchup. Good.

1743
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,560
I good. The best condiments of the day.

1744
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,120
The peppers all fresh.

1745
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,960
Are you like felt like much more fresh?

1746
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,560
All that stuff felt much more fresh than anything in the special.

1747
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,280
Yeah, I agree.

1748
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,640
Yeah, I yeah.

1749
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,960
You know what? The fan, that's kind of all I got to say about it.

1750
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,760
I liked it.

1751
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,720
Mm hmm.

1752
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,040
The other one from this location, the Uptown Chili Dog,

1753
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,920
an all beef hot dog topped with homestyle chili,

1754
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:21,880
pepper, jack cheese and corn chips served on toasted by Texas toast.

1755
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,600
What do you think of Uptown Chili Dog?

1756
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,000
All right. Well, a big thing of mine going in is that I usually avoid

1757
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,720
chili dogs at theme parks because they have made me sick multiple times.

1758
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:37,320
Now, I think both of those signs were coming out of Universal Studios Hollywood.

1759
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:41,280
Looking back, maybe one Hollywood, one Florida.

1760
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,200
So that said, I was a little hesitant about the specter of any chili.

1761
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,960
Now, I was looking forward to the chili one because I was feeding off.

1762
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,000
You were just so excited for Ballast Point.

1763
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,560
Of course, that defeated us.

1764
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,600
I was bracing myself for this chili dog.

1765
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,000
Happy to see Fritos.

1766
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,240
I so rarely eat Fritos.

1767
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:09,200
Now, as we were eating it, I had a something come over me and I said,

1768
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,520
I believe.

1769
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,920
That this is Hormel chili.

1770
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,240
I wrote down the quote, it was because there was there was

1771
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,040
there were these pregnant pauses.

1772
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,240
I am I am reasonably certain

1773
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,520
this is Hormel chili.

1774
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,360
It just felt as I said, you know,

1775
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,600
it today's the Star Wars day as we're recording this.

1776
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,960
I said I felt a presence I've not felt in a long time.

1777
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,480
I am pretty sure in the way that like the the mac and cheese

1778
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:49,280
or the man chees earlier, I don't necessarily think was so first.

1779
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,600
But it was in the ballpark of Stouffer's this.

1780
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,640
I was like, I think this was an industrial fat of Hormel.

1781
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,560
Like, that's what I couldn't tell is if that's a good thing or bad thing.

1782
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:58,400
I don't know. It was unclear.

1783
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,280
I think I want a little something if I'm cooking it at home. Fine.

1784
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,960
But I think I just want a little something more.

1785
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:11,320
This this taste it like someone wrote down the concept of a chili.

1786
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,680
It was just kind of nothing.

1787
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,760
This one was kind of nothing. It didn't do it for me.

1788
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,480
I did not know that was pepper jack cheese until you read the description.

1789
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,040
That's yeah, I felt the same way.

1790
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,000
I was surprised when I saw it.

1791
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,600
You want that to be the little spice that cuts through. Did not.

1792
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,560
I didn't hate this. Yeah, I didn't hate it.

1793
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,920
But it was it doesn't all work together.

1794
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,120
I feel like temperatures were off.

1795
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,520
The chili should have been a little warmer.

1796
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,720
I mean, I know it's impossible the way they do everything, but it just did.

1797
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:42,360
And it didn't gel in the way that that street dog did, wherever you all the flavors

1798
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,000
worked together to make one special taste.

1799
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:48,880
Nothing, by the way, nothing like an actual L.A. street dog.

1800
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,640
Well, you're a big.

1801
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,880
I've never actually even gotten one.

1802
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,920
But yeah, I'll turn around after we leave a wrestling show or a concert.

1803
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,600
And Jason's right at the vendor getting one of those sizzling.

1804
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,920
They're good. I'm not even putting.

1805
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,880
I mean, I have some I don't like this strip of mayo on it.

1806
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:09,960
But if they have like a little green salsa or a little avocado or nacho cheese,

1807
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,040
I'll take a little.

1808
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,520
Those grills that kind of like, you know, summon the flavors of the onions

1809
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:20,240
and like the hot dogs are imbued with like anything else that hit that grill

1810
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,680
in a good way. Yeah.

1811
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,720
Those post Hollywood Bowl show. That's fantastic.

1812
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,640
Yeah. It's like George Carlin's character, Jersey Girl, says,

1813
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,680
don't pour out the grease.

1814
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,080
I need something. I need to cook the pork roll in that.

1815
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,280
We all remember that scene.

1816
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,440
That's a very that's maybe the most New Jersey line ever written in a movie.

1817
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,440
There's a George Carlin quote for everything.

1818
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,480
George Carlin quote. Yeah.

1819
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,080
And most of them are from Jersey.

1820
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,000
I probably butchered it, but look it up, folks.

1821
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:51,080
I also would dock the chili dog points for being so late in the day.

1822
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,680
I think I think that's a tough one to do later.

1823
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,120
Could have been tough at ballast point to have kind of the heaviest,

1824
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,000
the heaviest one, because this was where I started to feel it.

1825
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,920
Maybe I started going a little downhill.

1826
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,200
I think around this. Yeah.

1827
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,240
I think I said, I don't feel sick, but I am very full.

1828
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,880
I am full now.

1829
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,240
The chili also like the quality.

1830
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:15,080
Yeah, I don't know Hormel from anything else, but even like I'm

1831
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,720
tasting this chili and I'm like the chili at Wendy's is better than this.

1832
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,920
Yeah. Like that's bad.

1833
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,240
Like that's more specific or flavorful.

1834
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,240
But you guys might be impacting.

1835
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,440
I wrote down a score and I've notched the score down a little bit.

1836
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,760
No, I think I agree.

1837
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,640
Look, we don't operate and we're not in separate soundproof booths here.

1838
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,680
That's not the idea.

1839
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:40,280
We're creating a discussion, but math will determine it at the end of the day.

1840
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,560
Do you want to lock in scores?

1841
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,680
Yes, I would like to lock it in.

1842
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,480
Award wieners.

1843
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,320
Got it. Please. Great.

1844
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,960
At this point in the day, we took a much needed hot dog break.

1845
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:55,280
I had concerns about is the hot dog Hula Baloo going to prevent me

1846
01:25:55,280 --> 01:26:00,720
from going on Guardian's mission breakout, which I am still a little edgy about.

1847
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,360
And I feel like such a pro now.

1848
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,920
I was fine. Even loaded up with many hot dogs and questionable chili.

1849
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,960
Right. Yeah. Totally fine.

1850
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,080
Well, you got the right.

1851
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:16,600
We hung out at the Pym Bar and you had a glass of wine, Mike had a beer.

1852
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,080
I just was pounding glasses of water.

1853
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:24,800
And yeah, we did guardians and web slingers said I do a very nice listener.

1854
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,040
Thank you for saying hello.

1855
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:31,440
Yeah. So we we cleansed the pallet for the walk to the Jason.

1856
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,040
As you pointed out, all these hot dogs are oddly central in the parks.

1857
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,440
Like they're all clustered in the middle, except for this one all the way

1858
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:42,200
at the other end of California Adventure, Lonely Outpost.

1859
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:50,720
And we went to the wharf first before we went to the lonely outpost.

1860
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,600
We went to like the wharf food court.

1861
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:57,400
You and I had a beer, had the blonde and that brought me back to life.

1862
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:01,840
Yeah, that gave me a second wind having a drink that day.

1863
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,400
Interesting salad, an interesting looking salad.

1864
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,360
That's yeah, I don't know.

1865
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,160
It was what was it even called?

1866
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,920
It was like a Chinese chicken salad.

1867
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,080
I came with three slices of fresh sourdough.

1868
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,280
That's from the bread.

1869
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,560
Yeah, it was from the bread place.

1870
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,360
It was fine. I there was some cucumbers.

1871
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,040
I just needed something.

1872
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,200
Look, it was green.

1873
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,560
That wasn't. Yeah, I maybe should have.

1874
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,680
Though that salad did not look good to me.

1875
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:29,920
I just came home and approximated in a side bowl as much as I could do.

1876
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:36,600
I know a side at home, but just like cereal, almonds, banana, fruit, blueberries.

1877
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,560
A lot of sugar, though, still.

1878
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,120
I guess so. Yeah.

1879
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,720
But that might have been why you were feeling it in the morning, too.

1880
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,480
Cereal bowl, did it?

1881
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,880
Well, there's all the there's a lot of sugar in the fruit.

1882
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:52,200
I'm just saying if you had like the in the banana and the blueberries,

1883
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,280
you think the even after a day of drinking and hot dogs,

1884
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,720
this is this is what I face on this show.

1885
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,120
I'm not saying it's the worst thing in the world.

1886
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,480
I'm just saying that that's it's a little sugary.

1887
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,680
And it's all at the end of the day.

1888
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,720
And it's all the end of the day.

1889
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:09,120
Yeah, it's possible. But it's not a lot of very plain cereal, though.

1890
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,360
Sure. OK. Because sometimes even granola.

1891
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,800
You have to remember, I'm me and not you.

1892
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,600
Well, I wouldn't make a side bowl with fruity pebbles.

1893
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,600
Although it sounds good now that I say it.

1894
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,160
I love there were some granola in Nature Valley.

1895
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,080
Granola bars just keeps making more and more products

1896
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,720
that are like trying to be dessert.

1897
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,520
And it's like, no, I want you to make like horse feet.

1898
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,960
I want you to make a bar of just oats.

1899
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,160
Like, I want you to make less sugar.

1900
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,120
I know, because I even I will go in somewhere

1901
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,160
and I want to get a little like like vegetable juice.

1902
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,160
And even like some of the companies that make like stuff

1903
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,320
that has more vegetables actually in it, still they have to make it sugary.

1904
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,360
I finally did I say this already?

1905
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,360
I finally found they have like an avocado juice at Trader Joe's,

1906
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,240
which doesn't taste sugar.

1907
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,560
I'm like, finally, there's a green drink

1908
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,040
that you can just grab off the shelf that doesn't still taste

1909
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,880
like it's trying to be some sweet juice.

1910
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,640
I tried it after you told me about it, and I think the taste is very good.

1911
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,840
It is refreshing.

1912
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,240
It's got the texture of drinking Green Goddess salad dressing.

1913
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,600
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1914
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,400
It's a little. Yeah, but that's good.

1915
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:16,240
Like that's don't don't let me off easy.

1916
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,400
I don't. I know. I want a thin.

1917
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,160
I want a very watery good.

1918
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,640
I love it. I want a cold, fresh.

1919
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,880
I love it. Very watery.

1920
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,720
That's what I like. I'm sorry.

1921
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:32,080
So this final stop, a newer one on the horizon, Angry Dogs.

1922
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,440
This is part of the Pixar Pier expansion is one of the quick little stands.

1923
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,880
It's very well themed.

1924
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,360
You get a gray. You get anger from inside out.

1925
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:43,600
The Lewis Black character who is who is blowing up,

1926
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,560
who is shooting fire out of the top of his head, screaming great.

1927
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,640
They just did a good job with that.

1928
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,400
All those little booths I like. Oh, yeah. Senior buzz and

1929
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,760
all well done.

1930
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,960
So there's a regular dog here, which they wait.

1931
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,640
The name of it's kind of slightly less annoyed dog.

1932
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,560
Yes, I know.

1933
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,040
I thought, yeah, the angry dog and the slightly less annoying.

1934
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,240
Yes, I think that's right. Yeah.

1935
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,440
But we did angry dogs.

1936
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,800
That's the, you know, the interesting one here.

1937
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,960
And this just came plane.

1938
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:16,600
Now we're back into condiment territory, but with a couple of new friends.

1939
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,800
You got Sriracha here since it is a spice place.

1940
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,400
And that's a good addition. Nice to see that.

1941
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,240
They could probably use that at a bunch of these locations.

1942
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,440
Yeah. So I liked that.

1943
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,280
But I'll throw it to you.

1944
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,320
Would you how do you feel about the angry dog?

1945
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,280
Probably the best flavored dog.

1946
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,760
Yeah, I think because of the spice closer to that hot line corn dog.

1947
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,560
I like. Yeah. Yeah.

1948
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,760
Finally, something some of that is boiled.

1949
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,760
When when Pixar beer first opened, there was like a line of condiment

1950
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:51,080
dispensers like Sriracha or Buffalo, you know, spicy mustard, regular mustard.

1951
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,080
Right. Like where you that was part of the novelty, I think.

1952
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,320
Again, everything's kind of been standardized, everything in packets now.

1953
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,920
This is where relish exploded.

1954
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,440
That'd be a nice more pumps.

1955
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,640
Less packets is what I think we should come out of this episode saying every day.

1956
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,560
Yeah. For us to make our dog goo.

1957
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,400
Yeah. Yeah. Just put that all in one sentence.

1958
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,160
And that's what we say now.

1959
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,560
It's a loaded sentence.

1960
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,760
So I did like that.

1961
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,720
I guess, you know, while I liked the taste, I am looking at that actual dog

1962
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:26,640
and like, what are these weird streaks of red?

1963
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:28,160
What am I eating?

1964
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,000
I mean, I just not think about that all day.

1965
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,320
I just can't.

1966
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,600
I just can't.

1967
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,560
Red pepper.

1968
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,920
Yeah. The streaks are probably less alarming than whatever the meat is.

1969
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,880
Yeah. I was looking at somebody.

1970
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,360
I don't think there's any like official confirmation of what dogs,

1971
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,880
but some I saw some message boards, people saying like Disney World

1972
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:49,960
is like it's like 20 percent chicken, 80 percent beef or like something like that.

1973
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,080
I don't think any of these are like all beef kosher.

1974
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,800
Yeah, no, not really well seasoned dogs.

1975
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1976
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,680
But probably not pork, people think also probably no pork, but like part chicken,

1977
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,960
part beef. Yeah.

1978
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,400
So we pray that that's all it is.

1979
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,480
I think was one of the kids labeled a turkey dog.

1980
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,800
There were. Yes, there was a kid.

1981
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,640
We did not do it because it was kids.

1982
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,360
The dog was too tiny. Yeah.

1983
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,920
And we also didn't do a veggie at award wieners.

1984
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,200
Oh, right, right.

1985
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,760
But the listeners asked about that and they were like, yeah, it's fine.

1986
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,480
You said it was fine.

1987
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,520
I said it was fine. Yeah.

1988
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,800
Jane and God and I had a bite of it a few months ago and it was kind of fine.

1989
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,040
He does this. Oh, God, this drives me nuts.

1990
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,880
Is someone from Philadelphia where it's like a Philly dog,

1991
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,920
like green peppers and onions, like you don't put green peppers on a cheese.

1992
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:39,680
Like it's like a cheat, like vegan cheesesteak dog.

1993
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,800
And it's like I don't the vegan part is fine.

1994
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,200
I don't care about that.

1995
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:48,360
But so many places like you see it, it went some places like real cheesesteak

1996
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,200
sandwich, green and red pepper. It's like, no, stop it.

1997
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,400
No, that's not interesting. OK.

1998
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,960
I knew that I don't think I knew those were out of bounds.

1999
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:01,240
I think like banana peppers or hoagie spread or like spicy pepper.

2000
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:05,600
Yes. You made me so hungry with that list of ingredients of the stuff

2001
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,400
I actually want to eat as we've been.

2002
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,200
We spent all day dealing with hot dogs yesterday, talking about them today.

2003
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,800
You describing any other genre of food?

2004
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:19,200
I said hoagie spread and Scott burst his mouth with saliva.

2005
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,680
Oh, he's like the easiest.

2006
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,760
Like if you go to Jersey Mike's, their pepper spread like pepper relish

2007
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,400
on like that kind of thing.

2008
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,960
Vinegar, very a lot of absence of vinegar yesterday.

2009
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:36,520
Yeah, no vinegar to cut off like good on top of hot dogs to cut the fat,

2010
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,320
to cut the grease.

2011
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,480
None of these are like.

2012
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,600
I will find out at the end.

2013
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,920
Are we? I'm curious if anybody's given out any nines or tens. Yes.

2014
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,760
OK, really. All right. All right.

2015
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,200
But is that in your in your mind, is that on the scale?

2016
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,160
Yeah, that's or would you?

2017
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,600
That's why I'm Veer and lower.

2018
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,000
I left I left.

2019
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,920
I left some room for portillo's or other things I've had that are like

2020
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,200
top of the line in my mind. OK, OK.

2021
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,600
Yes. Some invisible.

2022
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,600
They're not getting ranked, but yeah.

2023
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,480
And also for improvement for Disney, you know. Yeah.

2024
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,920
I think so. There's nothing I would give it a 10.

2025
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,440
I can see 10 on the scale of what we're doing.

2026
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,440
Yeah. I think general hot.

2027
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,280
That makes sense. That's perfectly valid.

2028
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,720
I mean, it'll still come out.

2029
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,720
It'll still come out in the same order of victory.

2030
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,080
Yeah. Yes, Joey. Angry dogs.

2031
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,720
Yeah, I think it's like this.

2032
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,080
This would be if I had a choice between maybe the first diggity dog

2033
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,960
or the angry dog, just like as J.

2034
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:36,160
Oh, maybe. OK. Say I'm an angry dad and I've got a family and I'm mad

2035
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,280
and I need to eat something.

2036
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,840
And I just like my my anger will not be quelled.

2037
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,840
And then we turn the corner and we see anger from inside out.

2038
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:46,280
And my young son says, Daddy, look, it's you.

2039
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,480
And then I said I like first I'm mad because he's insulting me

2040
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,600
and calling me this character.

2041
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,280
But then I go, you know what? It does look like me.

2042
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:55,320
And I have a little bit of a chuckle and I say, oh, we can get a quick

2043
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,440
hot dog here.

2044
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,120
I think I would want that one better than I would want diggity dog.

2045
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,280
I think that would make me that would.

2046
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,560
What about all my move?

2047
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,040
The kid this is too this is too complex for the kid.

2048
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,440
You think that the scenario is too complex?

2049
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,880
No, they had the dog. Oh, yeah.

2050
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,720
I think they got it.

2051
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,720
Well, you got to just do the slightly less annoyed.

2052
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,320
Yeah, they got they got the better one.

2053
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,360
Or some kid.

2054
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:22,120
My brother, very young age, was like very in the spicy stuff, like Jack it up.

2055
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,480
Yeah. Well, this kid you describe, though, is such a wiener,

2056
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,640
not in the hot dog.

2057
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:29,280
This is your initial description of that kid.

2058
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,640
This I that does throw a tantrum.

2059
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:32,440
Yeah. Yeah.

2060
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,560
Well, Dad was throwing a tantrum in my scenario.

2061
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,600
Oh, there isn't the kid.

2062
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,440
The kid was actually making roasting dad.

2063
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:42,160
Me. This probably solves both because dad gets to have spicy dog.

2064
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,720
There's a beer stand like steps away.

2065
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,520
I think they had one beer.

2066
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,440
They had one Firestone Walker beer.

2067
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:49,760
Static. Yeah.

2068
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,640
Yeah.

2069
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,720
But I guess all all that to say,

2070
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,840
if it was just between diggity dog or this, this, I think it's fun.

2071
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,040
It's a fun little change up.

2072
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,080
And you can you put as much sriracha or as little as you want.

2073
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,360
You still get a little heat.

2074
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,360
It's just yeah, it's a little bit more of a fun thing.

2075
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:10,920
And if it's a quick kind of snack meal, I would go with this over regular.

2076
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,360
I almost yeah, I would in general, I would recommend it.

2077
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,680
I think if you're you know, grabbing a quick

2078
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,440
but if you're grazing as we were all day, I think I know where I'm locking this in.

2079
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:21,240
Yeah.

2080
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,920
Well, have we and one more thing to cop to.

2081
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,200
There are there were hot dogs available at Wetzel's Pretzels,

2082
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:36,760
but Wetzel's Pretzels was pulled from the competition due to past sins against Jason.

2083
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,800
I mean, you guys were welcome to do it.

2084
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,880
I was not to kind of ruined already ruined my being present

2085
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,640
and fully enjoying my I fly experience during the City Walk Saga.

2086
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:51,040
And I was not reliving that now.

2087
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,680
Did I?

2088
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,280
I forget what exactly I should go back and listen

2089
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:01,480
if I had like a single pretzel dog or like little mini pretzel dogs.

2090
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,440
But I could be wrong.

2091
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,920
And that's probably where maybe thinking back, I did it wrong at City Walk.

2092
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,320
So it's like sitting out.

2093
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,360
Those are just like a single pretzel dog had never done me dirty before.

2094
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,720
So yeah, maybe this was where I should have given my second chance.

2095
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:18,920
But I think we were all still in such a haze from being swerved by Ballast Point.

2096
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,160
I also think, you know, this is the inaugural hullabaloo.

2097
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:26,080
So I think we were also trying to sort of feel out like what we were trying

2098
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,680
to strike a balance between what was doable, but also funny and pushing it

2099
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,000
a little bit.

2100
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,360
Maybe we didn't push it enough.

2101
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,800
Maybe in hindsight, we should have done those.

2102
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,920
And now next time we do some sort of hullabaloo, we will know

2103
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,560
how to push it a little bit more than we would.

2104
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,160
We've got to be worse to ourselves.

2105
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,680
We should be a little worse to ourselves.

2106
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,040
A little worse. Yeah, that's what I think.

2107
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,840
You know, we'll make our month in advance park pass

2108
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:52,800
and then we'll make our six week out of Ballast Point reservation.

2109
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,120
It's like three guys can't run around eating hot dogs,

2110
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,040
said several theme parks and hotels.

2111
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:02,200
It's like they were trying to cut back on the most annoying guests

2112
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,640
that were that were the least likely to spend

2113
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,840
actual money the other all the other times they went.

2114
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,920
I think why would we not be welcome?

2115
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,000
The people who went to reserved a table at a sit down restaurant

2116
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:22,000
and proceeded to all split a twelve dollar hot dog.

2117
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,160
We didn't want our drinks and tip and so we did.

2118
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,160
Yes, we weren't savages.

2119
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,760
I had an extra that's for the couple bucks.

2120
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,280
OK, that's good.

2121
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,600
Well, I think we're at the point where maybe we step down for a second

2122
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,160
and we calculate and we reveal I don't exactly know

2123
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,400
where this is going to land,

2124
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,920
but I think it's time for the judges to tally the scores

2125
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,920
and we find out the winner of the inaugural hot dog hullabaloo.

2126
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:51,960
All right, I have opened the digital envelope

2127
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:57,120
and calculated the scores done all the tallying.

2128
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,440
And I just want to say there's,

2129
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,600
you know, to all of the hot dogs, it's not about winning.

2130
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,280
It's about that you're all sort of mediocre.

2131
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:13,040
And probably Disney should have some better hot dogs.

2132
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,800
But I do think I am sure that if we were to do

2133
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,040
if we had done the hot dog hullabaloo 25 years ago, there would have been.

2134
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:24,600
I bet a lot more competitors that were all essentially the same.

2135
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,040
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2136
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,440
I'm sure there were so many more hot dogs at Disneyland.

2137
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,280
This is actually it's gotten better.

2138
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,440
Yeah, I think so.

2139
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,040
And there were some things there.

2140
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,280
There were there were some that I sort of wish I had had the entire thing.

2141
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,560
Not that badly.

2142
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,800
I am glad that we did the thirds.

2143
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:42,560
And there were like two.

2144
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,160
I was like, oh, I could have eaten the whole thing.

2145
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,320
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

2146
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,480
But who will take the whole thing?

2147
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,240
Let's find out as I read the final scores.

2148
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,640
Diggity dogs, the unadorned fake Nathans, all beef.

2149
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:01,760
Mike six, Jason five, Scott four.

2150
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,800
Median score of five right in the middle.

2151
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,160
Right. Probably where it should be.

2152
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:11,960
The electric relish dog from the refreshment stand.

2153
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,360
Mike eight point five, Jason nine, Scott eight, eight point five.

2154
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,720
Thus far. Wow.

2155
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:24,160
The mac and cheese dog from the same establishment.

2156
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,240
Mike seven.

2157
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,800
Kind of surprised by that.

2158
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,960
I said I had, but I said I've eaten.

2159
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:31,440
It's kind of like that mac and cheese.

2160
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2161
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,600
On the opposite end of the spectrum, Jason two.

2162
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,680
Wow.

2163
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:40,160
That mac and cheese just destroyed the bun like that.

2164
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,120
It was just like a pile.

2165
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,200
It was the first what you I knew something was up

2166
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,600
because you said this would be the first that I do not finish.

2167
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,400
She didn't even finish a third.

2168
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,280
Yeah. And I gave it a three point five.

2169
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,000
Thus weighing it all down at four point one six.

2170
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,920
Six, six, six, six, six. The decimals keep going.

2171
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,320
Craftsman hot dog of the day.

2172
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,240
The Gordita dog. The month.

2173
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:05,560
Oh, if it was the day of they were a different hot dog.

2174
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,080
You would give it a little more leeway.

2175
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,480
Yeah, but there's also there's not three hundred sixty five types of hot.

2176
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,280
That said, I'd like to see what they did for Christmas.

2177
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,080
What's a good Christmas hot dog?

2178
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:18,280
Oh, yeah, I would guess candy cane

2179
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,680
on candy cane instead of beef.

2180
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,800
I was going to say probably a interpretation of the gobbler.

2181
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,600
A Thanksgiving dinner kind of thing.

2182
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:32,280
Because I sure turkey dinner, I feel like works for either Thanksgiving or Christmas.

2183
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,600
It's like a hot dog shaped piece of a roast. Yeah.

2184
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,640
Meat roast. Oh, no.

2185
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:41,200
Turkey dog cranberry mustard stuffing.

2186
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,400
Maybe sounds OK.

2187
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,080
Yeah. Well, if that's what the craftsman's doing in November,

2188
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,800
and then I'll go check it out. Yeah.

2189
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,040
But for now, what they're doing, they're Cinco de Mayo entry.

2190
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,360
The Gordita dog, Mike five point five.

2191
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,560
Jason seven point five. Oh, my God.

2192
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,440
Scott three. Wow.

2193
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:59,280
Wow. I think I was low as anyone here.

2194
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,160
Point should have gone lower. Sorry.

2195
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:08,200
OK, so now we move over to award wieners.

2196
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:12,080
Will any of them be award winners today?

2197
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:14,880
Let's find out the bacon street dog.

2198
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:21,120
Seven point five from Mike seven point five from Jason seven point six.

2199
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,640
Wow. Wow.

2200
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:29,440
Great minds think alike, but one decimal point off of like this landing at it.

2201
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,280
The confusing seven point five.

2202
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,520
I was a little looking back.

2203
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,840
I looked back on it fondly, and that's why I had to give it that score.

2204
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,680
Because I was like, you know what?

2205
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:41,040
I did like it. All the pieces were pretty good.

2206
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:44,440
I think I was pretty worn out at that point in the day.

2207
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,040
So I was trying not to let that influence my decision.

2208
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2209
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,880
You got to remove where you're at.

2210
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,680
The ballast point anger should not reflect on this location.

2211
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,160
The uptown chili dog, Mike six point five.

2212
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,680
Jason three.

2213
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,840
Scott five point five.

2214
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:04,320
Thus landing at an even five.

2215
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:07,520
There's only one more that has the chance to take it.

2216
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,360
The remaining scores for the inside out inspired angry dog.

2217
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,560
Mike seven.

2218
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,080
Jason seven.

2219
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,080
Scott seven.

2220
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,000
Wow. Wow.

2221
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,520
Two of them. We landed exactly even more.

2222
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,360
Exactly. That puts it at seven.

2223
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:33,000
Just above that, at number two, the bacon street dog at seven point five three.

2224
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:36,360
And taking the the full event

2225
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,880
at the winner of the hot dog, Hullabaloo

2226
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,360
is the refreshment corners electric relish dog at eight point five.

2227
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,240
A very strong eight point five.

2228
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,880
A strong eight point five.

2229
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:49,800
I really enjoyed it.

2230
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,000
I was a little conflicted.

2231
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,680
It being a limited time, probably seasonal dog.

2232
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,400
Who knows how long it'll stick around.

2233
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,160
I'd love to have another one. I'll be honest.

2234
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:00,160
I would eat another one.

2235
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,400
I think they captured lightning in a bottle here.

2236
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,800
Any corn dog at the Disneyland Resort?

2237
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,320
Probably still a better bet.

2238
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,120
But so yeah, yeah.

2239
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:12,960
Well, I think that's maybe where this goes by saying that corn dogs

2240
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,400
corn dogs are not hot dogs.

2241
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:18,600
I think it sets up some future event such as this.

2242
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:22,800
And I hope everyone enjoyed this.

2243
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:29,080
The the you know, the winner, the electric relish dog, the losers, us

2244
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:34,760
for gathering around paper plates and tearing hot dogs in three.

2245
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:39,400
But hopefully the audience felt like winners hearing about our exploits.

2246
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:41,560
And now I pose it to the audience.

2247
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,360
Is there any other journey of this nature that you would like to?

2248
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:50,840
Would you like us to do any other completion of a genre of food

2249
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,960
at Disneyland, at anywhere else?

2250
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,960
Send us on a mission.

2251
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,040
It feels like corn dogs, probably the next one.

2252
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:01,920
And the if the corn the corn dog champion taking on the hot dog champion.

2253
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,360
I'd be interested to see.

2254
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,440
Yeah, I mean, corn dog, a lot simpler.

2255
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,800
There's only like three or four varietals.

2256
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:13,040
Maybe more if you add in whatever weirdo downtown Disney

2257
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:17,840
card is going, but I think this was a much more pleasant journey overall

2258
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:23,600
than like the the Gulf of like the hamburger hullabaloo

2259
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:26,200
or like the pizza party.

2260
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:31,120
Like there's some the golf between the pizza in the parks and like the pizza,

2261
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:36,960
like Vietnam or like the black tap burgers compared to the park burgers.

2262
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,880
Do you like a steakhouse kind of burger?

2263
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:42,960
Oh, but about a steaks on

2264
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:44,120
we do this.

2265
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:46,720
Would you like us all to have some nice steak show?

2266
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,240
Tell you how delicious they were.

2267
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,280
The steak showdown.

2268
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,520
We're walking around to tuxedos.

2269
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,080
John, different.

2270
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,480
I want to remind everyone, though, if we do do the corn dog thing,

2271
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:03,360
I have not had a corn dog since one made me throw up when I was like five or six.

2272
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,960
Well, I will be returning.

2273
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:10,520
I have not had a corn dog since because just it has the memory of it.

2274
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,600
But I'm willing to your therapy like the Maury episodes where he's like shows

2275
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,120
someone a tarantula and they run around the audience.

2276
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:22,040
If I could get a minotaur to feed me a corn dog, a lot of my problems would go away.

2277
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,040
So lump all the fears together.

2278
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,160
That's right.

2279
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,200
I know that.

2280
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,040
I don't think that would freak you out more.

2281
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,720
No, Michael.

2282
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:34,600
There's more fun ones like milkshake madness.

2283
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,960
Like there's not that many milkshake madness.

2284
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,280
Oh, that's what you want.

2285
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,080
Cake shake in the mix.

2286
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,800
You were now you're begging to be sent on these.

2287
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:43,800
This is like now.

2288
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:44,920
What about doing one of these?

2289
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:45,800
Ice cream?

2290
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,000
Once ice cream.

2291
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:47,320
I did.

2292
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:49,200
What about once a month?

2293
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,040
We do one of these.

2294
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,960
Oh, no.

2295
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,880
It's becoming our only fans.

2296
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,840
Like, you know, I'll do it.

2297
01:46:54,880 --> 01:47:00,240
I'll I'll I'll use this toy if you want me to, just because I have to.

2298
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:02,320
As the darkest thing I've ever heard.

2299
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,520
No, as often as comes up,

2300
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:12,640
the only fans thing much more dignified than us slogging through theme park

2301
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,640
hamburgers, much more respectable.

2302
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:19,840
I think we should just do getting I know where we will follow in his footsteps,

2303
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:20,600
which is get the Mr.

2304
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,640
And just review all this food and just do a whole full YouTube channel.

2305
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,000
We just pivot to YouTube, pivot to video.

2306
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,160
We're pivoting to video.

2307
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,520
Yeah, yeah, it's coming.

2308
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:34,360
OK, well, send us a will, you know, whatever, whatever.

2309
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,520
What do you want us to do next?

2310
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,160
Leave a comment below.

2311
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:38,480
Send us on our next mission.

2312
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,200
Do you want us to eat a lot of something?

2313
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,360
Let us know.

2314
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,360
My name's Mike.

2315
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:43,800
Click here, here, here.

2316
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,160
We're here. I'm pointing.

2317
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,920
You can't see it because this is audio.

2318
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:53,560
Like subscribe and ring the bell and light the fuse.

2319
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:56,200
I I like what about it.

2320
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,520
I don't care what they tell you to ring the bell.

2321
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:01,120
You know, what did we end up there that now we have?

2322
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:05,520
So, OK, for me to watch more of your videos, there are two steps.

2323
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,480
That's not a problem of the YouTuber.

2324
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,160
This is a problem of YouTube.

2325
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:11,120
How did you possibly get it to that point?

2326
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,920
That's notifications, right?

2327
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,000
Is that what the balance like?

2328
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,920
If you want an email, I think that a video has been done.

2329
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:22,360
I've read some stuff on like digital detox or like simplifying your like smartphone experience.

2330
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,320
The first step is always turn off all notifications,

2331
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:29,680
except phone calls and text message, like anything immediate.

2332
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:34,160
And that is, I think, the only notifications I have on on my phone.

2333
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:39,080
So the idea of YouTube just telling me like, hey, there's a new video.

2334
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,720
Hey, there's a new there's a new roller coaster video.

2335
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,120
Like, no, YouTube, absolutely not.

2336
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:49,080
As opposed to any time I've been hovering over Mike's phone

2337
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:52,320
or used your phone to take a photo or whatever it is.

2338
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:55,800
Your notification intake is unreal.

2339
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,360
Yes. You hold it.

2340
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,360
If I'm looking at your phone for 10 seconds, it is like,

2341
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:02,200
Ding, ding, toy theme park news test.

2342
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,840
Just endless. I don't know.

2343
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:07,040
Monday, Monday, not texting me.

2344
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,480
Not to know. I mean, it's an alert that he posted something.

2345
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,640
Oh, that's fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2346
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,680
A flight, a flight booker thing that's still up there.

2347
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,960
It is like I'm getting as much information as like an air traffic controller

2348
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,840
is getting at all times.

2349
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:25,240
And that's very odd, because you once showed me a productivity thing,

2350
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:30,000
like reminder hack that you do, where if you needed to remind yourself

2351
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,840
about something, you would write it in a note, screen grab the note,

2352
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,520
make that your lock screen background.

2353
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:38,840
Oh, I know what I've actually mostly done that for is is

2354
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,360
when I'm trying to watch Wrestle Kingdom.

2355
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:45,160
Which is in Japan and it's aired at like four a.m.

2356
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,400
And I want to remember not to check Twitter right when I wake up

2357
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,280
in the morning and see the spoilers.

2358
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:54,640
But how do you see that background if you have so many applications?

2359
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,480
Well, you know, if you put it on sleep,

2360
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,880
they won't show up in the morning when you click on your phone.

2361
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,760
OK, so I see.

2362
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,640
I haven't actually done that trick in a while.

2363
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:08,080
Now the screen is the dog's face, a blown up photo of that face.

2364
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,320
That sounds that's the way to start the day.

2365
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,040
I mean, just just because you're just because you're talking, let's talk.

2366
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,640
Let's see what the notification. Yeah.

2367
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:16,880
What do you go? Yeah.

2368
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,160
OK, I have Wario.

2369
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:21,840
I do. I have Wario 64's tweets sent to my phone,

2370
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,040
which are like video game deals and toy deals.

2371
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:28,800
I have secret flying notifications, which I haven't done that in a long time.

2372
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,080
I mean, we've flown, but not like, yeah, where are you going?

2373
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:33,920
Yeah, I could try. You know what? You're right.

2374
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,080
I should turn that. There we go.

2375
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:38,560
Or make progress. I have Uber Eats notifications.

2376
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,160
I have I don't know why.

2377
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,280
I had downloaded a while ago.

2378
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:46,160
Miss called Nick Monday 34 minutes ago.

2379
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,800
I have Wendy's Biggie Bag bonus fry deal.

2380
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,000
This is an hour ago. This was sent to me to learn it.

2381
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,640
Do these things. You've earned a free small.

2382
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:57,160
I would drop everything. These biggie bag purchase.

2383
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,560
Get the offer in the app and even more fries.

2384
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,960
Burger King may the fourth be with you for two hours ago.

2385
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:06,280
You may a three dollar whopper or impossible whopper be in your hands

2386
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:09,200
on the stellar Whopper Wednesday tap here to order.

2387
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,120
It's always Whopper Wednesday.

2388
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:13,560
That's it. You don't need that.

2389
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,920
I have Vegas Star Wars mentioned two hours ago.

2390
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,920
Vegas slot game that Jason turned me on to a couple of years ago.

2391
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:22,080
That's telling me about collecting one million five hundred thousand chips.

2392
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:23,320
It's a winning Wednesday.

2393
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:25,480
We have a feeling you'll get a lot of Wednesday.

2394
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:28,120
It's winning Wednesday. Monday Wednesday.

2395
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,760
Taco Bell. I have some Zillow notifications for houses I can't afford.

2396
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,240
That's just cruel. That's just cruel.

2397
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:39,400
Oh, are you what is this all?

2398
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:42,080
Are you proud as you list these neutral?

2399
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:47,040
I think even five. Yeah, I think Mike, Jason and I are ranking.

2400
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:51,080
Our level of alarm is at ten point one hundred. Yeah.

2401
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:54,720
Walmart, for some reason, I had a classic Rafael in my cart

2402
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:57,040
and it wants me to finish the purchase, but little does it know.

2403
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,880
I already purchased it months ago.

2404
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:05,200
So I am proud because these notifications have gotten me plenty.

2405
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,480
They've they've they're worth it, is what I'm saying,

2406
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:11,280
because you get notified for all sorts of interesting deals and things.

2407
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,000
Yeah. You know what?

2408
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,320
I can't be too hard on you because sometimes you forward me those deal.

2409
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,320
You text me those deals all the time.

2410
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,960
I have benefited.

2411
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,360
That's what we say about the checking. That's right.

2412
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:28,440
Mike driving himself slowly insane into full body deterioration.

2413
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,880
Sometimes it's to our benefit.

2414
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:33,080
You would think I would be more of like kind of a manic character

2415
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:37,480
with all that coming in like, oh, like this guy, you know, like a cartoon.

2416
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,520
This guy, you just we hurt a lot of stuff.

2417
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,280
You just internalize it like a geyser.

2418
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,840
Geyser Mountain. Yeah.

2419
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:51,160
It all comes it all manifests itself in your inability to hug many.

2420
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:55,000
That's right. Well, I think I'm just operating on a level

2421
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,640
of absorbing the energy around me.

2422
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,960
And you think you've reached enlightenment.

2423
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,400
They exactly you've reached it.

2424
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,680
I've gotten so many notifications.

2425
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,720
So calm all the time.

2426
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:07,880
I'm connected to so many people via tweets and app notifications.

2427
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,480
You realize we're all one.

2428
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,280
I'm vibrating at a different frequency than everyone else.

2429
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:17,040
I can see the world sort of on a fourth plane like Neo at the end of the first.

2430
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,120
I wasn't going to say it, but yes, you're right.

2431
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:20,480
It is a lot like Neo.

2432
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,600
I sort of unplugged in to the matrix.

2433
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:25,520
The rest of us are just in Zion in the muddy party.

2434
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,880
I already have only see our little bubble.

2435
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,760
We can only see our little bubble attached to the greater consciousness.

2436
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:35,080
Occasionally, we just jack into Twitter just so we could just get riled up at whatever

2437
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,960
lunatics going on.

2438
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,840
OK, all right. I'm getting out.

2439
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,320
You know, I'm Musk's Neuralink.

2440
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:41,680
I already have it, man.

2441
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:44,320
I'm already I'm already getting it all.

2442
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,440
I don't know what even you're talking about.

2443
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:50,320
OK, well, after all that, now here's the part where we have to give you

2444
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:53,760
instructions of what we first of all, you survived podcast, the right.

2445
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,720
I'm going to do this little spiel and just let me know if you don't fake it,

2446
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,440
if there's not one there.

2447
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,080
But if a notification shows up

2448
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:01,760
but that you didn't already read before the spiel is over.

2449
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:04,480
So you survived podcast, the right, the hot dog hullabaloo.

2450
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:07,560
Send us on our next mission through whatever media you want.

2451
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:08,800

We're on everything at podcast, the right.

2453
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,320
Merch is available in our tea public store.

And we'll throw that hot dog thing up there.

2455
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,920

Set alarms.

2460
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:34,040
I admit and wake up at eleven fifty nine when our new episodes are out.

2461
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:36,920
Yeah. Wednesdays on the patron of Friday on the main thing.

2462
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,000
Did you get anything while I was talking? 100 percent. OK.

2463
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:43,360
Jimmy Iovine, that long, I stretched it a little.

2464
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:47,520
Me, I have been son, Jamie, I have been has an app called Network.

2465
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,640
We've talked about it before.

2466
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:53,000
Oh, yeah. Some of the letters are missing from the word network.

2467
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,320
This is a kind of a home shopping for millennials.

2468
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:58,920
People we know of like so.

2469
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:01,960
So like there'll be little likes the videos and stuff that are hosting,

2470
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,800
basically telling you, you know, you can buy some things.

2471
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,160
What just dropped is there's a live broadcast now,

2472
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,040
something called Panera Day of Cravable Drops.

2473
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,440
Me to Medi. I don't actually know how to pronounce it.

2474
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:16,320
But a MediCom toy is a type of is a toy company.

2475
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:19,680
And they do these things called Bear Bricks, which are like almost like

2476
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:22,480
Vinyl Mation's, but they're like a big bear.

2477
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,400
Sometimes they're smaller bears, sometimes whatever.

2478
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,040
And then they paint like characters on them.

2479
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,200
They're just like Vinyl Mation's basically. But they're very popular.

2480
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,360
I have no bear bricks. I do not own bear bricks.

2481
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:34,560
But this just let me know that I can purchase bear bricks like this bear

2482
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,120
brick. 100 percent.

2483
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:39,560
There's this Pinocchio basically is a Pinocchio bear brick here for one hundred

2484
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:42,440
dollars that I can purchase and I can go through and see.

2485
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,760
Wait, what does that have to do with Panera?

2486
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,640
I don't know. But the two hosts, but the two hosts are standing

2487
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,920
in front of a display and it's just frozen now.

2488
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:54,080
They're standing in front of a display that's a giant sandwich

2489
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,000
and in the front of the thing, it says Panera.

2490
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,760
I don't have a lot of answers for you.

2491
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:02,400
This, again, just popped up while you were doing those after show plugs.

2492
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:05,920
So I am just this is what is happening.

2493
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:07,440
This is what has just come in here now.

2494
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,680
There's a Simpson Cyclops bear brick.

2495
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:12,280
I don't know if that's just from, oh, Treehouse of Horror.

2496
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,800
It's when there was a I forget which one that is.

2497
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,840
Yeah, but you can buy that for one hundred twenty dollars.

2498
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,920
I can buy one of these guys for you if you want.

2499
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:24,040
Jason and I both turned and did Jim Halpert takes to each other.

2500
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,560
Before you got to the word bear brick.

2501
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:30,240
Yeah, you mentioned like three startup names, Panera, Bearbrick.

2502
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:33,040
Here here's the here's the main screen.

2503
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:36,760
This is Panera Panera Day of Cravable Drops.

2504
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,480
Oh, man, they got these.

2505
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:39,360
What's the drop?

2506
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,800
So that's when they're dropping bear brick, like so dropping the bear brick sale.

2507
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,040
Not food. Not food is not they aren't selling.

2508
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,640
So they aren't selling like egg drops.

2509
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:48,160
Nasty looking chicken sandwiches.

2510
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,360
Now, Panera, get in touch. I'll fix your restaurant.

2511
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:52,160
Oh, do you know about free? Do you know about free sips?

2512
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,560
You've already. Yeah, you got to do free sips.

2513
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:57,560
That always tastes terrible.

2514
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:00,720
I hope you can get a you can get an iced tea for free.

2515
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,640
You're excitedly pointing at Jason about sips.

2516
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,840
You already told him about that. Don't taste good to him.

2517
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,440
I know. I have no I have no palate until July 4th.

2518
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:14,320
You can get a free drink of any kind at any Panera once a day until July 4th for free.

2519
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,240
I will drink any unsweetened iced.

2520
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:17,520
There you go. That a shot.

2521
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,280
Yeah, I guess so. All right.

01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:20,400
Sign up for free sips.

2523
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,880
You never know if it weren't for me.

2524
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:23,560
We just did. We did.

2525
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:27,960
Thanks to my friend, Luke, actually told me that we just did live Jim Halpert GIFs.

2526
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:31,280
And Mike, you were just a full time Michael Scott.

2527
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:32,800
It's happening.

2528
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,600
You were that about everything you just listed.

2529
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,120
Oh, my God, it's happening.

2530
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,560
Yeah, that's true.

2531
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:43,040
This is I mean, we've all we're all there's just our brains are mostly nitrates

2532
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,880
at this point, nitrates and sodium.

2533
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,960
So we're all like losing it a little.

2534
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:49,960
Let me ask you this question, Jason.

2535
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:53,320
Did you get that Duncan on Free Coffee Wednesday?

2536
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:54,560
Free Coffee Wednesday?

2537
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,280
Wow, of course.

2538
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,400
And he knew about that before me.

2539
01:57:57,400 --> 01:58:00,880
I did not turn him on to Free Coffee Wednesday, but I'm just letting everyone know.

2540
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,040

That might only be in this area.

2543
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,280
Yeah, might only be.

2544
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,400
Well, check your app before you go over there and demand it.

2545
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,640
Oh, my God. It's happening.

2546
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:19,480
