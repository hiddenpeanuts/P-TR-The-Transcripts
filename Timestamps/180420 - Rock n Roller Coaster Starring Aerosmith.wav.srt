00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Warning, today's podcast may include Hollywood vampires, guns that shoot CDs, a Californication

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,760
revelation and an in-depth look at the ride featuring the bad boys from Boston, rock and

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,800
roller coaster starring Aerosmith.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,400
Yes, we're the ones that jaded you.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:36,920
It's Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,640
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show hosted by three men who at best could be described

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,120
as late bloomers, but even that's a reach.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Scott Gertner.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Hi Jason.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Hi.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
And Mike Carlson.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
Yeah, hi Jason, thank you for that.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,120
I was a late bloomer.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,480
I guess I'm still blooming if you really think about it.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
Hey, we all are.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
Yeah, I guess we are.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,960
Who's to say?

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,320
What a not magical world it would be if the blooming process was ever totally complete.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
That's a good point.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
We should all aspire to keep blooming even into our golden years.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,600
Well, we're all always students of life, aren't we?

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,920
Yeah, I guess we are.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
You have a real professorial vibe to you today.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
We never stop learning.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Yeah.

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
This is kind of like this wistfulness, this wistful intimacy I feel like we have right

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
now without a guest.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,440
It's just the three of us, no one to introduce and I don't know, I think it allows us to

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:39,480
be in this sensitive headspace, whatever it is, which pairs great with the rock music

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,480
themed ride we'll be talking about.

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,960
I mean, look, once we get into this talk, we're going to transform from three thoughtful

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,400
professorial types to three dirty dogs.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,720
And I'm not talking about Edwin, the official show dog who's lying on the couch already

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,920
starting to fall asleep at the sound of these three men talking.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,000
I will take a photo of the official show dog right now during the show and I will post

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
it.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh yes.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Well, now that we've exposed our show dog to the...

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
To the Twitter.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,320
Edwin, the podcast ride show dog.

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
Yeah.

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:22,080
Part of the mythology, you know, before we get going too far, there's a little bit of

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,080
theme park information that just came across my desk as it were.

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,840
And just to get you guys into it, I want to do a little bit of a word association because

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,200
this is a word that I was not previously aware of and I want to see if you guys are.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
So I'm going to say a word.

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Okay.

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,920
And tell me if the word has any significance to you.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Okay.

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Okay.

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
The word is HALYX.

52
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
HALYX.

53
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
HALYX.

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Can you spell that?

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
I sure can.

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
It is spelled H-A-L-Y-X.

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Y-X.

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
HALYX.

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
No, I don't.

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,720
Am I supposed to word associate?

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,280
Like is it a psychologist's office or no?

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Is it just me and do I know anything about it?

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Well, does it make you...

64
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm not necessarily...

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
HALYX sounds like helix.

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,120
I think of helix, which is I think of a roller coaster.

67
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Sure.

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Well, look, I mean, it's a funky spelling.

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
It's a pretty wild spelling, which I think indicates...

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Three consonants.

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Yeah, all in a row.

74
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
All in a row.

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,000
It makes me think of like a Kinect set.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Like one of those cool, like not...

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
You know what I'm talking about?

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Like it was like a...

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Oh yeah, I had a Y in Kinects of a roller coaster.

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Oh yeah.

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Well, there you go.

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Was it a HALYX set?

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Is that what you're getting at?

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I am not.

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Well, here's what HALYX is.

86
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm so excited you guys don't previously know about HALYX.

87
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Yeah, I don't know this.

88
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Is that proprietary thing?

89
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,040
Like a very specific thing?

90
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,240
This is a Disney property, perhaps the least utilized great Disney property.

91
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,760
And here's what HALYX is.

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,480
HALYX was a band that was invented specifically for Disneyland that played at the Tomorrowland

93
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
stage in the early 80s.

94
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Wow.

95
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,320
It was used to combine the appeal of the band KISS with the Star Wars franchise.

96
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
No way.

97
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
What?

98
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,680
And I'm now going to show you a photograph of HALYX.

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Whoa, what?

100
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Look at this.

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
This is wild.

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Check the Twitter.

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Holy shit.

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Look up Google HALYX if you're listening to this.

105
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
If you're driving, get off the road.

106
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Or keep driving and immediately check out HALYX.

107
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,720
Worth the potential collision.

108
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Oh wow.

109
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
So if I could...

110
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,920
I mean, if you want to help me describe what I'm looking at, this is a...

111
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm looking at a two now.

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,520
Sea of musical rapscallions.

113
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,920
You've got sort of a Rick Springfield dude in a puffy 80s jacket.

114
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
You've got...

115
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,120
It's very Battlestar Galactica in look.

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Yeah.

117
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
And even costuming.

118
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
It's cool.

120
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,620
Very 80s, 70s, 80s space for sure.

121
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,800
You've got kind of a solid gold dancer dude, sort of a Jufro vibe.

122
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Whoa.

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,360
Couple more solid gold dancers in the back.

124
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,640
And then kind of a big, an abominable snowman.

125
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Yeah.

126
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,120
He looks like the guy that Luke cuts open.

127
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
Or Luke kills.

128
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,840
Luke kills in the cave an empire.

129
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Ah, right, right.

130
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
Uh-huh.

131
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I don't know what that is called.

132
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,520
I know the Tauntaun is the beast that Luke rides on.

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
I don't know what this guy is called.

134
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
Nothing that big in the band.

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
But a lot...

136
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,600
Look, it's an armada of humans and creatures who unite with their common interest in the

137
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,880
power of rock.

138
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,680
So I found out about this because as I told you guys off the air, I met a gentleman who

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
worked for Disney in the early 80s.

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,280
And we were sort of doing our little like Disney nerd off.

141
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,800
As you do, you just start dropping references and see how far you can go.

142
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
And I said, oh, you know, we just did an episode about Videopolis.

143
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,360
And he was like, oh, I was at the opening of Videopolis.

144
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,640
Damn, losing.

145
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,880
And then he threw out, well, you know about Halyx, right?

146
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,280
I do not know about Halyx.

147
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Whoa.

148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
I mean, yeah.

149
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
You know, it was Disney's Kiss.

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
I'm talking about it.

151
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,240
So I immediately looked up everything about Halyx.

152
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,480
I had to like try to I had to really suppress not telling you guys.

153
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,560
I wanted to tell you here in the moment.

154
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,080
So yeah, they played at the Tomorrowland stage, which is where the Captain EO theater is now.

155
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,000
Although what is currently Star Wars previews in New Oblivion.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,720
I don't think we're getting rid of that path of the Jedi thing.

157
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
No, that'll be there for until 2030 at least.

158
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,640
Way past when all of the film, many trilogies come out.

159
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
We'll still be looking at it.

160
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,080
I like the younglings and who become Padawans.

161
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,200
The path of the Jedi never ends.

162
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,280
For even when you become master, there's still a lot more to learn.

163
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,800
And even when one trilogy is over, seven more start.

164
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Seven more.

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,280
Hey, everyone gets a trilogy now.

166
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Y'all get it.

167
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,520
Hey, depending on how meetings go this week, we might end up with a trilogy.

168
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Yeah, hopefully.

169
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,280
Oh, there's Star Wars meetings we have this week that we're already plugging on a podcast.

170
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
We're as primed as anybody.

171
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Anyway, so this is a band that performed basically under Space Mountain, the greatest venue in

172
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
the world.

173
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,440
I would have to think for a band.

174
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,440
And OK, so yeah, they wanted to Disney wanted to have some summer entertainment.

175
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,880
They wanted to bring rock into the Disney fold.

176
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,720
And there I don't think had been you know, we're talking about Aerosmith Rock and Roller

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Coaster today.

178
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,720
And I think this might be the first attempt to get rock music into Disneyland.

179
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,080
So this was put together, a guy named Jim Magon helped supervise it, a guy who later

180
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,800
wrote for Darkwing Duck, Tailspin, Goof Troop, a goofy movie, a guy who in the 90s was one

181
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,680
of their primary writers.

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,000
And he has a personal website where he sadly, as far as I could tell, there's like a part

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,040
one and part two of the Halyx story and part three was never done.

184
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,760
It was like six years ago.

185
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,120
So hey, Jim spelled J-Y-M-N, a similarly odd spelling as Halyx.

186
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,200
And to your part three, I want to know the full Halyx tale.

187
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,200
So yeah, Disney wanted to put together a rock band that they enlisted the help of a guy

188
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,480
named Mike Post.

189
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,160
Does Mike Post mean anything to you?

190
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,880
This is the guy who did like all of the 80s, 90s, 70s theme songs, primarily known probably

191
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,600
for Greatest American Hero.

192
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Right.

193
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,760
Believe it or not, I'm walking, which was my the first dance at my wedding.

194
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Sure.

195
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
He also did.

196
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,160
And then utterly unsurprising news.

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,600
He also this guy did with the full list, Magnum P.I.

198
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Blossom, My Opinionation.

199
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,360
Wow, this guy's a titan.

200
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Yeah.

201
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,400
Doogie Howser, Hill Street Blues, Quantum Leap, NYPD Blue, and then like Don Don't, Law

202
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,720
and Order is him.

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Wow, really?

204
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
He did Don Don't.

205
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,400
But before he was quite the industry titan that he is today, he put together the songs

206
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,520
for a Star Wars themed rock band.

207
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,880
An open cast and call was done.

208
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,600
And they put together this odd little posse.

209
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,240
Probably probably the most notable thing, if you're looking at art of this, is that

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,720
there is a robot who has like kind of a full cart apparatus around him.

211
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,240
And so this guy had to play keyboards in a full like droid costume and inside a vehicle.

212
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,440
I'll show you guys this.

213
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,240
They like took an industrial golf cart and put space dude ads all over it and then built

214
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,880
a Prophet five synthesizer into the vehicle.

215
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,240
So Andy is wearing like robot gloves.

216
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,520
So this dude is driving a cart around the stage because they didn't want the keyboard

217
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
player to be stationary.

218
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,240
This is a space band.

219
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
We need to revolutionize.

220
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,200
Oh yeah, you got to move around.

221
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,840
Space is about movement.

222
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Certainly.

223
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,920
I was sleepy before this and it feels like you shot the Pulp Fiction needle into my heart

224
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,960
with adrenaline hearing that there was a space band with aliens at Disneyland in the 80s.

225
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
This is insane.

226
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,360
Robots, aliens, and then just regular cool people.

227
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,040
Just guys who look like they'd be on like they look straight out of the movie Semi Pro.

228
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,560
Yeah, it's their phenom.

229
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,680
It's hard to just describe this.

230
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,640
We'll post pictures, see what we're looking at.

231
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,440
But also it's one of those things, you know how like we love to romanticize and talk about

232
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,000
the Chuck E. Cheese band, the Rock of Fire explosion and how all these things have this

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,200
deep mythology and names that people keep track of and only people like us care about.

234
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
This band, not the case.

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
They didn't bother to name anybody.

236
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
There is nothing you can look up.

237
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Oh, we know what it is.

238
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Oh, names.

239
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,760
Yeah, kind of disappointing.

240
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,920
And everyone involved in this project universally just calls the big guy a Wookie.

241
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,240
Even though he's clearly not a Wookie, he is white, he is an abominable snowman.

242
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,360
But they're like, ah, you know, and then the Wookie basically are.

243
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,160
They were using it like clean and you say Kleenex when you mean like tissue.

244
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,520
They were just like a big hairy guy at that point was just a Wookie, even though it was

245
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
not a brand.

246
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,320
It was not a on brand Wookie.

247
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
It's a type.

248
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,480
Whether it's the bottom shelf of the serial aisle or the top.

250
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,640
Also, all those costumes very clearly like half trying to look like Star Wars and the

251
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,400
other half working very hard to skirt the line so they don't get sued for copyright

252
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,960
infringement or like.

253
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,920
The keyboard player is basically a stormtrooper.

254
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,440
But then there's just kind of like Sun Ra space Egyptians and tight gold pants.

255
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,680
I don't know the whole thing.

256
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,560
There's a real aesthetic happening here.

257
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,440
Just to say the whole history of it.

258
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,680
Also, they went through different names and styles.

259
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm looking at concept art of the original name of the band Starfire.

260
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,800
One word they also thought about calling it strike and they thought about calling it squad

261
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,080
SKWAD before finally landing on Halyx.

262
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,040
They all agree they didn't know what the word Halyx meant, but let's call it that.

263
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,600
So not only a keyboard player driving a golf cart around, but also a Wookie bass player

264
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
and who has to play bass in a mask and gloves.

265
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,840
And he's really doing it.

266
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,400
There is no pre-recorded anything going on.

267
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,000
He's covered in yak fur.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,700
That's what the suit was made from.

269
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,120
And then the percussionist of the band, not particularly themed, but he is doing somersaults

270
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:05,600
and backflips with a rope when he is not being called on to hit mallets and wind chimes.

271
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,280
This seems to me like the finest band.

272
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,160
This is the best band I think I like.

273
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
This is my favorite band, I think.

274
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,960
Without having heard anything, you just know from pictures.

275
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,800
I know that this is my favorite band.

276
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,960
I Googled this as soon as you were telling me about it.

277
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
I find out there is a YouTube video that says Halyx performs Jailbait.

278
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,160
Yes, I've heard the song Jailbait if I could approximate.

279
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,400
These are original songs.

280
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:37,600
They are original songs written by the guy who wrote Dun Dun and Blossom's My Opinionation.

281
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,880
The pedigree is very high.

282
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,240
So there is Jailbait, which if I could approximate the chorus, it's a female singer.

283
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,040
Well, I want you, but you're Jailbait.

284
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
Who approved that at Disneyland?

285
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
This is a song being played only at Disneyland.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,240
There is no other venue for this and they are doing a song about Jailbait.

287
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,000
The common scenario of a woman who is lusting after an underage boy.

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
Was she also a space high school teacher?

289
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Is that a part of the canon?

290
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Oh, they didn't have a canon.

291
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm going to add that to the legend of this.

292
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,320
That might help justify their lyrics.

293
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,160
Every lyric is justified at the end by going, and we're in space.

294
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,720
Laws are different here.

295
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Don't forget, we're in space.

296
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,160
We're talking space years.

297
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,080
But although no matter what the years are, if you are Jailbait.

298
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
That concept is universal regardless.

299
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,300
If they're using that term, unless it totally means something different in space.

300
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,720
Unless jail isn't as much of a problem.

301
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Jail is good in space.

302
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,960
I guess in the space of Halyx, yes.

303
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
It's not so bad.

304
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Jail is good.

305
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,480
Why, it turned out that Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.

306
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,640
No, I fucked that up.

307
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Oh, Jason.

308
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,120
Han Solo and Princess Leia turned out to almost be Jailbait for Luke Skywalker and F. Broward

309
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Strink's back.

310
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Oh, yes, sure.

311
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
We really walked around to that one.

312
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,400
In the most literal, I know.

313
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,120
I walked and tripped down the stairs along the way.

314
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,280
A different reason you would go to jail for a space relationship.

315
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,840
I don't have the song.

316
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,320
I don't have that song pulled, but I do have a song called Lightning.

317
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,880
So here now, ladies and gentlemen, a little brief taste of Halyx.

318
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:44,680
This is my favorite band.

319
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,160
That's kind of the vibe you need.

320
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,000
But if that's where you're starting, it's only getting better from there.

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,120
Not a lot of views on these videos.

322
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,280
I feel like a lot of people do not know about Halyx.

323
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,240
I want to get the word out.

324
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,480
The sound there is sort of a it's kind of a kind of a foreigner meets meets Toto meets

325
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,440
Bon Jovi's runaway and like a vocoder at the start that sounds sort of like Main Street

326
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
Electrical Parade a little bit.

327
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,480
They got that vibe with the Main Street Electrical Parade still in action at the time.

328
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,740
I mean, I feel like if I'd been if I was going to Disneyland in this era, it would have been

329
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,440
one of the three things I talked about.

330
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm not sure I'd be excited about Pirates of the Caribbean as much as this band with

331
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,240
the Wookie and the guy driving his keyboard around.

332
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,960
Well, let's let's let's real quick.

333
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,960
What would you give up to have Halyx be in the park today in the same version doing the

334
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
same songs?

335
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
What ride would you give up?

336
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Monkey Monkeys?

337
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,720
Oh, no, you you have a simpler idea.

338
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,400
I thought I thought you were trying to get us to know we have to have souls or like that

339
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
helps.

340
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,120
Yeah, I want Halyx in the park now.

341
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,920
And I'm wondering what I would give up for it.

342
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,680
You mean like an attraction?

343
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Yeah, it's a big attraction.

344
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Something's got to go.

345
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
But Halyx can come back.

346
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
It's a trade with the devil.

347
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
The devil is at your door.

348
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Autopia says, yeah, that's easy, though.

349
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,720
But it's well, hang on.

350
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,840
What if they're in the Autopia trail?

351
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,520
What if you're driving around them?

352
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,320
They have to play all day in the sun around the Autopia track.

353
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,960
They sure do to make up for their many years of absence.

354
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,200
Halyx has got to sweat it out in the sun and we'll be better off for it.

355
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
And they take all the Autopia cars and they put keyboards in them.

356
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,880
So you can play along just like the unnamed robot man.

357
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
ToonTown.

358
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
ToonTown.

359
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,320
We're getting rid of ToonTown.

360
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,040
I'll get rid of the Matterhorn.

361
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
How about that?

362
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Hey.

363
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
For Halyx?

364
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Are you kidding me?

365
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah.

366
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,720
Well, again, what if they transform that the much hallowed basketball court?

367
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,120
They turn that into like a private Halyx club.

368
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Oh, man.

369
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,640
See a secret show at Disneyland?

370
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
You get me.

371
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
You got to line up outside the Matterhorn.

372
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Yeah.

373
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
And you have to do a lot of concerts.

374
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Wow.

375
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
I'm sure this would take.

376
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,320
It is your reward for actually climbing the mountain.

377
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
You have to.

378
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,040
Oh, you have to climb to get in to see Halyx.

379
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Yes.

380
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Yeah, yeah.

381
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
There's a danger element.

382
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
You got to show how much you want it.

383
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,920
But then that mountain sort of becomes a space mountain also.

384
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,040
So it's sort of a second space mountain because they have to be playing in space.

385
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah.

386
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,720
Well, look, it's overlooking Tomorrowland.

387
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
I think you can.

388
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Yeah, OK.

389
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Fine with that.

390
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
It's kind of on the border.

391
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
That's sort of pulling it over.

392
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Halyx.

393
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,800
Yeah, this reminds me, the concept of Disney making a band reminds me of a thing that I

394
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,720
have to occasionally look up and remind myself to make sure I didn't hallucinate it is Devo

395
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
2.0.

396
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,160
Have we talked about Devo 2.0?

397
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Not in this setting we haven't.

398
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,760
I know about Devo 2.0.

399
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,640
Yeah, Devo 2.0.

400
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,600
According to Wikipedia, a quintet created for Walt Disney Records of child actors who

401
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,320
sing and dance and in the music videos and photo shoots, mime playing instruments along

402
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,680
the songs re-recorded by some of the original members of Devo.

403
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:00,000
And this album, I guess there was an album and a DVD came out in 2006.

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,080
And in the spring of 2006, I would have been at Disney World in the summer of 2006.

405
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,940
I just remember signs everywhere for Devo 2.0.

406
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,080
And I kind of knew about Devo.

407
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,760
I wasn't the biggest Devo.

408
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm still, I like Devo, but there's some people who are like, Devo man, like Devo fans.

409
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
That's one of their guys.

410
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
I think of that era.

411
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,080
Yeah, they have attracted a particular, which I've gone in and out of.

412
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,400
I know them a little deeper than other people.

413
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,360
But it didn't make me any happier to hear about Devo 2.0, I'll tell you.

414
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,960
And I guess my equivalent band would have been the Pixies.

415
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,440
Like in college, I got really into the Pixies and read a lot about them and went to one

416
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,280
of the reunion shows and that sort of thing.

417
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,080
And then for some people, that was the Devo reunion.

418
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,540
But yeah, Devo 2.0 is just all these signs with kids.

419
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,320
And I feel like on the bus, they were playing the songs.

420
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,360
They're like, check out Devo 2.0.

421
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,200
And I'm like, I don't get that.

422
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
And then some people have tried to explain it.

423
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,600
It's like, well, in the mythology of Devo, it makes sense because it's all about consumerism.

424
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,360
And then there's all this backstory about Devo that I get little bits and pieces of

425
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
sometimes.

426
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,760
And I don't quite understand it.

427
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,720
But look, I'm into backstory stuff.

428
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,920
So I'm sure I would enjoy it if I went a little deeper.

429
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,880
I like the idea that a band is commenting on the de-evolution of society and culture.

430
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,600
There's some truth to that.

431
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:33,620
However, that justifies you putting out a cash grab kids record and having the song

432
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,080
whip it be turned into Swift it in Swiffer commercials.

433
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,660
I feel like they have taken a little too much license in saying, oh, no, no, no.

434
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,200
But we are being subversive.

435
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,680
I've heard about Mother's Baw doing backwards messages in Devo songs.

436
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,560
He's doing a song for a commercial, but then it's actually a backwards voice saying, corporations

437
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
control your mind.

438
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,100
And nobody even knew what was in there.

439
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,080
But you're still getting a check from the vacuum company.

440
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
I don't know.

441
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
I think I've always had an issue.

442
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
Not saying I wouldn't do it.

443
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Not saying.

444
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh, yeah.

445
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Well, that's the thing.

446
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Yeah.

447
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Just sell out all the way.

448
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah, sure.

449
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Everyone has.

450
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Yeah.

451
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Maybe his mind is more focused on his two decades of movie soundtrack.

452
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
It's wonderful movie soundtracks.

453
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,760
There's a lot of good ones.

454
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,520
Oh, I'm a Mark Mother's Baw fan.

455
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Yeah.

456
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Yeah.

457
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,760
This particular line of logic that I have an issue with.

458
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,160
I can't believe Devo 2.0 was given concert space at Disney World.

459
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,040
I wonder if they drew a crowd.

460
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
If you watch the videos.

461
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Oh, I didn't see that.

462
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,960
I just saw posters for the album.

463
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Oh, gotcha.

464
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
OK.

465
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,320
I think they were playing it in part or like certainly probably blasting it in downtown

466
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,360
Disney or whatever.

467
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,920
And then kids without knowing it are suddenly on the drive home asking their parents, like

468
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,080
are corporations actually controlling us?

469
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,160
Dad?

470
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,440
Fun fact, one of the members of Devo 2.0 was the actress Jacqueline Emerson, who went on

471
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,320
to be in The Hunger Games.

472
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
How about that?

473
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
Good for Miss Emerson.

474
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,680
Spreading the subversive vibes still to this day.

475
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,880
Well, if you're going to compare the well, hey, actually, that that ties it in because

476
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
whereas now Disney has the full record label and they have a mechanism on which to put

477
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,200
out great rock music like Devo 2.0, they were not comfortable with putting out.

478
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,480
So also they cut a Halyx record.

479
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,100
There was an album produced by this legit producer of it was Disney was not comfortable

480
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,880
putting it out on their label because Walt Disney Records was like Cinderella storybooks

481
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
and that kind of thing.

482
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Oh, boy.

483
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,560
And we're looking at a hell of a poster here.

484
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,120
Is that real or fan?

485
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
I don't know.

486
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
What do you think?

487
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,400
I think I think that might be official.

488
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
I think it looks real to me.

489
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
It looks so cool.

490
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,680
It looks so of its time.

491
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
It's perfect.

492
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah.

493
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
It's very much.

494
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,640
It's not just the Star Wars vibe, but a little Flash Gordon, too.

495
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,440
It's kind of all the craziest 70s, 80s laser excess.

496
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,960
And so, yeah, they similar to that, Disney didn't want to put out adult films on their

497
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,000
own label.

498
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,520
So they did Touchstone and other things.

499
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,140
They put they were going to put the Halyx record out on Electra Records, still major

500
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,080
record label, and then it got bought by something else.

501
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,620
And the new head, as often happens, the new head of the label was not was some inhuman

502
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,760
monster who didn't want a space band getting released.

503
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,640
But like, oh, there's got to be bootleg.

504
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
There's got.

505
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Is there a leak?

506
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Is there a bootleg?

507
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,840
You would have to find it right now.

508
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
I couldn't.

509
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
I couldn't find it.

510
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
I dug a little bit.

511
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,720
Interrupt all proceedings if you find it.

512
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,040
But I'll just put out generally into the world that if there is a Halyx record out there,

513
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,280
if anybody has it, please see it to us.

514
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,800
Our DMS are open.

515
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah, the EMS are open and and maybe maybe do some advance.

516
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:05,080
If anyone out there is on the dark web, turn your turn your Bitcoin mining setups into

517
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
mine.

518
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,400
Hey, hey, hey, look, hey, looks fine, you look straight most powerful dark web search

519
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,960
engines that you're like hackers flying through the world wide web.

520
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Find us.

521
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,040
Something that matters.

522
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,160
Help three nerds hear an album where a robot sings

523
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,240
about a woman wanting to have sex with a minor.

524
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh, that's all I want.

525
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,360
We finally have a goal.

526
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,160
We have something to look forward to in our lives.

527
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,960
I have the song Jail Bay, right?

528
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
You heard that?

529
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,360
And there's also a song, His Heart.

530
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,520
That's what I, these are all live recordings.

531
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,680
They're all excellent.

532
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
I enjoy all of it.

533
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
We'll see these out there.

534
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,720
But here's a bigger proposition I have,

535
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,680
which is we're about to get,

536
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,200
you talk about bringing Halex back.

537
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,520
We're about to get a great new venue put into the park,

538
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,400
the Cantina, the Star Wars Galaxy's Edge.

539
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,120
Pulling the thoughts right out of my brain.

540
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

541
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,240
And we have DJ Rex coming, which is very exciting for you,

542
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
Star Wars Tour fans.

543
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,240
We're of Rex, the original captain of the Star Speeder.

544
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,560
Scott, you love your big Rex fan.

545
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,600
I'm pretty excited.

546
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,280
I don't know, there's something that seems a little cheesy

547
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,120
about this use of him.

548
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,320
And also, how is this bumbling pilot

549
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,640
suddenly a confident, cool DJ?

550
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,920
Well, I don't think he is a confident, cool DJ.

551
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,680
I think he's a bumbling DJ.

552
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
Maybe he's knocking records over.

553
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm pretty sure that's gonna be the angle.

554
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,640
Spilling glasses.

555
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,360
How do we know that piloting Star Tours vessels

556
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,920
was not his nine to five day job?

557
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,200
And DJing was his true passion.

558
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,040
Mm-hmm, you know what?

559
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
If he introduced himself to a person on the street,

560
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,080
you would say, I'm a DJ, but on the side, I'm...

561
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,920
Perhaps.

562
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,680
Well, like current Uber and Lyft drivers.

563
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,520
Yeah, right.

564
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,320
He considers his primary function a DJ.

565
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,880
Huh, pretty ahead of its time, actually.

566
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,440
But I'm excited to see him come back,

567
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
and I'm glad he's gonna be manning the stage,

568
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,400
but I'm saying, I don't know what's going on there

569
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,800
in terms of it being an actual venue,

570
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,840
but this seems to me like a place for HALIX

571
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,160
to retake their mantle.

572
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,560
And not only that, but there is kind of,

573
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,920
there's a little history of robotic or futuristic bands

574
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,840
in the Disney and or Star Wars universe.

575
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,680
You have the Max Rebo band from Return of the Jedi.

576
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,160
You have, I can only imagine, Max Rebo is an elephant,

577
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,960
and he must be friends with or a relative of Hooter,

578
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,600
who ends up playing music with Captain Eo

579
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,680
in the climactic final musical battle.

580
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,640
I think you could get Hooter and the gang

581
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,280
banging on their metallic trash cans

582
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,200
or whatever's going on there.

583
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,600
Yeah, let's get all these bands,

584
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,360
well, and also, with the news about Chuck E. Cheese,

585
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,640
and the Chuck E. Cheese's band disappearing,

586
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,100
Munch's Make Believe band,

587
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,280
there's gonna be a lot of out of work

588
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,680
Chuck E. Cheese animatronics.

589
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,120
Why don't we get them into the canteen as well?

590
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,960
That's great, too.

591
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,080
It's an animatronic surplus, right?

592
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
It's like America Sings all over again.

593
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,000
I'll take your idea, I'll see it one better.

594
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,320
The three of us will be in HALIX.

595
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,640
Yes.

596
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,080
We'll play in the band.

597
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,800
We will take off from whatever we have to do next summer

598
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,520
whenever this opens.

599
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,120
We'll put Jason in that thing, that writing thing.

600
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
He plays keyboard.

601
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,720
He doesn't even have to play, it's just a track or whatever.

602
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,600
But you know, I play a little, Scott plays a little.

603
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,640
I think we should be HALIX.

604
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,160
I will take some classes, I'll learn gymnastics.

605
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,040
I'll take up the role of the summer salting percussionist.

606
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,040
This might also be the only way we get into Star Wars land.

607
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,400
If Armageddon, they seem to be preparing

608
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,960
for an end of the world sort of scenario.

609
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,720
For the crowds there.

610
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Yeah, the crowds.

611
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,200
I don't know that the performers will even get to go

612
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,480
on the rides for months.

613
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,160
They might just put a black bag over your head

614
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,200
and rush you into the cantina and that'll be it.

615
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,680
Yeah, I think from what we're talking about,

616
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,760
that there's gonna be, we've learned that there's

617
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,080
potentially a lot of restrictions on annual pass holders

618
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,520
and can they get into Star Wars for the first summer

619
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
or not, like different levels will be.

620
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
It sounds like you might get punished

621
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,760
for being an annual pass holder.

622
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,680
Yes, I think you're gonna be outside of Galaxy's Edge

623
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,040
and there's gonna be big people cages.

624
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,480
It's gonna be like a children of men scenario

625
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,920
where people are caught in the hinterlands

626
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,680
between borders and dogs are barking at them

627
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,280
and pushing them into the corner.

628
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,920
And I don't know, I'm a little worried about

629
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,520
just border chaos at Galaxy's Edge.

630
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,800
It's gonna be a nightmare.

631
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,960
Unless we're Halyx.

632
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,000
Unless we can soothe the beasts with our musical tunes

633
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,880
and our hyper futuristic golf cart.

634
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,240
Hey guys, put your differences aside and check this out.

635
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,440
Din din din din din din din din din din din din din din.

636
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,000
Space boy, you're my space boy.

637
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,040
Wow, he's right.

638
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,480
Let's hug it out.

639
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Hug it out.

640
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,000
We've launched a lot of different campaigns lately,

641
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,600
but I do think, let me see,

642
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,600
hashtag podcast the ride boys for Halyx.

643
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,280
Is that a hashtag?

644
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,680
Or how about just, let's tie it all together, Halyx 2.0.

645
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,520
Hashtag Halyx 2.0.

646
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,680
Oh great, Halyx 2.0.

647
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,600
Halyx 2.0, yeah.

648
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,720
If they start feeling the street team power

649
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,440
that is building about Halyx 2.0,

650
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,880
they'll be sure to, if they know it's gonna get,

651
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,200
I think we virally could get equal attention

652
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,720
to Star Wars Galaxies.

653
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,160
Just so we're on the same page,

654
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,160
that's Halyx 2, the number two, the word point,

655
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,200
and the number zero.

656
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,720
Because if you put a period in 2.0,

657
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,080
it will break the hashtag.

658
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Oh, that's a good point.

659
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,320
No punctuation.

660
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,160
Okay, okay.

661
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,320
So Halyx, the number two, the word point,

662
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,160
and zero.

663
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,600
We'll show you online.

664
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,960
Should we also, in keeping with the bizarre spelling,

665
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,520
should there be an extra Y in there?

666
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Or maybe the I in point is a one, or an exclamation point.

667
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,480
I'm just saying, while we're having fun with this

668
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,320
and complicating it.

669
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,280
Yeah, we might need to get a whiteboard out

670
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,640
and workshop this a little.

671
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,560
So check out the Twitter after this episode goes live.

672
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,160
We will keep noodling with this,

673
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,360
and we will determine what the hashtag is,

674
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,440
and hopefully it'll be ready

675
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,480
by the time you're checking out the Twitter.

676
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,240
Thanks again for, I know we give you a lot of assignments.

677
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,920
There's a lot of supplemental reading

678
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,240
and homework on this podcast.

679
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,760
That's what I love about theme parks, homework.

680
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
After you've listened to three guys talk

681
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,560
for an hour and a half, perhaps more, perhaps many more,

682
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,400
then go read further essays,

683
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,320
and do voting and street team work.

684
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,120
For free.

685
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,200
If we had our druthers, people would have to read

686
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,200
all about these parks to even be allowed in.

687
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,440
To understand the choices about crowd flow.

688
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,280
You would have to pass a written exam

689
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,120
to get into Star Wars land.

690
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,840
Why should you come to Galaxy's Edge?

691
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,520
You don't know what was here before.

692
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,200
You don't know it was the Hunchback of Notre Dame

693
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,640
Festival of Fools, and also backstage storage area stables.

694
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,480
Yes.

695
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,000
Prove your worth before you enter Galaxy's Edge.

696
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,280
All right, well, we're tossing a lot out there,

697
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,640
but mainly above all else, check out HALIX

698
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,200
so you can truly appreciate HALIX 2.0.

699
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
So from the beginnings of Rock in the Disney parks

700
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,840
to some grand total, the highest HALIX they ever reached.

701
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,880
Worldwide status.

702
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,080
Yeah.

703
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,440
Let's start talking about the Rock

704
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,440
and Rock in roller coaster starring Aerosmith.

705
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,680
Or as it is known in Paris, rock and roller coaster,

706
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,040
Avec Aerosmith.

707
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,880
Right.

708
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,240
Whichever you wish.

709
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,440
I think we should start by,

710
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,560
what is each of our personal relationship with Aerosmith?

711
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,880
That's exactly what I wanted to talk about.

712
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,240
I think it's important to calibrate this.

713
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,400
I'll go first.

714
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,400
I got into listening to popular music a little late.

715
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,800
My mom force fed me Herman's Hermits and The Beatles,

716
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,200
but mostly just the pop stuff, not the psychedelic stuff.

717
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,640
And like 60s pop music.

718
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,440
So when I was like 13 or 14,

719
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,200
then I started getting into the cool stuff.

720
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,240
We're talking The Cardigans, Love Fool.

721
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,080
We're talking anything that was on the radio.

722
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,520
That, by the way, is a great song.

723
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Paula Cole.

724
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,320
Paula Cole, sure.

725
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,240
All that cool stuff.

726
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,200
And then at that point, my parents were like,

727
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,640
oh, he's getting into rock and roll music.

728
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,960
So then they started buying me, you know,

729
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,240
Best of Led Zeppelin and Best of This

730
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
and then Best of Aerosmith.

731
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,640
And man, I loved Aerosmith.

732
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,520
I'll tell you what.

733
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,360
All right.

734
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,720
I loved Aerosmith.

735
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,160
I thought they were great.

736
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,200
I liked the Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.

737
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,280
I liked Armageddon.

738
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,880
I liked that song.

739
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,840
I was very basic at the time,

740
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,800
as I guess you would say, with music.

741
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,560
And boy, did I love,

742
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,880
there was no song I loved more by Aerosmith

743
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,720
than 1999's Jaded.

744
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,160
I was gonna say, I think that is still my current favorite.

745
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,400
A pretty good song that I still kinda like to this day.

746
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,720
It would've been the right age.

747
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,360
Got a lot of play on the radio.

748
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,640
Probably got some play at school dances, right?

749
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,480
Does that sound right?

750
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,560
Yeah, a little bit.

751
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,200
I remember I was at a school dance

752
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,320
and I was dancing, it was like a slow dance

753
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,400
and it was I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.

754
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,680
And I remember the girl who went with me at the time,

755
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,280
it started playing and she went, oh.

756
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,120
And I was like, what?

757
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
I went, what?

758
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,000
You pushed her to the ground.

759
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,240
But she had a cool, she liked Weezer

760
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,280
and like cool stuff that I didn't even like in high school.

761
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,080
That other platinum selling, the cooler platinum selling.

762
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,920
I wasn't cool enough to be in Weezer.

763
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,760
You weren't there yet.

764
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,680
I was like 17.

765
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,120
I got into Weezer like I was 18,

766
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,680
maybe around that same time.

767
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,720
But I wasn't way in yet.

768
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,560
As Jason said, I'll late Bloomer.

769
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,320
So yeah, I really liked Aerosmith.

770
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,280
There was a song called Girls of Summer on a Greatest Hit.

771
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,120
Oh, that's good.

772
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,960
That's a pretty good song as well.

773
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,600
Some girls.

774
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,760
Yes, still pretty good.

775
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,600
You know what?

776
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,320
I think we tend to like these sort of generic,

777
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,680
pretty good pop songs.

778
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,640
I think any band that had bought those songs

779
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,280
would have gotten something out of them.

780
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,840
Because they were like, I don't know actually

781
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,760
who wrote those songs, but they were,

782
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,720
in the 80s, they've kind of famously started writing

783
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
with five different songwriters at once

784
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,720
and all their hit they had.

785
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,840
I don't want to miss a thing.

786
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,360
Diane Warren, the most balladeer.

787
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,280
That was the very end of the insane selling albums era,

788
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,480
I feel like, insane CD selling.

789
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,320
I don't want to miss a thing.

790
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,160
That's about right.

791
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,000
A couple years left after 99.

792
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,200
A few years, but yeah.

793
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
Sure, and they were compilations and stuff.

794
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,680
What a weird take that we have on it.

795
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,360
Because you jaded and you like this Girls of Summer song.

796
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,160
And I specifically bought a single of the song Pink.

797
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,000
Oh yeah, Pink is.

798
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,200
I continue to like Pink, okay.

799
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,560
Pink is not a bad song.

800
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,480
We'll get into that.

801
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,240
It's a dirty song.

802
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,960
But it's a very catchy.

803
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,400
Joe Perry, I think famously, was a little upset

804
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,680
of all these pop songs.

805
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,480
He wanted to rock a little harder.

806
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,360
But Mr. Steven Tyler likes having hits.

807
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,200
Yeah, didn't Joe Perry end up in some Satriani

808
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,000
sort of like noodley indulgent,

809
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,840
jammy band.

810
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,520
With the Chickenfoot?

811
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,160
No, he's not in Chickenfoot.

812
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,680
This sort of tips my bit at the end,

813
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,040
but he's in the Hollywood Vampires.

814
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,440
Oh, that's what, oh wow.

815
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,440
The Jelly Dab Al's Super Band.

816
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
And he's in, I'm sure he's in his own,

817
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,600
he's had some solo albums as well.

818
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,160
But he's very much like a rock and roll guy.

819
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,200
And I think he was fighting with Steven

820
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
about having all these pop songs.

821
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,280
But Steven wanted hits, Steven didn't care.

822
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,000
I think Steven probably likes pop music more than Joe does.

823
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,400
This is similar to the tension between Brian Wilson

824
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
and Mike Love of the Beach Boys.

825
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
And probably at various times,

826
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
Mick and Keith and John and Paul,

827
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,240
except there is no genius anywhere in this scenario.

828
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,320
There's less of, like there's a few,

829
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm about 25%, I feel like, through my Aerosmith feelings.

830
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,320
I'm gonna come back in an hour.

831
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
Because this seems right in your guys' wheelhouse.

832
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,240
Yes, it is.

833
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,280
Yeah, now I'm having 500 thoughts at once.

834
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,160
I will say the riff in Sweet Emotion is still awesome.

835
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,040
That is a very good riff.

836
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,440
And it's cool and I will listen to that any time.

837
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,040
Richard Linklater would agree with you.

838
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,360
Yes, Richard Linklater and I.

839
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,080
Do I like 70s Aerosmith?

840
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,920
I don't know.

841
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,240
Walk This Way doesn't hold up so much for me.

842
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,280
No, I find that sort of corny.

843
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,520
And I have a real, I get embarrassment goosebumps

844
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,680
very easily if I think something is corny and hokey.

845
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,440
I sort of, the hairs stand on my arm.

846
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,960
And I find.

847
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,600
Like a spider sense you would say?

848
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,120
My cheesy sense is tingling.

850
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,320
Which happens during theme park shows a lot.

851
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,160
Yeah, sure.

852
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,400
Yeah, you're gonna get a lot of corniness there.

853
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,520
But I think the Super Bowl halftime show

854
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,840
that they did with NSYNC,

855
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,320
where then they are joined by Nelly and Britney Spears

856
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,000
and they all do da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.

857
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,800
And they're all like walking back and forth

858
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,600
and NSYNC's doing like pop locks.

859
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,440
It's happening.

860
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,680
My hairs are standing. Wow, getting.

861
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,360
I get such sheer embarrassment

862
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,520
for a big cornball musical number

863
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,080
that I have a literal bodily reaction to it.

864
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,640
I believe if we go back and watch that,

865
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,000
Joe Perry's having the same reaction.

866
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,680
I'm sure he was rolling his eyes

867
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,080
when they pitched him all that stuff.

868
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,000
The hair on the top of his head is.

869
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
But Stephen was like, yeah, wow, that's great.

870
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,240
Or whatever.

871
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,360
All of those people in one halftime show,

872
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,080
how much money, how much would that have cost?

873
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,960
I mean, I guess that's an amazing marketing at the time.

874
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,800
All deals.

875
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,080
There's deals happening.

876
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,360
Also, there was like a filmed segment

877
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,560
before everybody came out with Ben Stiller and Chris Rock

878
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,760
because it was an MTV produced halftime show.

879
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,560
So not only that, they had to pay Stiller and Rock

880
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,640
to do improvised cameos for this thing.

881
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,800
Stiller used to be great at those little pre-show sketch.

882
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,640
That was his wheel.

883
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,040
And the awards with him and Tom Cruise.

884
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,160
Zoolander born from the VH1 fashion awards.

885
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh yeah.

886
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,720
Yeah, a rare film made out of award show sketches,

887
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,560
which they tried to do with,

888
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,680
oh no, Les Grossman, the Tom Cruise character

889
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,080
is from Tropic Thunder,

890
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,160
but then he did like a big dance at the MTV Movie Awards,

891
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,520
which they were, it seemed to be them,

892
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,080
that was like their fundraising effort

893
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,760
to make the Les Grossman movie,

894
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,360
which sadly did not occur.

895
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,560
Anyway, we're off the track.

896
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,600
Wait, Jason, what's your feeling?

897
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,440
Yeah, sure.

898
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,760
I think I said this before when Led Zeppelin came up,

899
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,240
but I knew them as like,

900
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,760
I knew them as like a huge band

901
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,200
and I would hear the singles on the radio

902
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,000
or like at the, they played it in the mall

903
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,320
or at theme parks and stuff.

904
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,760
I don't think I've ever owned an Aerosmith record.

905
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
Mm-hmm.

906
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,600
I don't think I've ever heard

907
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,880
an Aerosmith record start to finish,

908
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,960
but I knew the hits.

909
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,920
Like I think I probably knew all the hits.

910
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,960
I bet there are people who have Aerosmith tattoos

911
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,280
who have not heard an album all the way through.

912
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,600
Yes, that's true.

913
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,320
I guess I probably knew a lot of like the great,

914
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,840
what would be on the greatest hits.

915
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,680
I mean, when I would have been in like the,

916
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,520
in the middle school,

917
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,840
we started going to dances and all high school,

918
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:55,600
I mean, Don't Wanna Miss a Thing and Jade It

919
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,560
were like huge hits.

920
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,160
So they were certainly being played there.

921
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,280
So I probably knew them best.

922
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,000
The fact that there's potentially people more

923
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,520
in Aerosmith's era and who like them more

924
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,120
who are possibly screaming about the fact that all we,

925
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,960
oh yeah, I like them.

926
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,800
I like Jade It.

927
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,040
I like I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.

928
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,000
We are not referring remotely to 70s, 80s

929
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
to the Alicia Silverstone era.

930
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,680
I praised the Sweet Emotion riff.

931
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,520
You did.

932
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,360
Yeah.

933
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,960
That's a cool riff.

934
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,800
What else do I like?

935
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,240
Dream On, I think I like Dream On.

936
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,320
It's okay, right?

937
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
Yeah.

938
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,000
Dream On is okay.

939
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,080
We're kind of, we're classic rock fans.

940
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,000
I don't know that we really need to think about Dream On

941
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,840
for too long.

942
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
I like, I'm looking at just the greatest hits right now.

943
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,880
Mama Kin, do we know that song?

944
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,720
I don't.

945
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
That's kind of a fun song.

946
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,960
I'm not gonna sing it, but it's fun.

947
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,920
Oh, I guess that's probably a big place I knew.

948
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,800
There is, I grew up with 1029, MGK, Philadelphia,

949
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,080
classic rock.

950
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,600
And they, I think would play,

951
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,760
they're at Bass and Marismith and they're for sure.

952
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,200
Back in the Saddle.

953
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,920
Don't know it.

954
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,320
I'm back in the Saddle again.

955
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,640
It's a very obnoxious sort of song.

956
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,160
They're pretty bluesy, which I think eliminates me

957
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,960
from a lot of musical runnings.

958
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,520
The more bluesy it is, and they did an entire album.

959
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,360
I wrote it down.

960
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,180
Yes, I have that album.

961
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,640
Yeah, what's it called?

962
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,200
It's called Honkin' on Bobo.

963
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,040
Why?

964
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,480
Oh, this is another thing with Aerosmith.

965
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,880
It's all just like, just the lamest bawdy dirty crap.

966
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,280
It's just, it's like, there's like one of their albums

967
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,160
is like one car humping another car.

968
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,280
It's just some lame.

969
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,120
How did I forget about Honkin' on Bobo?

970
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,480
That's what I wanted to call my Seth MacFarlane

971
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,520
crooner-esque album, where I sang American Songbook

972
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,120
standards and then Aerosmith sued me.

973
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,520
You know, it's weird that I forgot about that.

974
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,880
The chapter, I try to not bring it up around you,

975
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,160
but since it's out there.

976
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,120
Even I've buried it.

977
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,920
You'd think I would have brought it up very first thing

978
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,600
when asked what is my relationship with Aerosmith.

979
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,440
The lawsuit.

980
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,280
Yes, yeah.

981
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,120
The lawsuit.

982
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,360
Big Ones, which of course is dicks.

983
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,520
They've famously covered Big 10 Inch,

984
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,920
which is an old blues song.

985
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,480
It's an innuendo for a giant dick.

986
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,320
Is the fact that they covered The Beatles Come Together,

987
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,640
where they think they're a different type of.

988
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,480
Oh boy.

989
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,800
Maybe even their covers are sexualized.

990
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm gonna say that is right.

991
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,360
Here's a big thing I remember knowing about Aerosmith

992
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,080
was like, when did this come out in the 90s

993
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,520
that Steven Tyler was Liv Tyler's father?

994
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,120
And I remember that being news and just a fact I learned.

995
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,960
I think I just knew it as like,

996
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,920
oh oddly enough, Steven Tyler is Liv Tyler's father.

997
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,720
Steven Tyler was Liv Tyler's father

998
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,200
and he didn't claim paternity for years.

999
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,640
I didn't know the second part.

1000
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,880
Yeah, and that she grew up thinking

1001
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,280
one of my favorite musicians, Todd Rungren,

1002
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,120
was her father.

1003
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,720
Oh, I don't think I realized that.

1004
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,800
From one to another, very strangely,

1005
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,000
because who's the mom?

1006
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,520
Is it B.B.?

1007
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,760
Yeah, Buell.

1008
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,600
Yeah.

1009
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,560
And then, well, which then once they got back together,

1010
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,040
once father and daughter are friendly again,

1011
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,440
what do you do but put her in a highly sexualized

1012
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,480
lesbian themed music video?

1013
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,720
If Trump were a rock star, that's what Trump would have done.

1014
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,160
Trump would have put Ivanka in all of these sexy videos.

1015
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,480
Really get the hair blowing.

1016
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,640
Yeah, get her on set just directing her, yeah.

1017
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,240
Get that long sweater she's wearing

1018
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,480
flapping in the breeze.

1019
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Were you guys into the Alicia Silverstone?

1020
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,640
I liked them at the time.

1021
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,800
I like them less now.

1022
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,440
I liked Cryin' Okay.

1023
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,120
Amazing, I feel like, is the worst of the three.

1024
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,880
Oh, it is, but then my favorite,

1025
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,800
because it's got digital tunnels and virtual shit.

1026
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,560
I probably should, I haven't listened to it a long time.

1027
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,920
Cryin', what's crazy?

1028
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,760
Crazy is okay.

1029
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,320
Cryin', I feel like was my favorite at the time.

1030
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,160
The best song probably of the trilogy.

1031
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,520
Probably the best song is Cryin'.

1032
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,040
The videos, I guess, the videos are good of their time.

1033
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
They're very of their time.

1034
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,280
I haven't watched them in a while.

1035
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,120
Yeah.

1036
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,240
Well, I mean, the point is,

1037
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,960
I don't think this is an uncommon level of fandom

1038
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,800
for Aerosmith.

1039
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,760
Like am I, I don't know.

1040
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,200
Are there people who are,

1041
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,040
if you're like really into music,

1042
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,960
or if you're a music critic, do you like Aerosmith?

1043
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,080
I don't think so.

1044
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,120
But at the same time,

1045
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,760
I don't think it produces animosity.

1046
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,080
Like Big Lebowski,

1047
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,920
I hate the fucking Eagles level animosity.

1048
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,760
Yeah, I think you're right.

1049
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,760
And even I don't, yeah, I don't dislike Aerosmith.

1050
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,800
I've had some good times with Aerosmith songs playing.

1051
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,280
And so, but you know what?

1052
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,520
What I'm saying is they would not be my first choice

1053
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,720
of what to put on.

1054
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,560
Right.

1055
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,680
And in fact, when Disney in the 90s decided

1056
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,480
to do a rock themed roller coaster,

1057
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,760
Aerosmith was not their first choice.

1058
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Was not the first choice,

1059
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,080
which I just learned about.

1060
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,160
And it's crazy.

1061
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah.

1062
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,720
Can you guess?

1063
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,880
Can anybody know?

1064
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,800
As you might guess,

1065
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,200
the Rolling Stones were the first band approached.

1066
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,520
And I believe they actually were approached.

1067
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,320
This is some Jim Hill info.

1068
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,320
I believe they wanted seven to $10 million a year

1069
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,400
in licensing.

1070
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,200
That's a year in licensing.

1071
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,480
Disney every year.

1072
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,960
That corporation would have to pay the Rolling Stones

1073
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,120
$10 million out of pocket.

1074
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,960
That's wild.

1075
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,920
Is that worth, and I think,

1076
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,000
I don't think it is worth,

1077
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,040
I don't think people are going,

1078
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,720
I don't think anybody's going to the park

1079
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,080
because there's a Rolling Stones ride.

1080
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,880
Well also then that means that Aerosmith came in

1081
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,760
at a much lower rate, a much more reasonable.

1082
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,640
Yeah, 10% is what Hill claims.

1083
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,920
10% of that amount?

1084
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,120
Of one million split.

1085
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,960
How many of them?

1086
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,760
Five, six, four?

1087
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,080
Depends on who's a,

1088
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
well wait, of Aerosmith?

1089
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,920
Of Aerosmith.

1090
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,760
There are five.

1091
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,600
There's five Aerosmith members.

1092
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,440
Can anybody name them?

1093
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,120
I can name all of them I believe.

1094
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:44,960
Do we want me to do it?

1095
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,800
Sure.

1096
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,880
Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Brad Whitford,

1097
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,640
not Bradley Whitford, Brad Whitford,

1098
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,480
Joey Kramer and Tom Hamilton.

1099
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,320
How about it?

1100
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,160
Wow, see five guys the whole time.

1101
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,360
I didn't look that up before.

1102
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,200
I just knew that.

1103
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,360
That is weird that it has not been,

1104
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,640
nobody's changed out.

1105
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,480
Yeah, that is pretty odd.

1106
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,720
There's a lot of personnel changes in bands of this level,

1107
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,880
but they're all, they want those checks.

1108
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,840
They don't want the checks going to some guy

1109
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,000
who looks like them.

1110
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,160
That is impressive though.

1111
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,240
And I also think it's funny that these names

1112
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,080
that are sort of obscure to some people,

1113
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,560
Tom Hamilton or whatever,

1114
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,840
the amount of acting and performing

1115
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,040
these people have had to do and have to do in the ride.

1116
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,560
This is a ride that thousands and thousands

1117
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,960
of people experience every day

1118
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,280
in which you watch Tom Hamilton recite dialogue.

1119
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,120
It's kind of funny.

1120
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,440
For 20 years.

1121
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,040
So Rolling Stones say no,

1122
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,600
or Disney's not willing to pay that amount of money.

1123
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,240
Aerosmith says yes.

1124
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,360
This is a question I had for you guys.

1125
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,520
If Aerosmith says no,

1126
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,520
what do you think Disney's list was?

1127
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,360
They're obviously going for baby boomers.

1128
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,080
They're obviously going for dad.

1129
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,520
And Timelessness, a band that might keep going

1130
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,360
for another decade or so.

1131
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
They've lasted a while.

1132
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,440
Yeah, you gotta have something.

1133
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,280
Yeah, Jason.

1134
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,960
Well, I wish, you know,

1135
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,920
one fact about this ride

1136
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,880
that I feel like is often thrown about,

1137
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,720
and God knows how far this even was along the pipeline

1138
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,320
in terms of actually happening,

1139
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,320
was that there was gonna be a West Coast version for DCA.

1140
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,560
Really? No doubt as the band.

1141
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,120
I've never heard that. The Rock and Roller Coaster

1142
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,120
started no doubt. Yes, I already read that.

1143
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,560
But that was a few years later too.

1144
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,400
A few years later.

1145
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,680
But I think- I don't think

1146
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,200
they would have gone no doubt

1147
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,680
in 1997 or eight. No, I don't think

1148
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,280
they would have, yeah.

1149
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,280
But I think that would have been something else.

1150
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,120
That's kind of crazy.

1151
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,200
A nice way to tribute, yeah, the band.

1152
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,240
Clearly Disneyland fans.

1153
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,640
Yeah, in Orange County.

1154
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,920
Being Threaded Kingdom.

1155
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,920
Gwen Stefani went to Studio K as we learned,

1156
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,760
at Knott's Berry Farm.

1157
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,080
But I'm just like, who?

1158
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,400
I think Aerosmith says no.

1159
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
I don't know who says yes.

1160
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,520
It's hard to think about a band

1161
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,160
that has been around that long

1162
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,600
and has some staying power.

1163
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,080
And yeah, in the 90s had a bunch more hits.

1164
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,760
It's pretty rare.

1165
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,880
You gotta give it to them.

1166
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,440
We're being snarky about it.

1167
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,160
But the longevity is pretty impressive.

1168
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah, there's no one else.

1169
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,080
I mean, who else was in the,

1170
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,280
who had a hit, who hits in the 70s

1171
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,080
and then had hits in the 90s?

1172
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,000
Well, Tom Petty.

1173
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,840
Yes, that's true.

1174
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,440
And Tom Petty will not,

1175
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,760
He would not have done this.

1176
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,840
Yeah, maybe not.

1177
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,640
I bet he'll do, you see him on The Simpsons or something.

1178
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,560
Yeah, but he thinks that's cool.

1179
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,960
He likes, he's a comedy guy.

1180
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,080
He likes Gary Shamlin.

1181
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,920
Gary Shamlin.

1182
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,760
He was on those shows.

1183
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,960
It could have been like,

1184
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,240
what is the Diddy song, Come With Me?

1185
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,080
Jimmy Page.

1186
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,920
Yeah, Jimmy, oh man.

1187
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,040
If it had been a Jimmy Page

1188
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,080
and Puff Daddy, Come With Me ride.

1189
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,920
Okay, that's something.

1190
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,280
Oh man, that would have been wild.

1191
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,400
That timing just about works out, I feel like.

1192
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,040
90s, late 90s?

1193
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,080
Avoiding 98 specific Godzilla.

1194
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,920
Right.

1195
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,040
Yeah, no Godzilla.

1196
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,920
Just like, hey, we're here.

1197
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,160
We're just recording another new version of Come With Me.

1198
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, or yeah, or just another,

1199
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,920
yeah, it's Come With Me 2

1200
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,480
and it's a different Led Zeppelin song

1201
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,840
with Puffy rapping over it.

1202
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,240
I do like to circle back to Petty.

1203
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,800
I do like the idea of call it like,

1204
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,400
running down a dream.

1205
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,240
Sure.

1206
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,360
Where you're in the car and you're.

1207
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,840
You do a quick launch to that.

1208
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,840
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1209
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,480
Yeah, that's probably the only appropriate.

1210
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,880
So American Girl probably it ends with, but yeah.

1211
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,040
We're getting sued now.

1212
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,880
That's fun.

1213
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,160
That me just doing that approximation.

1214
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,720
Now I'm on the Sam Smith list.

1215
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,560
I did Sweet Emotion earlier.

1216
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,760
I.

1217
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,240
And whatever record company that doesn't know

1218
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,480
that they own Halix, if they find out.

1219
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,760
Oh yeah, yeah, we're fucked.

1220
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,600
Yep.

1221
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,360
I guess who, yeah, who would have been a band,

1222
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,000
because you can't go like to.

1223
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,400
Another question you would have to consider

1224
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,000
is who would play ball with Disney?

1225
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,320
Like who would.

1226
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,640
Aerosmith was all about playing ball in the 90s.

1227
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,560
All about playing.

1228
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,160
They would loved playing ball.

1229
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,480
It worked out very well for them.

1230
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,360
But like the bare naked ladies

1231
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,840
would have been a little too silly.

1232
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,920
They were too fresh though.

1233
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,760
They were too fresh.

1234
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,560
They hadn't been around a long time.

1235
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,480
But the chickadee China, the Chinese chicken walk around

1236
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,880
in the character in the parks.

1237
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,720
That would have been great.

1238
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,800
Oh, that would have aged wonderfully.

1239
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,520
Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins,

1240
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,520
early 90s bands that sort of seemed like

1241
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,200
they might have been around a while.

1242
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,200
Another issue you have with picking a band is edginess.

1243
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,280
Although you're right, Aerosmith has.

1244
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,120
Very edgy.

1245
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,960
Yeah. It's all edgy.

1246
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,520
And in fact really bit them in the butt many years later.

1247
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,360
Yes.

1248
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,440
The choice of Aerosmith.

1249
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,320
I don't know, I think it obviously had to be.

1250
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
It had to be Aerosmith.

1251
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,760
Aerosmith.

1252
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,760
So what else do we, what do we know about this?

1253
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,360
Should we talk about the plot of the ride?

1254
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,640
Yeah.

1255
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,480
The star, I mean the other two famous actors in it.

1256
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,320
Sure, okay.

1257
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,400
Yeah, you go into a recording studio essentially.

1258
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,120
Like a record headquarters,

1259
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,400
but it's got a recording studio in it.

1260
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,120
It's called, do you have it written down

1261
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,960
with the recording studio?

1262
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,360
G-Force. G-Force.

1263
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,840
And then it's called Tour de Force in France, I believe.

1264
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,960
But then there's also, that said,

1265
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,600
once you get inside the building,

1266
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,480
there are posters for Hollywood records bands.

1267
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,320
Yes.

1268
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,140
I remember that.

1269
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,280
I remember going like, oh, Hollywood records.

1270
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,560
That's a good fake name for a record label

1271
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,600
to have in this movie themed park.

1272
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,560
No, that's this is actual record label, Hollywood records.

1273
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,400
Sure it was.

1274
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,520
One of them.

1275
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,680
Yeah, they have in France,

1276
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,040
they have like John and Yoko up

1277
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,140
in different like pieces of memorabilia.

1278
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,980
So it's not all.

1279
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,200
In France, they have Vanessa Paradis,

1280
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,240
French singer with basically no awareness in America.

1281
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,280
So it's a totally bureaucrified experience

1282
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,360
at Tour de Force Records.

1283
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,400
They still, look, they have some American,

1284
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,920
but it's not total.

1285
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,760
Yeah.

1286
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,640
It's not totally just specific to the land.

1287
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,400
So you go to recording studio.

1288
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,160
Because Aerosmith is, are you there

1289
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,680
to see them finish a record?

1290
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,520
It's unclear.

1291
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,240
So this is always the thing that even confused me in 1998.

1292
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,220
You go in and they're recording Walk This Way.

1293
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,560
It doesn't make any sense.

1294
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,940
They've already recorded two versions, famously,

1295
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,840
of Walk This Way in their hist and their life,

1296
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,280
the Run DMC version and the original.

1297
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,440
But they had probably had to do it again within sync.

1298
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,280
They might.

1299
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,100
I guess that's a good point.

1300
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,080
Maybe they are constantly re-recording.

1301
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,160
Probably for Swiffer commercials and stuff,

1302
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,000
just like Devo.

1303
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,700
Swift This Way, Swift This.

1304
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,200
Yeah, so you go in there,

1305
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,400
they're in the middle of recording.

1306
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,800
Ken Marino from The State and many other things

1307
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,100
is the engineer.

1308
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,960
He has no lines.

1309
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,640
Yes, this is a, I imagine something

1310
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,440
that nobody took note of when it was, yeah,

1311
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,560
they're recording a song.

1312
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,380
He's manning a mixing board.

1313
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,120
And probably nobody noticed it or thought about it

1314
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,960
at the time.

1315
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,780
That's just an engineer.

1316
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,120
But years down the line, he's much more famous

1317
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,240
and popular from a lot of shows and stuff.

1318
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,400
And it's a strange, distracting fact that he is,

1319
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,960
that it's Ken Marino.

1320
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,880
And you think, was he there to add a comedic value

1321
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,800
or punchline?

1322
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,400
No, he says nothing.

1323
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,360
He sits there silently.

1324
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,520
This is being, there's a technology being deployed

1325
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,320
similar to hologram technology,

1326
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,840
similar to what you see today at,

1327
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,000
oh, I don't know, the Hologram USA Theater

1328
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,160
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1329
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,240
Oh, there it is.

1330
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,060
You're in a recording studio and there's the glass

1331
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,280
that separates the booth from where the recording

1332
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,120
takes place.

1333
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,880
And Aerosmith and Ken Marino and their manager,

1334
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,880
Ileana Douglas, are on the other side of the glass.

1335
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,760
But it's done in this projected way

1336
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,720
where it sort of looks like they're there.

1337
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,240
It's a little bit of a photo real kind of shooting.

1338
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,080
And to do this, they had to shoot

1339
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,320
with unbelievably bright lights.

1340
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,200
The exposure had to be crazy high.

1341
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
And I found Ken Marino talking about it

1342
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,480
on the Nerdist podcast.

1343
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,160
And he apparently had to wear special contact lenses

1344
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,720
so that he would not go blind during the all day shooting,

1345
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,240
staring it.

1346
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,040
I can only assume the other people,

1347
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,040
it was the same deal unless Steven Tyler's brain's

1348
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,360
already too fried.

1349
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,000
Just toss that in there, man.

1350
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,760
Oh, we'll do that to you, my man.

1351
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,400
That effect is used, I believe it's similar

1352
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,360
in the queue line at Gringotts where you go into,

1353
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,360
you go into one of the bankers' offices.

1354
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,040
You go into one of the many Weasley brothers' offices.

1355
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,440
It's kind of hologram-y.

1356
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,280
It's kind of on the other ride too, on Forbidden Journey too

1357
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,160
when you see the kids and the poke of invisibility.

1358
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,800
It's sort of a similar thing of like, yeah.

1359
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,480
It kind of looks like they're there.

1360
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,560
Now the film looks a little old.

1361
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,360
It looks a little old.

1362
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,560
Yeah, it still looks pretty good.

1363
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,760
I was there six months ago.

1364
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,240
Holds up, cool.

1365
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,040
So you're there to see a recording session

1366
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,800
but then Ileana Douglas, their manager, comes in and says,

1367
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,040
you gotta leave right now.

1368
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,840
You got a concert to get to.

1369
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,480
And they initially accede to this demand.

1370
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,480
They leave and go back into a very CG limo

1371
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,160
in the back of the room, out the door of the recording studio

1372
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,960
which leads straight out to the street, obviously.

1373
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,400
They start getting in the limo and then pretty late

1374
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,280
after a lot of like, after 10 seconds of just milling around

1375
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,920
and Joe Perry asking for his blacklist Paul,

1376
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,000
yo Chris, can I get my blacklist Paul?

1377
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,440
Then it occurs to Steve and Tyler, wait a minute.

1378
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,320
What about these people?

1379
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,640
We're just gonna leave them here?

1380
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,480
They're not gonna come to the concert with us?

1381
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,080
Yeah, and because he says they love their fans.

1382
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,400
You know how we feel about our fans?

1383
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,240
You know how we feel about our fans.

1384
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,400
Famously love their fans.

1385
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,480
And yeah, so they also kind of like lightly harass

1386
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,560
Ileana Douglas.

1387
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,040
It's like kind of a, like they're all sort of,

1388
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,800
you get the set, like if cameras weren't rolling,

1389
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,280
like they'd hit her on the butt or something.

1390
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,960
Or they probably did during the taping of this

1391
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,800
and they just couldn't put it in.

1392
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,520
That's digitally edited out.

1393
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,720
Yeah, they say like, they're really,

1394
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,600
all she does is come in and very gently ask like,

1395
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,880
hey, you guys gotta go maintain the schedule

1396
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,080
that I set up for you.

1397
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,080
And they're like, ugh.

1398
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,920
Yeah, fuck you.

1399
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,320
Yeah, she's always like this.

1400
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,480
Yeah, they do say that, she's always like this.

1401
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,960
You all know how Ileana Douglas can be.

1402
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,840
She's incredibly apologetic.

1403
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,240
She's very polite.

1404
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,160
And then is very nice, helps all the fans.

1405
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,280
Immediately, yeah, come on, what are we gonna do?

1406
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,760
We gotta give them a, like,

1407
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,640
we should give these people backstage passes.

1408
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,480
She does.

1409
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,320
Yeah.

1410
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,240
Immediately, she's a very kind character.

1411
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,280
Gets a super stretch limo, gets a super fast car.

1412
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,120
Yeah.

1413
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,960
Super stretch limo.

1414
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,360
For everybody in that waiting room.

1415
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,440
For everyone in the waiting room.

1416
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,600
Here's a issue I have with this.

1417
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Concerts typically don't start until the band is there.

1418
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,280
And bands of this caliber kind of don't give a shit

1419
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,720
if they're running late, right?

1420
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,520
Well, you know, it depends.

1421
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,280
It depends, Jason, what venue we're talking.

1422
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,200
Because there are curfews at certain places

1423
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,440
and you do get a large fine.

1424
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,840
Oh, I guess you're right.

1425
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,000
If you're playing past, say, 11 o'clock

1426
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,040
at the Hollywood Bowl. I guess you're right.

1427
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,680
Or 10.30 maybe on a weeknight.

1428
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,120
So if you're close enough to residential areas.

1429
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,560
Right, so you know, Mr. Steven Tyler,

1430
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,400
even though he doesn't wanna play by the rules,

1431
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,160
still doesn't wanna pay a large fine

1432
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,720
at some sort of an outdoor venue,

1433
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,480
depending on where we are actually

1434
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,600
in the narrative of this ride,

1435
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,720
which I hope they explain. Well, look, there's rules

1436
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,480
and then there's city ordinances

1437
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,960
that are in place for the good of our communities

1438
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,040
and fellow citizens and we need to be good neighbors.

1439
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,200
Right, and no one appreciates city ordinances

1440
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,000
more than Jason Sheridan. Oh, I love it.

1441
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,040
I love those ordinances.

1442
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,800
You go to the Burbank Town Center

1443
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,760
to just discuss the ordinances

1444
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,280
with the different council members every weekend.

1445
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,000
Yeah, which is a mall.

1446
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,120
So I bother them at the mall.

1447
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:48,960
The town square. When they're trying

1448
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,960
to spend time with their families.

1449
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,080
Well, as an aspiring mayor yourself.

1450
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,320
That's true. Hashtag.

1451
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,560
It is true. What was it?

1452
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,440
Jason for DLR. Of course.

1453
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,360
Yes. I believe.

1454
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,960
Keep using it in addition to the many others

1455
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,800
that we've thrown your way.

1456
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,200
The thing with our hashtags is they're great

1457
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,040
because they're cumbersome.

1458
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,360
Yes, that is what this great path looks like.

1459
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,520
Well, we know no one has used them before.

1460
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,160
So that's a good thing. That's true.

1461
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,880
Yeah. Yeah, we're still flying blind

1462
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,080
on if these have been used at all.

1463
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,440
We do know where the concert takes place.

1464
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,400
It is at the Forum.

1465
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,600
They name check the Forum.

1466
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,840
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1467
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,000
Which is a great venue in Los Angeles

1468
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,680
that has now been converted to only be for concerts.

1469
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,800
It used to be sort of a shared space with sports,

1470
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,200
but there's no teams there now.

1471
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,360
So we know where they're playing.

1472
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,200
We know where they're going.

1473
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,040
And you know what?

1474
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,080
It takes a lot of freeway driving to get there.

1475
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,520
Those wild LA freeways.

1476
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,240
And that's what you have to navigate on this ride.

1477
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,040
Well, wait, where was the...

1478
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,560
Man, now do I want to know.

1479
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,800
I don't think I realized they were going to the Forum.

1480
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,000
But now I want to know where the recording studio was.

1481
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,720
Across town, Santa Monica.

1482
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,560
Yeah.

1483
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,400
I don't know.

1484
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,360
Sound City in the valley.

1485
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,280
It's Sound City.

1486
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,120
It's the girls' sound city.

1487
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,040
That makes the most sense to take freeway.

1488
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,080
I guess if you hop on the 10.

1489
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,680
Well, they go on the five.

1490
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,840
I think there's a five sign on the ride.

1491
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,680
All right.

1492
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,200
Oh, maybe they were recording right here in Burbank.

1493
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,040
That's possible.

1494
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,880
One of those quiet,

1495
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,440
one of those little unmarked recordings.

1496
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,280
Sure.

1497
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,000
Tons of little studios and sound stages,

1498
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,120
purposefully non-descript in the valley

1499
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,800
so that people don't come hunting around

1500
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,920
for stars and celebs.

1501
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,480
Trying to get limo passes and what have you.

1502
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,880
Yeah, trying to get limo passes,

1503
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,720
or in some case,

1504
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,240
like accidentally stumbling onto porno sets.

1505
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,440
That's probably another.

1506
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,640
That's a different kind of unmarked for a reason.

1507
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,480
More accurate.

1508
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,320
So there's an alternate story in France.

1509
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,160
Yeah.

1510
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,800
Scott, you told me not to read about the France squad.

1511
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,640
Because you wanted to share some of the France stuff.

1512
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,520
Look, I didn't want to be strict about this,

1513
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,640
but just because it was a surprise to me

1514
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,480
when I found out about it,

1515
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,120
when I went to Walt Disney Studios Paris,

1516
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,800
the worst Disney theme park by Leaves and Bands,

1517
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,080
I did not go on this ride in continuing with my,

1518
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:09,920
if you're surprised.

1519
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,360
But you've never been on the Rock and Roll Culture.

1520
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,200
I have not been on it.

1521
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,320
Oh my goodness.

1522
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1523
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,960
But hey, look, we aren't talking about

1524
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,560
Gs and inversions and whatever.

1525
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,840
We're talking about the plot.

1526
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,600
And I can consume the plot via YouTube videos

1527
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,320
just as well as anybody.

1528
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,160
Anyway, I waited while my wife did it.

1529
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:33,160
And I probably went to some other nonsense to the show

1530
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,280
where Martin Short takes you through the history

1531
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,920
of silent film and deals with a wizard

1532
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,800
played by Alan Cumming.

1533
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,040
I was doing some other nonsense.

1534
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,200
If I may ask though,

1535
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,960
because the difference between this and Space Mountain

1536
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,640
is probably just it goes faster.

1537
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,480
Is that why you don't wanna go on it?

1538
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,640
It's the quick launch.

1539
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,120
I have a problem with these quick launches.

1540
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,280
I should get over this.

1541
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,600
What this would open up to me

1542
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,320
if I were willing to do these things.

1543
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,440
Well, I mean, the logistics of this,

1544
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,000
well, sorry, sorry.

1545
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,400
What is the plot in France?

1546
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,760
I wanna know from either of you.

1547
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,760
Okay, so because Erin went on it,

1548
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,280
I asked her out was she was like, fine.

1549
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,760
And I said, yeah, was it that weird thing

1550
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,840
where you're like, we're late for the concert.

1551
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,480
We gotta get you there and Ken Marino's there.

1552
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,200
And can we get backstage passes for everybody?

1553
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,160
And she was like, no.

1554
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,680
I said, no, what do you mean?

1555
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,720
Were you just not, was the show down?

1556
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,440
No, no, no, it's still them.

1557
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,280
They're there, there's a recording guy there.

1558
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,480
But instead they tell you that, okay,

1559
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,440
you're still, it's a different record company.

1560
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,040
It's not G-Force Records, it's Tour de Force Records.

1561
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,360
And you're there in a recording studio, mind you,

1562
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,360
to experience a new music and ride experience

1563
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,080
that Aerosmith has crafted for you.

1564
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,480
And it's still Ken Marino, still a recording booth,

1565
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,240
but they have like a model of a roller coaster.

1566
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,320
And they're putting, well, at first it's all of the members

1567
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,080
besides Steven Tyler.

1568
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,240
And they're kind of murmuring about where's Steven?

1569
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,680
Oh, he's on a ride.

1570
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,280
And then Steven comes in, all hot and bothered,

1571
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,920
excited because he was, how many Gs he was experiencing.

1572
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,800
There's a part, then he said.

1573
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,240
He can't do heroin anymore,

1574
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,080
and this is the only way he can get Gs.

1575
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,160
This is the only high he has available.

1576
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,720
He's describing very eloquently the specific feelings.

1577
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,040
I was feeling two Gs, three Gs, four Gs.

1578
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,120
And then suddenly it felt like I was,

1579
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,640
and he cues the sound, going down.

1580
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,360
From loving an elevator.

1581
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,200
Sacrebleu.

1582
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,920
Works great with the French.

1583
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,160
He says going down, and then Ken Marino is like, ah, I see,

1584
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,520
and writes that down as a note.

1585
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,920
I don't know what he was meant to take from that.

1586
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,280
So Ken Marino gets to do more,

1587
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,240
he gets more business to do in the French version?

1588
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,800
He writes a note on a clipboard,

1589
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,480
if that counts as more business.

1590
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,440
But otherwise, still no dialogue, still doesn't talk.

1591
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,640
On the Nerdist, he said he had lines

1592
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,200
that they recorded for the European one,

1593
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,840
and he didn't know if they were there.

1594
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,680
But he did not, they didn't make it.

1595
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,360
These were shot on the same day?

1596
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,400
Presumably, because it's the same super bright lighting,

1597
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,240
everybody's in the same clothes.

1598
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,360
So for some reason, they felt,

1599
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,640
and the other one, the Paris one,

1600
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,440
didn't open until like five years later,

1601
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,040
but they thought ahead, the plot needs to be different,

1602
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,360
and the plot needs to be, instead of,

1603
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,520
you're late for a concert, the plot is,

1604
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,280
Aerosmith built a new ride for you,

1605
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,440
are you ready to go on it?

1606
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,240
And which is, so that's, as far as you know,

1607
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,600
when you're watching the video, that's what the plot is.

1608
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,560
But then, I've seen other things saying

1609
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,040
that the plot of the ride is

1610
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,800
that you're in an Aerosmith music video.

1611
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,520
And that's, so in your experience,

1612
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,440
you're going through loops and concert lighting,

1613
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,040
and that's you being in a music video.

1614
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,200
And still, another source I saw said

1615
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,160
that the point of the France one is that you,

1616
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,480
your car, is a note.

1617
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,080
You're a musical note.

1618
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,720
And you're going through all of the vibrations

1619
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,800
and twists and turns that a Joe Perry guitar note

1620
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,720
goes through when traveling through the acoustics

1621
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,840
of an amphitheater.

1622
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,560
So the point is, nobody knows what the plot of this ride is.

1623
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,920
That is the sort of whimsy I would expect

1624
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,880
from a country where Jerry Lewis is a national hero.

1625
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,360
Mm-hmm, yes.

1626
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,120
The kind of creativity.

1627
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,280
In fact, there's like,

1628
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,760
I'll just read from the Disney Paris website.

1629
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,440
Get ready to rock out in an Aerosmith music video.

1630
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,160
The bad boys from Boston are working with engineers

1631
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,520
on a revolutionary new sound.

1632
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,120
And they want you to be center,

1633
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,120
spelled the European way, stage.

1634
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,320
So jump into a soundtracker with onboard speakers

1635
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,520
and turn the amp to the max.

1636
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,440
Every electrifying riff is met with more G-force

1637
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,400
than an astronaut experience, not pluralized.

1638
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,560
Maybe proofread your site, Disney Paris.

1639
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,160
Blasting you through lightning rigs.

1640
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,000
What?

1641
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,320
What's a lightning rig? Lightning rigs.

1642
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,440
It's everything you'd expect from the amped up,

1643
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,960
neon lit, smoke-filled excess of a rock and roll lifestyle.

1644
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,800
Wow.

1645
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,640
Famously.

1646
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,000
Should that be lighting rigs?

1647
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,840
I think so.

1648
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,920
Well, it's a play on that.

1649
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,640
It's like they have a new version of a lighting rig

1650
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,840
called lightning rig.

1651
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,680
Okay.

1652
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,120
I've given them a lot, unless it is.

1653
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,160
It's possible it's just an error.

1654
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,040
Possibly just a misspelling.

1655
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,560
So, and that's another thing that in the Paris,

1656
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,840
I'm sorry, in the Orlando one, you get on a limousine.

1657
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,480
In the Paris one, you get on a soundtracker,

1658
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,760
which looks like a limousine.

1659
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,760
Except the front of the car has a CD embedded in it.

1660
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,920
Oh boy.

1661
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,120
And there's also a giant CD outside, right?

1662
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,560
There's a giant CD outside.

1663
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,920
That's another thing I'd like to say

1664
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,560
comparing the two versions.

1665
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:54,520
That courtyard in Orlando is kind of nice.

1666
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,480
Big classic guitar with a roller coaster track

1667
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,560
coming out of the neck.

1668
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,160
It looks like it was always supposed to be.

1669
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,200
It fits right in with the better end of the architecture

1670
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,640
of Disney MGM Studios.

1671
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,320
Such a nice area that a Britney Spears concert

1672
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,280
for the Disney Channel was held there.

1673
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,760
I have very fond feelings about this giant guitar courtyard.

1674
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,760
However, the Paris one is like the worst graphic design

1675
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,800
you've ever seen.

1676
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,360
I consider this an international crime.

1677
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,680
If we, just to bring it up for you guys,

1678
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,680
really doubling down on the CDs, there's CDs everywhere.

1679
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,160
These are never going away.

1680
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this'll be the tech.

1681
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,840
Well, how would you, what would you do now?

1682
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,280
Would it be, songs are invisible now.

1683
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,120
They're on a cloud.

1684
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,120
Just ones and zeros.

1685
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,560
No way to represent.

1686
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,880
So, and then like, it's a font.

1687
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,360
Like, this logo.

1688
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,800
It's very busy.

1689
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,480
It's the busiest thing you're,

1690
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,200
it's a leopard print guitar.

1691
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,880
There's roller coaster tracks exploding out of it.

1692
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,160
The font is on fire.

1693
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,120
It's a truly hideous.

1694
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,480
It's very, it's green, but there's so many colors

1695
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,680
and they kind of go together, but they kind of don't.

1696
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,840
It's very strange.

1697
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,120
There are like 25 colors all fighting each other.

1698
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,120
Not covering the sound stage that it's in.

1699
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,160
Like you can see the corner of the sound stage

1700
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,000
in this picture.

1701
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,320
Yes, and this is the thing with Disney Studios Paris

1702
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,360
is it's all just cheap metal buildings.

1703
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,160
And there's this corner of the park that is,

1704
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,440
it really is just Aerosmith Alley

1705
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,520
and they should call it that.

1706
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,680
I wish they called it that.

1707
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:35,160
You know, you're getting yourself into, but there's-

1708
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,280
Steven Tyler's parents were gunned down

1709
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,840
in front of him after-

1710
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,040
That's the origin of Aerosmith.

1711
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,880
That's the origin of Aerosmith.

1712
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,640
I must fight back with rock.

1713
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,480
I must fight my feelings by rocking it.

1714
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,840
We were leaving a Robert Johnson concert and-

1715
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,400
With the strains still echoing.

1716
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,240
Yeah.

1717
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,800
Bullets were added to the soundtrack.

1718
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,240
So the Rock and Roller Coaster is next

1719
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,320
in a very cheap building,

1720
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,000
is next to another very cheap building

1721
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,040
with this unpleasant Armageddon experience.

1722
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,480
It's like, and not-

1723
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,040
Which really is perfect.

1724
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:07,880
Yeah.

1725
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,700
Because Armageddon,

1726
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:09,540
don't want to miss a thing.

1727
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,380
But I don't want to miss a thing.

1728
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,040
The song is playing outside of that building.

1729
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:12,880
Wow, that's crazy.

1730
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,520
So Aerosmith just owns a couple acres in France.

1731
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,360
That's crazy.

1732
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,960
Outside of Paris.

1733
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,560
But this, you just, you get a headache

1734
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,280
from every component of this area of Disney Studios Paris.

1735
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,920
Like the songs, I will say, I think are unpleasant.

1736
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,760
The graphics are unpleasant.

1737
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,080
It's all like the buildings are nothing to look at.

1738
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,520
You're lucky if they slapped a poster up there.

1739
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,520
This is a, I want them to firebomb this zone.

1740
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,400
This is an atrocious area of a Disney theme park.

1741
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,280
That's too bad.

1742
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,880
I will, I'll say this about the France version.

1743
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,600
They played Jaded on the ride.

1744
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,040
Ah, and not here?

1745
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,280
And not in Florida.

1746
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,120
Wow.

1747
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,840
Jaded is nowhere to be found in Florida.

1748
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,540
Maybe outside, it might be played outside in that area,

1749
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,800
but on the actual ride or inside the ride,

1750
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,260
Jaded is not played, which of course we've both determined

1751
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,100
is the best Aerosmith song.

1752
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:09,460
Is the best Aerosmith song, let there be no debate.

1753
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,320
Although maybe, I think you gotta give some points

1754
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,240
to the customized version of Love in an Elevator.

1755
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,360
Love in a Rollercoaster.

1756
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,200
Right.

1757
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,020
Great.

1758
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:19,860
Live in an up while I'm going down.

1759
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:20,800
Pretty cool.

1760
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,400
Maybe that's later is like,

1761
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,960
if my parents are listening, which they are,

1762
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,440
just stop listening, it's just something like having

1763
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,160
bone in an elevator.

1764
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,080
And so I guess, but that's crazy that they just changed it

1765
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,220
to Rollercoaster, because that's sort of what.

1766
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,060
Still the same thing.

1767
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,160
Still the same thing.

1768
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,000
Yes.

1769
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,400
It's like getting it on in a Rollercoaster.

1770
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,240
And the fun.

1771
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,440
Just more dangerous.

1772
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,640
The fun of sex that has to be over in 15 seconds.

1773
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,720
Yeah, the ride is like a minute 15.

1774
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,240
The ride is so short.

1775
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,080
Yeah.

1776
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,920
Like sex.

1777
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,440
Like sex.

1778
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,560
Always is for three podcast hosts.

1779
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,240
I have to say, this ride,

1780
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:04,280
I do have like, I have more associations with this ride

1781
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,960
and Aerosmith than I do with Aerosmith alone.

1782
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,640
Cause I remember going on this ride,

1783
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,640
probably it probably would have been that opening summer.

1784
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,840
I was probably there.

1785
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,240
I remember seeing it on the information channel

1786
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,880
and seeing it on the map and like going into the courtyard

1787
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,640
and liking the courtyard.

1788
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,240
And I, my very specific memory of it is asking

1789
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,480
multiple cast members, does this ride go upside down?

1790
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,420
Because I didn't like, I hadn't really done looping coasters

1791
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,840
besides maybe one at like a little seaside park

1792
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,880
in New Jersey.

1793
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,520
And for whatever reason, I could not get a cast member

1794
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,520
to give me a straight answer.

1795
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,400
And so we're like, I guess we'll just try it.

1796
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,000
And there's a very unpleasant outside cue.

1797
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,480
That's just like a few TV screens.

1798
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,080
Yes, it is not dressed up at all.

1799
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,520
It's not really dressed up.

1800
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,920
Playing music videos, what's on the screen?

1801
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,280
Yeah, they're playing music videos.

1802
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,600
And you hear the Aerosmith songs and stuff.

1803
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,760
There's some songs.

1804
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,360
And then when you get inside

1805
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,120
and then you go through the little pre-show area

1806
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,880
and then you come out of that.

1807
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,200
And I kind of like the cue out of that

1808
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,720
that looks like the alleyway behind the recording studio

1809
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,600
with the chain leg fences and stuff.

1810
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,120
But then as soon as you come out of it,

1811
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,600
you see people sitting in the cars

1812
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,960
and the cars fucking launch.

1813
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,960
And I was like, not only will no one tell me

1814
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,160
if this goes upside down,

1815
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,680
I've never seen a roller coaster do that before.

1816
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,920
Because this would have been the same summer

1817
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,160
Islands of Adventure opened.

1818
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,880
So before this and the Hulk,

1819
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,960
I didn't even know about the concept of launch masters.

1820
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,960
And then my dad and I got in and yeah,

1821
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,080
that launch is still to this day.

1822
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,680
And I've ridden a number of them,

1823
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,840
still a very unnerving feeling.

1824
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,960
Sure, I'm not willing to have.

1825
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,520
I love it.

1826
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,360
I love it too.

1827
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,200
I love a launch.

1828
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,920
I don't know, I've said this before.

1829
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,520
It gets the whole thing over with.

1830
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,880
My whole thing with roller coasters

1831
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
is I don't like that slow up.

1832
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,160
I don't like the dangling.

1833
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,760
I don't like feeling like you're gonna fall.

1834
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,200
I like momentum on it.

1835
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,720
So this is similar to what you're saying.

1836
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,480
I was very scared when I went for the first time.

1837
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,240
And I remember my mom asked the question you're asking

1838
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,400
to a lot of employees of like, does it go upside down?

1839
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,400
She was like, I mean, I think she was like late 30s,

1840
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,240
40 at that point.

1841
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,360
And she was like worried and they're like,

1842
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,560
you'll be fine, don't worry.

1843
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,240
Yeah, and now I feel like if you ask a cast member that,

1844
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,960
immediately they'll tell you, yes, yes it does.

1845
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

1846
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,640
Once or twice.

1847
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,480
Yeah, and it's.

1848
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,320
Once or twice?

1849
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,160
I don't know.

1850
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,000
I hadn't been upside down

1851
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,360
because the only thing I'd ever been on

1852
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,560
that was anything close to being a roller coaster

1853
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,960
was Space Mountain.

1854
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,800
And Space Mountain is still pretty tame.

1855
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,760
I mean, it was the one in Florida

1856
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,040
I had not been to the one out here.

1857
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,560
There's no strong element to it that is like,

1858
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,520
there's not one thing in it that's more scary than.

1859
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,360
Yeah, I find.

1860
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,720
Just generally it being a roller coaster.

1861
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,200
Yeah, I find Space Mountain in Florida now a little scary

1862
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,520
because of how rickety it is.

1863
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,360
Fall apart.

1864
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,720
Yeah, they gotta fix that track.

1865
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,400
Yeah, yeah, but I, yeah.

1866
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,440
So I went, I think it's probably opening summer

1867
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,280
and I hadn't been yet.

1868
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,040
So Tower of Terror is there.

1869
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,720
And so I went on Tower of Terror and Rock and Roller Coaster

1870
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,240
for the first time on this one trip on this one day.

1871
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,920
And if you were to have stopped me at the end of the park,

1872
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,680
at the end of the day and say,

1873
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,800
how do you feel about Rock and Roller Coaster?

1874
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,360
And Tower of Terror, I would have said,

1875
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,600
they are both the same level of great.

1876
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,560
I was so happy with both these.

1877
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,400
I may have even said Rock and Roller Coaster

1878
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
was better at the time.

1879
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,440
Which in hindsight is crazy.

1880
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,480
It was and it is cool that like launch

1881
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,000
because the launch kind of varies.

1882
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,280
I mean, reading about the ride each, I don't know,

1883
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,200
we don't have to say all of the,

1884
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,280
there are five cars and the six in rotation

1885
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,680
that can play any of them.

1886
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,680
And each car plays a different song or set of songs.

1887
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,320
And the launch is different for each one too.

1888
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,000
Sometimes it counts down to five, four, three, two

1889
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,840
and then launches you.

1890
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,680
It tricks you.

1891
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,720
And Steven Tyler is counting sometimes

1892
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,360
and then he leaves one out.

1893
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,320
Yeah, and sometimes he says one though.

1894
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,560
His Rock and Roll mischievous tomfoolery.

1895
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,400
I see.

1896
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,720
Yeah, but it is fun.

1897
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,320
Like I do like, I know what you mean.

1898
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,960
The first time I wrote it, I thought it was great.

1899
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,080
And I still like it.

1900
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,160
I mean, it's gone in the last few years.

1901
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,440
And it's like, yeah, this is great.

1902
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,600
I am not saying I still feel that it's the same goodness

1903
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,920
as Tower of Terror, but at the time.

1904
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,760
No.

1905
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,240
And also like I did, it is something

1906
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,080
where I felt like alive.

1907
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:15,920
Like I could.

1908
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,760
Oh, absolutely.

1909
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,240
I was like, oh, I'll survive on a roller coaster.

1910
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,120
I'll be okay.

1911
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,200
This is very fun.

1912
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,200
It's a landmark day for you.

1913
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,720
A day I haven't had.

1914
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,680
Yes, I know.

1915
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,880
We would be honored to be with you on your first launch.

1916
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,720
Well, look.

1917
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:30,560
There's negotiations.

1918
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,560
Scott, you have one of those famous grapefruit flavored

1919
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,280
drinks at the Brown Derby and a slice of their famous grapefruit

1920
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:37,800
cake.

1921
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,520
And then we'll take you down to the hospital.

1922
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,320
The Incredicoaster might be the place to start.

1923
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,160
I would do the Incredicoaster.

1924
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,240
Yeah, you guys see that.

1925
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,760
Dynamo animatronic.

1926
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,000
Yes.

1927
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:56,480
To see with the temptation of a big doll or whatever is in there,

1928
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:57,480
I'll brave it.

1929
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,360
To see that big doll.

1930
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,800
I got to say, yeah.

1931
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,840
So as a kid, I was this end of the park.

1932
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,600
I was like, wow, two big attractions down there.

1933
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:13,040
And now, now looking at the current state of Hollywood Studios,

1934
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,720
this end of the park is doing some heavy lifting.

1935
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,400
This end of the park is carrying this park.

1936
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,600
So much is closed.

1937
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,240
So much is under construction.

1938
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,680
Only end of the park.

1939
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,440
See, I mean, I keep forgetting the great movie ride is closed.

1940
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,160
I'm like, well, there's nothing there.

1941
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,160
If the great movie ride was still open,

1942
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,240
I would say that this would probably still

1943
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,840
be one of my family's favorite parks to hit on.

1944
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,000
Even though there's three rides.

1945
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,240
I guess there's the Indiana Jones stunt show and Fantasmic.

1946
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,680
Indiana Stunt Show, Star Tours, Fantasmic is I like because it's

1947
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:52,240
insane, and the great movie ride, and then this in Tower of Terror.

1948
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,840
And then my family also really likes Mama Melrose.

1949
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,520
There's a Woodfired Italian, Woodfire Pizza Italian restaurant.

1950
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,600
I feel like most people are like, oh, we like the sci-fi dining,

1951
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,120
or we like the moms, the 50s.

1952
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:04,840
The gimmick places.

1953
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,880
Right, the gimmick places.

1954
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,000
But then there's an actual decent restaurant in there, too.

1955
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:09,880
I remember that being OK.

1956
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,680
Oddly enough, I've never eaten at the Brown Derby.

1957
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,560
Oh, we ate once.

1958
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,480
That was pretty good.

1959
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,280
I did as a kid.

1960
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1961
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,480
Not bad.

1962
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,720
So there's still a lot I like in this park.

1963
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,560
But you know what?

1964
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:27,080
We will get tweets or requests for general Disney World travel advice.

1965
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:30,200
And I'd have to say for the next six months or so,

1966
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,400
the advice would be skip Hollywood Studios.

1967
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,120
Do a four hour.

1968
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,360
Do get Rock and Roller Coaster hit tower.

1969
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,640
At the very least, hit tower.

1970
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,720
But people who are, if you're trying to save a couple bucks,

1971
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,200
let's be conscious of people's pockets.

1972
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,040
Well, but you've got to get the Mark Hopper option.

1973
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,600
You know?

1974
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,280
I mean, you do it in park hopping anyway.

1975
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,160
I say you do those.

1976
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:54,280
You do a lunch at Mama Melrose, hit up Star Tours and then another lunch

1977
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,400
at Mama Melrose.

1978
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,480
Yeah, then another lunch at Mama Melrose.

1979
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,080
And I mean, I love that Indiana Jones stunt show, too.

1980
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:01,960
I'm wrong.

1981
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,840
Well, I don't know.

1982
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,160
My advice is pretty similar.

1983
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,040
I think we just like this park a lot.

1984
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,760
All I'm saying is Tower of Terror is worth it, especially now

1985
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,240
that we don't have any version of it.

1986
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,680
I mean, we have a version of it, but not a version, the Twilight Zone version.

1987
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,520
This is certainly true.

1988
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:21,360
But I'm presenting the world in which people do not go to Disney World for nine days.

1989
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,120
That's true.

1990
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,200
You aren't doing the indulgence.

1991
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,120
I don't understand that.

1992
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,320
There are those people.

1993
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,920
I don't know why they're listening to this, but there are those people.

1994
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,920
You can take a boat from Hollywood Studios to Epcot.

1995
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,640
It's a quick thing.

1996
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,920
So say you're doing a full Epcot day.

1997
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,000
You go at 8 o'clock in the morning or 9 o'clock in the morning.

1998
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You do an hour.

1999
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,560
You do Rock and Rollercoaster Tower.

2000
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,800
You take the boat to Epcot.

2001
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,480
That's not much of out of the day.

2002
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,200
I don't want to nitpick, but I don't know that you're right.

2003
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:45,960
Is that a boat?

2004
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,360
I don't. Well, there's a boat, but I think you have to go to one of the hotels and then go to Epcot.

2005
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,040
You can walk from here to Epcot.

2006
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,400
This is the bigger thing.

2007
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,080
Will we ever trust Mike again?

2008
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,640
I don't know that there's a direct friendship boat from Hollywood Studios to Epcot, Michael.

2009
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,800
I'm looking this up now.

2010
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,480
Now I'm really upset.

2011
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,680
Will our relationship ever match?

2012
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,520
You know what I say?

2013
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,480
Skip this park.

2014
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,200
Just put on your headphones, download the song Jaded, get in a revolving chair and spin around.

2015
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,040
And then that's like you were on the ride.

2016
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:16,920
The end.

2017
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:22,600
And I don't know, ask the hotel you're in to cut the elevator cord or an emergency level.

2018
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,240
I think this park is going to look pretty neat when you take the Skyliner into it.

2019
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,520
Oh, there's going to be a big...

2020
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:36,360
Now, if you're listening to this in 2019, post Galaxy's Edge, now it's a crown jewel of a park, I would have to hope.

2021
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,000
I could care less about Galaxy's Edge.

2022
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,480
I'm just excited for a new mode of transit to get around Disney World.

2023
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,120
This is a sort of a gondola thing.

2024
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:49,080
You have to like stop at one of the hotels and then you go to Hollywood Studios.

2025
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,240
Like that's that crazy from the thing that I said.

2026
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,600
No, but great hotel.

2027
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,240
That boat, you can go to the boardwalk, beach or yacht club, swan or dolphin.

2028
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,120
A lot of fun stuff.

2029
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:05,000
Again, also you can walk between this park and Epcot, which is a little bit of a hike, but it's a beautiful walk.

2030
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,600
That is the thing.

2031
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:15,560
My genuine advice is at some point in your Disney World travels, take a day to just wander around hotel lobbies and stuff.

2032
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:21,800
Oh, I mean, yeah, if you're into it for the theming, the hotels are a treat.

2033
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:27,400
Yeah, if you go for that fast roller coaster bullshit, then fine.

2034
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:35,200
But if you want themes, if you want accurate Cape Cod architecture, then do it Scott's way.

2035
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:42,000
If you want to see what carpeting would have been put into a hotel in 1997, go and see all of the Disney World hotels.

2036
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,760
A strike against this, according to some people, I don't know that I completely agree, but it's the Rock and Roller Coaster is what they call an off the shelf coaster.

2037
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,520
It is not a Disney specific design by Imagineering.

2038
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,000
They just basically look at a roller coaster catalog and they pointed and said, I want this.

2039
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,400
They designed everything that's around it.

2040
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:09,720
In the case of Orlando, they put up the five freeway sign and you probably go through like a Hollywood sign or something.

2041
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,920
I imagine you sure do.

2042
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,200
You absolutely do.

2043
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:12,720
Great.

2044
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,520
Good guess.

2045
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:21,600
But that's, of course, to simulate some sort of out of control drunk drive that Steven Tyler had while he drove a car through the Hollywood sign downhill.

2046
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,240
It's a real story for him.

2047
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:23,840
We shouldn't be.

2048
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,360
I get to the big boy and Burbank.

2049
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,880
I'm going over the hill.

2050
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:28,840
He went the other way.

2051
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,360
You're saying he's going up.

2052
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,840
He's driving up the hill and then he went the other.

2053
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,440
He went reverse and he's like, well, I'm going to go home.

2054
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,080
Time to go back the way I came.

2055
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,120
And at the end of the ride, you crash into Bibi Buell's house.

2056
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:46,200
Yeah, I'm here to see my daughter.

2057
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:51,240
And Elvis Costello is there with another gentleman caller.

2058
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:59,720
Can I can I point out also the you said that it's different experiences based on which limo you get in?

2059
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,080
Or sound caster in Paris.

2060
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:14,520
But you know, you can you know which song it's going to be off of the license plate numbers, which we're in rock and roll style have attitude.

2061
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,880
The license plate numbers include you go, babe.

2062
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,320
Bye bye.

2063
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:25,160
H8 hate traffic and too fast for you, which is correct.

2064
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,080
In my case, it is too fast for me.

2065
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,720
Thanks for letting me know. Right. Yeah.

2066
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,200
But so that's a fun that's a fun little Easter egg.

2067
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:37,960
I also hear there's a lot of hidden Mickey's on this ride, but I don't think I care.

2068
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,720
I think we haven't talked about this yet.

2069
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,720
Do you guys care about hidden Mickey's?

2070
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,200
We've got a lot of episodes and not talked about them.

2071
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:48,120
I think like if I can if I spot one, I'm like, oh, that's fun.

2072
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,960
That's about my extent.

2073
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,680
Yeah, I feel like a lot of them are lame.

2074
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,320
I feel like sometimes they're like cool.

2075
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,080
Like sometimes there's one.

2076
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,560
I think there's supposedly one in the queue for the Little Mermaid ride in Florida,

2077
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:07,080
where it's only when the sun it's in the rock work in the queue and the sun.

2078
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:13,000
When the sun hits a certain point in the sky in the day, it casts a shadow of a hidden Mickey.

2079
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,000
Yeah, that's cool. I like that.

2080
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,680
And the MGM studios is it has a giant.

2081
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:24,040
You're in a giant hidden Mickey with the mouth being the courtyard of the MGM of the great movie

2082
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:29,240
ride and then like the eyes are the lake and something else or the ears of the lake.

2083
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,840
And you ever seen this?

2084
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,560
If you go to Google Maps and look down on Hollywood Studios, it's the biggest hidden Mickey.

2085
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,720
My favorite part of the hidden Mickey the map.

2086
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:40,760
All right.

2087
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,160
Okay.

2088
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:44,040
No, it's a joke because it's just traditionally three circles.

2089
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,240
Uh huh.

2090
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,200
You don't really see about that.

2091
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:46,600
Okay.

2092
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:51,000
No, you have a you have some kind of giant fetish and you want to get swallowed by Mickey.

2093
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,680
Oh, I do want to get swallowed by Mickey.

2094
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,000
Just say you wanted to get eaten on alien encounter.

2095
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,720
You want to roll around in Mickey Mouse's mouth.

2096
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,240
Yeah, he can spit you out.

2097
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,440
It's up to him what happens.

2098
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:05,560
But I also I'd like to say I think a pretty good poll quote if we needed like a

2099
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,400
catchphrase that explains this podcast to people who haven't heard it.

2100
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,880
I think sometimes hidden Mickey's are cool.

2101
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:20,280
Because that conveys both that we think that but some time we're a little picky about our Mickey's.

2102
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,800
Sometimes it's lame.

2103
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,600
So yeah, let that be a defining quote forever.

2104
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,480
Two videos I watched this ride.

2105
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:32,280
One, like Space Mountain, there is footage of this ride with the lights on.

2106
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:37,320
And it is like Space Mountain terrifying, maybe even more so because of the like

2107
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,240
metal work on this is so like intense.

2108
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:46,920
The track is just very gruesome looking, just very like industrial

2109
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,120
steel.

2110
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,080
And then it's also just built in an unthemed soundstage.

2111
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,640
So there's just girders everywhere.

2112
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:58,280
It feels like you're like you've been Space Mountain with lights on or Rock and Roller

2113
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,120
Coaster with lights on feels like you're in like an industrial like a kill floor or something.

2114
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,800
Like it's a place you've been brought in to be slaughtered and cut into bits.

2115
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,120
You are like Charlie Chaplin falling into the machines in modern times.

2116
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,840
Scariest movie I've ever seen.

2117
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,360
Scariest movie.

2118
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:18,840
There was a one night Star Wars overlay of this attraction.

2119
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,480
Yes.

2120
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:25,160
Where you were I mean, they didn't take any of the black light signs down, but you were

2121
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:29,960
racing to get to the premiere of Star Wars The Force Awakens.

2122
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,640
That's how they justified it.

2123
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:36,680
That's the way I figured the way like it said premiere at the end.

2124
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,760
You're like, well, we got here to the premiere.

2125
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,840
And I'm like, oh, OK, I guess you're racing to.

2126
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,480
Yeah, that would that would start without you.

2127
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:49,480
You know, talking about overlays and musical overlays that were briefly around

2128
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:56,280
the success of having roller coasters sets to rock music kicked open the door to the

2129
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:03,480
Rockin Space Mountain and Rockin California Screamin that were open for a summer at

2130
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:08,920
Disneyland in which the two primary roller coasters at the Disneyland Resort were taken

2131
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,760
over by those rapscallions, the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

2132
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,920
And I got to experience both of these.

2133
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,200
This is my first summer at Disney.

2134
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:18,520
Really?

2135
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,920
Disneyland, the first time I had ever been to these parks.

2136
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:26,360
And I got to experience California Screamin and Space Mountain in the best possible way.

2137
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,000
Soundtracked by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band.

2138
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,880
I mean, how do we all feel about the Red Hot Chili Peppers?

2139
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,680
I think it's similar.

2140
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,240
It's one of those.

2141
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:33,960
Similar to Aerosmith.

2142
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:34,680
It's fine.

2143
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,400
They're spotty.

2144
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,600
They can be around.

2145
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,880
They don't bother me.

2146
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,240
Flea is a fantastic actor.

2147
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,840
No hits, never had an album.

2148
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:41,800
Back to the Future 2.

2149
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,640
I have had, I have a few of their albums.

2150
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:49,240
I do think that Aerosmith and Red Hot Chili Peppers are very similar in a lot of ways.

2151
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:53,960
In the way you're saying that, but they have a very like rap, rocky, they're very bawdy.

2152
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,040
There's like a lot of dirty stuff in it.

2153
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,840
I was very into Californication when it came out.

2154
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,720
The song.

2155
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,440
I like music video.

2156
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,200
Not having sex in California?

2157
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,320
What?

2158
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,360
The song you said.

2159
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,960
No, it's in the album.

2160
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,880
I'm very into California, Californication.

2161
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:08,360
The song.

2162
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,720
Well, isn't the album, isn't the album awesome?

2163
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,760
Also, I meant the song.

2164
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,560
I didn't have the album.

2165
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:16,920
But I like the song.

2166
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,160
I like the music video.

2167
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:19,960
I miss the joke.

2168
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,160
Whatever joke you were going for.

2169
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:25,320
And he was saying you're open to the act of Californication.

2170
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:25,720
Yeah.

2171
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,760
Having, doing sexual things in California.

2172
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,240
I'm just, I'm not going to lie.

2173
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:36,200
I didn't know about the, I didn't pick up on that word play until just now.

2174
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,000
Oh, really?

2175
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,920
You just thought it was like a process.

2176
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,440
Like being in a California machine.

2177
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,520
I honestly did think it's just like, yeah, these fuckers love California.

2178
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,440
I also too mostly think of that music video where it becomes a video game for a little bit.

2179
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,640
That he's like hopping through.

2180
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,360
Is that right?

2181
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,440
Is that Californication?

2182
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,000
Is that the video?

2183
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,560
I can't remember.

2184
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,440
There's a lot of, there's a lot of hits on that album.

2185
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,640
There's Other Side, there's Scar Tissue, there's Around the World.

2186
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,680
Danny California on that?

2187
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,720
No, Jason, please.

2188
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,360
I don't know.

2189
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,080
Danny California is on Stadium Arcadium.

2190
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,360
Oh, I mean.

2191
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,240
We do our research.

2192
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,120
No more three stars.

2193
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,760
But I just, but you had not done your research about.

2194
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,880
I had not done.

2195
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,000
Fornication was.

2196
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:17,720
Oh man.

2197
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,440
Dirty stuff.

2198
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,400
It's all dirty stuff.

2199
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:25,080
I'm glad I punched up and reused that late bloomer joke for this episode because we really.

2200
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,760
We really illustrated it.

2201
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,400
I was so shocked that you were like, what are you talking about?

2202
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,760
And then it all comes out.

2203
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,840
We taught you a classic pun today.

2204
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,640
We learned something.

2205
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:38,520
Oh, that classic pun, Californication.

2206
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,800
It's a pun is what it is.

2207
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,120
It is.

2208
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:40,600
Yeah.

2209
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,400
California.

2210
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,440
It's like up there with the Mark Twain zingers from the American Adventure.

2211
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,680
Anthony Kiedis and Mark Twain.

2212
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,440
America's greatest words.

2213
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,000
Could you imagine that's what they're going to update it to.

2214
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,440
Oh, shaking hands.

2215
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,160
Shaking hands.

2216
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,680
Like at the end of American Adventure.

2217
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,880
Oh, I'm fine with that.

2218
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,120
Throw Benjamin Franklin off the torch.

2219
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,320
It's Kiedis, baby.

2220
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,080
Well, it looks like one of the.

2221
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:10,600
You know, talking about the body nature of rock bands, which is what we're doing.

2222
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,480
We should say the you know, this ride was just having a pleasant.

2223
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,720
It was just chugging along.

2224
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,560
The train kept a rolling, as Steven Tyler would say.

2225
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,040
But and with no without incident.

2226
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:29,240
But I guess after many years of murmuring, people noticed that Steven Tyler in this

2227
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:34,200
pre-show with Ileana Douglas and Ken Marino at one point peers out into the audience as

2228
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:39,640
if to see us, the guests and refer to us and say, but I love my fans.

2229
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,080
They have to come with me.

2230
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:46,280
And he makes a hand gesture in doing so known as the shocker.

2231
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,720
He holds that, which is he's holding up.

2232
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,480
I'm not even.

2233
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,640
Hey, somebody's going to have to explain to me how to make it.

2234
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:56,920
It's it's two fingers and then one is down and then one is up.

2235
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,880
There's I will not.

2236
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:58,680
Sexual innuendo.

2237
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:02,360
I will not say the thing that the kids in high school when they taught me this

2238
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:03,800
would say about it.

2239
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:04,680
You can look it up.

2240
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,080
It's a dirty equation.

2241
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,760
Yes, it's an equation.

2242
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,840
You know, the recipe for a shocker.

2243
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,520
It's cool and funny to do.

2244
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,720
It's cool and funny.

2245
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:14,920
But I hold on.

2246
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,800
It ages well, even though we have an explicit podcast.

2247
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,000
I won't be that explicit.

2248
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:20,760
We're not.

2249
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,840
Yeah, we haven't blooms that far yet.

2250
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,240
What's odd is that they left in Joe Perry doing that thing where you put your hand

2251
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,920
under your chin and you drag it.

2252
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,320
A let sort of like the Godfather.

2253
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:31,960
The Godfather.

2254
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,560
Fuck you like the Italian.

2255
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,360
Fuck you.

2256
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,840
Joe Perry does that like the entire time he's on screen.

2257
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,760
Yeah, they're fine with that.

2258
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,360
But yeah, they so yeah, they digitally took it out.

2259
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:45,160
They had in 2016 very recently.

2260
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,880
It's some Disney graphic designer.

2261
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:52,440
So like somebody was sent this footage and they had to digitally add a finger

2262
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,720
to Steven Tyler's hand to make it a regular palm up and not a gesture.

2263
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:58,220
Hello.

2264
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,880
Yeah, so it's just him trying to see it.

2265
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:02,280
Yes.

2266
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:07,640
In practicality, when filming it, it was probably blocking the very bright lights

2267
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:11,640
from his eyes while doing a lewd gesture.

2268
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,840
But yeah, Steven.

2269
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,680
So do you do you see what Steven Tyler wrote on Facebook after this went down?

2270
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:22,200
No, Steven Tyler on his Facebook in all caps wrote way to give me the finger.

2271
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,880
Now, Walt Disney World dot dot dot 17 years later.

2272
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,280
And then he just wrote the greatest ride at Disney.

2273
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:34,600
So is that footage of him getting off like walking, exiting the ride like years later

2274
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:40,200
and and him go and I feel like at one point he says like, just checking in on my ride.

2275
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:44,280
Like and then everyone with pictures, taking pictures, high fiving people.

2276
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,600
He I think he was real psyched about it.

2277
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,600
I think he's psyched about it because he went on.

2278
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,040
I think it was like a 68th birthday.

2279
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:50,680
He was down there.

2280
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,400
He went on it.

2281
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,720
I think he's happy to be on a ride.

2282
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,160
I don't think he thinks it's lame.

2283
01:29:55,160 --> 01:30:02,760
I swear to God, if I am 68 and I don't have a ride to check in on, just pulled me off

2284
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,280
whatever support.

2285
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:04,760
Yeah.

2286
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,320
Yeah.

2287
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:05,880
I will.

2288
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:06,840
I'll do something.

2289
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,480
I'll purposefully fall down the stairs and then plea.

2290
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:14,680
I'll tell you guys, my co-hosts, I'm giving you permission to pull me off the dialysis

2291
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,080
machine if I don't have a ride yet.

2292
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,440
What another name I have to write down giving me end of life.

2293
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,080
Well, you know, that person, I had to pull the plug.

2294
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:30,040
Will you be OK if we're just still performing in HALIX at Star Wars Galaxy's Edge?

2295
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,680
Oh, that counts.

2296
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,320
That's fine.

2297
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:31,820
Great.

2298
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,240
The opening ceremony, Aerosmith showed up.

2299
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,520
I believe they played.

2300
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:36,760
Yeah.

2301
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,000
And contest winners got to go and enjoy a buffet meal and drinks with them.

2302
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,120
And they were.

2303
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:42,600
That's true.

2304
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,000
I was going to mention the buffet if you were not going to mention it yourself.

2305
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,200
I'm glad you took note of it.

2306
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:53,560
But then you got to ride with one of you, you got a chance to ride with one of the members

2307
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,600
of the band in your car, which is a foolhardy thing to do after enjoying a buffet.

2308
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,320
I ate a bunch of macaroni pasta that looked like guitars.

2309
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:07,560
And then me and Brad Whitford, not the actor, the Aerosmith Brad Whitford,

2310
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:12,760
got to ride in HH traffic to the tune of Jaded.

2311
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,440
It was the greatest day of my life.

2312
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,400
It was if it was France.

2313
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,200
Oh, if it was Orlando.

2314
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:16,680
OK, OK.

2315
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,240
Yes.

2316
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,480
They also at the opening ceremony, they were joined by Denny Dent, the speed painter.

2317
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:22,600
Oh, yeah.

2318
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,800
Who speed painted.

2319
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,240
No need to say his credit.

2320
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,200
We all know Denny Dent.

2321
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:30,280
Speed painted the big pick, all five Aerosmith members.

2322
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:30,920
What?

2323
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:31,240
Really?

2324
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:31,480
Yeah.

2325
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,360
He's one of those guys who just throws paint at a camp or was.

2326
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,800
He has passed away, apparently.

2327
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:41,080
And then those canvases hang throughout like employee offices in Walt Disney World, apparently.

2328
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,200
Yeah, that is weird.

2329
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,720
Why didn't they just put them on the ride?

2330
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:44,920
Why did.

2331
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:45,400
Oh, good question.

2332
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:45,960
Is that you?

2333
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,080
Is that your father?

2334
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,440
No, it's Tom Hamilton.

2335
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,280
I'll share.

2336
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,480
Who did it?

2337
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,600
Denny Dent.

2338
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,720
They were all fighting for Steven Tyler or Joe Perry.

2339
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,560
Well, you know, that's in Iger's office.

2340
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,080
You know, the big dog got that one.

2341
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:00,440
Oh, yeah.

2342
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,080
He took that from Iger.

2343
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:04,040
They do famously call Bob Iger the big dog.

2344
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:04,600
Yeah, yeah.

2345
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,960
That's Disney lore you should know.

2346
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,040
He's like WWE star Roman Reigns.

2347
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:10,360
Bob Iger.

2348
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:13,880
Yeah, their explosions go off when he enters that building with the dwarfs on it.

2349
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:18,600
It's similar to how Pitbull is named Mr. Worldwide.

2350
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,480
That's his nickname.

2351
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,960
And I am also nicknamed Mr. Worldwide.

2352
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:23,160
That's true.

2353
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,880
Not Mr. Californication, though.

2354
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,520
We know that.

2355
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,640
No, clearly not.

2356
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:33,960
Interesting actual fact about this ride is apparently the second fastest ride in Walt Disney World.

2357
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,120
Test tracks supposedly goes faster.

2358
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:36,760
Really?

2359
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,920
And I can do that, but their launch doesn't go uphill.

2360
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:47,720
I guess that's where I don't want to leave my heart and lungs at the bottom of the ride.

2361
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:54,200
And then, you know, you don't want to go zero to 57 in two point eight seconds.

2362
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:54,920
I guess I don't.

2363
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:57,480
I guess I don't want to live the rock and roll lifestyle.

2364
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,800
That's what it's like at all times when you're.

2365
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,680
Yeah, that's true.

2366
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:02,360
Yeah.

2367
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,480
Well, I should do it.

2368
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,840
Hey, next time I'm there.

2369
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,560
I don't know.

2370
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,640
I mean, who knows how long it'll be there.

2371
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,280
Let's be honest.

2372
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,480
Yeah, the Paris one is being turned into a Marvel attraction.

2373
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:12,040
Iron Man.

2374
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:12,440
Oh, right.

2375
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:17,720
That's why we're talking about it to their farewell.

2376
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,120
And how do you say goodbye in French?

2377
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:20,680
There's been a.

2378
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:23,720
I didn't know that.

2379
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,720
You didn't know California Cation.

2380
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,200
I didn't know or even though I was in France.

2381
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,400
Two years of French.

2382
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,520
That's all you remember.

2383
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,600
I bet Iron Man will tell you to get in the.

2384
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,800
What are they called in France?

2385
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,200
Not sound snappers.

2386
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,520
What are they sound casters?

2387
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,480
Yes, soundcast.

2388
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,320
Quick, get into soundcaster.

2389
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,760
The Avengers need your help.

2390
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,600
I'm building a ride.

2391
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,800
The Avengers are building a ride and you have to go on it and test it out.

2392
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,040
OK, the G's are almost complete.

2393
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:55,320
OK, we're here at Stark Industry Studios.

2394
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,440
We're in Studio B.

2395
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:00,440
I'm cutting my new record and we're finishing a roller coaster demo.

2396
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:05,400
If the narrative is that Tony Stark is cutting a demo, that's great.

2397
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:08,680
It's not tied all together with producer Steven Tyler.

2398
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,960
He's sitting back there.

2399
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,680
He now has taken the Ken Marino seat.

2400
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:14,760
Sounds good, Tony.

2401
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:20,760
I would love it if there was a gag in one of the Marvel movies where one of them

2402
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,880
released like a novelty single like Disco Duck or the Super Bowl Shuffle.

2403
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:26,360
Sure.

2404
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:29,640
I guess I guess you would need to introduce Wonder Man for that.

2405
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,080
Like his characters.

2406
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:31,960
He was an actor.

2407
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:32,520
He was like that.

2408
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:32,920
That's good.

2409
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,000
I mean, the superhero and a musician.

2410
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,280
In Thor Ragnarok, there's a pretty good runner that Jeff Goldblum's character plays weird synth

2411
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,120
and like makes up songs.

2412
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:43,240
So maybe he's that.

2413
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,000
Maybe he's the what is his character's name?

2414
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,240
It's not the collector.

2415
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:48,520
The collector is Benicio.

2416
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,080
He's a.

2417
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,760
Oh, God, what is his name?

2418
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:57,800
Which, by the way, OK, in Los Angeles, you likely know that Jeff Goldblum does jazz piano shows.

2419
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,300
Yes.

2420
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:01,240
And so he's more than willing to.

2421
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,600
He'll always take a concert venue.

2422
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,480
Let's get him down in the Cantina as well.

2423
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:07,960
Oh, great.

2424
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,760
I'll give him in character in Thor character.

2425
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,520
It can't just be the jazz piano.

2426
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,800
It's got to be a synth component.

2427
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,000
You got to bring it into the future.

2428
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,120
But I think he'd love to do.

2429
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:19,400
I don't think that would be hard to book.

2430
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,760
I really don't.

2431
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:25,480
I think Jeff Goldblum would be thrilled to perform at Disneyland every once in a while with it.

2432
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,280
Does he have like, I don't know, space hair?

2433
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,280
Does he have like a blue goatee or some shit?

2434
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:30,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2435
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,120
And a big robe, a fun robe.

2436
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:32,440
Great.

2437
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,560
I guessed the wardrobe.

2438
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,000
So let's get him in character performing in that Cantina.

2439
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,960
But mainly Halix, only between Halix sets.

2440
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,160
Oh, the Grand Master.

2441
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,120
The Grand Master, of course.

2442
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:42,760
The Grand Master.

2443
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,160
He's great.

2444
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,280
I mean, he's great in that movie.

2445
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,360
That is a side note.

2446
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,080
That's like totally him.

2447
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:52,920
Like, I almost think that's the best use of just like him, his essence,

2448
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:58,280
like letting him just improvise and it's odd and off timed and they keep takes in it that are like

2449
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,640
no other movie would keep that take in of him just making a weird noise.

2450
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,680
Anyway, that's a side note.

2451
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:07,080
What do you think is the best use of Steven Tyler in a movie?

2452
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:07,640
In a movie.

2453
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:11,080
Is it, let's take the ride out of the running, although he's great in it.

2454
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,520
Because I don't know if you're aware of the full filmography,

2455
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,760
but he is in the film Be Cool, the sequel to Get Shorty.

2456
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,520
He is in Polar Express.

2457
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,280
He does a big musical number.

2458
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:27,560
He's like an elf, is an elf that is mocap amended to the features of Steven Tyler.

2459
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,560
And he's also, I swear to God, I can't remember the name of this movie,

2460
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,640
but it was on in a hotel room once and it's an animated movie where he's a big fat worm or

2461
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:35,960
something.

2462
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:42,200
And the only way you don't know who it is because his speaking voice is very generic.

2463
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:47,880
He's just kind of a, uh, just kind of a raspy voice dude and he acts very stiffly,

2464
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,400
but he's a mystical worm.

2465
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,880
And his name is Nimglu.

2466
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:57,080
And this is video I love where he like, he says, he like,

2467
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:02,040
I was, I always dreamed of being in an animated film and now my wish came true.

2468
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,000
I'm Nimglu.

2469
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,960
So I'm very fond of Nimglu, but I, of the film, I can't remember the name.

2470
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,080
It's Epic.

2471
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,120
The movie is called Epic.

2472
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:10,680
Oh wow.

2473
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:11,240
Yeah.

2474
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,600
I never would have got there.

2475
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,520
Why is him big worm movie called Epic?

2476
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,720
He's a caterpillar.

2477
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,220
Oh, okay.

2478
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:19,320
And it is, yeah.

2479
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,640
Oh God, that movie, I think I saw a little of that movie.

2480
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,120
Who made it?

2481
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:22,840
Was it Ice Age?

2482
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:23,800
Is it Dreamworks?

2483
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,520
No one knows who made, I already forgot the name.

2484
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:27,720
It's Nimglu the movie.

2485
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,200
It's called, I am Nimglu.

2486
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,000
I have not seen any of those things you've mentioned.

2487
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,840
I've never seen Be Cool.

2488
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,200
I've never seen Epic.

2489
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,560
Your head is better for it.

2490
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:41,080
If I'm giving the non-funny answer, I guess it's Wayne's World 2.

2491
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:41,960
Oh, right.

2492
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:42,600
Of course.

2493
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,720
He is good in a film.

2494
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,160
He is good in Wayne's World 2.

2495
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,280
They're great in Wayne's World 2.

2496
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,320
And that's a good song too.

2497
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,760
The song they play, Shut Up and Dance.

2498
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:51,240
Yeah, yeah.

2499
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:51,740
That's fun.

2500
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:52,840
Yeah.

2501
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:55,480
So, so an American Idol, he was good.

2502
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,080
He sure was.

2503
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,520
Now, he didn't factor into the American Idol experience.

2504
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,480
The very unpleasant Disney World attraction, did he?

2505
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,440
No, I don't think so.

2506
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,080
So there wasn't an Aerosmith Alley in Florida.

2507
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:11,160
Joe Perry also very upset at Steven Tyler that he did American Idol to sell out like that.

2508
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:11,720
Oh, really?

2509
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:11,960
Yeah.

2510
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,120
Pitbull is also in Epic.

2511
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:15,880
Oh, wow.

2512
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,680
How about that?

2513
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,360
Mr. Worldwide.

2514
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,240
There we go.

2515
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:23,880
There's also a great video of Pitbull playing beer pong with Jimmy Fallon outside of the

2516
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:26,760
Simpsons ride while all the characters cheer him on.

2517
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,720
Simpsons and Sideshow Bob included.

2518
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:35,000
They put their famous rivalry aside to cheer Pitbull and Fallon.

2519
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,080
Look, that's great intra-company marketing.

2520
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,600
That's great synergy for NBC Universal.

2521
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:48,760
That's great inter-intra network marketing between Fox and NBC.

2522
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:51,320
And it's just good fun for all of us fans.

2523
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,680
For everybody who loves beer pong.

2524
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,520
And Florida.

2525
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:58,600
There's rumors of what might replace this ride.

2526
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,440
Is it maybe going to be replaced in Orlando?

2527
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,960
Yes, there's been many different rumors over the years of different bands.

2528
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:09,320
There's also, I think most recently, a rumor that they're going to just put doors on it

2529
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,560
and it'll become a Monster Zink coaster.

2530
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:16,760
Monster Zink, I think, has been like the most rumored to have new rides that never pan out.

2531
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:20,360
There's going to be a whole Monster Zink door coaster that was going to replace

2532
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,440
the Monster Zink ride out here in California Adventure.

2533
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,960
But it's got to be much tamed.

2534
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,800
This is way too crazy.

2535
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,160
I don't think it does.

2536
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:27,880
I don't think it does.

2537
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:33,240
This is way too intense to make it a Monster Zink because then little kids are going to go on it.

2538
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:36,600
You do have to be of a certain height to ride this intense of a coaster.

2539
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:38,200
It's got to be a Twizzler.

2540
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,160
You got to be a Twizzler.

2541
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,280
You got to learn.

2542
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:41,480
These kids got to learn sometime.

2543
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:44,200
It's 48 inches to ride.

2544
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,200
So they're going to be, look, you're going to have to wait.

2545
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:49,000
48 inches to ride another Aerosmith album.

2546
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,120
Jesus.

2547
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,880
They're always sneaking stuff in.

2548
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:02,200
They could do, yeah, the big 10 inch and they could say like the big 48 inch.

2549
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,000
They could change that song around.

2550
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:09,080
And then there was also, and this is published on Screamscape,

2551
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:14,440
and a lot of people were goofing on it because it's probably not real, but supposedly one night

2552
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:20,520
they tested out the Powerline song eye to eye on the ride.

2553
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,480
Supposedly.

2554
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,520
For the public.

2555
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,040
The public was, oh yeah, I remember they.

2556
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,000
This was a rumor.

2557
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,680
People have said this is not true.

2558
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:31,000
This was just somebody lying to Screamscape, but as we know Screamscape, kind of a rag.

2559
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,640
And they'll publish anything.

2560
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:34,280
We love Screamscape.

2561
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:34,760
They don't give a shit.

2562
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:35,560
No, we love it.

2563
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,680
No, I'm going to stick hard to the mic stand.

2564
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:43,960
So that would be my, I guess we're getting ahead of ourselves of what we would do to it, but I like that idea.

2565
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,960
That doesn't make any sense.

2566
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,960
The song from, yeah, why exactly?

2567
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:52,440
I mean, it's sort of a concert vibe and you're talking about the song from a goofy movie,

2568
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:57,640
which culminates in this new Jack Swing concert with this particularly good song.

2569
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:01,640
Which we've, yeah, we've said is like the best Disney song of all time, maybe.

2570
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:07,000
Well, so we thought until Halix's Lightning, which I just played you,

2571
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,800
and you can see how Jailbait and the other one factor in.

2572
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:16,280
So Powerline's moving down the charts, but yeah, it's up there.

2573
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,160
Still up there.

2574
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:17,640
Top five.

2575
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,240
And obviously Hakuna Matata.

2576
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:20,120
Yeah.

2577
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:20,840
Number three.

2578
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:21,720
Can't mess with the classic.

2579
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:22,760
Number three with a bullet.

2580
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,440
Does I Don't Want to Miss a Thing count as a Disney song?

2581
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:27,240
No.

2582
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,120
Okay.

2583
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,960
But wait, didn't I determine it was it's Mickey's favorite song?

2584
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,440
But Mickey can like songs that aren't in the Disney family, right?

2585
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:38,200
He can, but he chooses not to.

2586
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:38,600
Fair enough.

2587
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:39,880
So why would you?

2588
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,920
So you want to put, you want to get that Powerline.

2589
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:43,640
I like that.

2590
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:46,920
I have other ideas too, but I mean, do we have anything else before we sort of?

2591
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:53,240
Yeah, I think they will redo it to a Mary Poppins coaster and Lin-Manuel Miranda will

2592
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,440
wrap along to new songs about Mary Poppins.

2593
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,360
That sounds hellish.

2594
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:10,920
I think I just, I want to keep what's there, but you know, let's capitalize on the talent

2595
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:15,880
involved now that we've, now that people are familiar with Ken Marino, let's give him some

2596
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,280
lines.

2597
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,160
Let's make it a route.

2598
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:22,200
What if there's a little more of a story and you're chasing this bumbling audio engineer

2599
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,480
around the freeways of Los Angeles.

2600
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,600
Are you trying to hit him?

2601
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,100
Yeah.

2602
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:33,180
Uh, you're trying, he, well, maybe he, uh, messed up the, like, uh, he, he mixed Joe

2603
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:36,940
Perry's guitar over Steven Tyler's vocals, right?

2604
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:39,820
Which is verboten in an Aerosmith record.

2605
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:43,900
And now you're trying to track him down and punish him and ram him with your soundcaster.

2606
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,100
He makes it out alive.

2607
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,060
I like Ken Marino.

2608
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:52,380
I don't want to hurt the guy, but he's got like a cartoon, like bandage and like a sling

2609
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:53,900
after the ride.

2610
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:54,140
Yeah.

2611
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:58,780
Yeah, he gets only as abused as, as goofy would, but yeah, but through the streets of

2612
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:06,220
Los, he like, uh, uh, yeah, he like tumbles out the hole of the Randy's donuts or, uh,

2613
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:09,660
uh, yeah, lots of LA themed, uh, uh, injuries.

2614
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:10,220
Yeah.

2615
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:12,300
I, I, I will say this.

2616
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,220
I think the France version might be better.

2617
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,180
I think the narrative is a little more interesting.

2618
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:22,380
Steven Tyler creating a ride is crazy and more fun than them just going to a concert.

2619
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:27,740
And I'll also say, and this is a full free of irony or free of, of, of joking is that

2620
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,900
I think the ride itself looks better.

2621
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:34,140
I think that the sort of just the sort of generic lighting rigs on the France one with

2622
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,740
the lighting kind of looks cool.

2623
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:36,620
It looks like a concert.

2624
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:41,500
It looks how like concert lighting is, and it doesn't look to be quite honest as cheap

2625
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,540
as the one in Orlando.

2626
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,620
Cause the one in Orlando sort of looks cheap.

2627
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:49,820
It's, it's a, once you're inside, once you're inside, the signs all look kind of cheap and

2628
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:55,100
like, it looks like kind of like that kiss, uh, the kiss golf mini golf course in Las Vegas.

2629
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,140
Have you ever been there?

2630
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:56,940
I love that.

2631
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:58,300
I wish it were that quality.

2632
01:43:59,020 --> 01:43:59,420
Yeah.

2633
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:03,660
Very similar to some of the mummy, uh, blacklight paint in Florida.

2634
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,820
It's like, there's some cool effects in the mummy ride.

2635
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:08,300
This is what opened right around that time too.

2636
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:14,700
Um, but yeah, some of the actual signs on that ride, a little just kind of blacklight paint.

2637
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:15,820
Erin went on it though.

2638
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:17,180
And she said exactly this.

2639
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,780
She said it was like blacklight.

2640
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:21,340
She said it was like a youth group haunted house.

2641
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:27,500
Well, she, she found the video, the video, which in Orlando, she went on the France one.

2642
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,100
No, she thought France was a little credit.

2643
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:32,380
Well, from, I'm all I can go off of is just the video.

2644
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:36,220
So I think that the video I watched made it look a little less cheap.

2645
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:40,140
I'm sure it's cheap because the same coaster, they didn't do a ton of work on it.

2646
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,340
But I like the narrative better.

2647
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:48,620
I think though you like the narrative that you're either a note or you're in a video

2648
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,260
or Steven Tyler designed a ride for you.

2649
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,940
I like that Steven Tyler designed a ride for you.

2650
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:56,220
I think like you were saying, we should update the video.

2651
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:00,380
Aerosmith should still be involved, but I think it should show like, you know,

2652
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,340
what's been happening more.

2653
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:02,540
It shouldn't be 20 years old.

2654
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:06,460
It should reference Steven Tyler's new solo album, red, white, and you,

2655
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:09,500
the country album he put out about a year ago.

2656
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:16,460
It should also like somebody should say, Hey Joe, how are the Hollywood vampires going?

2657
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:18,700
And he should talk about them for a minute or two.

2658
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,260
He should say what's happening.

2659
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:25,100
Maybe a cameo from Captain Jack Sparrow himself, Johnny Depp.

2660
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,020
He's the guy.

2661
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,620
Hey Joe, we need you in the limo.

2662
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:29,980
Yeah, that's see, that's great.

2663
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:31,340
That's what I'm talking about.

2664
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:33,420
The vampires of we got a gig.

2665
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:39,260
We have to go play our cover of paint it black for an audience of record executives who paid

2666
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:40,460
$600 a pop.

2667
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:45,420
Are they, are you yet now in this new version trying to make it to

2668
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:48,860
a co-headliner Hollywood vampires Aerosmith concert?

2669
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:49,420
That's great.

2670
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:53,580
But Steven probably would put in that he gets them to do also a solo set of just the country

2671
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:54,540
songs as well.

2672
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:56,460
Well, then you're getting your money's worth.

2673
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,300
It's a star started event.

2674
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:03,340
But you don't see this concert that you're on the way to this concert that doesn't exist.

2675
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:03,900
Hold on.

2676
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:05,740
I have a plus up as well.

2677
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:06,380
Tell me more.

2678
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,020
In regards to that.

2679
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:08,380
Yes.

2680
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:13,100
I also think that it's they build the whole thing up that you're going to see a concert

2681
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,420
and then that doesn't pay off.

2682
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:19,180
So that's a bummer too, because like you really there's video screens when you get off the

2683
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,180
ride in the gift shop that's showing the concert and that sucks.

2684
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:25,500
I think you got the gift shop.

2685
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:29,420
You build the stage, take some of the pirates off of pirates of the Caribbean.

2686
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:33,420
They already look like the members of Aerosmith in a lot of ways.

2687
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:41,420
Their age, their skin is rough and oily and their hair long and stringy and scary.

2688
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:43,740
One of the mules is Steven Tyler.

2689
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:44,540
That's fine.

2690
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:45,980
I don't think anyone would notice.

2691
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:49,340
Just put a microphone with a scarf tied to it in front.

2692
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:55,420
I think you put those guys there at the stage, much like that Minions room where you get

2693
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:57,740
to dance with the Minions after the Minions ride.

2694
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:58,220
Oh, yeah.

2695
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:00,300
This is a better version of it.

2696
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,700
You get a robot concert going for you.

2697
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,420
It cycles through.

2698
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:08,060
If you want to stay there forever and see their whole greatest hits, all the dirtiest

2699
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:09,740
songs, you sit there.

2700
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,500
You watch this robot concert.

2701
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,100
It's like the Chuck E. Cheese Band.

2702
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,420
I think that's a great idea.

2703
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:19,340
That's truly a fun ending to the Aerosmith ride.

2704
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:23,980
And Wayne and Garth appear at some point, say they aren't worthy, ask them to play at

2705
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,780
Wayne Stock.

2706
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:27,260
They resist, but ultimately have a change of heart.

2707
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:27,820
Of course.

2708
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:31,580
Then the robots all have to leave at the end because the limo pulls up to take them to

2709
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:32,380
Wayne Stock.

2710
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:35,820
So you're tying together all of the things Aerosmith ever had to go to.

2711
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:36,860
Yeah, that's perfect.

2712
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:42,620
Or you could really tie it all together and at the end they are kidnapped by an evil group

2713
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:50,460
called the New Order Nation and their horrible leader Helga who are trying to enslave all

2714
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:55,820
of the world's youth population by suppressing all forms of entertainment, which is the plot

2715
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:58,620
of the video game Revolution X.

2716
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,260
Of course.

2717
01:47:59,260 --> 01:47:59,740
Oh, man.

2718
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:05,980
So if they get to perform for three hours, then Eliana Dufferin and the others are going

2719
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:10,060
to say, Eliana Douglas pulls up, you bring her back, we got to get to Wayne Stock.

2720
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:12,540
Of course, you know how I feel about my fans, Wayne and Garth.

2721
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:13,340
Of course.

2722
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:17,580
And then they're walking, the animatronics have to do all this and play accurate chords.

2723
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:22,940
Then they're on their way to the limo and then the evil Helga from the video game Revolution

2724
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:27,100
X swoops in with, I don't know, ninjas, spies, whatever.

2725
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,620
She has her disposal.

2726
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:29,820
She is General Goons.

2727
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:33,020
Hey, I have some great memories of playing Revolution X.

2728
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:40,780
Switching between Area 51 and Revolution X at the game room at Disney's Key West Resort,

2729
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:45,660
which is crazy to think about how graphic both those games kind of are.

2730
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:46,460
Oh, yeah.

2731
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:47,020
Very violent.

2732
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:49,020
You're just firing shots into a concert.

2733
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:50,460
Just firing shots, yeah.

2734
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:59,740
I believe, tying other stuff together, you are like, I think the secret weapon that you

2735
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:02,220
unlock at the end of the game is a big CD rifle.

2736
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,780
So Aerosmith, again, going all in on CDs.

2737
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:07,420
You're definitely shooting CDs at some point.

2738
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:12,780
I think the CDs function like grenades in other games where you can clear the screen

2739
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:13,900
with CDs.

2740
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:18,700
Well, I think we've come to the end here now that we're discussing all of the multimedia

2741
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,860
that Aerosmith has been a part of.

2742
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:24,060
The primary one and the greatest one being Rock and Roller Coaster.

2743
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:25,980
It seems like this thing is good.

2744
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:27,740
I think we dig the Rock and Roller Coaster.

2745
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:32,220
It may be less so Paris, although, hey, it takes all kinds.

2746
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:32,460
Sure.

2747
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,500
And I haven't been on it.

2748
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:37,420
So when I make it out, well, I will never probably see it unless I go quickly.

2749
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,500
It may be replaced by the...

2750
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:45,500
Well, then, you know, we wish you a fond a du, a fond au revoir.

2751
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:50,780
I'd also just here as we to play us out.

2752
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:56,300
Here's a little thing for I didn't realize that Aerosmith, in addition to the film

2753
01:49:56,300 --> 01:50:01,020
appearances, in addition to the video game Revolution X, they did two other video games.

2754
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:01,980
Did you guys know that?

2755
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:06,860
That the guitar hero, there was an Aerosmith guitar hero.

2756
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:07,420
And then...

2757
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:09,100
Yes, yes, I played that.

2758
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,940
OK, how was it?

2759
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:16,140
Well, actually, I mean, another version is of what I was saying earlier, not another

2760
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:21,660
version, sort of to continue what I was saying earlier is I played that with an ex-girlfriend

2761
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:24,380
in like 2008 and she was like, Aerosmith sucks.

2762
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,820
And we played it and I was like, well,

2763
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,100
maybe they aren't so good.

2764
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:33,020
So, yes, I would know you were just under her spell, like the villainous Helga of the

2765
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:35,100
revolution was a lot like Helga.

2766
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:35,580
That's true.

2767
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:36,380
Now I think about it.

2768
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,700
But you unkidnapped yourself.

2769
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:43,580
But they were part of another third video game that I only heard about today.

2770
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:47,180
A CD-ROM actually called Quest for Fame.

2771
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,060
Oh, there it is.

2772
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:48,460
OK.

2773
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:50,380
And it was kind of you heard of it before?

2774
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:55,740
No, I just remembered like a string of like CD-ROM games with a celebrity.

2775
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,220
Mm hmm.

2776
01:50:56,220 --> 01:51:00,540
There were a friend and listener of the show, Tyler Burton.

2777
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:06,940
There's a lot of crazy like rock oriented CD-ROMs, which I don't know,

2778
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,020
we'll justify talking about them on the show.

2779
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:10,380
So I will bend the topic.

2780
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:14,140
They were sold in theme parks or something.

2781
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:15,260
Who fucking cares?

2782
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:22,700
But so I just so this was kind of a proto guitar hero where the vibrations of your

2783
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:26,860
V pick let you play along with your favorite band, Aerosmith.

2784
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:31,100
You didn't need a full guitar like Guitar Hero requires.

2785
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:35,340
All you need is your pick that's attached via USB cord, I assume.

2786
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:40,540
And you can play it along a tennis racket or a or just your leg.

2787
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:43,020
It's just strumming against anything you want.

2788
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:48,860
And so just to play us out, I'm going to play a little bit of the gameplay of Quest for Fame.

2789
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:54,700
This is what it sounds like when you add your tennis racket guitar to Dude Looks Like a Lady.

2790
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:58,620
But with that with that being said, before I play us out here,

2791
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,300
you've survived podcast the ride.

2792
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:05,020
Check us out at podcast the ride on Twitter, on Instagram.

2793
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:12,140
We'll try to post some some Halyx there and hashtag Halyx to point.

2794
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:14,220
Oh, point spelled out.

2795
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,020
We'll figure it out.

2796
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:15,740
We'll figure it out.

2797
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:19,260
We'll make it available for you by the time you head there.

2798
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:22,060
Hey, thanks so much for listening, everybody.

2799
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:46,263
And here now is you playing with Aerosmith.
