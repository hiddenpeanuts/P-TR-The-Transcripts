1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
dog.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Greetings foolish subscribers.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Your cadaverous pallor betrays an aura of foreboding.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Almost as though you noticed how long this podcast is.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Is the episode actually the length of a feature film?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Or is it your imagination?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And consider this dismaying observation.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The information contained in this podcast has no practical application in the real world.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But who are we kidding?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's nothing unusual for us.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's Hauntcast, The Fright.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Welcome foolish mortals to Hauntcast, The Fright.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not ghost-hosted by three headless men in their ghoulies.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm Rotscaredner, joined by Mike Snarlscum and Jason Skeleton.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's the best I could do.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think I got the best one.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Jason Skeleton.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I thought about it working a little harder and then I was like, you know what?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's just the plain Jason Skeleton I feel fine about.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I think I've seen this Halloween season, I've seen filters for Instagram or Snapchat.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know, with dancing skeletons.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And it always makes me laugh.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like a skeleton going all out, having the time of his life.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think it's so delightful.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Isn't it?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is it because you use scare already?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because Jason's scared in.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I like scare in mine.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You took scare.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, I carted it over.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Being that there was a whole word I could turn, I should have done like skeleton with a D.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Skeleton, okay, that's good too.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Skeleton.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Or figure out a way to put scare in mine and then we all have scare in it and then it's uniform.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because scare in is the closest thing I could think of off the top of my head.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Snarlscum is a stretch also.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But feel free to replace these as we go.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I just thought I'd throw those out and we can change them every year.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, we'll change them every year.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because we are doing the Haunted Mansion every year on Halloween.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's official.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you were looking at this episode title and think, first of all, hopefully you're

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
excited that we are covering the Haunted Mansion and we're excited to be doing it.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But if you're wondering how people who took 19 episodes to cover City Walk are going to

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
possibly contain the Haunted Mansion in a single episode, we are not.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This will be a tradition every Halloween week will be the Haunted Mansion because there's

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
so much culture to cover within the Haunted Mansion.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know how many it's going to take.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It seems like a lot potentially.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I mean, we are going to, obviously we've all agreed to do this podcast for at least 10

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to 20 years.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So we know that.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's the handshake deal I assume we made long ago.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So I would say yes.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There's 10 episodes honestly seems maybe.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We'll see if we can be tidy and keep it in there.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We'll talk a little later about what we're taking off the table.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But basically, we're kind of calling this like the origins of the attraction.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We'll kind of talk about how it got started, all the earlier versions and how it became

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
one of the best theme park attractions of all time.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But before we get into that, a big exciting announcement.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Today, this moment right now is the rope drop of Podcast the Ride, the second gate, which

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
if you don't know, if you didn't hear our announcement of this earlier, this is our

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Patreon bonus content world of wonder that we are opening up over at patreon.com slash

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
podcast the ride.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So it's open the second gate.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, wait.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know what I should do is open the Patreon content in the name of the Weirdo Podcast

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
fans of the world.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yay.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
All right.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, we've already started off on the right foot calling our donors weirdos.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, I consider no weirdos is a term of affection for me.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I started out with my buddy Tommy Blot just started calling me and a lot of other people

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
weirdos.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I realized, oh, that means he means he likes you.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's what I started doing.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's true.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's the line in that Spider-Man turn off the dark song.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, yeah.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
All the weirdos in the world.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
These are just the avant-garde people, the interesting people, you know, that's what

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Bono meant.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
People you want to be taken over New York City, which by the way, this isn't anything

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
we've talked about, but I did.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I did want to propose to you guys and I'll just do it on the air, perhaps within the

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Patreon an entire episode just about the Letterman performance of Spider-Man.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We should do that annually as well.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I watch that every couple of months.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
All right.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now in year three, we will cover the man made entirely out of mutant bees.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Swarm?

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're talking Swarm.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm talking Swarm.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm talking Swarm.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's what Green Goblin would say.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, a Swiss Miss episode.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, for sure.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So that's an example of the kind of wonder that awaits you.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But let me give a very specific example of what you can find if you go to patreon.com

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
slash podcast.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The ride right now available to you is our first Patreon episode, which is about Disney

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Quest.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It is a full length episode that's only for you, the potential patron.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Disney Quest, which if you don't know offhand, was the five story windowless VR experience.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Enigma.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That lasted for a long time.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
One of the most confusing things ever on Disney property, and we know this is kind of an internet

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
favorite, Disney Quest, and we thought that'd be a really fun way to kick it off.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But there's going to be all kinds of stuff.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We want to say the basic terms, the kind of stuff we'll be doing.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, let's say too, yeah, pledge five dollars a month.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You will get access to the Disney Quest episode right now.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's available right now.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You could stop listening to this and go to Disney Quest and then come back to Haunted

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mansion.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can park hop.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a Patreon park hopper.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And then starting in November, you will get three bonus episodes a month.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And we can, there are different types of episodes we have coming.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Among others, this is not going to just be it, but right now we have three different,

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or not three different.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So we were talking about we have full length episodes.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We have character meet and greets.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So we've been hearing a lot about like people want to hear about Sunny Eclipse, you know,

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the Lounge Singer alien from Cosmic Rays in Disney World.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And we're going to do that.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Maybe I'm not going to commit to this one officially, but when we kind of stopped doing

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that animatronic a month of the month a while ago, and I had a little thing written up about

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the lady who works in the Spaceship Earth Computer Center, like with the cool Afro and bright

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
yellow.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe that's a character meet and greet.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I agree.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We talk about kind of anybody with a, what's the name of that toy?

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You have a bunch of them, the Vinylmation.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The Park Stars.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I think if it's a Park Star, it's a good candidate to be a character meet and greet.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I agree.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I do think we can talk about the goat on Big Thunder for 45 minutes to an hour.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,760
If we haven't proven our worth in the rambling arena at this point, if you don't believe

153
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,000
we can do that, we'll prove it over on the Patreon.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,400
And if you're one of the wonderful weirdos that wants to hear us do that, please come

155
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
over to the Patreon.

156
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
Come to us, the three biggest weirdos of the ball.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
In the world.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We also have, they're called Sea Tickets.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh yeah.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
See, we haven't talked about Sea Tickets yet.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This has been our idea for a while.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Kind of taking attractions that don't really, that are kind of riffraffs, that don't really

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,200
fit into a broader discussion of a land, that are kind of their own odd thing, that don't

164
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,000
necessarily sustain the full two hours, although you never know.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,520
We don't know where these will go.

166
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,000
But they're potentially more of mini episodes.

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And what have we talked about for the Sea Ticket?

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,600
I mean, the one, we haven't done one of these yet, but we always talk about the Mike Fink

169
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
keel boats.

170
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Right.

171
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,160
And as an example of that, what are those?

172
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,360
That's always been one of those weird, I'm not sure I ever did it.

173
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,960
And then one of them went to sink and then it became not an option to do it.

174
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
But we're going to talk about that.

175
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm pushing for Lucy at Tribute.

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
I love Lucy at Tribute.

177
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,160
There was a Lucy Ball Museum at both Universal Studios, Hollywood and Florida.

178
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,760
That was among the more mundane things at Universal.

179
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,440
Maybe I'm mistaken.

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,600
I think a lot of it, actually, Aaron, my wife, very fond of Lucy Tribute.

181
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm very fond of it too.

182
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,640
I think when you said that for a Sea Ticket, like a shorter episode, I said, no way.

183
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
Full length.

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Oh, we're bumping that over.

185
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,200
We can put it on Sea.

186
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm just saying you may not be able to contain me talking about I love Lucy.

187
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,640
Yeah, Lucille Ball was probably my first favorite comedian.

188
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
So a weird little kid.

189
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,200
So that could be a Sea Ticket, but that might grow and become.

190
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,360
Well, these might all evolve and shape.

191
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,320
We've got to see if we're even able to do shorter ones.

192
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,800
And really, I think potentially in episodes could consist just of our internal discussions

193
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,000
of what goes into what category.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, that's true.

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,960
I guess we do this via text a lot, but maybe we need to cart it over and make it listenable.

196
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,440
We should really just say...

197
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,680
We should probably have at least a document because searching through text messages can

198
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,200
often be a nightmare.

199
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,160
Yeah, true.

200
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah, I mean, we should...

201
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,280
Well, let's just open up our text.

202
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,840
Let's make our texts and our emails available.

203
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's release the archives.

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,880
That can be part of it.

205
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,860
It's all evolving what is the actual contents of podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

206
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,360
But that's some of the stuff we've talked about.

207
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Do we miss anything?

208
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,960
We'll do the podcast The Ride post office there.

209
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,320
We've had this idea of a lost and found episodes where we go back and cover parts we've already

210
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,440
done before.

211
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,920
We're actually, speaking of which, we started this show about a year ago and the first episode

212
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,520
was the ET Adventure.

213
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,040
This very day, we're going to record a little character meet and greet with an old friend

214
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
named Botanicus.

215
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Yes.

216
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Botanicus.

217
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
So, yeah, November, we're announcing...

218
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,440
We're not always going to announce everything ahead of time with the next month is coming,

219
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,400
but for the month of November, the first month of The Second Gate, we're going to do Disney

220
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,520
Quest and we're going to do Botanicus, an episode all about ET's wise teacher from the

221
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Green Planet.

222
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Finally, not weighed down by the other elements of the ET Adventure we had to cover before.

223
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,840
We don't have to waste time with the flop-global.

224
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,160
We can focus right on ET's teacher.

225
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,840
I will say we will talk a little bit about the flop-global.

226
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,560
We have no choice because that book that Botanicus is in is entirely about the flop-global.

227
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Right.

228
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,280
He has more page time than Botanicus does, so he will be mentioned.

229
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,120
But Botanicus, we got a lot of fun stuff.

230
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I found something that was shocking to me on the internet, and I will just tease you

231
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,640
with that, having to do with me and Botanicus that I did not know existed on YouTube that

232
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
someone made.

233
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Oh, wow.

234
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Interesting.

235
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,480
I found this an hour ago and I went, whoa.

236
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,840
It blew me away.

237
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
So that's a tease.

238
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
This is a real...

239
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,120
For your brand, for hashtag Botanicus.

240
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Yes, which is a real flex.

241
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
2014, yeah.

242
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
My brand.

243
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm finally really taking advantage of it.

244
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Fine, Ryan.

245
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Right here in...

246
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,240
And then I guess we'll say the last episode, or the third episode in November, will be

247
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,720
about Club 33.

248
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Club 33.

249
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,640
You may have seen on Twitter that we got lucky enough to go, invited to Club 33, and we ate

250
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,760
and drank and...

251
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,240
And why not, with this new exclusive experience that we're crafting, why not put the ultimate

252
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,880
theme park exclusive experience into there?

253
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,960
So the podcast, The Ride of the Second Gate, has private clubs that you can join.

254
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Yes.

255
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Yeah.

256
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,040
It really makes me laugh, but in the Club 33 episode there.

257
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Makes sense.

258
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Yeah.

260
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,880
These are champagne episodes that you're going to get.

261
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,360
So yeah, that's the beginning.

262
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
That's the beginning.

263
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,680
As we said, we won't always know what all of them are, but if those are enticing to you,

264
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,560
then head to patreon.com slash podcasttheride and...

265
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,400
No colon in that web address.

266
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,040
There's never a colon in the middle of a web address anyway.

267
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,680
No, only after HTTP.

268
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Yes, oh yes.

269
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
That's the only spot.

270
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Only there.

271
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,480
So, but just the words, podcasts.

272
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
So our famous colon's safe.

273
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,960
Our famous colon, yeah, is not there, but also you can just click on the link in this

274
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,520
episode description or on all of our social media accounts, because Lord knows we will

275
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,400
be screaming about it for a while.

276
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I mean, I don't know, screaming.

277
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Screaming is obnoxious.

278
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
A little bit screaming.

279
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
You might be screaming.

280
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Yes.

281
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm just trying to keep it mellow.

282
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,240
Yeah, I'm, I'll let you be calm about it.

283
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Yeah, but yeah.

284
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,040
I got worn out by my initial bellow, but I was happy to bellow about it and I'll continue

285
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,400
to bellow about it.

286
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,440
And the Disney Quest one is a lot of fun.

287
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,920
That one's in the can and we...

288
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
It's a real...

289
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
That's a play.

290
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,440
If you don't know Disney Quest offhand, one of the, truly one of the strangest things

291
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
ever on Disney property.

292
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,720
So hear us talk about it for, that's a pretty lengthy one too.

293
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,080
It is a lengthy one.

294
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,960
Also, full disclosure, we realize that's technically coming out on October 26th, but cut us a break.

295
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
You're getting a little early.

296
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Just a little treat.

297
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I don't know if anyone...

298
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,960
So that's technically, you were saying that's a November episode, but you're getting to

299
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
the 26th.

300
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
So there's three episodes for November.

301
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,360
You said the three episodes for, yeah.

302
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Right.

303
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
So anyway, if that sounds fun...

304
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
I don't know.

305
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Don't hold us to rules.

306
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,520
Yeah, don't hold us to rules.

307
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,720
For $5 a month, you're supporting us in the regular show and you're getting three extra

308
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,920
episodes.

309
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
That's the deal.

310
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
If it sounds fun, come along.

311
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,280
If not, we have our regular episodes that are still free.

312
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,520
Yeah, they're not going anywhere.

313
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Yeah.

314
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,440
Which we are currently in.

315
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,600
And I like that after all that, where we sort of had, not like rules, but there was a lot

316
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
of mechanics to explain about podcast thread, the second gate.

317
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,840
And now we get to shift right over to a different type of mechanics, which is the Haunted Mansion.

318
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,040
As we said, we're going to break up the Haunted Mansion.

319
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,760
We're going to cover it bit by bit, year by year.

320
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,480
It'll be a Halloween tradition.

321
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
And as we said, there is so much here.

322
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,720
And I thought just to be very clear about what we're going to cover or not cover, we'll

323
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,840
take a couple of things off the table right now.

324
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,640
My idea to tackle it was to do it chronologically, the beginnings of the ride all the way up to

325
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,220
the opening in 1969.

326
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,320
So what I'm going to take off the table, Nightmare Before Christmas.

327
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
We're not going to talk about that yet.

328
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Go on.

329
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,240
Yeah, get in the back of the bus driver before Christmas.

330
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Maybe in 2025.

331
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,360
Phantom Manor in Paris, which is wonderful.

332
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
We won't cover quite yet.

333
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,560
Or the Tokyo version or the Disney World version.

334
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,800
That's how much there is in the single.

335
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,600
There's just there's so there's so many specifics and wonderful stories, particularly about

336
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
the creation of this ride.

337
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,840
And there's plenty to do right there.

338
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
What else are we?

339
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,840
I would go so far as to say Phantom Manor and Mystic Manor in Hong Kong, two separate

340
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,920
different attractions than just Haunted Mansion.

341
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,960
And those episodes could be done potentially not Halloween week.

342
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
It depends.

343
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Or they could.

344
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,560
We'll figure it out that schedule wise later.

345
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,520
That's a sort of trick a gooly in the Haunted Mansion might play on you.

346
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,500
I would say don't count on us getting to the Hat Box Ghost today.

347
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I don't know.

348
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,600
I'm not I'm not prepared for that.

349
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,920
No, I'm not prepared for me either.

350
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,840
I don't think I think that's we're looking twenty nineteen twenty twenty at least before

351
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,460
we get to Hat Box Ghost.

352
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,680
So maybe we'll talk about it.

353
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,360
Maybe we get to the even the hallway where there's pictures of Hat Box Ghost on the wall.

354
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Maybe I don't.

355
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,200
I'm not convinced we're even going to make it into the house.

356
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
It's possible.

357
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,160
We won't talk about the ride today or this year.

358
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,760
I mean, this is also we're kind of in doing all of this rule setting.

359
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,400
We are also under selling how cool everything is.

360
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Oh, yeah.

361
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,720
That we have to talk about.

362
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Of course.

363
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,200
And that this well here I will throw I'll throw this out.

364
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,280
I'll I'll I want to extract some opinions from you guys.

365
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Yeah.

366
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Where we get going too far.

367
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,200
Do you think at least at the time in 1969 this ride opens?

368
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Is it in 1969 the greatest theme park attraction in the world?

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,600
It might be now.

370
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah.

371
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,400
I don't know what ride looms larger in my mind than the Haunted Mansion.

372
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,080
And even just doing research for this, I feel like I've read as much for this as any like

373
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,720
any episode I could pinpoint besides maybe Hard Rock Park.

374
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,880
And that was a whole park.

375
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,560
Well, that was a we just like, you know, we thought we were going to get like a drop of

376
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,480
oil and instead it gushed.

377
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,840
It was a geyser.

378
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
That was the problem.

379
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,760
We all that day were like, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, it's time we have to start.

380
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,360
But yeah, this way, I think we knew there was a ton here.

381
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,960
And I agree even like this story of how this got made is interesting enough on its own.

382
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,240
Like it's so big.

383
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,280
There's so many people involved and there's so many huge events that touch it.

384
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,840
And it took so long to get it off the ground.

385
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,680
It's part of the fabric of Disneyland before Disneyland even broke ground.

386
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,300
There's so much there.

387
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,200
It's for sure the best ride when it opens.

388
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
For sure.

389
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,480
Because if you're a Pirates guy, Pirates doesn't open until a few years later.

390
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Right?

391
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
No, Pirates is first.

392
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
67.

393
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,040
Oh, I'm confused.

394
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,360
But it's close.

395
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
It's neck and neck.

396
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,600
If Pirates is second, it's not a distant second, certainly.

397
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,360
Like I'll give due to Pirates.

398
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,360
But how insane, what a crazy run that those attractions were relatively close together.

399
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,520
A lot of the same team involved and that they're in the same area of the part, the first new

400
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
land of Disneyland, New Orleans Square.

401
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,040
Is that level of immersiveness, of architectural accuracy.

402
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,200
There's such a neat vibe there.

403
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,600
There was all kinds of live entertainment at the time and that the first two rides are

404
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,440
probably still in anybody's list of the top 10 attractions ever.

405
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,120
Yeah, and they seem like, you can feel that they're in the same era.

406
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,680
You can feel there's obviously a lot of similarities because the same people worked on them and

407
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,180
they're both kind of follow a little bit of a same pattern in the sense that it ends with

408
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,600
a big party.

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,320
They both kind of end with big parties.

410
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,400
It starts out slow, it starts out scary.

411
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:44,060
And starts out in just kind of relatively unassuming patios and hallways.

412
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,720
They really save the magic.

413
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,280
There's no videos.

414
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,240
Obviously I have no problem with a video getting you into the experience of the ride.

415
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,640
Those are often my favorite things.

416
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,440
But I love the fact that these are pure analog experiences.

417
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,600
Yeah it's crazy.

418
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,000
They get lumped together still to this day.

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,160
I feel like they're inseparable when you're talking about, I don't know.

420
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,920
When you're talking about rides you're always lumping these two together because of the

421
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,520
proximity I think, but also because of the fact that they're so similar in maybe structure

422
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
is the word I'm looking for.

423
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,080
And they both explode the amount of audio animatronics at the park.

424
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,160
I think by this point you've got Small World, but some of those are more minimal.

425
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,640
You've got Carousel of Progress, but you're kind of following new iterations of the same

426
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,400
character over and over again.

427
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,600
There's not too many audio animatronics in that all told.

428
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,360
There's Tiki Room, but they're small.

429
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:53,440
The fact that there's so many grand life-size and memorable characters in both of these

430
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,000
rides that you could describe, oh that weird guy or that weird lady offhand.

431
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
There's so many of them.

432
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
It's part of, by the way, not to get us on a tangent, but another thing that we will

433
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,560
not be addressing in this episode, except maybe for right now, the Eddie Murphy film,

434
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,120
which I've never seen and I imagine we'll talk about it someday and I'll see it.

435
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,640
But from my vague knowledge of it, the fact that they don't use the characters other than

436
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,840
little cameos or that it's not the mansion because the mansion is so memorable.

437
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,120
Well, Jennifer Tilly is leota.

438
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Yeah, that's right.

439
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Leota's in it.

440
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,760
That is the only thing that really sticks out.

441
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
From what I remember.

442
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:45,440
That seems to be one we could do something with if we pop by Howl at the Moon first before

443
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
recording that if you catch my drift.

444
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Liquid courage before dealing with the Eddie Murphy film.

445
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,920
You had a bucket full of blue stuff.

446
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,160
A bucket full of blue stuff to talk about blue Jennifer Tilly.

447
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
It's ectoplasm.

448
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,480
Yeah, I mean that's sort of, I've been corrected about my country bears.

449
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,040
I've never seen the country bears movie, but all featured prominently on the cover of country

450
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
bears that are not any of your favorite country bears.

451
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Oh yeah.

452
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,920
At least they are not recognizable.

453
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,320
Doug Jones, of course, is like, no, they are in the movie and the movie's good.

454
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,440
He said that to me.

455
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,400
So I guess maybe I have to watch it now.

456
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,840
That's a debate we can have.

457
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Yeah, maybe we talk country bears with him on the movie specifically.

458
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,420
But yeah, it's like that people like those characters.

459
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,600
Why are you running away from using that?

460
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,520
I mean that's what, and we won't talk about too much the Guillermo del Toro idea for the

461
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,280
Haunted Mansion, but he I think is so focused on the Hatbox Ghost.

462
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,400
But again, we're not talking about him very much.

463
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,200
If that film ever happens or any future Haunted Mansion property, I have a feeling that it

464
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,480
will be more central to the actual, like what the fans like about this ride.

465
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,740
Because why would you not utilize that?

466
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,800
People are super passionate about every single, every room, every piece of wallpaper.

467
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:08,720
I sat in one of those Van Eeden auctions and I watched just replicas of the like, is it

468
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,920
a raven or an owl?

469
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,680
What is the like the top of the line dividers?

470
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
That's a bat.

471
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
It's a bat, okay.

472
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,640
But there is a raven that follows you throughout the attraction.

473
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Yes, yeah.

474
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,400
But okay, the bat heads of the poles that divide the line up.

475
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,520
I watched a replica of one of those sell for, you know, $20,000.

476
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Wow.

477
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,040
Like there's so much, like people freak about every single piece of this and I hope there

478
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,640
one day is a film that like does the, does all this stuff in a cool, respectful way,

479
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,360
the way the best comic book movies do like really pull from the, from the actual culture

480
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
of the ride.

481
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Yeah, of course.

482
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,200
I mean, it's, yeah, it's, it is like the whole thing has become so iconic as you're saying,

483
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,400
like every piece of it is iconic.

484
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,360
And I guess even though I'm, cause I was really struggling with Pirates versus Haunted Mansion

485
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
of like what I like better.

486
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,480
And I feel like maybe I often want to go on Pirates more, but if I really think about

487
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,000
it, the pieces that make up Haunted Mansion do feel more iconic to me and more memorable.

488
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,040
There's more things I think if I listed a hundred things about Haunted Mansion, I feel

489
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,160
like I can easily come up with that list faster than Pirates that I go, man, that's great.

490
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
That's great.

491
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
That's great.

492
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Yeah.

493
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,600
I mean, I think the thing about like every piece of it feels now at this point, like

494
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
it's its own thing.

495
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:34,640
You know, I also maybe this, it's really splitting hairs, but if I, I think the fact that the

496
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,920
Haunted Mansion is, is this smooth experience that never, only if there's a little like

497
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,240
slow loading or an accident or something, does it slow down.

498
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,240
But like it is such a dependable experience.

499
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,680
That's like, you know, you're getting, you know what you're getting every time and you

500
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,440
never get tired of it.

501
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,880
Pirates does have that issue of the boat backups that goes so deep into the ride at this point.

502
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,840
That's gotten really bad the last few years.

503
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Yeah.

504
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,080
I think they're running too many at once.

505
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,360
Yeah, they run so many boats cause they try to get people in and out fast.

506
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,520
But yeah, it ends up being, it ends up like in that last scene when the Pirates are shooting

507
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,560
at you, you're just like sitting there forever.

508
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,320
That makes you a little like by the time you're off of the ride and then you get back and

509
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,000
it does, it ends with just kind of, you see where you came in again.

510
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,120
I think that ending is maybe the only thing that I have to feel like I get off of Pirates

511
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,480
and go, okay, well I'm ready to eat or like chill out or something.

512
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,160
It does feel like you get checked out of the ride like a minute before you should or at

513
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
least two minutes before you should.

514
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
You'll check your phone at the end.

515
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,800
But Haunted Mansion, you're in it.

516
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,760
Pirates you can run into, I think, cause I ran into this once.

517
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,520
It was like my family and then we had like the whole boat and tour to ourselves except

518
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,840
for a row of people, a few rows back who were hammered.

519
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,680
And then you're just stuck with these people for the whole ride.

520
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,640
Haunted Mansion, you have a little more privacy.

521
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,280
The only issue you really won't run into that makes me neurotic is people firing off a flash

522
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,720
in Leota's seance room.

523
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Oh really?

524
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,680
Like trying to take a picture and forgetting to turn the flash off because it's so like,

525
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,360
you know, oh it's just automatic.

526
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,800
The flash on your phone just detects when it should go off.

527
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
That sucks.

528
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,800
That's like then you're like 30 seconds of the ride adjusting your vision trying to react

529
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
to that.

530
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Devilish deeds.

531
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,400
Don't take those flash photos folks.

532
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,800
Yeah, well it's wonderful.

533
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
There's so much.

534
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,160
And do you want, I feel like we all probably looked into the history of the ride beat by

535
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
beat.

536
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,960
Let's try to move through this chronologically and then see where we're at and see if we

537
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,840
even have time to talk about specific rooms.

538
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,960
Well the earliest iteration or thinking about this ride goes all the way back right here

539
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,120
to beautiful Burbank, California.

540
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,320
When Walt wanted to build the Mickey Mouse park across from his news studios.

541
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,400
Which we don't talk, we haven't talked about Mickey Mouse park a lot, but sort of the original

542
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,280
like smaller iteration of what became Disneyland.

543
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:14,800
And if you're in LA and you drive past the Burbank Disney animation studios in that building

544
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,320
and a big plot of land that is still undeveloped right next to that building, that is the original

545
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
spot.

546
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,440
That's where Mickey Mouse park would have been built.

547
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,280
Right next to the studio.

548
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Yeah.

549
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,680
But there are, illustrate, you know, concept art from that and there's a little, little

550
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:41,560
part of it says like, correct me if I'm wrong, it says church, graveyard, haunted house or

551
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
old house.

552
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,920
Oh, okay.

553
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,080
And it's just like, they always envisioned some sort of spooky house, some sort of haunted

554
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
house.

555
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Sure.

556
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,000
Because even at, even just back in the day pre Disneyland carnivals, you know, fairs,

557
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
haunted houses were very common.

558
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,960
Yeah, I mean, because the famous story of course is Walt wanted a place to take his

559
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,920
daughters that wasn't just a shitty old carnival.

560
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,760
So yeah, and on his head he was like, how do we plus up this crappy like fun house, haunted

561
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,160
house type thing?

562
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah.

563
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,440
And that came up a lot in a lot of different versions of it.

564
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,320
Like, and this was one of the battles thought about the haunted mansion is that like some

565
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,400
of the design showed it as like a shitty old decrepit house.

566
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,320
And Walt was like, I don't want a shitty old decrepit house in my park, especially in the

567
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,700
another early version where it was going to be off the main drag of Main Street, which

568
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,720
she's kind of like, that was interesting.

569
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,200
Yeah, that I mean, that's a real, that's a thing I feel like you think I think about

570
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,280
like Americana, especially to kill a mockingbird or Winesburg, Ohio, like these little towns

571
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,440
with the main streets, there's always like one shitty rundown house.

572
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,040
And at the time, at the time it probably made sense, but to us, they all look old now.

573
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,200
And it's like, Oh, look at that old house from the early 1800s, as opposed to these

574
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,240
modern houses from the late 1800s.

575
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Now it's just like, look at all that old crap.

576
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Sure.

577
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Sure.

578
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,280
It all just blends into a much.

579
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah.

580
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
That's funny.

581
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,960
Yeah, so I didn't know that that the, it was initially going to be like an offshoot of

582
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Main Street.

583
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,280
And there's been various things.

584
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,520
If you go down Main Street today, there's these little alleyways, but there's nothing

585
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,000
too significant down there.

586
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,400
But those were earmarked in the early days in the fifties and sixties as potential like

587
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,880
expansion zones and whatever, because it just can be like Liberty streets.

588
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,720
What became Liberty Square in Disney World, which is where the Haunted Mansion is in Disney

589
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,400
World and the Hall of Presidents, there was going to be like a little like in the past

590
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,680
colonial area, right?

591
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,840
Shitting off of Main Street.

592
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,680
And love Liberty and he wanted it represented, but it didn't happen until Disney World.

593
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,960
Edison Square was also one of those possibilities.

594
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Oh yeah.

595
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,440
I don't know much about Edison Square.

596
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,520
Was there also international?

597
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,000
Was there going to be an international street?

598
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh, maybe.

599
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah.

600
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,640
Kind of the early seeds of what became World Showcase.

601
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Yeah.

602
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,840
So, there was going to be a little side street with the haunted house at the end.

603
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,520
And then they started talking about doing something as sort of an annex of adventure

604
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
land.

605
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,200
Like, and I think by, I might be wrong, but in 58, they were already starting to talk

606
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,760
about a New Orleans area, but not where it ended up per se, more along the river.

607
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,800
It was going to be sort of tucked into a part of adventure land.

608
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:49,800
And in 58, there was a map put out where Walt made the New Orleans announcement official,

609
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,560
although it was all stuff that never, it didn't quite end up getting built the way that he

610
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,480
said, but that included a wax museum, potentially of pirates.

611
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Right.

612
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,480
That would have, then that's what turned into the ride parts of the Caribbean.

613
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Something called a thieves market.

614
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
I know.

615
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
That's fascinating to me, I guess.

616
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
What does that mean?

617
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Like a bazaar?

618
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Maybe.

619
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,600
Like a thieves market kind of a thing.

620
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, like you could run by and steal an apple, a vest.

621
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,720
Will we finally see some of that in Star Wars Galaxy's Edge?

622
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
Oh, and thieves, a proper thieves market perhaps?

623
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
Stealing from the Toydarians.

624
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,440
So they're called the aliens who make the waves.

625
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
Wados race is called the Toydarian.

626
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yes, you're correct.

627
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,120
So you think there's, there's bad deeds going on in the market plate?

628
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
What's it called?

629
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,960
Oh, well you're talking about Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, which is on the planet Batuu.

630
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,460
Yeah, in the outer rim.

631
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,640
In Black Spire Outpost.

632
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Black Spire, okay.

633
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:50,640
So Black Spire Outpost is not, it's not a clean shopping destination like City Walk.

634
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
That's what Jason's suggesting.

635
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Yes, of course.

636
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Okay.

637
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,920
So yeah, perhaps this was the original Black Spire Outpost while I was thinking about it.

638
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,720
So we can see the origins of Black Spire Outpost in the Thieves Den.

639
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,640
Is that the same map that has like the munition depot and the burning of the town?

640
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,440
Like there's some that read, there's some old maps.

641
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,960
This is what I'm looking, oh yeah, one of the resources is something called, it's a

642
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,080
book called The Haunted Mansion Imagineering a Disney Classic by Jason Sorrell.

643
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
It's really great.

644
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Great book.

645
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,680
Oh, the one we're talking about is in here.

646
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
A lot of pictures.

647
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
You can read it yourself.

648
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,800
You don't want to hear us essentially slowly read the book to you.

649
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,600
Try to remember what's in here.

650
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,560
Also, and this is another check mark in the plus column for The Haunted Mansion.

651
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,520
I don't know of any other attraction that has as thorough a website as DoomBuggies.com.

652
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,200
Like this meticulously researched fan site.

653
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,720
And I read the six part history.

654
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,680
I started to read, and there were all these offshoot articles from that six part hit.

655
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,800
Like I still have six tabs open on my iPad that I just didn't get around to.

656
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,080
Well, save it a year.

657
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,640
You got plenty of time.

658
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,600
We can always go backwards.

659
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,800
Unlike The Haunted Mansion itself, our DoomBuggies can go backwards and then forwards again.

660
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Yeah.

661
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:16,040
So, well, if we're going chronologically, then the man in charge of the ride eventually

662
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,520
put in charge of the whole project was a guy named Ken Anderson.

663
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,200
And he was like the one who's making these early sketches, trying to come up with the

664
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
concepts.

665
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,400
And he was, I associated him offhand with, I want to say Sleeping Beauty, but he wrote

666
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,000
a lot of the animated.

667
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,240
He's like the screenwriter of the Winnie the Pooh shorts, the original ones, among many

668
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
other.

669
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
I couldn't even begin to say the whole thing.

670
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,280
A lot of former animation department guys working on this.

671
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,840
The other name, and I forgot about this.

672
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,080
This is how much I've read about this now.

673
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:55,760
The other name that I saw pop up with Ken Anderson's, Ken Anderson's was Harper Goff

674
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,800
in the early days, who went on to design the Glamour Trams, Universal's first tour trams.

675
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Oh, really?

676
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,960
He was the art director on that.

677
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,240
And then he was also the art director of Willy Wonk and the Chocolate Factory.

678
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh, right.

679
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Okay.

680
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Yeah.

681
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,280
So he was involved very, very early on in this cast of thousands that worked on The

682
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Haunted Mansion.

683
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,600
Was he part of one of those other, like either Kings Island or Astroworld, do you know offhand?

684
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,480
I would believe that because yeah, a lot of people did go work for other places.

685
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I wonder if that-

686
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
You might be one that's not away.

687
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Yeah.

688
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,280
There really should be like an IMDB for everyone's theme park work.

689
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
I mean, that would be the greatest.

690
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Absolutely.

691
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,640
Or a, yeah, I spend a lot of time on Discogs.com looking obsession musicians and that's my,

692
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,280
I want these things to be more easily cataloged.

693
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,800
But it all gets so fuzzy.

694
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,920
People don't get the, you know the way when we found out Tony Baxter kind of helped originate

695
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,760
Soarin a little bit.

696
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,560
You never, you have no idea.

697
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,840
Or Raleigh Crump making Marvel McFay and Berry Tales.

698
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,320
Right, right, right.

699
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Yeah, we're gonna need that because I very much want to do an article about Six Flags

700
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
power plant in Baltimore.

701
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Oh, absolutely.

702
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,080
Which I have been to that building.

703
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,600
It eventually became an ESPN zone, a hard rock cafe and a massive Barnes and Noble.

704
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:20,800
But it was once like Disney Quest, an indoor amusement park, but they didn't want to call

705
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,080
it an amusement park.

706
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,280
Right, because they'd had grand plans for rides and what ended up happening was that

707
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,920
they didn't make any rides.

708
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,280
It was just shows.

709
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,360
But all these Imagineers, it's all walkthroughs.

710
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,640
Which Walt became very against the Haunted Mansion being and rightfully so.

711
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,480
But yeah, I'm, oh, I'm 100% on Six Flags power plant.

712
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,200
That's a really fascinating, bizarre failure.

713
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,840
It was only open a couple years, right?

714
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,800
Yeah, it did not last very long.

715
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,820
And then yeah, the next generation, yeah, the restaurants and the bookstore was one

716
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,520
of the revitalize that whole area of the Baltimore Inner Harbor.

717
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,040
It has the giant Baltimore Aquarium on one side, the Science Center on the other.

718
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
It's just like a ton of tiny malls.

719
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Okay.

720
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,720
That aren't connected, but there's just like four malls.

721
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I see.

722
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,560
And obviously the Harbor Keeper will be joining us for an adventure, step by step adventure

723
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,440
through the harbor.

724
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
To give Ken Anderson is his do here.

725
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm looking at his IMDB.

726
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,120
He has story credit on Cinderella, on Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, The Jungle Book,

727
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,000
Aristocats.

728
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,800
And then he's just every like many different roles on many different.

729
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,960
Yeah, and also like storyboards and like all the art is him.

730
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Layout art.

731
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
That's so crazy.

732
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,480
Like so many of these people are writing the scripts or writing the songs and also doing

733
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
the concept art.

734
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,720
Like the multi-talent nature of these Imagineers is mind blowing.

735
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,880
Yeah, like I think it's in this Haunted Mansion book where Exatencio, like Walt was like,

736
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,840
you're going to write the script for pirates.

737
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,360
And he's like, I've never written a script before in my life.

738
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,240
And then it was like, but then I figured it out.

739
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,200
Like, and Walt just told you to do something.

740
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,320
And then these guys were like talented enough to figure it out.

741
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
Pretty crazy.

742
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Yeah.

743
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,320
Really cool.

744
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:12,520
I am so excited to tell you about a lovely meal kit delivery service that I'm obsessed

745
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
with.

746
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
It's called HelloFresh.

747
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,160
HelloFresh shops, plans, and delivers step-by-step recipes and pre-measured ingredients so you

748
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,360
can cook, eat, and enjoy.

749
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,680
My favorite HelloFresh meal is the balsamic fig chicken.

750
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,480
It's very, very awesome.

751
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,520
And I made it, which is pretty amazing, in the place that I live, my home.

752
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,400
All right, here's how it works.

753
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,200
There are three plants to choose from.

754
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,240
Classic, veggie, and family.

755
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,520
Forget planning dinner, spending money on takeout at 10 p.m., or worrying about gathering

756
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,240
ingredients week after week.

757
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,120
All the ingredients come pre-measured in handy labeled meal kits so you know which ingredients

758
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,720
go with what recipe.

759
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
It's easy.

760
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,060
The recipes are simple and the instructions are outlined on pictured step-by-step cards.

761
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:57,020
So it's like super hard to screw it up, which is good for me.

762
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,760
Spend less time meal planning and grocery shopping each week and get that time back

763
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,200
to do more of what you love.

764
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,280
Most recipes take only 30 minutes.

765
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,400
So you can listen to podcasts ride.

766
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,280
Like you can listen to one-fifth an episode of podcasts ride while you prepare your meal.

767
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,240
And HelloFresh is a subscription service so your meals come to you week after week, just

768
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240

For $60 off HelloFresh.

773
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:50,360
So, well, so Ken Anderson, yeah, he drew the initial concept for what became the creepy

774
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:57,140
old house and it was, I didn't know that it was so specifically a specific house in Baltimore

775
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,440
to bring it back.

776
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,720
The Shipley Leitaker house and if you look at photos side by side, it absolutely is very

777
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,480
much like the haunted mansion.

778
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,200
It was destroyed, I think not long after the real, the haunted mansion opened.

779
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,000
But yeah, there essentially was a real haunted mansion and he also based it a lot on the

780
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Winchester mystery house, which is an attraction in, ooh, is it Santa Cruz?

781
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Where is the, or San Jose?

782
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Where's the Winchester?

783
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,480
Yeah, I think San Jose, San Jose.

784
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Okay, okay.

785
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,160
Yeah, that was one that Walt really got, I mean that I think made him think like it should

786
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,880
be a walk through like the Winchester mystery house or San Simeon, I saw it mentioned a

787
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
lot.

788
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,120
I don't know about San Simeon.

789
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
That's the Hearst castle.

790
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Oh, okay, okay.

791
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,920
And then the Winchester was the Winchester gun, like that's the family that created the

792
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
gun.

793
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:59,280
Now, of course, filled with doors and that opened the walls and stairs that go nowhere.

794
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,360
The Winchester widow thought the house was haunted by everyone who had been killed by

795
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,160
a Winchester gun and she was very much into the cult.

796
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Wow.

797
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Yeah.

798
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
That sounds like a good ride.

799
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
At least a good maze.

800
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,200
Now that I'm a big haunt fan, I feel like I could make up a good Winchester maze.

801
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,920
So it is the house that already exists.

802
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,160
But mine would be different.

803
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
It would be more theatrical.

804
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,000
I could really, you know, they're not going to let me do everything I want to do in the

805
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
actual house.

806
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
I have to think they must do a haunt thing, right?

807
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,200
The Winchester, they're smart.

808
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Look that up.

809
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,320
Of course, there was that movie with Alan Mirren not too long ago playing the widow.

810
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Right.

811
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,320
What was that called?

812
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,800
I think it was just called Winchester.

813
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,280
Is there a point where the people who are there, do you see ghosts who died from a bullet

814
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,200
from a Winchester gun and then they say, well, I'm upset that I died, but you know, price

815
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
of freedom.

816
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah.

817
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:05,240
On the other hand, I cannot question the quality of the workmanship and the fair pricing of

818
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,000
the Winchester munitions.

819
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,560
Never had a problem, never stoppage.

820
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,000
I didn't have to polish it very often.

821
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

822
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,800
No misfires, no clogs.

823
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
No complaints there.

824
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,520
Complain about the death, but not only.

825
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,960
I was also, when I was shot with it, I was also holding a Winchester rifle.

826
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,120
They have tours of the estate, daily tours, but then they also have what's called the

827
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,640
Halloween candlelight tour.

828
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,200
But I'm trying to figure out if there's like teenagers that'll scare you too.

829
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,360
Oh, I don't think if you're holding candle.

830
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,760
Did this come up before where I took, my family took the candle lantern tour of Plymouth,

831
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Massachusetts?

832
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
No.

833
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,480
I'm not so fond with ghost stories and hauntings and stuff because it's so old and in the early

834
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:01,000
days of Plymouth, people were very big fans of dying all the time from diseases and lack

835
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,200
of medicine and food and such.

836
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,920
So there's a lot of spooky hauntings and going on.

837
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,200
There were a ton of, more ghosts per capita in the 1600s than these days.

838
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Yes, absolutely.

839
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,680
And people didn't have television or movies to entertain themselves.

840
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,440
So even if there wasn't ghost, people would just be like, ah, there's a ghost over there.

841
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,360
We got to kill the time until we go to sleep, possibly forever.

842
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,440
We may never wake up from that sleep.

843
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,000
We don't have medicine.

844
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,920
You paint a glorious picture of the era.

845
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,000
I hear Salem, though, leans even hard, much harder into it.

846
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,380
Plymouth leans into the founding of the country more and Salem, I think, leans into the spooky,

847
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,280
the witch trials and the black cats and everything.

848
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
Understandably.

849
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
Gotcha.

850
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,600
So Ken Anderson designs this exterior.

851
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:57,280
Walt says, as you said, I don't want a decrepit old mansion ruining the skyline of my beautiful

852
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,280
park.

853
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,800
Wait, is this Walt's line or is it somebody's response to him?

854
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,240
We'll take care of the outside and let the ghosts take care of the inside.

855
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,520
I think that was one of those ones often attributed to Walt.

856
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
To Walt.

857
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
Okay, okay.

858
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,320
And then the other thing in terms of the like, he died before this ever opened.

859
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,720
Walt died before this ever opened and was to his death was like, oh, there's got to

860
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
be a walkthrough.

861
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,920
Oh, had they not made the switch yet?

862
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,320
I don't think they made the switch until after his death.

863
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,480
Maybe right at the end because the World's Fair kind of kickstarted that.

864
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,480
But we're getting ahead.

865
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
I'm getting ahead of myself.

866
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Sure, sure.

867
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Yeah.

868
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,960
So they, but they at least have the idea that you're going to enter this big themed experience

869
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,280
through a mansion facade, but they had to settle on what the story of this was.

870
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,880
And Ken Anderson came up with a couple of stories and I imagine you guys came across

871
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,320
these.

872
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:01,520
The most fleshed out of which seems to be the story of Captain Bartholomew Gore, who

873
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,720
was an old sea captain who murdered his wife.

874
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
This is so great.

875
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,600
Like we always talk about how we want to see that Batman five, like a Joel Schumacher,

876
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,680
like Batman triumphant, like that Howard Stern scarecrow, Howard Stern scarecrow, like Jack

877
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,120
Nicholson back, whatever.

878
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,920
Like you imagine this when I'm looking at the legend of Captain Gore, I love this.

879
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,520
I imagine in the same way of like, God, what would this have been like?

880
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Sure.

881
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,400
And why not do it in some regard now?

882
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,840
Why not do this as a like Disney's getting into the void thing and there's the horror

883
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,680
void, Nicodemus.

884
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,360
What if now we had the tale of Captain Bartholomew Gore?

885
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,360
I was thinking that Disney does the Mickey not so scary stuff for Halloween, but why

886
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,920
not throw some mazes?

887
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,880
Because again, I'm a big Haunt fan now.

888
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,440
Throw some mazes in California Adventure and make Captain Gore.

889
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,120
Because essentially what they're saying when the mansion was going to be a walkthrough,

890
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,120
they're talking about Haunts.

891
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,120
They're talking about what now Universal and Knotts just do for a month and a half or two

892
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,120
and a half months.

893
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Yeah.

894
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,360
And they do literally every one of Ken Anderson's ideas in different Haunts and people will

895
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,520
lose their minds.

896
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,880
You go, oh, well, it's an old Disney thing that didn't get made.

897
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,640
And even if you never heard of it, you go, oh, that's amazing.

898
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,320
And it would sell out and they would make a shitload of money.

899
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,520
This is like lost demo, like weird fragments of Shakespeare plays that didn't get made.

900
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
Yeah.

901
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,480
Like it's these alternate what could have been.

902
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,120
I think that's a genuine money idea.

903
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,880
Yeah, it's a great idea.

904
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,640
And I'll go one step further and give it a modern long naming style like some modern

905
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,120
rights.

906
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,960
The Legend of Captain Gore colon another Haunted Mansion.

907
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,960
Oh, yeah.

908
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
No, sure.

909
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960
You get the term in there.

910
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
You get the title in there.

911
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
There's not there.

912
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,840
There doesn't have to be the single Haunted Mansion.

913
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,320
Yeah, that's really cool.

914
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,120
Just call it the Haunted Mansions.

915
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,240
Yeah, like eight Haunted Mansions.

916
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,560
And already we're in the in case you don't know, in case you've only been to the US ones,

917
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,960
Phantom Manor is totally different.

918
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,240
Mystic Manor is totally different, but they're in similar in spirit.

919
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,680
It's a similar thing going on with Tower of Terror where some of those have different

920
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,840
stories.

921
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
And yeah, why not?

922
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,360
Like the idea of this being more of a franchise and sure tales of more crusty old murderers

923
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,000
that will tell the real Robert Dyrd's story.

924
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,280
Some of them can be based on facts like law and order.

925
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,400
Some of Haunted Mansions are factual.

926
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,360
And instead of coming back, hurry back, hurry back.

927
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,640
The little ghost at the end goes, OK, bye bye.

928
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,880
And there should be one based on that with the Chicago guy that you love, the killer.

929
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,880
Oh, H.H. Holmes?

930
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,880
H.H. Holmes.

931
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,720
Oh, yeah, H.H. Holmes castle house.

932
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,080
Regional Haunted, well, we, hey, once again, you can go check out our episode about Disney

933
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:56,720
Quest right now, but that was an attempt to do regional, little Disney theme parks.

934
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,720
This is the idea.

935
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:04,720
You do like pop up Haunted Mansions in different cities, maybe based on stories from the cities.

936
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,440
You go to Galveston and you build the Durst mansion on a mansion.

937
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,800
You go to, is it Chicago?

938
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,240
Where was the H.H. Holmes story?

939
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,080
Yeah, Chicago during the World's Fair.

940
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,560
Yeah, regionally, we're bringing back the Disney Quest idea, but with your favorite local murderer.

941
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
Making a murderer in Baltimore.

942
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,920
There's a lot to do in Baltimore.

943
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,200
We're going to take over that harbor.

944
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,760
These are great ideas.

945
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,960
Also looking through all this art, like Star Wars is a thing that it's been mined so thoroughly

946
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:42,520
for nerds and fans of things like every single alien in the background of a scene has been

947
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,120
named and there are figures and there are comics about that character.

948
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:55,040
And then there are full, like there's toys based on the concept art of characters now.

949
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,000
This thing has been mined so thoroughly and Disney hasn't even, they don't even know what

950
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,720
they're sitting on as far as I'm concerned.

951
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,260
With something this popular, all this art and all this crazy stuff, there's at least

952
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,360
something to do with it.

953
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,720
Because this again, so many different attempts variations.

954
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:22,360
So Captain Gore, the story there was that he was about to be married and he told his

955
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,840
wife don't go in the attic and she went in the attic and she found out his secret, which

956
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,320
was that he in another, in the past, he was a murderous pirate.

957
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,320
He was Black Bart.

958
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,320
He was Black Bart.

959
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,320
Yeah.

960
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
I've seen Black Beard.

961
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,320
Is it Black Bart or Black Beard?

962
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,080
I see Black Bart.

963
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,640
Oh, he's Black Bart.

964
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
He's Black Bart.

965
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,160
Another famous pirate, right?

966
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,180
Black Beard, the most famous pirate perhaps?

967
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,180
Not at this point Captain Jack.

968
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,180
I think so.

969
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,180
There was probably a Black Bart.

970
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,080
The Black Bart was I think also a famous pirate as well.

971
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,080
Okay.

972
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,720
Which I mean, I guess it seems, I mean, this is before, wait, this is, yeah, this is in

973
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,000
the 50s so they didn't have pirates open yet.

974
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,960
So although I think that's kind of a cool thing to tie the two attractions together.

975
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,680
It seemed like, well, that's, yeah, that Mark Davis connecting those two.

976
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,680
Yeah.

977
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,680
So he was Black Bart.

978
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:15,760
He has a pirate secret and instead of letting the secret get out, he throws his soon to

979
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,400
be wife down a well.

980
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,760
Which here's a thing I came across.

981
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,880
This blew my mind and I'm going to break a rule here because this was so crazy to me.

982
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,880
It can be done.

983
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,880
Figuring this out.

984
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,280
When you leave the attic, you turn around and you go downhill backwards to get to the

985
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,680
graveyard.

986
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,760
And I read one, I only came across this.

987
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,960
I forget where that you, that is a simulation of the bride being thrown out the window.

988
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,960
What?

989
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
By captain.

990
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,960
But that was a thing.

991
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,960
Oh wow.

992
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,960
Really?

993
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,960
Like a holdover.

994
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
I'd never read that before.

995
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,960
I don't know if it's true, but now I could not get it out of my head that that is why

996
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
you go backwards.

997
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,960
Do you think maybe it's just sort of a holdover from a design?

998
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,120
Cause like you're going backwards into the party, but maybe you're dead now.

999
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
Is that the idea?

1000
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,160
Is that the transition to you being dead potentially?

1001
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,160
Cause we're dead.

1002
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,200
Like you're dead at the end of the Haunted Mansion.

1003
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Is that?

1004
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Is that right though?

1005
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,920
Cause a ghost follows you home.

1006
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
Right.

1007
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
Yeah, you're right.

1008
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,920
Maybe you aren't.

1009
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,920
So then you're not dead.

1010
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,920
You have to come back and bring your death certificate.

1011
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,920
Right.

1012
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,920
So then you're not, so then it can't be that.

1013
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
So you're not dead.

1014
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,920
But it's a simulate.

1015
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
It's like, you know.

1016
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,000
Maybe the idea is come back when you're dead.

1017
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah.

1018
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,400
But I think that's an interesting example, whether it's true or not, there's so many

1019
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,360
little things that in some way through all of these creators involved, stayed in the

1020
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,360
Haunted Mansion.

1021
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,400
There's so many little bits in the soup mixed in.

1022
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Fragments.

1023
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Yeah, exactly.

1024
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:48,280
There's early iterations where there's a character named Madam X and that became Madam Leota

1025
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,280
down the road.

1026
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,600
Or like, yeah, there's all kinds of where this didn't get fully fleshed out, but it's

1027
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,480
acknowledged in this photo on the wall.

1028
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,320
So like all of this, the many years of development, by the way, in everything we're discussing,

1029
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,080
as you said, Mike, we're still in the fifties, right?

1030
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,800
Not over 69.

1031
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,000
There's so much this thing plugged along at the slowest pace possible.

1032
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's crazy.

1033
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,680
Like I mean, movies still sometimes take this long to make.

1034
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,800
And I mean, not this long, but there's like, this is like reminds me of hearing those nightmare

1035
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,400
stories of movies that were in development hell for 20 years.

1036
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,840
Like Walter Mitty.

1037
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
Like Walter Mitty.

1038
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
But it all worked out.

1039
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Right.

1040
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Or this is about to come out.

1041
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
I can't believe this.

1042
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,240
I remember this Indiegogo four years ago and I'm finally getting the reward.

1043
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,480
Orson Welles' final film, The Other Side of the Wind comes out on November 2nd.

1044
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,000
And it sat unfinished for decades.

1045
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,840
And they finally got all the footage together and got the rights cleared away.

1046
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,040
That's farther along though.

1047
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,600
That got farther along than what I'm saying.

1048
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,920
Like, oh yeah, that's true.

1049
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,440
Cause there'll be movies and then there'll be like 25 writers or like 10 story credits,

1050
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,440
10 screenwriters.

1051
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,440
Yeah.

1052
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,800
And then like, which is what happened to this, what you're saying, like so many different

1053
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
people.

1054
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
Traded hands?

1055
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,120
Almost like people not, I don't think people were fired off of it, but I think people like

1056
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,720
left Disney and weren't part of it or other people got put in charge.

1057
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,880
It almost is a similar to a big tortured blockbuster.

1058
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
Right.

1059
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,880
But that ended up working out.

1060
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,040
And very few of those movies end up coming out as good as The Heart of Man.

1061
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1062
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Really?

1063
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,040
Yeah.

1064
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
It's the rare one for sure.

1065
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,040
Yeah.

1066
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,560
So yeah, look at the, in this book, the art is really cool.

1067
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,600
Like there's a ghost chasing a woman around and then he has like big hairy hands or something.

1068
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Yeah.

1069
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,600
And then there was like, it was, it's interesting cause it was a walkthrough, but there's, there

1070
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
was a big conveyor.

1071
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,520
I don't know what you would even call it.

1072
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:45,280
Like a big platform that would lower into the ground instead of taking you upstairs.

1073
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,620
It looks dangerous actually to me too though, because like the way that the elevator works

1074
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,280
in the Haunted Mansion is very safe, I feel like, but this was just like a thing in the

1075
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,000
ground with just lower.

1076
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh.

1077
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And I feel like somebody was definitely gonna like hit their head on the side or-

1078
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

1079
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It was certainly dangerous.

1080
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
If you weren't like evenly on that thing.

1081
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

1082
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Right.

1083
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Or somebody's hand-

1084
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Cushion City.

1085
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The kid would get caught in it and something like something bad.

1086
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah.

1087
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I didn't worry about that.

1088
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
They would have figured it out.

1089
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,200
Well, clearly the walkthrough element had to change and that was kind of a component

1090
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,120
of why in these early versions Walt was not totally satisfied.

1091
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,000
And there were a lot of like, it seems like in the early versions they'd like rig up these

1092
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,800
ideas of an effect, but they would sort of take two minutes to play out.

1093
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,800
It sounds almost akin to like what they do now in the Harry Potter windows, the little

1094
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,000
like things you can activate with a wand, but you'd have to like stop and look at it

1095
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,360
and I think Walt needed something that could continuously be getting people in and out.

1096
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,560
Were you talking specifically, there's this sea captain effect that they had.

1097
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,560
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1098
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,560
What was the deal with this?

1099
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,560
Like you were saying it took two minutes to play out.

1100
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,560
Okay.

1101
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,920
And then the sea captain, they had like mocked up or figured out a version of it would like

1102
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,800
appear at a certain point in the ride and then he would just turn into water.

1103
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
Whoa.

1104
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,320
And like it's described as like the Imagineers were like, oh my God, like it was amazing

1105
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,400
effect, but it took so long to set up and do that it was scrapped.

1106
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,400
It's not repeatable.

1107
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
It's not.

1108
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,480
They can't just run constantly for 12 hours at a time.

1109
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,680
Because it does seem like over and over again, they are worried about like ride capacity,

1110
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,680
which is funny because it doesn't seem like they were worried about that for Star Wars

1111
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,680
land.

1112
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,120
Yeah, I don't know how that's going to work out.

1113
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,320
Because they got rid of the ride that would have eight people, which was that Bantha people

1114
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
over.

1115
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,640
But like it does seem like they're very concerned with like, there's going to be a lot of people,

1116
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,840
we got to move them in and out.

1117
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,600
So even in a cool effect like this, we can't do it.

1118
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,960
It sucks because it sounds cool.

1119
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,520
I don't even know if there's a version of it anywhere in the theme park.

1120
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,900
One thing I want to bring up that I kept seeing referenced and I think the timing is kind

1121
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,040
of crazy on this.

1122
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,440
So inspirations, you know, we talked about the Winchester Mystery House.

1123
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,920
Architecturally there's a bunch of houses that kind of inspired it.

1124
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,640
But yeah, that Baltimore one, especially with the columns and the iron grating all the way

1125
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,360
around the outside patio.

1126
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,560
Antebellum style.

1127
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
Yeah.

1128
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:16,000
Another thing that I saw referenced that inspired it was the 60s horror movie The Haunting,

1129
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,200
which was remade in the 90s and remade just recently as the Netflix original series, The

1130
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,640
Haunting on Hill House.

1131
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,760
Is that all the same thing?

1132
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
Yeah.

1133
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,760
The Haunting of Hill House.

1134
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,400
It's based on a book which is supposedly like one of the scariest books like horror books

1135
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,400
ever written.

1136
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,520
I mean, just look at, so here's a Haunted Mansion.

1137
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,920
This is an ad for the Disney World one.

1138
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,720
And this is the poster for The Haunting.

1139
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,720
Oh, whoa.

1140
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,720
Pretty similar.

1141
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,720
Pretty, pretty close.

1142
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,720
Sure.

1143
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:53,520
There were specific gags to use kind of an off word, but that were kind of borrowed from

1144
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,520
The Haunting.

1145
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,560
For instance, it was a movie in 63.

1146
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
Yeah.

1147
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
Featuring Russ Tamblyn.

1148
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,760
Russ Tamblyn was the name I read.

1149
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,960
There was like four main characters.

1150
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,560
That's the name of the actor or the character?

1151
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,560
The actor.

1152
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,560
The actor.

1153
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
Related to the number?

1154
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Tamblyn's father, I think.

1155
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,560
Really?

1156
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
Yeah.

1157
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
Yeah, I feel like I've heard that name before.

1158
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,560
Oh, interesting.

1159
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:19,360
So, but especially the door sequence, like the third or fourth thing in the ride where

1160
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,080
there's like doors kind of pounding and one seems like it's breathing or that the knockers

1161
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,520
are going of their own accord.

1162
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,440
It seems like all that was very haunting influenced.

1163
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,440
Yeah.

1164
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,320
Yeah, I think that's right.

1165
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,240
Although not to be confused with The House on Haunted Hill, a very fun campy horror movie

1166
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:45,560
where Vincent Price lures people to spend the night in a house and if they can do it

1167
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:50,920
and survive, they will get a large amount of money and everyone is given a little coffin

1168
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,600
when they get their little hand held coffin.

1169
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,640
They open the coffin and there's a gun inside and the house used in that is the Hollyhock

1170
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,360
House in Barnsdale Art Park, right?

1171
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,360
Oh, interesting.

1172
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,360
In Los Angeles, the Los Alis neighborhood of Los Angeles.

1173
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:09,480
Is this the, somebody had posed a question to me, where does the trope of spending the

1174
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,920
night in the haunted house to get some reward come from?

1175
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,080
And I wonder if it's from that movie.

1176
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,880
I think in popular modern pop culture, I would say yes, that is the thing that is parodied

1177
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
a lot.

1178
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,760
Is there probably an example of it in Gothic horror?

1179
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,760
Yeah, sure.

1180
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
I don't know.

1181
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,760
I don't have time for that stuff.

1182
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,760
I can't read.

1183
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,640
I read very slow and there's a lot of those books and it's hard to tell them apart.

1184
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,120
And is there, does this happen in real life?

1185
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:39,920
Is it, can anyone listening hook us up with an old man who will challenge us to spend

1186
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,280
the night in a haunted house?

1187
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,480
Which is essentially the plot of the Eddie Murphy movie also.

1188
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
Oh yeah.

1189
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,520
There is something like that.

1190
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,760
Similar to that, I think.

1191
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,480
I have not seen the whole thing.

1192
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,720
Yeah, if you know an old character actor who's willing to take in a few boys to see a challenge

1193
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,680
to them, yeah, please let us know.

1194
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,480
Or if you are that old character actor, I was disappointed because I watched some of

1195
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,240
that Netflix show and I thought it was a new version of the Vincent Price thing.

1196
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,240
Oh, yeah.

1197
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,720
I was like, here we go.

1198
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,920
What new old character actor do they have to invite?

1199
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,920
Oh, what?

1200
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,060
It's a family.

1201
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,440
It's a family drama.

1202
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,440
Oh, what?

1203
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:26,000
No, but the House on Haunted Hill and The Haunting were both remade in the 90s too, like within

1204
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
a few years of each other.

1205
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,680
I think one of them has Jon Stewart in it, I could be wrong about that.

1206
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,280
Or somebody, or Chris Catan is in one of these.

1207
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,280
Yeah, there's something like that.

1208
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,280
I know, I remember that.

1209
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,280
Jon Stewart's in the faculty.

1210
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Maybe I'm thinking of the faculty.

1211
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,040
Yeah, but Catan could be right.

1212
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:45,320
Also obviously we'll cover the Jon Stewart filmography beat by beat in the Patreon for

1213
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
no reason, why not?

1214
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,320
Big Daddy.

1215
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
Death, Death, Death to Spoochie.

1216
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
Oh boy, what a lineup.

1217
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,320
So, where are we?

1218
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
I mean, we're still-

1219
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,320
We're still poking around here.

1220
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,320
We're still in the middle of the movie.

1221
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,240
So, where are we?

1222
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
We're still poking around these-

1223
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
Ken Anderson.

1224
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,240
Oh my God.

1225
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
We're still poking around these walkthroughs.

1226
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,840
And this was one of the things that delayed the development of this.

1227
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,320
Walt was committed to doing it, but just didn't like some of these stories, found some of

1228
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,120
the stories too dark.

1229
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:16,720
Oh, also Ken Anderson in his multiple propositions proposed a thing that would have culminated

1230
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,480
in The Headless Horseman from The Sleepy.

1231
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,680
It's Adventures of Ichabod.

1232
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,640
The Adventures of Ichabod and Mistreat.

1233
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,520
I forget what you call just the Ichabod part, but yeah.

1234
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,720
So there would have been a pre-standing Disney character in it, but Walt wasn't totally happy

1235
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,560
with everything, but they still- I'm not sure the mechanics of how this worked out, but

1236
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,120
they built the house.

1237
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,720
They were committed enough to this is going to work out, and they had the plan of it'll

1238
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:51,080
be a small house that you enter with elevators that take you down and below the berm, and

1239
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,960
then there's a bigger show building behind the train tracks, which is how it works at

1240
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,960
Disneyland.

1241
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,960
That's part of what's happened.

1242
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,200
They have to get you, as with pirates, they got to get you behind the train tracks.

1243
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,680
And it's in this big, it's funny, you guys look at those on Google Earth or whatever.

1244
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,160
Those show buildings are so weird and boring.

1245
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,160
Oh yeah.

1246
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,000
Those big clunky industrial warehouses.

1247
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,560
Which I forget, if I'm really into it, if I'm in a great mood at the park having fun,

1248
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,360
like, oh yeah, I'm excited to go on the Haunted Mansion.

1249
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:25,120
I forget like, oh yeah, this all has to exist in space somewhere, in physical space.

1250
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,880
You get sucked in the illusion, especially as a kid, that you're in the house.

1251
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,880
The house, yeah.

1252
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,880
And that it's all happening in the- but that house is so small.

1253
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,600
Similar to down the road, the Indiana Jones adventure, where you enter the temple, but

1254
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,320
the temple is the smallest thing ever.

1255
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,320
Yeah, a quarter of a mile away.

1256
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,320
Yeah, yeah.

1257
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:47,520
Well, it was like when I was on pirates, and I was with a guide in April, and he was like,

1258
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,000
you know, we're not going underground.

1259
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,880
That's just sea level is the whole ride.

1260
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,800
The train is elevated.

1261
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,320
For pirates, yeah.

1262
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,360
Everything that when you load and everything, it's elevated.

1263
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,920
And the restaurant is all of New Orleans Square is built up.

1264
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,920
But always just your brain is like, well, we're going underground.

1265
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,160
That's where the pirates live.

1266
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,500
We're going- but it's like, that's all just built up.

1267
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,500
It's like so effective.

1268
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,500
You're going to ground level.

1269
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,480
You're just growing to, yeah, ground level and everything else is just- because it makes

1270
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,120
sense when you think about how like everything is like built up.

1271
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,120
Huh.

1272
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,120
Yeah, yeah.

1273
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,120
Okay.

1274
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,120
So you're not actually, yeah, you're not going into it.

1275
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,920
But anyway, those basics were established.

1276
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,800
And this, until I started doing research for this, I didn't realize, I knew that there

1277
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,640
was a delay between the building getting built and the ride opening.

1278
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,920
But I didn't know it was that that building was there in 63 and the ride was not open

1279
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,920
until 69.

1280
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,920
Until 69.

1281
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,600
And for a good amount of time, it was this mansion that was just unlabeled with no reference

1282
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,640
to what it was.

1283
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:50,240
Which ended up making like free, what we would now call viral marketing because then people

1284
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,400
just started making up their own stories or urban legends.

1285
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,400
And it's like, it's too scary.

1286
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,680
Or someone died in there or there's actual like, oh, they can't open it yet because they

1287
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,920
got to make it less scary.

1288
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,400
There was a ride that was to not unlike Alien Encounter later, all of these like, what's

1289
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
happening in there?

1290
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
Yeah.

1291
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,400
I think that's so crazy.

1292
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:14,080
And then it was just up there for six years, partially because story problems, partially

1293
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:20,120
because Walt, without a lot of heads up, got pulled into this 64 World's Fair thing where

1294
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:24,760
he built all these attractions in New York, small world, carousel of progress, the prime

1295
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,860
evil world thing.

1296
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:32,240
So a lot of people got pulled off and the place just sat vacant.

1297
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,240
Yeah.

1298
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,800
And I feel like I saw something, were they giving out flyers for it in 61?

1299
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,800
Wow.

1300
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,400
Like CN 63 or CN 60.

1301
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,400
Yeah, really.

1302
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,400
Really?

1303
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,960
They really thought like this thing got delayed so much, but they were, yeah.

1304
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,100
The marketing people are like, well, if past rides are any indication, it will take this

1305
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,320
long to build it.

1306
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:58,480
And I guess at the time, the biggest expansion had been Matterhorn Monorail subs came in

1307
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,600
at the end of the fifties.

1308
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,600
Yeah.

1309
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,960
I'm trying to imagine like a modern equivalent of this.

1310
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,520
Like if the temple in Indiana Jones just was there for, and you could like see it very

1311
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,880
clearly for five years.

1312
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,380
They did it for a year.

1313
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,360
And I remember walking around and they did open just that little zone.

1314
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,360
Right.

1315
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,360
And that was the coolest.

1316
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,360
Sure.

1317
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,280
And it did make you wonder what the hell's going on.

1318
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,280
It was like a teaser trailer.

1319
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,000
Did you not know it was Indiana Jones?

1320
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,120
No, they told you that.

1321
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,720
But there was no indication.

1322
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,240
Maybe there was one piece of concept art of what the ride was going to be, but it sure

1323
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,760
let you spin your wheels and go, what the hell is this thing?

1324
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:43,160
These aren't perfect one to one comparisons, but it would be like, say, releasing concept

1325
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:49,120
art for a couple possible hotels in a parking garage and never fucking building them.

1326
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:54,440
I mean, it's not it's certainly a cruel tease, but it's not quite one to one.

1327
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:00,800
It would be if they just built if they built the outs, they built like part of the hotel.

1328
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,200
No, this doesn't work.

1329
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:07,640
It'd be well if they if they built the Haunted Mansion and then demolished it and put back

1330
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,360
in the sandwich restaurant.

1331
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:18,320
Holiday World is back for a limited time, depending on how these local elections go.

1332
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,680
This is totally out of order, but I have to say it before I forget.

1333
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,600
There was and I don't remember what era this was.

1334
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,360
There was a plan at a certain point for a restaurant.

1335
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
Yeah.

1336
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,360
Yeah.

1337
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,880
I mean, they did like Blue Bayou and then they were going to do Haunted Mansion restaurant

1338
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,440
and that obviously got cut.

1339
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,440
So crazy.

1340
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,960
So yes, there was a Haunted Mansion sandwich shop at least.

1341
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,120
That seems like a good spot to bring in the next couple of people who worked on this,

1342
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,120
right?

1343
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,120
Yeah, sure.

1344
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,120
Yeah.

1345
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,120
Yeah.

1346
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,120
Yale Greasy and Raleigh Crump.

1347
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,120
Yeah, sure.

1348
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,440
So yeah, Raleigh Crump has come up before probably.

1349
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:01,280
Well, we just mentioned Marvel McFay, but probably mainly associated with the sort of

1350
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,880
kooky art style and the tower that was outside of Small World in the World's Fair.

1351
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,360
Forget all the Raleigh Crump specifics.

1352
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,360
Power of the Four Winds.

1353
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,360
Power of the Four Winds.

1354
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,680
A lot of another animation guy, right?

1355
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,080
Another guy pulled over from animation.

1356
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:25,040
All of these guys did backgrounds or character design, something for animation.

1357
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,040
Yeah.

1358
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:32,160
But his thing was that there was talk of some kind of pre-show, which potentially was a

1359
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,160
restaurant the way the Blue Bayou gets you into the world of pirates.

1360
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:41,400
And then when that got cut, there was this other idea, the Museum of the Weird.

1361
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,280
And I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Museum of the Weird expert, so somebody feel free

1362
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,600
to take it from here.

1363
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,100
But it was kind of this, and again, another facet of developing this ride that Raleigh

1364
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:56,120
Crump had collected all of these oddities and designed all this weird stuff, like a

1365
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,840
clock with a face and a gypsy cart.

1366
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,600
And it was like, how do we fit all this in?

1367
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:06,360
And Walt figured out this potential pre-show area before your walkthrough experience began.

1368
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,360
Yeah.

1369
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,360
I mean, I haven't...

1370
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,040
Diven, that's not the right word.

1371
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,040
Diven.

1372
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,800
Diven to the Museum of the Weird yet.

1373
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,880
But Raleigh Crump, there was an article about him in a newspaper, like what, a month ago?

1374
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,680
And he very much is like, he's like, if this name means anything to you, the wavy, gravy

1375
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,680
kind of guy.

1376
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,600
He's like a very hippie, kooky kind of guy who likes...

1377
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,000
He kept talking in that article about like, we got to make Disneyland weird again.

1378
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,400
He's very much up on like a lot of psychedelic stuff, colors.

1379
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,560
Oh yeah, concept art is very much, yeah, like minimal and stylized.

1380
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,560
Yeah.

1381
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,560
Colorful.

1382
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,960
Yeah, at least the color wise, there's a Jack Kirby vibe I kind of almost get from it.

1383
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,400
Kind of, yeah, around the same time too.

1384
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,400
And he seems like, he is such a specific type.

1385
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:00,280
And I don't know that there's any other Imagineers I've read about that are so specifically like...

1386
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,260
I don't know that he got high a lot, but like a Sid and Marty Croft aesthetic almost, coming

1387
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,840
from like another Imagineer more than Raleigh Crump.

1388
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,840
Yeah.

1389
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:14,880
Well, he wrote a book called, I think it's called, It's Kind of a Funny Story.

1390
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,760
There was just a gallery show exhibiting his work, I think here in California.

1391
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
I went to...

1392
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,000
God, what was it called?

1393
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I think it just closed.

1394
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,600
There used to be a store, a collectible store here in Burbank where I've bought Disney merchandise

1395
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:35,360
before, but they did a Museum of the Weird inspired art show a few years ago.

1396
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,640
And so was people's interpretation of his models or art from the Museum of the Weird.

1397
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,640
Oh, what it could have been.

1398
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,640
Okay.

1399
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,640
Yeah.

1400
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,520
Of like the chair with a face in it or the candle wax man.

1401
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,720
The candle wax man, the man made of candle wax is very unnerving to me.

1402
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,720
Sure.

1403
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,800
That picture and the cat going around.

1404
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,800
Yeah.

1405
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,800
Right, right.

1406
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,800
It's weird.

1407
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,800
It's kooky.

1408
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,800
It is weird stuff.

1409
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,800
It's surrealist.

1410
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,680
I assume he would like Pee-Wee's Playhouse.

1411
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,880
In my head would probably like talking furniture.

1412
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,840
And this stuff has gotten revit.

1413
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,080
There was talk of a Museum of the Weird movie at some point in the 2000s.

1414
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,080
Really?

1415
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,720
Probably didn't get that far along.

1416
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:24,840
Eventually made into a comic book called Seekers of the Weird by Marvel in Disney's theme park

1417
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:29,840
Disney Kingdoms line with the Haunted Mansion comic and the Big Thunder comic.

1418
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,040
You're sitting on just making another haunted maze, the Museum of the Weird and everyone

1419
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:39,240
lose their minds and pay them $100 extra on top of the Disney admission to go to it.

1420
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,200
This is all really, the fact that there's like these subcultures and it also reminds

1421
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:51,840
me of weird like the bands that the guy you like played with before it became the Elvis

1422
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:57,560
Costello hung out with Brinsley Schwartz and these weird like Proto, the Cory men and that's

1423
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,080
what all these things feel like to me.

1424
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,840
I just started listening to Brinsley Schwartz the other day.

1425
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,080
Oh, that's Brinsley Schwartz.

1426
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,080
Good, very good.

1427
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,080
Nick Lowe.

1428
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1429
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,080
He writes a great song.

1430
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,080
It's a good band.

1431
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,080
You should listen to it.

1432
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,080
Yeah, you got your Rockpile stemming off.

1433
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,080
It's before Rockpile, right?

1434
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,880
Yeah, no, that was way later.

1435
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,880
But I did.

1436
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,920
Yeah, that's what this feels like to me.

1437
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,580
Weird little like, you know, that didn't become the main thing, but you know, it was part

1438
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:26,120
of the DNA and also, and I think it might be true that the first notion of a seance

1439
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,920
room came out of the Museum of the Weird.

1440
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,000
You know, and I think that was eventually if they hadn't done this development, it might

1441
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
not have been in the Haunted Mansion.

1442
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,360
Yeah, in the book, there's like a very colorful version of a seance room and it looks more

1443
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:44,800
like I want to say gypsy, but that's probably like a very lame way to describe it.

1444
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,840
But it's very colorful.

1445
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,080
It doesn't seem like spooky at all, but it seems like a cool place.

1446
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,200
Like it seems more like what I've seen from Mystic Manor than Haunted Mansion.

1447
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Oh, sure.

1448
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:02,680
And the drawing of the cart, forget what exactly the term for that cart, but that there is

1449
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,960
a cart like that outside of the Disney Disney World Haunted Mansion in Florida.

1450
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Oh, gotcha.

1451
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,040
Kind of a little, you know, a little steps removed because, you know, all of these ideas

1452
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,040
change the north.

1453
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,040
There's a little cart in Disneyland.

1454
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:18,720
And there's a little cart, but the Florida one is more colorful like that.

1455
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,720
Yeah.

1456
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,520
You're looking at this stuff, it all reminds me of like, it's his style is like so individual,

1457
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,920
so individualistic and it's been clearly done in the 60s and so bold.

1458
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:36,840
And it reminds me of like the point, like the Harry Nilsson scored animated feature

1459
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,400
or like, or like what's that?

1460
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,280
It's the French movie.

1461
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,280
Is it fantastic?

1462
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,040
It's not Fantastic Voyage.

1463
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,400
What's the like weirdo psychedelic?

1464
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:54,440
I apologize for blinking on this name, but it like his stuff just like feels like, it's

1465
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,800
like cool, crazy counter or Lord or more obvious reference.

1466
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,120
Yellow submarine like, yeah, definitely fits in that.

1467
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,120
Yeah.

1468
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,480
Yellow submarine is a good, is a good example of something where like, I bet that's his

1469
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,560
completely is aesthetic and the art doesn't, it looks very similar to it.

1470
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:16,920
The way that years later you end that they've that every once a year you get this wonderful

1471
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:22,080
mashup of the, what became the Haunted Mansion aesthetic and the Tim Burton aesthetic.

1472
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,120
It would be so cool to like walk around Raleigh Crump world.

1473
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
Oh yeah.

1474
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Specifically.

1475
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:33,760
Cause within just, yeah, there's so much character and specific choices within his, his art and

1476
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,320
yeah, they got to start.

1477
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,320
I'm upset.

1478
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,240
I know it was an idea we just had right now.

1479
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,240
Yeah.

1480
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,640
I hope someone somewhere is thinking about doing these, these, these spinoffs.

1481
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,880
The company in general does not know what they've got.

1482
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,840
They know this stuff makes a lot of money and it's currently like maybe one of their

1483
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,960
more consistent businesses, but I don't think they have any clue really what they're sitting

1484
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,640
on as far as material that's already there.

1485
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,640
That's what they own.

1486
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,160
A thing that impressed me it's talking to, and you, you can hear this on the season pass

1487
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,320
podcast episode about not scary farm, but talking to their merchandise guy down there

1488
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,120
and he was just like, anytime we were to bring up an old knots thing that we don't even,

1489
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,440
I mean, we're not the most knowledgeable about knots.

1490
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,040
He's like, yeah, we're working on that.

1491
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,040
Yeah.

1492
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,040
We're working on some pins for that.

1493
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,400
We're working on this or that or stuff like they are like mining their full a hundred

1494
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,400
year history.

1495
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,400
Yeah.

1496
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,000
And I mean, they obviously probably have less, um, less stuff, but they still have a ton

1497
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,720
of stuff because it's been around for so long and Disney does some version of it, but they

1498
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:38,080
still only do the very bare minimum.

1499
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:43,040
Like I would think that if they sold like, like we're recording this a couple of days

1500
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,360
before what's kind of come out and this Tiki, this hat box goes Tiki mug sold out, which

1501
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,800
I went down to try to get it and I was too late.

1502
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,480
I was hours late and it's just shattered me and I've been depressed about it for a few

1503
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,480
days.

1504
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:05,560
Um, but like stuff like just merchandise stuff of all this old design or, or that, uh, just

1505
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:11,880
like a little toy of this cart and be like, well, it's the original Rolly Crump haunted

1506
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,120
mansion cart from the promo art.

1507
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,120
People will lose their mind.

1508
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,120
People go nuts.

1509
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,120
Like people would love that shit.

1510
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,480
And it's not just us.

1511
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,520
There are thousands, as you can see the people lined up for the hat.

1512
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,320
I know hat box ghost is a little mainstream now, but he's not that mainstream.

1513
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,320
Right.

1514
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,680
He really only became, he only got put on the ride a few years ago.

1515
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:34,200
And it didn't, it grew out of people keeping this legend alive and being like there was

1516
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:39,360
a much, it was a, again, in a music way, it was like a little like cult audience that,

1517
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,680
uh, that grew and grew and grew and now can sell out of stadium.

1518
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,160
The story of the hat box ghost again, probably its own episode.

1519
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,760
I think it might be.

1520
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
Yeah.

1521
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:54,760
Well, here we're talking, we're talking about artists and their influence on this ride.

1522
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:59,240
And maybe now we can start getting into the primary people who the, the haunted mansion

1523
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,240
story comes from.

1524
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,680
Uh, unless you want to go backwards.

1525
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:08,080
Well, I think we got to talk about Yale Gracie before who, oh, sure.

1526
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,960
So Yale Gracie, uh, was the guy who was tasked with, you know, Rolly Crump's doing all these

1527
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:20,040
designs and Ken Anderson, uh, plenty of design work and, and a lot of the early storyline

1528
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,000
development I think went to Ken came from Ken, but Yale Gracie was the one who came

1529
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,360
up with all, he was tasked with the illusions.

1530
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,280
How do you make it look like there's ghosts in this damn building?

1531
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,040
And, oh yeah.

1532
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:40,780
So, uh, and him and Crump, uh, uh, happened upon the, uh, old theater technique of pepper's

1533
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,780
ghost.

1534
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,780
Okay.

1535
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:45,360
So you credit them for bringing that into the red.

1536
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,360
Uh, yes.

1537
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,360
Yeah.

1538
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:52,720
I mean, it goes back to the 1800s and it's where you, you have an object or a person

1539
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,560
like out of view of people, but there is a piece of glass.

1540
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:03,360
So we're in modern times, plexiglass and the way it reflects light off of it, it makes

1541
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,720
the object looks transparent in the audience.

1542
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:12,880
There's probably, if you saw a spooky play in the 1800s and you saw pepper's ghost thing,

1543
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,040
I bet you lost your fucking mind.

1544
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,080
Probably started for life.

1545
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,080
Yeah.

1546
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:23,400
It's just people going like, we still don't have medicine yet, but we can do this.

1547
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,000
We die less, but like, look at that.

1548
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
There's a ghost.

1549
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,080
You can see through that thing.

1550
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,880
You can see how does that work?

1551
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,880
How possible?

1552
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,880
Yeah.

1553
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,880
Funds to this.

1554
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,480
There's a less from keeping my child alive.

1555
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:43,240
How many church outings do I have to go to to balance out the seeing this creation?

1556
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,240
I've been bedeviled.

1557
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,360
I, yeah.

1558
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,600
And then there's, there's a story.

1559
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,720
I think this was all in this haunted mansion book about that.

1560
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:59,120
Crump and Gracie just got to have this room of madness where they were just experimenting

1561
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,920
with different illusions, some of which ended up in the ride, some of which didn't.

1562
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:10,960
And that there, and there was a story in there about how they, uh, they were asked to turn

1563
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,240
the light on, keep the light on at the end of the day because the janitors were getting

1564
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,240
spooked.

1565
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,240
Yeah.

1566
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,800
Janitors did not want to walk in there and have to clean the object, clean the office

1567
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,880
and find all of this crazy stuff.

1568
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,280
And they were like, oh sure.

1569
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,160
We'll leave the light on.

1570
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,720
But they also rigged up the wind, a motion sensor.

1571
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:34,640
And when you entered the room that a black light would, would turn on and now all of

1572
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,800
the illusions would be operational and lit in the scariest way possible.

1573
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
That's great.

1574
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,560
And they came back in the next day and all of the effects were running and there was

1575
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,920
a broom dropped on the ground.

1576
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,040
So clearly the janitors fled in horror and said, you're going to have to clean your own

1577
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,560
office from now on.

1578
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,560
We're not doing it.

1579
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:00,520
This is one of the fun urban legends associated with, with the haunted mansion.

1580
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:06,240
I, I, I saw other stuff in there too, that Raleigh said he had drawn the original stretching

1581
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:10,360
portraits and then Mark Davis said, I'm going to redraw these.

1582
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:17,540
Oh, or that he drew the original wallpaper design, which that I kind of believe more

1583
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,840
with all the, with the eye.

1584
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:27,440
Yes, the purple wallpaper with black, which is incredibly popular on merchandise now.

1585
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,120
Lots of apocryphal stuff around the reading about a lot of imagineering stuff.

1586
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,160
It doesn't sound fun, but it does.

1587
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,240
Reading that in the book, that sounded fun to me.

1588
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,240
Yeah.

1589
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:42,000
I'm just like trying to figure out effects and it just seemed like, yeah, that like oftentimes

1590
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,840
it's just like, it seems like, Oh my God, how are we going to do this?

1591
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,840
Yeah.

1592
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,480
Especially in the early days.

1593
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,520
But these, it seems like these guys were cut loose to just drive stuff.

1594
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,840
And this is going a little out of order, but I might as well say it.

1595
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,840
You guys might've come across, come across this.

1596
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:04,240
The, the busts that follow you that, that as you move, the perspective changes and they're

1597
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,960
always staring at you.

1598
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:06,960
Yes.

1599
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:07,960
Still spooks me.

1600
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:08,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1601
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,160
And I, here's a, here's a bigger thing about the haunted mansion.

1602
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:17,560
This will apply to the episodes we do in the next five years, all of them that they're,

1603
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:22,880
I'm so impressed that there are so many effects in this ride that I didn't really know off

1604
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,880
hand.

1605
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,500
And they, I think they've done a good job of keeping some of this stuff.

1606
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,660
If not totally secret, then like it's still, you, you gotta wrap your head around.

1607
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:35,320
How do they literally, how do they do that?

1608
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,640
And this, and the bus is one of them and feel free to skip a minute ahead if you don't want

1609
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,560
to hear how they do it.

1610
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,200
You're talking about the bus in the line or at the end?

1611
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,240
Yeah, before you, before you board.

1612
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,240
Yes.

1613
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,240
Thank you.

1614
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:50,240
That, that is not a regular bust.

1615
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:58,440
It is a little window box and you were seeing into, like it's like a cut open bust essentially

1616
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,600
and you're seeing into the inside of it and it's lit in such a way that it looks like

1617
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:08,040
the front of a, of a bust, but in fact it's the hollow inside of one.

1618
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:15,480
And it's, and so it's just like this optical illusion thing and Gracie and Crump stumbled

1619
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,340
upon this because they were also working on the Lincoln animatronic and there was a bust

1620
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:26,800
of Lincoln's head that was like open at the back and they passed by it and it was like,

1621
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,800
Hey, look at that.

1622
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,320
Doesn't it look like Lincoln's looking at you?

1623
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,440
Like here, go back and forth and Lincoln followed the whole way.

1624
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Wow.

1625
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,800
So that's a hollowed out, it's not a real bust.

1626
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,800
It's a hollowed out.

1627
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,800
Yeah.

1628
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,800
Reverse of a bust.

1629
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,800
That's crazy.

1630
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,840
You're looking into like a sculpture of a face.

1631
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:45,840
That's interesting.

1632
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,840
And it was, and it was originally Lincoln.

1633
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,320
It was because Lincoln was just lying around.

1634
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:54,080
I can kind of see it now in my head because I always have kind of thought that there was

1635
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,080
a dementia.

1636
01:19:55,080 --> 01:20:00,080
I could kind of like, I always kind of could tell it felt like it was maybe an inverse,

1637
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,080
but that's very interesting.

1638
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,080
There's something that bugs you and it doesn't feel like tangible.

1639
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,080
I'm sorry.

1640
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,080
It doesn't feel tangible.

1641
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:10,080
It doesn't feel like a, like, but like, is it a some weird proto hologram?

1642
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,760
But no, in fact, there's no, which again, analog effects.

1643
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,140
So this is all pre-digital on top of the fact, it's all these like very clever, like magician

1644
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,180
inspired effects like Pepper's ghost.

1645
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:25,880
And then also that I'm sure a lot is digitized now, but that all of the animatronics are

1646
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,120
run by this gigantic server room.

1647
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,360
That's all punch cards and everything to pull this right off in 69.

1648
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,240
It's so fun, not that computers like help make a ride easy.

1649
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:41,000
Now every, all the biggest, best rides in the world are the most complicated things

1650
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,400
to wrap your head around ever.

1651
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:47,240
The processing power of the Falcon ride is going to be mind numbing, but like that it's

1652
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,640
just computer rooms.

1653
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,160
It's just big crazy banks of how would they do this thing?

1654
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,160
It's so, it's crazy.

1655
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:57,320
It is why it's crying a bunch of like three, much of like animators and story guys.

1656
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,080
And then some of these people had engineering backgrounds too, but like just, yeah, hey,

1657
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,080
figure this out.

1658
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,080
Yeah.

1659
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:07,840
And then they went off of Cinderella and onto figuring out how to make ghosts come alive.

1660
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,840
Yeah.

1661
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,560
Which it seems like there was a lot of tinkerers too.

1662
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,920
Like Trump was like a tinker and Gracie and like the way they talked about Yale, Gracie

1663
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,880
is like, he would just be in his, and he would just come up with stuff and he'd just have

1664
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,080
stuff sitting around on the shelf.

1665
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:28,000
And even if it wasn't used on a ride or a movie, they're like, oh, we can actually use

1666
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,240
that on a different ride or movie.

1667
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,240
Oh, gotcha.

1668
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,240
Right.

1669
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,240
Right.

1670
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:38,200
And the other thing to think about that all these guys doing this, like this is a very

1671
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,760
funny picture of Yale.

1672
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,760
Great.

1673
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,760
And probably most famous.

1674
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,760
You're going to talk about the picture.

1675
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,040
There are so many good pictures of Yale, Gracie with ghosts.

1676
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,040
With ghosts.

1677
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,780
It is so, it is a treasure trove.

1678
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:52,640
Like I, that, this is a very similar picture to what you will post to these.

1679
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,600
You just Google image Yale, Gracie ghosts.

1680
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,800
This picture of him pouring like champagne or booze or something into a glass of one

1681
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,840
of the ghosts is fantastic.

1682
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,580
I like this one.

1683
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:08,880
He just looks like somebody's cranky grandpa or dad.

1684
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,440
All these guys too.

1685
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,280
Like a pipe firmly in his mouth.

1686
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,280
He's the pipe guy.

1687
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,280
Yeah.

1688
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:19,600
Cause there's a, there's a video you can watch also from a special called Disneyland Showtime

1689
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:24,600
and Kurt Russell narrates kind of what we've been describing, like these offices and who

1690
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,960
knows if they were set up for the cameras or not, but like, you know, here's a workshop,

1691
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:33,420
your ideal image of what imaginary could be where there's just ghosts everywhere.

1692
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,800
And yeah, you watch a guy with a pipe go and like make an adjustment and he's smoking a

1693
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,520
pipe while working on the, he said, that's real.

1694
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,160
He just was this short sleeve workman guy with a pipe.

1695
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,800
All these guys, even the pictures of Raleigh Crump in the miniature of the tower, the four

1696
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,680
wind he's like in a short sleeve, like sure.

1697
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,240
It looks like, you know, Johnny all American.

1698
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,240
Yeah.

1699
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,840
Well, they're all very, I mean, this is the same exact time as, you know, the moon, the

1700
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,640
moon landing in Apollo 13.

1701
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,280
And yeah, it looks like the, it's all a bunch of Clint Howard's.

1702
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,280
They're all,

1703
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,280
Yeah.

1704
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,920
Even the psychedelic artwork guys look like that.

1705
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,960
And that's the same thing of Jack, he's in pictures of Jack Kirby sitting at his desk

1706
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:12,960
working.

1707
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,960
It's like sleeves rolled up smoking a cigar.

1708
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:15,960
Right.

1709
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:16,960
Cause that's what you wore to work.

1710
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,280
There's a picture of Raleigh with a yellow shirt, which is I think scandalous maybe for

1711
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,280
the time.

1712
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,280
Oh, shows what a, yeah.

1713
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,280
Yeah.

1714
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,280
What a wild man.

1715
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,280
Yeah.

1716
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,280
Kind of a handsome,

1717
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,280
He's kind of a quarterback.

1718
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,280
Yeah.

1719
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,280
Pretty, pretty built dude.

1720
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,280
Yeah.

1721
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,280
I mean, he's, he's in some of these videos too.

1722
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,880
There's one where he and Walt have really kind of got this poor woman corner or in,

1723
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,800
Oh, that I think that is the Miss Tencenio of Disney.

1724
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,600
She was the ambassador for the,

1725
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
That's another word.

1726
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
Do we have a name of that special?

1727
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
Oh yeah.

1728
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,600
It's so great.

1729
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,680
I mean, I'm sure you could find it.

1730
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:50,160
That's the one where like Walt is, seems a little lit.

1731
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,600
I feel like I heard someone talking about this recently where he seems like a little,

1732
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,560
like he's like in our spook how or so scary how.

1733
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,480
And he's like, and then Gracie is like, Haunted Mansion.

1734
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,480
Walt like he's,

1735
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1736
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,520
And he keeps going like Haunted Mansion and oddities from,

1737
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,520
Oh yeah.

1738
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,520
Beyond the mind.

1739
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:12,360
There's something, they see Ramble like that's not, no, that's not the name of the thing.

1740
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:17,520
It does seem like colloquially around the lot around Wed, they would call them, the

1741
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,400
people working on this, the illusioneers, because they were coming up with so many tricks

1742
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,400
and stuff.

1743
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,400
Right.

1744
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,400
And they're called, and it's Wed.

1745
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,520
This is, all this is pre it becoming called Imagineering.

1746
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,440
They keep saying Wed illusioneers.

1747
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,440
Yeah.

1748
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,440
Yeah.

1749
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,440
Illusioneers cool.

1750
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,440
Yeah.

1751
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,840
That's not a, that's not the worst altering name for sure.

1752
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,400
I get Imagineers is a bit, I guess a better catch all, but still.

1753
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,280
When does, do the universal ones, are they universal ears or they,

1754
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,280
Universal creative?

1755
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,280
Yeah.

1756
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,280
I feel like that's the term.

1757
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,560
There's not a fun, they really should have come up with a fun name.

1758
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:55,640
We should borrow from a upcoming topic, the Bill and Ted show, borrow a joke from them

1759
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,280
and call the universal Imagineers Harry potheads.

1760
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:07,000
Hey, hey, don't tip the appearance of Harry pothead on an upcoming spoiler.

1761
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,720
Harry pothead coming.

1762
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:19,240
But anyways, well, so more, more in the parade of wonderful, the wonderful short sleeve stiff

1763
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,240
shirts.

1764
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,240
Yeah.

1765
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:26,520
We're finally getting into Mark Davis, Claude Coates and a lot of the ride, a lot of the

1766
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,240
story of what fine now we're finally getting into what the actual, the actual automation

1767
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,800
23 minutes into the podcast and we're finally getting, I knew it.

1768
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,480
I knew we weren't going to get in the door, but there's so much there.

1769
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,840
Also, you know, we're not doing too much as like jokes.

1770
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,680
We're so like, there's some topics when there's not anything to rail on.

1771
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,760
I'm worried about beginning stuff wrong too, in this episode.

1772
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:54,200
And I already got the pirates wrong because I Googled pirates and it popped 73 up because

1773
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,280
it's when magic kingdom opened and I went, oh, it must be 73.

1774
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,520
And I'm like, so worried now that we're going to get like, there's going to be like haunted

1775
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,520
mansion.

1776
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,520
What opened in 73?

1777
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,520
Pirates, pirates in Florida.

1778
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,520
Oh, in Florida.

1779
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:09,720
I'm saying I already got something wrong and I started sweating because I did it.

1780
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,920
Because I, so I'm saying like, we're just like, not a lot of jokes, but we're going

1781
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,120
here and we're just trying to like, tell, talk about what's interesting.

1782
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,280
But I'm worried there's going to be a ton of haunted mansion driven episode where there's

1783
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,280
more room for error.

1784
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
Right.

1785
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,520
We're going to talk, but there's going to be 50 haunted mansion nerds frothing at the

1786
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,520
mouth.

1787
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,000
If you, well, we haven't even talked about the blood mirror family yet.

1788
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I know.

1789
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
But I don't know where they show up in the timeline.

1790
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,320
Honestly, I think it was a Ken Anderson alt version.

1791
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,600
That was a Ken Anderson version.

1792
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,600
Yeah.

1793
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,600
Yeah.

1794
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,880
That was going to be this family who all like killed each other in comical ways and they're

1795
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,280
the ghosts singing.

1796
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,280
That sounds great too.

1797
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,280
That should be one of the haunted mansions.

1798
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:51,520
And also there's this like picture of like 11 that, that image, the marketing image from

1799
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,720
the haunted mansion in Orlando had all of these pictures of weird family members.

1800
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:00,560
And I think they were the blood or maybe not again, there's so much.

1801
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,560
Yeah.

1802
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,560
Yeah.

1803
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,560
Yeah.

1804
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,560
Weird.

1805
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,560
And let's, so let's get blood mirror manor going.

1806
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,560
All of them.

1807
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:12,320
But so, but okay, let's get into, we're finally, we're stepping up to the main general concept

1808
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:19,760
and the, just to break down the real basics of how the story ends up being told is that

1809
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:25,040
Claude Coats was kind of the, we talked about him with Snow White, Snow White of Florida,

1810
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,160
his primary doing.

1811
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:33,360
He was, he was more, he was a master of like locations and setting and mood and feel and

1812
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,360
environments.

1813
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:40,520
Mark Davis, more of a character guy down the road, worked on country bears, America sings.

1814
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,520
Jungle Cruise.

1815
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,520
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1816
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,520
So like.

1817
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,440
He's the guy with the, he's the responsible for the jokes on the Jungle Cruise too, like

1818
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,080
in addition to characters and stuff.

1819
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,480
It's his like whims, he's a whimsical guy.

1820
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,480
So many America scenes.

1821
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,480
Yeah.

1822
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,240
So many, which is many of the tableaus on Splash Mountain now.

1823
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:04,000
So so many of the like famous, oh, that little animatronic scene is Mark Davis.

1824
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,400
And so being a character person, he's probably more about personality and more about comedy.

1825
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:14,760
And the big breakdown of this ride is, or was, should it be scary?

1826
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,200
Should it be funny?

1827
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:22,120
And the arbiter of this at some point in time might have been Walt Disney himself, but Walt

1828
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,200
Disney passed away in 1966.

1829
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,880
So these imaginaries were left to, left to fight it out, scrap it out themselves.

1830
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:35,080
And I think it's interesting because Coats and Davis did work together on Pirates.

1831
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:39,640
And, but you never hear about the war from Pirates.

1832
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:40,640
Maybe Walt was helping with that.

1833
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,640
Cause that's what they're saying.

1834
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,920
Like he would, like the difference is that Walt would just make a decision.

1835
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,400
They'd go, here's what I want.

1836
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,720
Claude would say, I want to do this.

1837
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:47,720
Mark would say, I want to do this.

1838
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,120
And Walt would go, okay, we're doing the, he would pick one.

1839
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,680
Cause Mark was characters and Coats was sets or like.

1840
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:54,680
Yeah.

1841
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:55,840
I mean, there's that breakdown.

1842
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:01,960
But also clearly with that, there's also, I think the, the, the horror versus comedy

1843
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,960
breakdown.

1844
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:08,520
And, and, uh, which, which Coats is pushing more for, for scary environments.

1845
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:12,480
And we, you know, we'll explain how it, how it kind of ended up working out.

1846
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:18,360
But to me, it seems like Mark Davis, his attractions have a lot of character.

1847
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,680
Like Claude Coats is Tony Baxter's mentor.

1848
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,360
From what we can tell, Tony does seem to like a ride where you're the person on the ride.

1849
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:29,200
Maybe all of his rides don't have a ton of animatronics.

1850
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,920
You're sort of experiencing something.

1851
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:35,120
Whereas Mark Davis is seem like you're going to go and watch a bunch of fun characters

1852
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,200
do something a little bit more.

1853
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:42,840
He's more about that's the, for my eye, my untrained eye, that's what I see when I look

1854
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,840
at the different rides.

1855
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,160
There's exceptions to the rule.

1856
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,640
But there's, you know, it has a lot of personality, obviously.

1857
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:53,080
There's this general, if you think about the flow of Haunted Mansion and the ride that

1858
01:29:53,080 --> 01:30:00,200
we may or may not talk specifics about, but the, the, that for a while it is a character

1859
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:06,360
free ride and you sort of just like get, you know, or you hear the ghost host, but you

1860
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:11,920
don't or you see, or you hear dead men telling the tales in, in, in pirates.

1861
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,920
But it's so much of that.

1862
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,520
That's another very long drawn out.

1863
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,920
A lot is happening before you see specific characters and they're, they're kind of luring

1864
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,520
you into this world.

1865
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:29,440
Not unlike Indy in a way also that until you whip around that corner, you don't, that there's

1866
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,240
this big sudden reveal of, oh, there's Indiana Jones, but it's been all about going through

1867
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:40,600
this tunnel and a long, long, long buildup, which is a pretty cool way to do a ride.

1868
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:46,400
I find it a little strange that Harry Potter and the gang are in the line.

1869
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,440
Is that how we do them?

1870
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,440
They do make an appearance.

1871
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,440
Yeah.

1872
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,440
You mean they're not on the ride?

1873
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,440
Or just in general?

1874
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,800
I mean, they're in the ride, but the, like, that they aren't saved for the ride.

1875
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,760
I think it's kind of a, when you end up in that room and they're there, you're like,

1876
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,760
oh, oh.

1877
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,760
It's like a ghost almost too.

1878
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,760
Yeah.

1879
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,760
Which is cool.

1880
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,080
It's not a big complaint, but it feels like a kind of like underselling, oh, we're going

1881
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,280
to go see Harry Potter and then he's just in the.

1882
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,280
The specialness of it.

1883
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,280
Yes.

1884
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,280
I see what you're saying.

1885
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,840
I think I know the justification.

1886
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:19,880
I know the justification I think is that Hogwarts is so special that of course they're there.

1887
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,920
Like of course the characters would be in Hogwarts.

1888
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,920
Because I would argue also that like the Harry Potter ride is great.

1889
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:32,080
I think that there should be a full on Hogwarts dark ride.

1890
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:37,280
I would argue that there should be something that really lets you explore Hogwarts even

1891
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,880
more to a degree than it is going through the line.

1892
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:43,520
More like gangs and stuff happening than like just, it's on the way to other stuff.

1893
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,520
Yeah.

1894
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:49,400
So I feel like maybe that's, you're right, but I do get what they're thinking is of like,

1895
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,400
you're in the school.

1896
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,840
You should see the students.

1897
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:57,720
Like I would like to see a full Hogwarts ride where it's like the students are there and

1898
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,120
like stuff is going on and like it's a bustle.

1899
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:03,640
I just feel like you're saying Harry.

1900
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,640
I think you're right.

1901
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,500
I'm just saying that's probably their justification is that it is a working school and all you're

1902
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:13,680
really seeing are a couple of people in robes and then there's a bunch of tourists.

1903
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,240
Mine was more practical and I'd have to go back.

1904
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:23,560
I have to get maps from when I first went and like now, but I feel like when I was first

1905
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:29,040
there, there was a line on the map about take the castle tour and there was a separate one

1906
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:35,280
of the queue lines was just, you could just walk through Hogwarts and not get on the ride.

1907
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:39,640
And I feel like they were trying to pitch that as like a separate, like, Hey, if you

1908
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,880
don't want to ride the ride, it's a little ride is a little intense.

1909
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,220
We just want to walk through.

1910
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,680
You can do that.

1911
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:48,880
I can't really tell the last times I've been there if they were pushing that.

1912
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:54,680
Cause I feel like they use it for express now or they just also anyone I've ever tried

1913
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:58,300
to warn that the ride is intense laughs at me after they get off of it.

1914
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:02,020
It's happened like five times now where I go, that's a pretty scary ride.

1915
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:05,440
And then like they come on there and be like, what are you talking about?

1916
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,000
And like, this is anywhere from our friend Marissa to my mom.

1917
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,880
Like I went on with my mom and I was like, it's going to be pretty scary.

1918
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,880
My mom's like, it's not that scary.

1919
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,880
I would give the motion sickness warning like, cause I don't feel motion sickness on a lot.

1920
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,880
I don't have that.

1921
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,520
So it's the one rare theme or problem I don't have.

1922
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,520
But I do.

1923
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,520
I feel it on that.

1924
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,520
That's interesting.

1925
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,520
Yeah.

1926
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,520
I don't have that problem, but yeah.

1927
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:27,520
So we're almost going upside down.

1928
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,040
Like that was the thing that always struck me is with like, as a kid, I was scared to

1929
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,680
death of rides that went upside down.

1930
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,520
This goes like 70% of the way there.

1931
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:36,520
I was scared of the Dementors.

1932
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,520
Yes.

1933
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:38,520
No, I especially don't like them.

1934
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,520
Yeah.

1935
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,520
They get close to you.

1936
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,520
Especially the Dementors count in Hollywood.

1937
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,520
There's like 12 more.

1938
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,520
Yeah.

1939
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,320
But now that again, now that I'm a Haunt fan, maybe I'll go back and I won't be so scared

1940
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,320
of the Dementors.

1941
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:53,960
You also became a real big fan recently of laying it on thick.

1942
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,160
I think to be fair, I think I've always been a fan of that.

1943
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,040
That's you and I both.

1944
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,040
Yeah.

1945
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,040
Okay.

1946
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,800
Let's keep, I think we can get to the door.

1947
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,800
All right.

1948
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,800
Let's try to get to the door.

1949
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,400
Well, anything more about Dave?

1950
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,960
Well, oh, we can't.

1951
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,960
We can't.

1952
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:10,960
Davis and Coates is still going.

1953
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,000
Because the peacemaker eventually arrives.

1954
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yes.

1955
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Ex Atencio.

1956
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Ex Atencio.

1957
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,760
Uncle of Hollywood director, Peter Atencio.

1958
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:21,760
Oh, that's right.

1959
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1960
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:30,320
And a guy who was like around the church that I went to growing up and my mom knew his daughter

1961
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,320
and I ran it.

1962
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:35,040
I got to meet him in the church parking lot one time and he drew a Mickey for me and I

1963
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,040
still have that.

1964
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,040
That's great.

1965
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,480
It's a very treasured thing.

1966
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,480
Yeah.

1967
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:43,680
And that thought also when you talk about why Pirates and Haunted Mansion feel like two

1968
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:48,680
parts of a whole, that it's Coates, it's Davis and it's Ex Atencio.

1969
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:53,080
Ex Atencio wrote the script, also wrote the song and had never written songs in his life.

1970
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,080
Green, Green and Ghosts.

1971
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:59,040
But he could wrap his head around the fact that in both Yo Ho, Pirates of the Night for

1972
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:03,120
Me and Green, Green and Ghosts, that it has to be kind of in the round.

1973
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,680
It has to be a circular song.

1974
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:13,440
It cannot be a live and let die with all these different sections and changes of tempo.

1975
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,840
It has to be one flood.

1976
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,480
It's the best example I could think of.

1977
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,480
I love live and let die.

1978
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,480
That's perfect.

1979
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,840
That is opposed to Bohemian Rhapsody.

1980
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:24,520
Live and let die.

1981
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,160
It has to be this like, that's I think how he could wrap his head around doing a song

1982
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:33,000
having not done one is that like, okay, well I know from rides how this has to function.

1983
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,480
It has to loop like animatronics.

1984
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,120
And music by the music part of that by Buddy Baker.

1985
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,120
Okay, yeah.

1986
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,120
Yeah.

1987
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:45,280
And they were, I think he like both of both of those people, both Baker and Atencio were

1988
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,160
surprised that they got the assignment.

1989
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,440
They were like, I think, fill around with an idea and then we're like, and then Walt

1990
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,840
will give it to the Sherman Brothers.

1991
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,760
But in this case, they did not.

1992
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,720
So it's actually strangely two of the most, you know, even though they did so many of

1993
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:03,680
the famous Park songs, it was this was both, both of these were Atencio and and he, yeah,

1994
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:07,600
beyond doing the song also like had to make heads or tails of all the stuff we've been

1995
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,520
talking about for an hour and a half.

1996
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:15,320
All of the various show elements, the different directions that Coates and Davis wanted to

1997
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:19,400
go these weird scraps of here's an idea Raleigh Crump had, here's an illusion that Gracie

1998
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:20,400
thought of.

1999
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,860
He had to tie it all together.

2000
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:27,640
And also at this point, he was stuck with the general notion of, okay, what the fans

2001
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:31,560
are going to expect now is that this is a retirement home for ghosts.

2002
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:38,760
We're backed into that because when the mansion was just sitting with no attraction inside,

2003
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:44,480
Walt's tasked new, imaginary hire Marty Sklar, who became eventually the head of the whole

2004
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,080
thing and worked there for decades and decades and decades.

2005
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:51,120
One of the first things he ever did was write this big note that was left on the gate explaining

2006
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,120
the backstory of it.

2007
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:57,000
The gist of which is and as Walt Disney had said in various media, this will be a place

2008
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,920
for homeless ghosts to stay.

2009
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:05,760
The first time Walter talked about it on record, he was for the BBC and he talked about how

2010
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:10,760
he had sympathy for all of the ghosts in England that have nowhere to go because London got

2011
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,520
bombed during World War II.

2012
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,520
I read that too.

2013
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,520
That was the most bizarre thing.

2014
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,520
What a bizarre thing to say.

2015
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,400
Can you imagine if a head of a company said that now?

2016
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,400
Referred to, yeah.

2017
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:28,680
Like, and not that long after because we now are about the same distance of time from 9-11.

2018
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:31,480
So like, we're a place for the 9-11 ghosts to go.

2019
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:37,040
Bob Iger announcing that the 9-11 ghosts are free to come to Disneyland.

2020
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,040
Like what?

2021
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:42,360
They've been swirling around the skies of Manhattan, but now, yeah.

2022
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,360
He'd have to resign.

2023
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,360
I mean that's, well.

2024
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,360
If he tweeted it, yeah, he'd be done in an hour.

2025
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:51,600
If James Gunn has to go away for like lame, bad, dirty, gross jokes from 10 years ago,

2026
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,240
Bob Iger inviting the 9-11 ghosts.

2027
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,600
He needs to be punished for this thing we made up that he did.

2028
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,600
I agree.

2029
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,600
You know what?

2030
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:03,600
In all fairness though, Walt's famous last words of course were, I will be ghost number

2031
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,600
a thousand.

2032
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,600
Change the script.

2033
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,280
Yeah, one of those.

2034
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,600
He's not one of the impressive, he's just like the third knocking door.

2035
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,600
That's Walt.

2036
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:19,160
I used to think when I was a kid that he was one of, we shouldn't be talking about this,

2037
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,280
but the end of the ride with the heads that are singing, I used to think one of the heads

2038
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,280
was him.

2039
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,280
I did too.

2040
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:25,280
I think I went for that too.

2041
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,040
I don't know if it was, it's not Thorol, I don't think.

2042
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,040
Thorol Ravenscroft.

2043
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,640
I don't think that's who I was mistaking for Walt, but it might've been.

2044
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,640
It's just the vibe.

2045
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,640
Like a mustacheed man.

2046
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:37,240
Those heads, you can't see it, but all those heads underneath the neck are wearing short

2047
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:42,440
sleeve dress shirts with pocket protectors and somehow a full carton of cigarettes.

2048
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,480
Bushy.

2049
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,720
If all of those heads were smoking cigarettes, that would be the best.

2050
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,720
Oh God.

2051
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:51,200
Can you imagine how exhausting that would have been on message boards?

2052
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:54,440
It was like, I think they should always be smoking cigarettes.

2053
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,640
I can't believe they took out the smoking bus.

2054
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,640
Walt wanted it, he's rolling it in his grave.

2055
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:04,520
All the ghosts were smoking in the graveyard and they should have been smoking forever.

2056
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:08,920
Smoking's okay, but drinking is not.

2057
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,440
Those people would, if there was a Taunton Mansion bar, they would shut the fuck up.

2058
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:16,800
Let's be honest, these anti Disneyland drinking people.

2059
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:25,360
If you get the drink and then you get, I was going to say a real tiny glit, a fancy hat

2060
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:31,880
box shaped shot glass that you put into, like if you get a Margherita Cadillac style, you

2061
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:32,880
put the little.

2062
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:36,160
Oh, and he like dumps it himself if that was possible.

2063
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,960
Everything's dry ice everywhere.

2064
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,600
There we go.

2065
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,000
Again, it's crazy that that doesn't exist.

2066
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,840
They were going to do that Tower of Terror bar in Florida and they didn't for some weird

2067
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,840
reason.

2068
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,360
But Mike Carlson would draw the line if they served wine.

2069
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,120
An alcoholic's drink.

2070
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:53,520
Yeah, well that's an alcoholic's drink.

2071
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,640
Margherita is a fun drink or a colorful drink.

2072
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:02,680
This to me, one of the strangest things ever said out loud by anyone or been certainly

2073
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,160
on the podcast itself.

2074
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:09,600
Well, I mean, in full disclosure, we're recording this on the 20th of October, which is our

2075
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,560
one year anniversary and I picked up a bottle of sparkling wine for us to enjoy at this

2076
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:19,400
episode and Scott has been like licking his lips and salivating this whole time.

2077
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,760
So in Mike's defense.

2078
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:28,080
If you haven't heard Mike said that it out beat by beat all of the all of my smacks.

2079
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:32,680
And also people probably and a lot of episodes, though, my neighbor has a window.

2080
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:37,340
So with a pie on it and Jason oftentimes is licking his lips and salivating.

2081
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:39,120
So I have to edit that out often as well.

2082
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,440
This is a cherry pie cooling on a window.

2083
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:45,880
So you know what you were getting into when you moved here and I have to oftentimes as

2084
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:49,600
you're floating off the couch toward it, I have to pull you back down and I have an

2085
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,200
anchor around my ankle now to prevent that.

2086
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:57,520
But when you close the blinds, then you can't see your neighbor who is a burlesque model

2087
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,400
in a 40s bathing suit.

2088
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,400
Get her away.

2089
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,400
No.

2090
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:04,400
In decent.

2091
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,920
All right.

2092
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,360
So where are we?

2093
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,360
We're getting there.

2094
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:13,800
We're 40 minutes into the Haunted Mansion and we haven't talked about.

2095
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:14,800
I love OK.

2096
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,440
Well, I think the divide is becoming clear.

2097
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,720
I think you come back next year and we'll talk about, you know, the stuff inside.

2098
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,040
We'll talk about the room.

2099
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,380
So how about the so we have the war.

2100
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:28,000
We have exsitio making peace.

2101
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,060
I think like the it seems to me like how it ended up working out is that the beginning

2102
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:40,520
of the ride pre characters is like that's the scary zone.

2103
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,520
Spooky.

2104
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:47,760
And it's and it's kind of keeping this this tone of OK, like there's going to be there's

2105
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,120
going to be a wake.

2106
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,660
Ghosts are going to start appearing.

2107
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:54,340
But is that going to be OK or is that going to be terrifying?

2108
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:56,840
And you get to live in that for a little while.

2109
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:59,840
And then probably the leotis scene starts to transition.

2110
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:03,720
She's not funny, but she's like making you comfortable with the idea.

2111
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,040
We're going to start seeing goes.

2112
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:10,400
And then when the ballroom starting to get a little funnier and then by the final by

2113
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,960
the graveyard party now, oh, ghosts are fun.

2114
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,400
Actually, I like ghosts.

2115
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:17,360
I want to I like a ghost ghost.

2116
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,360
That's scary to me.

2117
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:24,560
I was going to ask, where do you guys personally think the line where where does where is the

2118
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,720
brackish water between the fresh water and the salt water?

2119
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,160
Where is like the delta?

2120
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:37,440
I think it's the my very my favorite thing in the ride is the the dual.

2121
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,520
The two ghosts and the pain, yes, we're facing apart from each other and then they turn and

2122
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,520
they say, I agree.

2123
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,520
And that to me is where it starts.

2124
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,120
That's exactly what I want to say.

2125
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,720
Yes, because it's like it's still kind of scary.

2126
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:48,720
That whole room.

2127
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,560
Yeah, that scares me as a kid.

2128
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,960
I was like, I like this, but I'm happy I'm on the second floor.

2129
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:58,400
Like, I'm happy I'm above like above them because they don't have like and I don't know

2130
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,400
this.

2131
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:02,840
We didn't need to research this because we won't do this until 2020 2021.

2132
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:07,000
But I didn't like the feeling you get because I think it's a little bit farther away than

2133
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,760
the graveyard ghosts is that those people aren't as full of life, even though they're

2134
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:12,760
moving.

2135
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,800
They don't have as much character to them.

2136
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,200
I don't see them as friendly.

2137
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,440
I see them as like having a party and I'm intruding upon it.

2138
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:24,080
Whereas when you're in the graveyard, you're enjoying you're there happy that you're there.

2139
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:28,720
Well, and they're part of like a very formal functional, like if you went to like a royal

2140
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:32,400
banquet order to that here now is the dancing part.

2141
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,800
And now we sit at the table and we use this knife.

2142
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,160
We but the by the graveyard party, all bets are off.

2143
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:39,640
Everybody's hanging everywhere.

2144
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,040
There's lampshades on here.

2145
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,080
And people have broken out into different clusters.

2146
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,320
There's no order left.

2147
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:50,440
And that's my so my view of how this that's the story works is that yeah, that you're

2148
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,440
like nervous about ghosts.

2149
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,440
Am I going to like ghosts?

2150
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,760
So wait, they're having a fun party.

2151
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,440
I actually I shouldn't have been afraid the whole time.

2152
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:01,040
So then you're accustomed to like, I guess I'm I guess I'm a fan of ghosts.

2153
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,040
All right.

2154
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,040
Well, very good.

2155
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,040
One's going to follow you home.

2156
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,400
It's like, well, wait on a second.

2157
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,400
I didn't agree.

2158
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,120
Let's not go nuts here.

2159
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:14,160
Yeah, that's that's my that's that's how I perceive the story.

2160
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:18,760
And I think I so I think you get this gradient from Coates into.

2161
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:19,760
Yeah.

2162
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,100
Into Davis in a very fun way.

2163
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:28,860
But as we talked about a little bit in Snow White, you know, Coates didn't get to do his

2164
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:35,680
full on hit like trapping people in a scary, stressful environment, which is why when he

2165
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:42,800
he got his dream in Florida and did the Snow White ride, it was super scary, not character

2166
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:43,800
oriented.

2167
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:48,200
So somebody's just yelling in the other room.

2168
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,200
Goose.

2169
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:55,440
But that's that's like where so to tie our whole spooky month together.

2170
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,440
Yeah.

2171
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:01,560
So, you know, Snow White probably doesn't happen as terrifying as it is.

2172
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:08,840
And as a friend of the show pointed out recently, like we said, Claude Coates was Tony Baxter

2173
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,040
psyched him as a mentor figure.

2174
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:16,640
So when it came time to do Haunted Mansion in Paris, Phantom Manor definitely leans more

2175
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,200
towards the scary.

2176
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,200
Yeah.

2177
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:20,200
And the whimsical.

2178
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:25,400
Although there is also competing stories about that, that, you know, the French, they they

2179
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,400
get scary.

2180
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,120
They Tony always said they get scary.

2181
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,120
They get funny.

2182
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,160
They don't get them together.

2183
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:35,080
So they have to go in one direction or the other.

2184
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,560
This is I'm sure this excuse me.

2185
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:44,440
This point has been made before, but the Haunted Mansion and pirates are structured like Wilco

2186
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:47,920
front man Jeff Tweedy talks about putting a concert together.

2187
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:53,520
He's like he likes to start out with like maybe like a challenging like moody or stuff.

2188
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,720
And by the end, it's a celebration and it made a lot of sense to me when I heard him

2189
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:01,160
talk about what a concert structure like that you want to end on a very fun, triumphant

2190
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:06,480
note, but you start out kind of wading into something that's a little bit more like dark

2191
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:07,680
or challenging.

2192
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:11,920
So it really is kind of a perfect structure for a show in general.

2193
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:12,920
Like just to you.

2194
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:16,240
So, you know, you start out with ashes of American flags, but then by the end you're

2195
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:20,960
playing Monday, you're playing, I got you, you know, all your fun Wilco rockers.

2196
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,960
It like makes a lot of sense to me when we're talking about like the way they transition

2197
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,960
out and then the way this stuff ends.

2198
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:36,640
And in this case you get scary version of Grim Grinning Ghosts into mid step waltz version

2199
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:44,000
of Grim Grinning Ghosts into fun, kooky ragtime Grim Grinning Ghosts.

2200
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,040
And I'm describing Jason's dream, a concert that is all Grim Grinning Ghosts front to

2201
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:50,560
back 70 minutes.

2202
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:56,800
And I'm going to do you one better on that, Mike.

2203
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,800
The Wilco Alhom Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, very labored creative process.

2204
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,800
Yes, very labor.

2205
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:08,600
Much like the Haunted Mansion, an album that in my mind looms very large.

2206
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:13,000
Also probably think, did like Pitchfork give that like a perfect 10, like the year that

2207
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
came out.

2208
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,760
It was like the album of the year.

2209
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,560
So do we give the Haunted Mansion a perfect 10?

2210
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,200
A perfect 10, yeah.

2211
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:23,480
Are we the snobbier end of Pitchfork and it's just 7.8?

2212
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:24,480
Fine.

2213
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:25,480
It's pretty good.

2214
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:31,360
Why did they give the rafts to Thompson Island at 7.9?

2215
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,360
I don't understand.

2216
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:36,920
Maybe instead of the whole scale plus it up, we should just start doing the Pitchfork rating

2217
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:38,120
on these rides.

2218
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,840
Oh yeah.

2219
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:44,320
For all the rides will give a very precise amount.

2220
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:49,960
And then like strangely, like to make a point, we give 10 out of 10 to the Jimmy Fallon.

2221
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:50,960
Right.

2222
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,720
And we're like, you know, pop art.

2223
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:53,960
It's what's the problem with that?

2224
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:54,960
All right.

2225
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:59,160
What to them had a job interview those people this week?

2226
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:04,200
They're trying to get more mainstream.

2227
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,880
I'm heading to MTV.com.

2228
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:12,200
Well where are we and how do we how do we proceed?

2229
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:17,220
We keep trying to get into the queue and we keep getting spooked by curveballs and I've

2230
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:22,440
got another one, the World's Fair, the 64, 65 World's Fair.

2231
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,440
Yes.

2232
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,440
Probably.

2233
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:30,800
I mean, the second big event that affected this ride in addition to the other being Walt

2234
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,000
Disney's passing.

2235
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:40,000
But the World's Fair, a lot of imagineering, a lot of wed and presumably MAPO, which is

2236
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:46,400
the manufacturing arm of wed diverted to making World's Fair sort of stuff.

2237
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:52,680
But greatly the work done for that and the research done for that greatly influenced

2238
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:55,200
this ride.

2239
01:48:55,200 --> 01:49:01,600
All the animatronics work done for the World's Fair attractions and the rides is the early,

2240
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,560
early pre-omnimover ride system for the Ford Magic Skyway.

2241
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,560
Oh, okay.

2242
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:08,560
Yeah.

2243
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:14,000
Of a continuously moving ride vehicle that was refined into the omnimover used in Adventures

2244
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,080
Through Interspace and other Claude Coats.

2245
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:18,080
Yes.

2246
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,520
So if you don't know about, if you don't know the mechanics of Adventures Through Interspace,

2247
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,880
those were what became the Doom Buggies.

2248
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:33,360
It's these pods with the high backs, the best vehicles in which to make out at Disneyland,

2249
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:37,520
thus leading to Haunted Mansion being the best ride in which to make out.

2250
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,080
Have you, didn't you make out in a Doom Buggy?

2251
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:42,080
Oh, you know it.

2252
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,080
Or like you kissed.

2253
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2254
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,080
What was the story?

2255
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,080
Oh, no, I did.

2256
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:53,280
Well, there was, I like, knowing that, you know, knowing that I like, this was, if I

2257
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,280
was going to get it done.

2258
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,280
Right, that's the time.

2259
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,280
That's, yeah, yeah.

2260
01:49:56,280 --> 01:50:00,080
I think I talked about, this is the same one where I had some of this mischief with the

2261
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,080
Matterhorn.

2262
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,080
Oh, yes, yes.

2263
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:06,560
And we were like, the whole day at Disneyland, we were trying to evade the very overprotective

2264
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:10,320
mom, me and my long distance girlfriend who I only saw once a week.

2265
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:13,920
So we had to make out at Disneyland because there was no other option.

2266
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,400
So did you say once a week?

2267
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2268
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,200
I only saw her a week a year.

2269
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,200
That's what I meant.

2270
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,920
That was how I spent my high school years for you, the listener.

2271
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,240
I was, had a girlfriend I only saw one week a year.

2272
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:32,080
So I had any, any exploration I wanted to do, I had to do at family friendly, theme park

2273
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,080
destinations.

2274
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:38,640
So once again, if you've been listening for a year, that's just a reminder that things

2275
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:42,800
like that are why we are the way we are.

2276
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:51,320
A crucial backstory, just like all this crap about Raleigh Crump and led to the iconic

2277
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,720
podcast, The Ride Boys, We Are Today.

2278
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:54,720
So iconic.

2279
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,720
No, no, no.

2280
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:59,360
So we like knowing the layout of it, we were like always trying to, we were always trying

2281
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:04,600
to escape the overprotective, you know, just, you know, like very much like in a movie,

2282
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:10,160
like the Katie Holmes's first daughter trying to escape from the prying eyes of the Secret

2283
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,160
Service.

2284
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:16,240
I swore you were going to go with Amanda Bynes and Frankie Muniz trying to escape movie executive

2285
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:17,240
Paul Giovanni.

2286
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,240
Big fat liar.

2287
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:21,240
By hiding in the costume department?

2288
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:25,240
And then having a wild romp through all the costumes and props?

2289
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,240
Oh yeah, yeah.

2290
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,800
That's another, that's a big theme park movie.

2291
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:30,320
Well we can, maybe that's a Patreon.

2292
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:31,320
That sounds like a Patreon.

2293
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:34,280
Patreon commentary on Big Fat Liar.

2294
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:39,000
So anyways, I like, I had to like, when the elevator doors opened, I like broke off and

2295
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,440
like we got away from her mom and I could see her like getting lost in the crowd and

2296
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,440
pushed back.

2297
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:45,440
Oh wow.

2298
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:49,200
And we're getting steps ahead and we're, you know, now we're like seven doom buggies ahead

2299
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,200
of her.

2300
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,200
Oh wow.

2301
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,200
So we can do, we can do whatever we want.

2302
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,200
Oh yeah, she was furious.

2303
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,200
Absolutely.

2304
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:58,400
They're going to enjoy this attraction on their own.

2305
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:06,840
He might lightly graze her boob over the shirt without me watching.

2306
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,320
That pale wet boy, who knows what he'll do.

2307
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:10,320
He's wet?

2308
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,320
Yeah, he's sweating.

2309
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:12,320
It's just constantly damp.

2310
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:16,240
I see, you're not incorrect.

2311
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:20,760
Also keep in mind, I had, if you've seen a photograph of me, I had hair twice as long.

2312
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:23,760
Oh yeah, I think I've seen something.

2313
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:27,040
So that's my, that's my, hey, worked out great.

2314
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:31,960
I was the happiest haunt in the whole mansion.

2315
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:34,240
I will be back with my death certificate.

2316
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:37,400
Did you just run to get back in the line then after that?

2317
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:38,400
That would have been smart.

2318
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,160
No, then we were, we were good beyond that.

2319
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,160
Yeah, no cell phones.

2320
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,120
You don't want to get too lost, you know.

2321
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:45,120
No there, yeah.

2322
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:50,000
So I'm not sure we all had, so this, we're talking like 2001 or so, which is two.

2323
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,620
Anyway, so we've obviously covered all the important stuff.

2324
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:55,280
My make out adventures in the year 2001.

2325
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,320
We've talked about first daughter and Wilco.

2326
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:03,400
What, what can we, how can we wrap this up for this, this chapter?

2327
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:07,880
I mean, we've, I actually, I think the entire origins episode makes a lot of sense.

2328
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:08,880
Yeah.

2329
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,320
I feel good about it, but what's, what's anything big that we haven't, oh, you were starting

2330
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:13,600
to say the, the doom buggies.

2331
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:18,280
Yeah, the doom buggies as they call them in the Haunted Mansion.

2332
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:20,520
A couple of interesting things about that.

2333
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:28,040
One, the only time doom buggies is said in the Haunted Mansion is when they come to a

2334
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:34,840
stop and that recording that says like, you know, spirits have, you know, interrupted

2335
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:35,840
your journey.

2336
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:38,360
Please stay in your doom buggy.

2337
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,360
That is Exitencio.

2338
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,360
Oh.

2339
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:41,360
Saying it.

2340
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,360
No kidding.

2341
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:43,360
I know that.

2342
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,360
That is his voice.

2343
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:46,360
Who's also the skull in Pirates.

2344
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:47,840
Pirates, yeah.

2345
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,840
Yeah.

2346
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:49,840
Wow.

2347
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,200
And the same guy does the safety announcement, wrote the song, wrote the dialogue.

2348
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,200
Yeah.

2349
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,880
And here, look, we've talked about this.

2350
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,840
We've talked about everything, any and everything, except for the, besides these specific stuff

2351
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:08,120
in the ride, but the dialogue, indelible, famous people quoted with the exact intonation.

2352
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:13,000
So many lines from this are so quotable that it was all from this same guy.

2353
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,680
That's a, that's totally bonkers and I'm sure we'll get into our, our favorite stuff, you

2354
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,840
know, next year.

2355
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:24,080
But that's also a, I remember that being one of the like early, oh, let me try to impress

2356
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:28,360
people I'm taking here with my little, you know, my odd little knowledge.

2357
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:30,800
You know, these are called Omni Movers.

2358
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:36,320
I remember knowing maybe Erin was, the early sign Erin was the one is that she, I told

2359
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,720
her about Omni Movers and she thought that was neat.

2360
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,640
Other people, I'm like, this is called an Omni Mover.

2361
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:43,640
What?

2362
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:44,640
Who cares?

2363
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:46,760
Could the difference have been she just smiled and was like, cool.

2364
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:49,960
When you say neat or was she literally like, oh, that's very cool.

2365
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:50,960
Like you believed it.

2366
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,960
Oh yeah, no, I should know.

2367
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:55,440
Oh no, a very, a very earnest smile and the word neat.

2368
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,760
And she still likes to use the word Omni Move.

2369
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,440
She likes to point out Omni Movers to others.

2370
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,800
It's a match made and that's right.

2371
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,800
And Omni Mover Evan.

2372
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,520
I mean, I all, I, I wasn't saying she wasn't actually interested.

2373
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:10,680
I was just saying that the difference between some, the average person when they hear Omni

2374
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:14,280
Mover, they, their eyes glaze over and they go, who cares a shit?

2375
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:17,000
And then just the difference between somebody going, oh, cool.

2376
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Yeah.

2377
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,480
Seems like, yeah, that's a, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2378
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:20,480
That's all though.

2379
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,480
That's all.

2380
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:22,480
You're the one marrying me now.

2381
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,080
Uh, yeah, absolutely agree.

2382
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,520
I, uh, is a mild interest in what you're saying.

2383
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:30,800
But the ride system is like, uh, and there's not a ton of rides that are this, but you

2384
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,240
wish there were more rides that were this that you never, that it's, it's one, it's

2385
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,520
not individual cars.

2386
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:40,840
It is a trail of cars that is never stopping.

2387
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:41,840
That's continuous.

2388
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:42,840
And that's what Little Mermaid is.

2389
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:46,960
And that's how they solved the, that was one of the big problems with the walkthrough ideas

2390
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:49,080
is you weren't going to get enough people through.

2391
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:53,240
The Omni Mover pretty much doubled how many people could get through this thing.

2392
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:57,440
There really should be in each theme park, there should be like three versions of this.

2393
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:58,440
Yeah.

2394
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,840
Like there should be, like, cause People Mover is a version of this, especially the one in

2395
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,840
Florida.

2396
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,040
I think Florida moves more, whatever.

2397
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,040
It's a bigger, longer thing.

2398
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,040
Yeah, yeah.

2399
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,040
You can eat up more people.

2400
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,040
Yeah.

2401
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:12,640
Like People Mover version of this is your, like, Inner Space was, uh, what was it?

2402
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:14,440
Little Mermaid, sorry.

2403
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:16,720
Um, it, because like it's practical.

2404
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:22,520
It wasn't like a dream flight or isn't, um, I guess you'd call it's not the pod, but Buzz

2405
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:23,520
Lightyear is.

2406
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,520
That's true.

2407
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,520
Yes.

2408
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,520
Good point.

2409
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:27,520
Yeah.

2410
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,520
Yeah.

2411
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:29,520
Dream flight and if you would have wings.

2412
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:30,520
Yeah.

2413
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:31,520
There's just something you can literally get people off the ground.

2414
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,960
And the Imagineers liked it because they could control the speed and what your perspective

2415
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,920
would be and what you were going to look at.

2416
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:43,360
Oh, I think the idea when you see the early discussion of this ride that we can make you,

2417
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,440
we can spin you around that you can go backwards.

2418
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,440
Right.

2419
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:51,200
That, that I think is a mind blowing, uh, mechanism that they got to put in.

2420
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,200
Yeah.

2421
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,200
Yeah.

2422
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:55,560
The amount of control they suddenly added really is like one of the most ingenious,

2423
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,200
uh, uh, very, and it seems like it would have been a version of this is that third ride

2424
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,200
that got canceled from Star Wars land.

2425
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,040
Is that, is that you think that's the deal?

2426
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:08,240
They supposedly it was like a people mover Bantha ride and Bantha is a big like furry

2427
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:09,240
creature.

2428
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,800
I don't know how they're going to make it look like you were on the back of it, but

2429
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,400
like it was just a people mover type thing where it would just be a continuous and you

2430
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,440
just zip around above the whole land.

2431
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,440
Yeah.

2432
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:23,360
And colloquially called people eaters because they take so many people out of the park.

2433
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,000
Um, this was interesting to me.

2434
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,040
This is concept art of the doom buggies going down the portrait hallway.

2435
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,040
Ah, oh yeah.

2436
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:32,040
Yeah.

2437
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:33,040
Yeah.

2438
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:39,240
Isn't some of that stuff or the bus or something saved for when you're on the ride in Disney

2439
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:42,840
world, I think some of the, some of the elements are different.

2440
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:43,840
Like it's not in the line.

2441
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,840
It's on the ride.

2442
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:47,720
The line is a little shorter when you're, when you get off the elevator.

2443
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,720
Uh huh.

2444
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,720
Uh huh.

2445
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:53,080
It's like, it's, it's a different line and it's not, it's, it's a better line after the

2446
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,520
elevator to the ride in Disneyland.

2447
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,520
Okay.

2448
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:57,520
Oh, interesting.

2449
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:00,400
But some of it's yeah, some of it's on the wall a little bit.

2450
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:04,480
This is stuff we will, uh, we'll get into also the differences between, which I thought

2451
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:07,960
there were just a few, but as you go through this book that we've pulled all, a lot of

2452
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:12,120
this info from, there are a ton of different, a ton of differences between all of these

2453
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:13,120
places.

2454
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:17,560
And you'll be hearing this in a few years when president Michael Avenatti, uh, made

2455
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,480
every mistake, right?

2456
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:22,840
President con man the second, uh, is in charge.

2457
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,840
He's our con man though.

2458
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,840
He's our con man.

2459
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:31,120
I've gotten more on board the Avenatti train day by day only because I've lost all hope,

2460
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,680
but I don't, do I think he'd be a good president?

2461
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:33,840
Of course not.

2462
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:38,440
But we need a guy who can like, you know, who would like smack Trump in a debate.

2463
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:43,260
Well, look, Scott, the residents of river city were very fond of professor Harold Hill

2464
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:48,560
when he rolled into town to save them from the ills of billiards.

2465
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:49,560
He was a nice man.

2466
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:50,560
The boys band.

2467
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:51,560
He seemed nice.

2468
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:52,560
Yeah.

2469
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,560
It kept being nice, right?

2470
01:58:54,560 --> 01:59:01,800
So, uh, uh, by and large in the end, actually, yes, I've fucked myself with that point because

2471
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,800
everyone likes him at the end.

2472
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:03,800
Uh,

2473
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:06,800
Wile Langley would have been better.

2474
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,800
Oh yeah.

2475
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:10,200
He does actually, yeah, that's a good point.

2476
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:13,960
Um, so I mean, we're at the game.

2477
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,080
We got the climax.

2478
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:16,840
We talked about what Omni movers are.

2479
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,840
Yep.

2480
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:18,840
Um, what else do you see that?

2481
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:22,760
What's a good, like, how do we lead when what and, and how do we, so I guess we'll pick

2482
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,480
it up next time in a year.

2483
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,480
Yeah, any year.

2484
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:29,960
By going room by room because I truly, and I think going room by room, do we even get

2485
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:30,960
to the end of the ride?

2486
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:31,960
No.

2487
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:32,960
I don't know.

2488
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:33,960
I don't know.

2489
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:35,880
Cause there's so much just in each of, there's so much personality.

2490
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,640
There's so many, uh, wonderful gags.

2491
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:42,960
I have a lot of thoughts about the employees working and I like, we all have, I think our

2492
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,960
own taste of what we would do if we were working the haunted mansion.

2493
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,920
That's sort of a dream.

2494
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:49,920
Everybody kind of fantasizes.

2495
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,640
What everyone's favorite stretching portrait is.

2496
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:52,640
Yeah.

2497
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:55,520
What people fantasize about working, I think haunted, whenever you go, Hey, if you worked

2498
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:56,800
at Disney, where would you want to work?

2499
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,200
I think most people say haunted mansion.

2500
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:03,440
That seems like a num, probably the number one or, or I guess tower of terror.

2501
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,360
Usually people like to say, Oh, I could be like creepy to people.

2502
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:10,360
Something where you get to do stuff or like the late great movie ride.

2503
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,360
You know?

2504
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,360
Yeah, sure.

2505
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:13,360
Yeah.

2506
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,360
What are you talking about?

2507
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:15,360
Yeah.

2508
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,360
Interact with people.

2509
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:19,360
Oh, after all that bunks, he materializes.

2510
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,360
Yeah.

2511
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:21,360
I'm bad.

2512
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,360
I'm not a actor scene.

2513
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:24,360
Yeah.

2514
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:26,480
I, I guess you're right.

2515
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:30,080
I, I'd have to think about that where I would want to, did you guys, I didn't know until

2516
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:34,600
there's a little tease of stuff to talk about that there were live actors briefly in the

2517
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,600
80s.

2518
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:36,600
Yes.

2519
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:37,600
That's crazy.

2520
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:38,600
Uh huh.

2521
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:39,600
People hated it.

2522
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:40,600
Scared me as a kid.

2523
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:43,440
I would love it because I'm a big one fan.

2524
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,040
Jersey Shore haunted houses.

2525
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:49,120
Like I would go to the person working the line like, excuse me, are there real people

2526
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,120
in this or is it just the robots?

2527
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:55,720
And if they said there's real people that jumped out, I'd be like, no, no, thank you.

2528
02:00:55,720 --> 02:01:02,680
I think it's somehow might be worse than haunts because at least haunts you are, you are moving

2529
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:03,680
and you can look away.

2530
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:06,280
Like if you're in a little car, you're trapped.

2531
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:10,240
I mean, we've all been on this ride so many times, but I thought now, since I know that

2532
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:13,080
fact, I've thought about it being on the ride.

2533
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:17,280
So especially going down the hallway, I'm like, what would be a really, what would scare

2534
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,880
the shit out of me right now?

2535
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,160
I guess if somebody actually came through the door, like very fast, if somebody's popped

2536
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:25,560
through the door, you lose your mind.

2537
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:26,560
Uh huh.

2538
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,800
But yeah, if you, if a person was just like, I'll ask you some questions about record

2539
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,800
Ralph, Ralph breaks the internet.

2540
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,800
You have a couple of minutes to answer a survey.

2541
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:39,680
Uh, if like the, if the omnimover like turns around and there's just a person like, like

2542
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:42,080
staring at you, like it, right.

2543
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:46,000
I guess maybe after I'm trying to think like maybe when you enter the attic, cause the

2544
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
attic is so claustrophobic.

2545
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Oh yeah.

2546
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Yeah.

2547
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Yeah.

2548
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Yeah.

2549
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Yeah.

2550
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Like stuff like that.

2551
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,960
I've thought about, I think if Leo, if Leota shattered and like hopped into my car and

2552
02:01:55,960 --> 02:02:04,000
not the others, only my, like her, like her decrepit, uh, like, you know, her, her, her

2553
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:10,600
pale hardened, uh, uh, rigor mortis face, uh, uh, you know, and there's like little squishes

2554
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:13,480
with each pounce and then she's in my, yeah.

2555
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:14,480
Yeah.

2556
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:19,360
If it shattered like a fish bowl and Leota was in my lap, I'd be, uh, that's the worst

2557
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,360
thing I could think of.

2558
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:22,160
That's a rolly crump idea.

2559
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:23,160
That's a weird idea.

2560
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:26,160
I think it's a little weird, but I think it's good.

2561
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:28,560
I think you can make it work with, with some finessing.

2562
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:32,280
Um, but it's not, yeah, it's scary, but it's hard to development.

2563
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:34,640
Uh, and we'll, yeah, we'll keep perfecting.

2564
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:40,120
Let's see if, let's see if we were, let's say a crump crump coats and Davis, who of

2565
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:43,760
the three of us, like which of us are, which guy?

2566
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:44,760
Hmm.

2567
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:45,920
Uh, who do you think?

2568
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:46,920
Who's the weirdest?

2569
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:49,720
We're all a little, uh, uh, I don't know.

2570
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:53,200
I mean, we're all parts of all of them, but for the fun exercise, we should, we all go

2571
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,200
a little mad sometimes.

2572
02:02:54,200 --> 02:03:00,880
I'm obviously a little, I'm Claude now because of how much I like scary stuff.

2573
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:01,960
So I'm Claude.

2574
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:06,160
I'm, I'm crump because of how I trip out on psychedelic wine.

2575
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:07,160
That's true.

2576
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,160
And Jason is clearly Mark Davis.

2577
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,160
I guess I'm Davis.

2578
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,160
He's a whimsical, yeah.

2579
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:14,640
He's a whimsical, a lot of character, very specific character.

2580
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:17,520
I mean, certainly the most memorable of the three of us, you know?

2581
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,360
Oh, well, I'll take that compliment.

2582
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,840
Put that in my pocket for later.

2583
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,080
You were designed, if we could have, you know, I really don't want to call for fan art, but

2584
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:32,000
if you could draw a picture of Mark Davis creating Jason on an animation desk, that

2585
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,360
would be really great.

2586
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:36,640
Remember it all began with a Jason.

2587
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:39,880
Um, I like that.

2588
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,600
With a nice call for fan.

2589
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,600
Okay.

2590
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:48,960
Well, then I think I can say you survived a haunt cast, the fright in which the ride

2591
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,760
in question was not discussed.

2592
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:55,160
But I hope you found all of this information interesting.

2593
02:03:55,160 --> 02:04:00,280
I think it's all crucial backstory and crucial development for what, what became the iconic

2594
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:03,720
ride that we will get into next year.

2595
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:04,720
Yes.

2596
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:09,320
We hope you'll meet us at the wrought iron gates this Halloween season next October.

2597
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,320
Yes.

2598
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:15,520
And if you're only listening, if you, if you only intend on listening to our haunted mansion

2599
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:21,200
episodes, then I would say don't hurry back because you got a while to wait.

2600
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:26,440
Uh, we were going to be waiting as long as people waited for the actual ride to be built

2601
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:27,440
in Disneyland.

2602
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:28,440
That's a good idea.

2603
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:29,440
We get it done.

2604
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,240
Can we get it done in six years?

2605
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,240
We'll try.

2606
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:33,240
We'll try.

2607
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:34,240
We'll do our best.

2608
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:36,080
Uh, we'll, we'll give it a go.

2609
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:39,400
So for me, for a, a guess what?

2610
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:45,240
Uh, next week we're going to be covering a, a, a, a spooky theme park attraction that

2611
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:52,080
I think is every bit as iconic clean and perfect as the haunted mansion.

2612
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:53,680
So come back to find out what that is.

2613
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:56,760
We're as positive about it as we have about this.

2614
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:04,160
You will find us glowing about all of the incredible writing and detail in this attraction.

2615
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:06,840
In the meantime, please go to patreon.com.

2616
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,240
It's how you can do it right now.

2617
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:13,440
It's so exciting to say we will waste two more hours of your time.

2618
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:20,160
Totally different attraction for building full of attraction for only five little dollars

2619
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:21,160
a month.

2620
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:23,960
You can barely get a McDonald's meal at that.

2621
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:29,160
You can, if you use the app like I do, I can get a $2 to $3 meal and it's actually very

2622
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:30,160
satisfying.

2623
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:32,160
But like you barely get a comic book for that price nowadays.

2624
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:35,280
And we'll give you hours of entertainment.

2625
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:40,920
And you know what's funny is that like the haunted mansion today, the first Patreon topic

2626
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:46,240
Disney quest is a building with no windows and no doors.

2627
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:47,240
Very good point.

2628
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,240
Very good point.

2629
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,240
It's all together.

2630
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:52,240
So yeah, head to patreon.com slash podcast.

2631
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:53,240
All right.

2632
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:54,240
I'm so excited.

2633
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:57,480
It's open and thanks people for encouraging us to do this and thanks in advance for checking

2634
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:59,800
it out if you're going to do it.

2635
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:06,160
And for our regular hijinks, head to Twitter at podcast the right, Instagram podcast the

2636
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:11,920
right, our podcast the right Facebook group, podcast the right at gmail.com.

2637
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:18,480
And which again, I'll keep saying it, send us ideas, stuff that you want to see as Patreon

2638
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:25,320
content or any kind of content or write us letters or complain about the very slow speed,

2639
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:29,920
almost Omni mover like pace at which we're moving through the haunted mansion.

2640
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:30,920
Yes.

2641
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:33,320
Well, you've survived haunt cast the right.

2642
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,320
I did say that already.

2643
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:36,320
Hurry back.

2644
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:41,600
I think this is the second time you forgot that we said it already.

2645
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,600
Or Scott said it already.

2646
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,600
I honestly this time I did not.

2647
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:44,600
You zoned out.

2648
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:45,600
That's okay.

2649
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:48,160
Well, I just wanted to do the hurry back voice.

2650
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:53,960
See you over on the second gate.

2651
