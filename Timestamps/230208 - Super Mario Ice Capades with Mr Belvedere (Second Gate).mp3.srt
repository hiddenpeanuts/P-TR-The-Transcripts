1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,560
Well, welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate on Ice.

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined for these capades by Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hi.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,680
Yes, I'm here for the capades.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,800
This was a question I had right away and when catching up on these materials is a capade

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,800
something and what I have determined is it is not anything.

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,520
Yeah, there's no, was this invented for this event?

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
I think so.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, I think what it is is a play on escapades, but it is ice capades.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,640
Oh, wow, I didn't actually think about that.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
We've heard this phrase our whole life, but I never really meditated on it.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,200
I just heard capades and thought it was like trials or championships.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,560
I thought like, well, you must be really good if you make it into a capade.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,320
Well, because ice capades are, they were much older than I thought they were.

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,120
And they ended much longer ago than I thought.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,760
They went out of business.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,880
I thought, oh, the ice capades must still be around.

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Surely not the case.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,960
Like, yeah, in about 30 years.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,080
I also thought that for sure the ice capades were still going on.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Mid 90s.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Yeah, gone.

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,200
We'll get into, yeah, it seems like you guys did too, maybe I found some interesting ice

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,440
capades stuff, but what we're focusing on here and delightfully so is, well, let me

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,660
read how this is where the topic came from.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,140
This is a Twitter suggestion from Nick Topolos, who I met at Tamoshanter, correct?

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,140
Right, Nick?

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
That was you.

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,140
OK, well, hi, if that's the case.

33
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,900
Anyway, with Super Nintendo Land and the Mario Brothers movie coming out in 2023, I can think

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:16,020
of no more topical thing to cover than the Super Mario Brothers at the ice capades 1989

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,900
featuring Jason Bateman, Alyssa Milano and Mr. Belvedere as Bowser.

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,340
Great thing to see in the replies.

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,540
Done and done.

38
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,420
Don't have to twist our arms.

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,260
So delighted by this and as a prerequisite for this episode, you may want to watch this

40
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
clip.

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,020
It's a lot less daunting than other things that we might send you to.

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,460
This is, I believe, a seven minute sequence.

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,140
So give it a watch.

44
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,140
We're back.

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,300
We're in the range, I think, of Letterman Green Goblin in terms of like a nice, nice,

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,900
easy runtime.

47
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,140
And similarly, well, hey, it's like a really stupid thing with a really good actor, I guess.

48
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,460
I'm going to think a good actor.

49
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,340
Yeah, a big green guy, like kind of for children.

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,900
It's very dumb and fun.

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,900
I love this thing.

52
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,140
Yeah, it's right up our alley.

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,620
It's another one of those things where you're like, I don't know how we didn't know about

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,340
this our whole lives.

55
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
I didn't at least.

56
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,060
I don't know if you've ever seen it before.

57
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
I did.

58
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,060
I and I might have mentioned it on the show with this context that I remember this being

59
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,420
a big video, at least in my estimation, kind of right when Internet video was starting

60
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,900
to happen, like even pre YouTube.

61
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,300
I remember I go to something called I film that would collect kind of odd bullshit like

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,600
we probably all had what ours was before it all got codified into YouTube.

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,640
But I remember being either way, it was while I was in college and I was so thrilled like,

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,880
oh my God, I've been waiting for this forever for like receptacles for just bizarre.

65
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,120
Like I just always wanted to be on the receiving end of like found footage and weird like this

66
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,000
was on a tape and which seems so quaint now.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,640
Now we just have everything we always want right at our disposal.

68
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,440
But this was the thing that made me go.

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,760
Yes, we are heading into a great era.

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
I've never heard of this.

71
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,040
I can watch this on my computer.

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,240
Cracking your knuckles, booting up your real player.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,920
Yeah, probably an insane file format that no one remembers.

74
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,480
I used to you try to figure out different play like movie players to play certain files

75
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
that you had.

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,440
You like downloaded trailers when you downloaded the spy who shagged me teaser.

77
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Right.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:35,200
I remember in college learning about like I did not fully know what MP3s were.

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,280
And someone's like, oh, here's how you import all your music off CDs into Windows Media

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,360
Player.

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,200
And by the time I finally did that a week later, someone's like, oh, iTunes is available

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,160
on PCs now.

83
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:59,800
But I didn't know enough about like control all select files, drag to iTunes.

84
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,280
So I re imported them all, like just destroyed a Gateway PC probably by doubling up on like

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
MP3 files.

86
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,480
Oh, and I have two thoughts here.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,600
We'll get back to your thought, but I have to quick quick.

88
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
OK, wait.

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
So you didn't have a period where you were using like Winamp and MP3s for like a couple

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,560
years before iTunes came into play?

91
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Uh, no.

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Scott?

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Yeah, you were the Winamp era.

95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Uh huh.

96
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,280
I know you're on the galaxies and you're right.

97
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,320
Yeah, it was that kind of awkward time before it got corporate.

98
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,480
It was like senior year in high school for me where it was like, did you know you can

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,200
download every song you want for free?

100
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,960
And you're like, doesn't seem legal, but like there was a Wild West.

101
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,600
No one knew exactly what was going on.

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
And running through sick visualizers.

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,400
All of the visualizers were the greatest.

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,080
I would just come home from school.

105
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,600
I would play like Cake the Distance on Winamp and I would visualize it and I'd get an instant

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,240
messenger and talk for three hours to people I just saw at school.

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,640
Yeah, those are the different.

108
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,720
You know you're a 2000s kid.

109
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Yeah.

110
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,400
People are getting all the feels from what I just said right now.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I would know.

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,600
My routine was come home, watch an hour of Kids in the Hall on Comedy Central, which

113
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,480
I did for years.

114
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Even senior year?

115
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,200
Uh, it might have stopped by that point.

116
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
OK.

117
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Yeah, even senior year.

118
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I would get on instant messenger eventually.

119
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:31,360
I don't think I had a full account until like 10th grade or so.

120
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,720
But I would come home and I would read comic book news and message boards and stuff.

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,080
Senior year?

122
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
For years.

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
OK.

124
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,840
Why are you holding him to the fire on senior year?

125
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm just wondering, because what he's saying seems like it would be more of a freshman

126
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,520
or sophomore year.

127
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
I don't know why that is.

128
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,760
Freshman year, we had no internet in the house.

129
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,040
And then senior year, I remember helping my dad boot up the...

130
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,400
There were those crucial years.

131
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,920
We got internet like in eighth, my eighth, when I was eighth grade, I think.

132
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,880
And then like kids came over and they like downloaded a naked picture from my computer

133
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,880
and I was like not looking because I didn't want to get in trouble.

134
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
No.

135
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Yeah.

136
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
You turned away from the screen.

137
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,800
I believe I literally turned away from the screen.

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,640
It might have been like a Pamela Anderson in Playboy picture and I wouldn't look at

139
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,160
it because I was...

140
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,080
Are they trying to get you to and you won't turn around?

141
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
I think so.

142
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
But it's your computer?

143
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Yeah, downstairs.

144
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Yeah.

145
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,480
So then are you like, guys, you have to get this out of here.

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Whatever...

147
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I don't remember...

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,160
Whatever system you have to run, we have to defrag the whole thing.

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
Well, that's funny.

150
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,280
I probably was protesting, but my friend had that happen basically where like his mother

151
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,760
searched the computer and he called me one day and he was like so despondent.

152
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,800
He's like, they found out what I was looking at.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
This was a couple of years later.

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,880
And then he like walked over to my house and I remember him just like head down like he

155
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,360
had been like chastised by his mother.

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,240
Can I look at boobs here?

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,480
Can I boot up the stuff website?

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
It's interesting.

159
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
The old internet is...

160
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,040
I've fond memories of it mostly.

161
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Except for...

163
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
But except for the...

164
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
The day of the nudity.

165
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,720
Except for the like airbrushed Pamela Anderson Playboy photo from 1992.

166
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Not what her body was.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,800
It took an hour to load in my eighth grade.

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,920
And I was like, get this off here, you guys.

169
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,760
To get to this specifically, and I do love...

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,220
What a great excuse to talk about this thing because it is...

171
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,920
This is the month of Super Nintendo and we may have been already, listeners might have

172
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,800
been already or you're about to go.

173
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,760
But here we get to talk about maybe the first iteration of a Mario themed experience that

174
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,400
you could go to a place and experience.

175
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,280
I could be wrong, but in ads for the Ice Capades, they are pretty specific about this is exclusive

176
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,080
for the first time anywhere.

177
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,320
Mario and Luigi Live.

178
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,480
So without this, we don't get to the big universal version that we have so many years later.

179
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
That's true.

180
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
This is the baby.

181
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
This is the birth of it, I guess.

182
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:24,720
So this, the full context here, this is a sequence from a much longer special that I

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
think...

185
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Oh, wait, is it ABC?

186
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
I might be...

187
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,200
I'm not sure about the network, but either way, the special is called the Ice Capades

188
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
with Jason Bateman and Alyssa Milano.

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,560
It aired on December 7th, 1989, a date which will live in infamy.

190
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:48,800
And I had only seen this clip in context or out of context, not knowing the full thing.

191
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,560
But three weeks ago, I had no idea that this entire special was uploaded to YouTube.

192
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Oh, right.

193
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,160
And I watched the whole thing the other night.

194
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,200
It's a delight.

195
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,800
If you want to go deep diving on this, I would recommend the entire thing because you get

196
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,480
pretty good ice skating, really good physical comedy routines.

197
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,400
I guess I had no memory of what the Ice Capades were or what else there was or what's happening

198
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
while they're changing the big sets.

199
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,240
But there's this whole routine with a conductor who's like...

200
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,760
It's a really spastic physical comedy routine where he's attached to the ground so he's

201
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,800
able to just swing back and forth and flail wildly.

202
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,520
And then there's a cop who interrupts a couple's skate that's really good.

203
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
The whole special is fun.

204
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,080
I'll bring up a couple of other things from it.

205
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,520
But obviously it doesn't reach the heights of this Mario sequence, which is so fun.

206
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,800
Did you guys ever go to this, to what we've talked about?

207
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Such as on ice.

208
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,360
But no, you don't recall going to the Ice Capades.

209
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Never.

210
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,680
We went to Disney on Ice and Sesame Street Live.

211
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,200
Those were the big...

212
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
But that wasn't on ice.

213
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
That was on floor.

214
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
That was on floor.

215
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,880
Sesame Street on floor.

216
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I would catch...

217
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
We would watch them on TV every now and then.

218
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,800
It was kind of hard to escape figure skating in the 90s in terms of TV programming.

219
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
It was very popular.

220
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Sure.

221
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
A lot of various...

222
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,240
It became, besides the Olympics and the popularity of that, of the Winter Olympics, there were

223
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
a lot of Disney specials.

224
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,520
There were Disney fantasy on ice type specials and stuff like that.

225
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,800
Was this the 50th?

226
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
That's what I was watching.

227
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
Which year is that?

228
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,680
It seems to have aired as a special for at least three years in a row.

229
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,760
I think the next year might have been...

230
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,960
They might have actually saved the 50th branding for that.

231
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,800
But I am wondering if we need to go further diving into the Ice Capades.

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,480
That's immediately what I thought.

233
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,080
I watched The Simpsons.

234
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
The Simpsons family.

235
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Big Stuff Simpsons.

236
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
That's the next year.

237
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
The Simpsons.

238
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Yeah.

239
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
The big Simpsons are walking around.

240
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
It's incredible.

241
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,400
The stuff Tomer trying to do, the choking Bart gag is very...

242
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,200
There's a lot of funny stuff on it.

243
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Yeah.

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,320
Choking Bart physicalized in an arena with commentary from host Peter Scolari.

245
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Peter Scolari.

246
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
That's the one I was watching.

247
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,200
Host Peter Scolari.

248
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,800
And he does a couple things in it.

249
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,520
That's branded 50th anniversary.

250
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Yeah.

251
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,280
That one's more the proper 50th.

252
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,320
The year before that, I didn't watch much of this one, but hosted by Kirk Cameron featuring

253
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,200
appearances from Rita Moreno, the Jets, the Smurfs, and the California Raisins.

254
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,720
So Mario might just be the tip of the iceberg in terms of bizarre branding that happened

255
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,160
at the Ice Capades, which is part of its whole history because we've talked about it before.

256
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,920
I forgot this little bit of history that Disneyland, when it opened, would not have had costumed

257
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,880
characters of Mickey and Minnie and everybody except that they borrowed them from the Ice

258
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Capades.

259
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,760
They realized that need right before opening, thus resulting in these bizarre chopped up

260
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,520
face versions of the characters.

261
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,240
So that skaters could see.

262
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Yeah.

263
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,160
Oh, that's why they're so huge and why the sight lines are...

264
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,320
Why do they have big triangles out of the peripheral vision?

265
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Right.

266
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
It wasn't...

267
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
They weren't like wounds.

268
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Yeah.

269
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
See?

270
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Yeah.

271
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,520
It looks like they had like moles removed due to sun damage.

272
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Mousetrap, I always fall for it.

273
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,520
It's just cheese laying out and I always fall for it.

274
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
No matter how many times.

275
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
No matter how many times.

276
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
You're smart, Mickey.

277
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,840
I have six holes in my head.

278
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,280
On the 50th anniversary, when I...

279
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,240
It feels like we could do a whole podcast, like a year long podcast on the Ice Capades,

280
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
maybe.

281
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Maybe not a year, but like six months.

282
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Six months, yeah.

283
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,640
But it definitely was like, oh yeah, okay, wow, this is all this shit that we want to

284
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
talk about.

285
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,960
It's great when you find areas that keep us going, all right, we found more oil.

286
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
You get a little juice.

287
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,800
You get a little juice.

288
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,680
And on the 50th, they're going through their lineup of people and I'm mixing up clips too,

289
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,200
because there's one with the Flintstones.

290
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Did you see that?

291
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,320
Flintstones doing some sort of like tap, like one singular sensation type of a number where

292
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
you're like...

293
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
There is my night.

294
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,200
Like why is this in the show?

295
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,680
Yogi Bears and that up here.

296
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,520
But I think it's the 50th where they're going through the list of people and then they go

297
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,280
featuring like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Dave and Joey.

298
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,200
And there's two clowns and I go, ooh, who are Dave and Joey?

299
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,880
And then if you go through it and you're watching and Peter Scalari explains that there were

300
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,600
two legends of the Ice Capades, two other clown legends, Bitty and Batty, and that Dave

301
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,600
and Joey are the kids of Bitty and Batty.

302
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
So Dave and Joey...

303
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,640
Second generation ice clowns?

304
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Ice clowns.

305
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,840
You search them, you can't find it.

306
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,560
Like immediately if you search them, it doesn't come up.

307
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,560
So they're not particularly famous unless I just was searching the wrong thing.

308
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
But...

309
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,600
Well, these specials take a lot of time to explain stuff to you.

310
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,960
From what I could tell off the Kirk Cameron one and this one, the whole thing, the device

311
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,440
in this one is Jason Bateman explaining everything to Alyssa Milano.

312
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,920
Mansplaining you might say.

313
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,120
For some reason, Alyssa Milano does not know anything about the Ice Capades and he knows

314
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
every single performance.

315
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Like, you don't know them?

316
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
You got to know them.

317
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
And you don't know Nintendo?

318
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
All right, here's what it is.

319
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
There's King Koopa.

320
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
He's called himself what?

321
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
The Video Prince?

322
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
The Video Prince.

323
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
You haven't played since then?

324
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
No, I haven't.

325
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
He's called himself what?

326
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
The Video Prince?

327
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
The Video Prince.

328
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
You haven't played since you played with the Video Prince?

329
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Really strange.

330
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Yeah, he barely talks.

331
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,120
But I guess just to say, I think like maybe the reason that these specials are this way

332
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,120
that they're so explainy is because no one outside of this organization knows any of

333
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
this.

334
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
We better spoon feed it.

335
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,120
Kirk Cameron really talked to everybody like they're in third grade.

336
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
So yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

337
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,880
But yeah, I was like, oh, there's a whole world here of like, yes, second generation

338
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,120
clown skaters, hobo, like specifically, maybe hobo clown skaters.

339
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Oh, well, that's a big little tramp Charlie Chaplin derived like hobo skaters.

340
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Yikes.

341
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Oh, my God.

342
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,120
And we have to go to like, there's got to be a Hall of Fame.

343
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,120
There's got to be a clown Hall of Fame, right?

344
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Some secondary city secondary market talking about is the boat that the guy who owned

345
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Bozo before David Arquette bought him, claimed he was in the Clown Hall of Fame, claiming

346
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
he was the first Bozo when he was not.

347
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,120
And then he was removed from the Clown Hall of Fame when they realized that the error

348
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
and there was a big controversy.

349
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,120
There was not only you immediately answered Jason's question.

350
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Yes, Jason, there is a Clown Hall of Fame and there's been it's been.

351
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
There's a fraudulent one as well.

352
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,120
It's like when we the when we talked about carnivals and such and there's like there

353
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,120
is a Carnival History Museum like in Florida about carnival.

354
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
There's a Hall of Fame for a lot of things.

355
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Yeah.

356
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,120
And most of them are like a closet in someone's house.

357
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,120
There's not it's not like there's not a Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of Fame type like building

358
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
for the Clown Hall of Fame.

359
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
I don't think.

360
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Who knows?

361
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Unless we're underselling it.

362
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Maybe people can tell us the Clown Hall of Fame is spectacular.

363
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Yeah, I don't think there's like a Jan Wenner of clowns that is like in kind of in charge

364
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
of it.

365
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,120
And it's been so great our whole lives to hear all about Jan Wenner of these fascinating

366
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,120
these the the Titans of Rock, the Irving Azov's who is cooler than these names that we hear

367
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
about for and then it cuts to the guy.

368
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,120
He's just a little angry guy who only talks about business.

369
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
But he has another generation, right?

370
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Isn't there another one?

371
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Is there a son Wenner like the Clown children?

372
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
I don't know.

373
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Oh, I don't know.

374
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Is there a young one?

375
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Another Azov.

376
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Yeah.

377
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
I don't know.

378
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Jan Wenner child.

379
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Is he a skater?

380
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Nice skater?

381
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,120
No, I just mean it's continuing.

382
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Oh, yeah.

383
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
There's India Rose Wenner.

384
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
There's Theodore Simon Wenner.

385
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,120
Alex Alexander Jan Wenner and Gus Wenner.

386
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Yeah, we have two more too.

387
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,120
The Wenner Nepo babies, the Clown Ice Capades Nepo babies.

388
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I was about to say we have not used the phrase Nepo babies yet on the podcast and yet with

389
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,120
our discussion of guys, it is certainly a related notion.

390
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Like, but you can't have guys without running into a couple of Nepo babies.

391
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
That's true.

392
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Yeah.

393
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
And Jason's right.

394
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Dave and Joey are Nepo babies.

395
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Dave and Joey, the Hobo Clowns from the Ice Capades are Nepo babies.

396
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
That was just...

397
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Sorry.

398
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
That all played out.

399
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
It's gonna burst your bubble.

400
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Yeah.

401
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
The Nepo baby discussion.

402
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
They had a leg up.

403
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
They had a leg up.

404
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
That was just a crazy like end of year.

405
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Like, oh, Christmas is coming.

406
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Let's squeeze in one more discourse.

407
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Let's rile everybody up.

408
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,120
It's like when you eat at a nice restaurant and they bring you a little cookie or little

409
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
like candies afterwards.

410
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Ooh, more.

411
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
A seize mint.

412
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Yeah, a seize mint.

413
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
Exactly.

414
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah.

415
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,120
You made me forget or you may recall, I'm sorry, that when you said there's a Yogi Bear

416
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
thing, I forgot it made me laugh so hard when we were watching this the other night that

417
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,120
we found an ad for the Ice Capades is coming to Montreal.

418
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:45,120
So it's all in French and they're mentioning who's going to be there like from Hanna Barbera.

419
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,120
And then the phrase that they mentioned the Flintstones, but then they throw in Yogi Orse,

420
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
which is bear in French.

421
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,120
I had to remind myself, Yogi Orse.

422
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120
They say it's so mean.

423
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
The scariest.

424
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,120
If I yelled that at my son, he would cry.

425
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Yogi Orse.

426
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
If I need to punish him for any reason, that's the punishment.

427
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Just yell that.

428
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,120
The local commercial, the commercials that are often embedded in some of this stuff are

429
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
really that's where the gold is.

430
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
I mean, I don't even think we even got to it in the Discovery Zone, but one of the Discovery

431
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Zone commercials had a tag at the end of like the local card of like new Discovery Zone

432
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
open in Las Vegas.

433
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Come meet Zbop and Ronald McDonald.

434
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
And it's like, oh man, I wish there was footage of that.

435
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Ronald and Zbop.

436
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,120
When they were all part of the McDonald's family.

437
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Well, actually, and speaking of that, here's the one other thing, didn't it?

438
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,120
This is like all if if as if I needed to fully prove that we need to do more Ice Capades.

439
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Here's the oh and one more thing.

440
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,120
In 1973, there was an Ice Capades sketch called The Golden Hamburger Caper.

441
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Oh, I missed this.

442
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Starring the McDonald's gang.

443
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,120
There was a McDonald's on ice in the early 70s.

444
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
The Golden Hamburger Caper.

445
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,120
The hamburgers were golden or the caper is golden.

446
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Well, the arches are golden for sure.

447
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Oh, right. That's why.

448
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Wow, there was were they like the full on like Croft ripoff look?

449
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
I think so.

450
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Yeah, I found a couple of pictures.

451
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
That's kind of the vibe.

452
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Wow.

453
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
OK, well, clearly more ice capades to do.

454
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:34,120
But for now, we focus on I think I guess we will determine if they ever topped this moment.

455
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,120
It's a very high bar.

456
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,120
This this Mario sequence.

457
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
This is so delightful.

458
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Where to begin?

459
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,120
We could just kind of go in order, I guess, and introduce these people as they come.

460
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:57,120
As we were saying, there's Jason Bateman is has has a lot to get through to Alyssa Milano, who's clueless about all of it.

461
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Yeah, I would say, though, that this is this even with that, that this is a more chipper Jason Bateman than I am typically used to.

462
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,120
It's kind of weird seeing him be earnest and smiley.

463
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Yeah, no, there's there's none of the the the now his brand snark.

464
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Right, right. I mean, you can see the hint of it.

465
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
You can see the early version of it here.

466
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
He's wanting to shake off the child star.

467
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah, he's a little sarcastic and a little condescending, but it's not to the point.

468
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,120
He knows like this is my bag.

469
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,120
This is what it's going to be my meal ticket.

470
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Twenty five years later.

471
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Who was on who's the boss around this time?

472
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Right. And what was his?

473
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Well, he's in the Ricky Schroeder one.

474
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Right. So it was Silver Spoons.

475
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,120
But then another one called the Hogan family.

476
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Yeah, because it was a one with Valerie Harper.

477
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Right. And then she left.

478
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
There was going to tell you that I believe more than I know.

479
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Am I am I mixing up my Mike's wheelhouse, Valerie Harper, Hogan family.

480
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Am I crazy?

481
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Now, people are yelling, of course, at their podcasting device.

482
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,120
And I think in this case, they are not.

483
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,120
I think nobody I think no one has the history of the Hogan family.

484
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Yeah, I believe I am correct that Valerie Harper left the Hogan family after the first season.

485
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Well, it's incredible then that he was able to still perform and do a good job in this special given the immense drama on the Hogan family.

486
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Yes. And I think maybe was she replaced by Sandy Duncan?

487
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Oh, Scott's why does Sandy Duncan never go away?

488
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:39,120
God, she just circles like the crows that are circling the record right now.

489
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Anyway, it's the two of them and they are they're in pretty like Dawson, 80s sweaters.

490
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:56,120
I don't always love to call that out, but both like it's a great like dull brown one and then a great like reveal some of the shoulder one.

491
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,120
So they're in prime 1989.

492
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:11,120
And in this particular moment, they've gone backstage and I'm not sure why, but there's a bunch of youths playing just Nintendo generically.

493
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Jason Bateman, you don't know Nintendo.

494
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
You got to look at.

495
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Come on. You got to try Nintendo.

496
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Does he say, you know, I don't believe it.

497
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Nintendo was the things I don't believe it.

498
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Nintendo.

499
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Yeah, I could not see, by the way, a Nintendo entertainment system anywhere in this shot.

500
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Just the TV.

501
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Maybe not.

502
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Oh, yeah, that's possible.

503
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Is that am I crazy?

504
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
I'll double check that.

505
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
That sounds correct.

506
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Well, I think in general, the understanding of what is happening with Nintendo on the part of the writers is a little not.

507
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
I think I think there's some fuzziness.

508
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I would say they might not have been as into it or as knowledgeable.

509
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Yeah.

510
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Yeah.

511
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Because then we get an explanation of the stakes of Mario and it is this.

512
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
OK.

513
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
OK. We are in.

514
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Yes.

515
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm wrong. It's in the very left back of the frame.

516
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,120
It's kind of obscured by people and bodies and stuff.

517
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
OK. So Nintendo is reflected.

518
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
The video Prince was right on that one.

519
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
He explains we are in the mushroom.

520
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:26,120
We're in the Mushroom Kingdom and we have to rent rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser, the dastardly king of the Koopas.

521
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Now you see those things in our way right there.

522
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Those are the Koopa Troopas, the evil minions of Bowser.

523
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,120
And at that exact second that he says that there are no Koopa Troopas on screen.

524
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,120
It is definitely Goombas.

525
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
And he and he says, and now and somehow we have to get around them.

526
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Which is really that's the big challenge.

527
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,120
If you aren't a Mario fan, the big challenge is how do you possibly get around?

528
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Somehow you have to get around the Koopa Troopas.

529
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Right.

530
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I don't know what method you guys use.

531
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
I would just I never found one.

532
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,120
They were the first one killed me and I never played.

533
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Yeah.

534
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I never made it past Mario one one.

535
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Yeah.

536
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Turned it right off.

537
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Yep.

538
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Right. Well, not my head and I accept the consequences.

539
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Went back to my Bible.

540
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,120
It's the real recreation.

541
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,120
So then but then things go awry.

542
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,120
And I think I have the clip timed up for this.

543
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Let's let's meet the villain of the piece as the characters do because it's kind of a wobble on the screen.

544
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,120
This is not your ordinary game of Nintendo.

545
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Oh, no. Oh, no.

546
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
It's a computer virus.

547
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,120
It will release all the evil forces stored up in the computer.

548
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
We know how evil they can be.

549
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Who could have done such a dastardly thing?

550
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Koopa.

551
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Koopa.

552
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Hey, man, that looks like Mr. Belvedere.

553
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Don't you adore chaos?

554
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
No.

555
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Isn't the company divine?

556
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
No.

557
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Anyway, that's the I mean, what a I think this would be fun no matter who was Bowser,

558
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,120
but how spectacular that it's Mr. Belvedere of all people.

559
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Awesome.

560
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Yeah. Does he say isn't cacophony divine?

561
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Yeah, I believe so.

562
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Is that really is that a sentence that I guess sounds like that's the character of Bowser.

563
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Right. He's oh, me.

564
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Oh, my.

565
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,120
He's Dr. Smith from Lost in Space.

566
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Really?

567
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Same same character.

568
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
It's so good.

569
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Yeah.

570
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
I'm trying to think. Yeah.

571
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Like put. Yeah.

572
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Around this time, who else?

573
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
I mean, anybody like John Ritter did it.

574
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Tony Danza was King Koopa.

575
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
That would be good, too.

576
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Yeah, yeah, sure.

577
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Yeah.

578
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
With this makeup on and.

579
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Inadvertently forward thinking.

580
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Who was talking in 1989 about getting computer virus on their entertainment on their Nintendo entertainment system?

581
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Yeah, that's true.

582
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Sure, it's much easier to now with every video game system having to be connected to the Internet at all times.

583
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Well, it doesn't have to be.

584
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
Oh, OK. Yeah, but it can be.

585
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Yeah. I mean, most are most are constantly on online, but you can turn it off.

586
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Not Jason's Jason's Jason's techno paranoid.

587
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
When's the last time?

588
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
PlayStation 2.

589
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Whoa, Scott.

590
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
We you.

591
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
OK, Scott.

592
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
More recent than Jason.

593
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Yeah.

594
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah.

595
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Yeah.

596
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
You missed you missed out on Winamp.

597
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
You missed out on.

598
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Yeah, Jason is like 10 years behind every technology trend.

599
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Yeah.

600
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,120
I well, so it's shining a light on issues.

601
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
And then we get to see Mr.

602
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Belvedere, the great Christopher Hewitt, who maybe it has to be addressed as probably most famous today for the story of he crushed his balls.

603
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Yeah.

604
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
I'm sad on them.

605
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Do you know the do you know the real story of this or do you like we could talk about where like what supposedly was.

606
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Yeah.

607
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
But then I looked up the the truth.

608
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
I don't think I do.

609
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,120
I know a little bit because Patrick Monahan, Patty Mo on Twitter regularly brings up.

610
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Remember the time Mr.

611
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Belvedere sat on his balls and they had to shut down production for.

612
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Oh, good.

613
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I'm glad he keeps it in the consciousness.

614
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
So this yeah, the story here.

615
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Supposedly it was that he was late for a table read and everybody's annoyed that he's late.

616
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,120
And then he comes in as if it hadn't happened with a briefcase even goes are everyone.

617
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Hello. Hello.

618
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Good to see you.

619
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Ah, another episode awaits.

620
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,120
What side jinx will the famous Mr.

621
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Belvedere get you?

622
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,120
And then that's how I always visualize.

623
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Yeah. Yeah.

624
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
And then that is the end of that table read.

625
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:06,120
But there's actually there's a whole story here that Mel magazine got into in a really fun article because the problem here is that this story comes from the book gasping for airtime written by Jay Moore.

626
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,120
And this is a story supposedly told to him by Adam Sandler.

627
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
When Adam Sandler was doing a guest shot on Mr.

628
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Belvedere.

629
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Right.

630
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Problem is no such thing ever happened.

631
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,120
And this is elsewhere in a book that is mostly him complaining about people of color getting on instead of him.

632
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Oh, great.

633
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
And it's oh, it's a spectacular book.

634
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,120
And that how he was Jay Moore's back was against the wall.

635
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:39,120
And there was nothing he could do except steal someone's standup routine and transcribe it into a sketch, which aired.

636
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
This happened.

637
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Wow.

638
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,120
What later became a studio 60 plot line really did.

639
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,120
And it was Jay Moore and the whole book is like, but what was I supposed to do?

640
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,120
There was no other read the book or you read.

641
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,120
I've read the book gasping for airtime.

642
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
But what year was that out?

643
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
I don't know.

644
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
A while ago.

645
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Did you read it because you were like, these are just an SNL guy and you were interested in?

646
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Yeah, I think so.

647
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,120
I was like, you know, he's never specifically bothered me.

648
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I would like to know if I should be specifically bothered by J.

649
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Moore.

650
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:17,120
And you got an answer is now I as anyone who reads the book would be, you end up specifically bothered by Jay Moore.

651
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Anyway, so story is a lie.

652
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
So what's the actual deal?

653
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Well, comedian Doug Benson eventually outs himself as the actual source of the story.

654
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Wow.

655
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:34,120
But even that there's still a couple links in the chain because he lived with Rob Stone, who was the oldest son on Mr.

656
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
Belvedere.

657
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
OK.

658
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,120
And Rob Stone comes home one day and says, guess what?

659
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
There's no show this week.

660
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You'll never guess why.

661
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,120
But even then, the story isn't actually that it happened during a table read.

662
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
And it's almost maybe even a little more fun.

663
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,120
There was a Reddit AMA with somebody named Jay Abramowitz, who was a writer for Mr.

664
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Belvedere at the time.

665
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
And he went on the record and said, no, no, no.

666
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
What happened was Mr.

667
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Belvedere was in the Hollywood Christmas parade.

668
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:12,120
And that's one of those parades where everybody's in a convertible and sitting up kind of on the body of the car and the car stopped unexpectedly.

669
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Oh, no.

670
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,120
He fell down in such a way that his balls were in peril.

671
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Oh, poor Mr.

672
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Belvedere.

673
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Yeah, that really makes it not.

674
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:30,120
I mean, that's one of those, you know, as with the Fabio story, which where they're trying to throw Fabio under the rug as if his big, brutish face crushes geese left and right.

675
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,120
This, I think, was an unfair weight situation where, like, well, he's so large, you see, that he could.

676
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,120
But I don't think he can't help that the car.

677
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Yeah, it was an accident.

678
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Yeah.

679
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
I mean, it's look, I feel bad for him either way.

681
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
But the car, that's not his fault.

682
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
Yeah, yeah.

683
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,120
He was in a car accident, basically.

684
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,120
But anyway, then he came to work and still tried to carry on.

685
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,120
But the pain was too much and they sent everybody home.

686
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
So there were a few steps of this.

687
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:09,120
When it's crazy that now we're talking about this on a podcast and there was a whole article about it because how it all started was there was a meeting in the Belvedere offices and somebody comes in and says, OK, don't tell anyone.

688
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:25,120
But got to us knowing how the listeners knowing someone on the other side of the room is literally picking up a rotary phone before they're done the story and calling during the meeting.

689
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
During the meeting, he's Morse code tapping the message.

690
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Mr. Belvedere crushed his balls.

691
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,120
What do you mean, head of Hopper died years ago?

692
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Does she have a nepo baby daughter I could speak to or son if there's a son?

693
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
It's the nearest hopper in the industry.

694
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Was there like a national inquirer at the time where it was like Belvedere sits on balls or like balls crushed in parade?

695
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Like, was there something like that at the time?

696
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,120
I mean, I don't think anyone knew.

697
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
I think it took this J.

698
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Moore book with the incorrect details for it.

699
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
So I guess I thank him for I guess the story.

700
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Wow.

701
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Anyway, then another detail of this is that the some of the male writers on the staff spent the rest of the day trying to reproduce his accident.

702
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,120
We all failed and were therefore skeptical of his explanation of the cause of the testicular discomfort.

703
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,120
Try it yourself and please let me know if you succeed.

704
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,120
OK, so they were thinking maybe he was lying about what happened.

705
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
Yeah.

706
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
So maybe we don't know the story.

707
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
The truth is still out there.

708
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
We'll never know.

709
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
The man passed away 20 years ago at this point.

710
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Yeah, 2001.

711
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:36,120
And unless he sent some final memo where he's like said a lot of beautiful thoughts about what it was, you know, what he learned from his life.

712
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Oh, and by the way, that little ball thing.

713
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:46,120
Maybe it's like a Mark Twain situation where in like his estate will release it in 100 years after he's dead.

714
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
And then we'll like we won't probably know.

715
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,120
But the future, our great grandchildren will know what happened to Belvedere's balls.

716
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
It's in the safe.

717
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,120
It's in the Salinger safe where it's like, oh yeah, there's some more novels and stories.

718
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,120
It's possible.

719
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Or like, yeah, like if you are.

720
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
Hello, Mr.

721
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Binney's like doing a video.

722
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,120
I'd like to let you know there's a story that's been going around about my balls.

723
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,120
I want to tell you exactly what really happened.

724
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,120
It is my hope that by this point, my acting legacy is why I'm primarily known.

725
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,120
However, I suspect that it is made that my legacy is mainly the ball thing.

726
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,120
I want to set the record straight.

727
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,120
I was messing around with the elf puppet on the other soundstage.

728
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,120
And my greatest regrets.

729
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Never playing key Richard the third and messing around with that elf puppet and destroying my testicles.

730
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
I was just trying to warm them with the puppet.

731
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
I was not anything weird.

732
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Is the situation that the elf puppet somehow like clamped down on his hands?

733
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Uh, here's what I was doing it.

734
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
That might be the case.

735
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
But my here's what I'm picturing.

736
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,120
He put his balls in the place you put your hand on elf just to see.

737
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Well, that's ridiculous.

738
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Well, you think it's more you put his balls in else mouth.

739
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:12,120
I think he put his hand in the hand and put his hand in his hand.

740
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,120
The elf sucked his balls.

741
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,120
And he didn't realize I think he thought he would be more restrained, but it actually probably gave him normal range of motion.

742
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
He just like just yeah, over.

743
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Yeah, over extended.

744
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Elf puppet pulverizes balls.

745
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Where else are you?

746
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,120
I maybe side with Jason here because where else are you going to get the snap?

747
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
You're right.

748
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,120
I didn't think it too far.

749
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
I didn't think it far enough.

750
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
And you were right.

751
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,120
That's what you were right to get us on the elf territory.

752
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
This we know is true.

753
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,120
It's just a matter of details at this point.

754
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,120
So yeah, maybe that's it.

755
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,120
And he's gotten himself medical attention sooner, but he seems like a classically trained actor.

756
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:00,120
So likely kept up the illusion of having a conversation with elf as they began the intimacy.

757
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,120
He's having to do his voice and elf's voice.

758
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Right.

759
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
That makes sense too.

760
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Yeah.

761
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
So the paramedics were confused when they got there.

762
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
How are you feeling at this point, elf?

763
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Remember Mr. Shumway?

764
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:21,120
It does prop into my mind every now.

765
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Like when I finally saw Nope and the sitcom subplot going wrong in there, I was just like, oh, no, this is weird.

766
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:34,120
Oh, no, this is worse than the time Mr. Belvedere sat on his balls.

767
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
It's horrific.

768
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
If that's what it had been.

769
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
That's the dark flashback.

770
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,120
You're seeing the kid watching something horrible hiding under a table.

771
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:50,120
What's it going to be?

772
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Well, well, we got down to the bottom of that.

773
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,120
Now we know we found one more real story and it is out.

774
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:10,120
He puts his hand in the puppet and then says to no one, ah, I'll find Mr. Belvedere time to create the ultimate 80s mashup.

775
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:16,120
There's a show called The Goldbergs will relish the idea of this in 30 years.

776
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Only in the Goldberg writers wildest gene.

777
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,120
He could see the future.

778
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:32,120
So now we leave basically, you know, when there's that virus interruption and Bowser as played by Mr.

779
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,120
Belvedere appears, it stays on the screen for a little while.

780
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,120
But then we go full frame and then there's one more.

781
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:46,120
There's the big gasp moment in this is when the full Nintendo or full Mario set is revealed.

782
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
It's like, oh, my God, this rules.

783
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Wow. If you were at this and you were a kid at this time, you got to see this full perfect recreation of like a Mario one specifically.

784
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Mario. Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

785
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,120
That would have been nuts. And it's like Mario back then and Mario now.

786
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,120
I don't know if there's anything more universally loved.

787
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Everything is divisive. Everybody.

788
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,120
People are mad about the Beatles being the best band.

789
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,120
You see some of those takes were like, these are overrated, blah, blah, blah.

790
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,120
I have never seen anybody say, by the way, you know, Mario is bad.

791
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I don't like Mario. Yeah.

792
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,120
So I mean, even back then, every kid was obsessed with Mario basically.

793
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:30,120
So I'm that I'm making two points, I guess, just back then everybody was obsessed with it and you'd be, oh, my God, it's Mario.

794
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
This is crazy.

795
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Seeing it in the real world.

796
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,120
That's true. That the Super Nintendo world gets to open without like, but why is it only based on the new games?

797
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
Right. Yeah.

798
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
And by the way, if it was no problem.

799
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Yes, yes.

800
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Mario Galaxy land. Everybody be like, holy hell, yeah.

801
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,120
They're really across the board.

802
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Everyone be like, this rule.

803
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,120
It's crazy how that's happened.

804
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
They've never completely missed.

806
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,120
I'm sure you have people have their favorite games that are better than others.

807
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,120
But like you could literally it could be Mario Sunshine land, which I feel like is a more divisive Mario game on GameCube.

808
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,120
People still be like, this is awesome.

809
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Yeah, I like that.

810
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,120
I like the cart of sunshine is what I remember.

811
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,120
The cart iteration was I thought was fun.

812
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,120
Yeah, I love sunshine.

813
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
I thought it was so much fun.

814
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Was that the one with the backpack with the like fire hose?

815
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,120
You were like cleaning up spills the whole time.

816
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,120
I did play that a lot on like a friend system.

817
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Yeah, I don't know.

818
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
A lot of fun with it.

819
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:37,120
Yeah, I think the other I think Odyssey and Galaxy are better as far as newer games, even though sometimes probably 20 years old at this point.

820
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,120
But still, yeah, any any of them, I think people would go nuts for maybe not Virtual Boy.

821
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
That's true.

822
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,120
If they had built a new land at Universal Studios and it was all black and red.

823
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,120
If that was our Halloween Horror Nights overlaid.

824
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,120
Oh, you fixed it.

825
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,120
I mean, that'd be so scary.

826
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Yeah, virtual boy.

827
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
What was the Mario?

828
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Was it a Wario game for Virtual Boy?

829
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
I don't remember.

830
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,120
I know there was like Mario tennis where a ball flies at you.

831
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
There was.

832
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Yeah, but I think Wario.

833
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
There was a launch title.

834
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,120
I think I don't think it was a debt like a regular.

835
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,120
It was Virtual Boy.

836
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,120
There might not have been a proper land.

837
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
Oh, OK.

838
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,120
OK.

839
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Maybe the most like harm I've ever actively placed myself in was regularly hanging out in the Sears video game section, which is in the middle of the like young adult and boys close to the game.

840
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,120
I know where the video game section is in the Sears.

841
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,120
And that's where my mom, she was just like, I'm going to look around the Sears.

842
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Just hang out.

843
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,120
You can hang out here if you want.

844
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
Or you can come with me.

845
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
It's like we're going to hang out with the video game.

846
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Of course.

847
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:52,120
But the demo Virtual Boy that God knows how many people a day stuck their grubby, disgusting, kid facing.

848
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
Yeah.

849
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Like it is amazing.

850
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,120
I did not get like smallpox or walking pneumonia or something.

851
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,120
I wanted that goddamn Virtual Boy so bad and I never got it.

852
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Yeah.

853
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,120
I don't think you're missing out on much.

854
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
I don't think so either.

855
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,120
I think you're going to have now kids had a lot of headaches from it.

856
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Oh, yeah.

857
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,120
But at the time I was like this is virtual reality.

858
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
This is Jason.

859
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:24,120
If you had ended up with like a perfect line of acne just in like goggle press on shape like exactly on that spot, I would I ended up with plenty of Scott.

860
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,120
Thank you very much.

861
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Distributed evenly all over the face.

862
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,120
It stuck around to like 2728.

863
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:37,120
So I but I I don't think I wanted one.

864
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,120
But I was intrigued by it.

865
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Just similarly intrigued by like the Game Boy printer, even though I knew like this is the stupidest thing.

866
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,120
This is not going to last.

867
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,120
And also like these the the stuff you have to buy for it.

868
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,120
I'm like, they're not going to make this forever.

869
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,120
What would you print on the Game Boy?

870
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Like little Pete?

871
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Well, there was Game Boy camera and there was Game Boy.

872
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Usually you're printing these like very pixelated.

873
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
I never had that either thing.

874
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,120
I had a Game Boy color, but I was fascinated by them.

875
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Yeah, but I was.

876
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Yeah, I mean, everybody.

877
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:24,120
It's another words like everybody's basically a Nintendo fan because you probably at least had one console growing up or pretty incredible that Universal found and paid for a property that is one of the only.

878
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:35,120
The keys on Earth, but is this way the approval Mario's approval rating has been 100 for 30 plus years like and yeah, and most of the other Nintendo stuff, too.

879
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:42,120
But well, and that's also like when you look at like here, here I will show you a frame from this ice capades thing.

880
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,120
And it is very, you know, like when you look at what once the characters show up, they have big creepy eyes.

881
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,120
The brothers are rendered pretty bad.

882
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
There's there's things you could complain about about this.

883
00:43:52,120 --> 00:44:00,120
But basically we're looking at a big colorful set of the castle and there's coins and the Green Hills and everybody's really, really happy.

884
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,120
And this was in 1989 and now it's 2023 and the land is opening up and everybody's really, really happy.

885
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,120
And it doesn't look that different than this.

886
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,120
No, it's very similar.

887
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
Yeah, no, it's true.

888
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:16,120
It's three dimensional, but like they never had to like radically like, boy, we were getting Mario wrong back then.

889
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,120
No, this is I mean, the only place they got it so wrong was the movie.

890
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:27,120
The original movie, which is I felt like maybe it was something designed to destroy little kids brains in hindsight.

891
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:35,120
I don't know. Maybe we maybe I don't know if we do an episode eventually about that, but I bought it for four dollars and I haven't watched it since I saw it in the theater.

892
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,120
And I'm very curious.

893
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,120
I think it's all opening weekend or something.

894
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,120
Oh, absolutely. I was so excited about it because everyone had Mario fever.

895
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,120
But yeah, I that that gets it perfect.

896
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Basically, like it looks like the video game that you showed me.

897
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,120
I'm saying and you'll and there'll be complaints about the movie, the forthcoming animated movie, I'm sure.

898
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:10,120
But among the complaints will not be it is a very cold, austere cyberpunk Blade Runner light made by incompetent music video directors.

899
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,120
It's so weird.

900
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:26,120
They're very nothing, basically nothing resembling the video game other than I guess the overalls and where there's like there's characters in it who I have learned were like, no, that was Yoshi or that was, oh yeah, the dinosaur.

901
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Yeah, there's this or like this to like goons in it who are supposed to be some of the Koopalings.

902
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,120
Right. Right. I didn't know that until a year ago.

903
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:42,120
Like that's bad news. If your movie doesn't convey who the characters are until decades later.

904
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,120
My memory is to those overalls don't come until really late in the movie.

905
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:55,120
Yeah. Yeah. But that's something that happens even now where it's like they never call an Athaway Catwoman in the third Christopher Nolan Batman.

906
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,120
It's called Catwoman.

907
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:03,120
The Joseph Gordon Levitt is Robin, but they call him like a great perfect and he is Robin.

908
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:18,120
Right. But they don't say it. And that's I feel like that still happens where like for some reason people are like hung up on like some of these directors Nolan or the weird husband and wife who never worked again after Super Mario.

909
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Well, they're the same weird thing where they don't like to say the name of the character. This is based on the similar.

910
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:33,120
I kind of that's the thing I liked about the Robert Pattinson one where they they kind of just played everything straight.

911
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Like they got away with a lot of Batman specifics. Yeah, sure.

912
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:45,120
I that's a whole we've sidetracked. I know I only I'm only being dismissive because I like to talk about that with you for 25 more minutes.

913
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,120
I can go inside if you want to do a side.

914
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,120
We have this is that we have a limited amount of time here.

915
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,120
Third Patreon level.

916
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,120
Thanks.

917
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,120
It would rather be inside than here.

918
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:18,120
Here is now you we definitely get character names here because here now is the roll call of so if you aren't looking at this and you should have looked at this if you're going to listen to this episode but Bowser is Mr Belvedere in like just his head is cut out of kind of a clock

919
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,120
the costume and there's some green paint smeared on pretty badly.

920
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:29,120
But then everybody else is is a full mascot and here you meet them all.

921
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,120
Cooper troopers.

922
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,120
I'm a rather erased the database.

923
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
Your property.

924
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:47,120
Cooper.

925
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,120
It's so great.

926
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,120
And they look awesome.

927
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,120
Yeah, like those costumes look so great.

928
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Be that good either.

929
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,120
Yeah, like it's because yeah, these were I don't know.

930
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,120
This is the first version of any suits these characters ever probably had.

931
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,120
Yeah, and they aren't that far off right.

932
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,120
He's ended up in the parks.

933
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,120
I mean, the eyes are a little perfect.

934
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
Yeah, yeah.

935
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,120
And they look like dumb.

936
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,120
I will say that there's something about the quality of every carry including the Mario Brothers.

937
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,120
They all look really stupid like like yeah that they look bad.

938
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,120
I mean that the characters seem like they're dumb characters.

939
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,120
There's nothing wrong with that.

940
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,120
No, no.

941
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
And this is 89.

942
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,120
Is that right?

943
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,120
That's it because that's the same year that the Super Show starts the Captain Lou show.

944
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,120
So I'm trying to think today.

945
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,120
I wonder if there was ever any use for those costumes on that either.

946
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,120
I mean, presumably.

947
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:51,120
So what we can only assume from this is that these costumes were with the Ice Capades tour and that the only thing that was special only was Mr.

948
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,120
Belvedere, which I wonder what Bowser was for the rest of it if there was a Bowser suit.

949
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:03,120
But you know, if you just saw it on the tour, you didn't get the full experience because Belvedere is.

950
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,120
Oh my God.

951
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
This so good sparkle.

952
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:12,120
I don't remember exactly when the song starts, but I think I have to play a little bit of his song.

953
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
Oh, I love this song.

954
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
Yes.

955
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,120
Ha ha.

956
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,120
Oh, yes.

957
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,120
That's what I kept singing when I was watching it earlier.

958
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,120
Oh, yes.

959
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:54,120
I mean, the thing we have to mention, he goes from standing on the stage to sitting on a little castle mobile in a nice gig, if you can get it, you know, going from standing on.

960
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,120
He does not do any ice skating.

961
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,120
I think the closest he gets to the ice is usual.

962
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,120
Jason has pinpointed something where a performer does not get to sit down.

963
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,120
Does it not have to walk?

964
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,120
To sit and speak sing on a tiny castle mobile.

965
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,120
You don't even have to drive the castle mobile.

966
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,120
Someone else is clearly controlling it.

967
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,120
Somebody might be skating under it.

968
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,120
So there might be two people really hoofing at 10 or 10 children are under it.

969
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,120
Yeah, so he gets a little.

970
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,120
If we can figure it out for a live show that Jason gets to Jason.

971
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,120
Ha ha.

972
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,120
Oh, yes.

973
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Oh, yes.

974
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,120
It's a classic.

975
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:43,120
It's a classic example of early wraps being used for the people who put it together.

976
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,120
Like, I think I know how people make wraps.

977
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:55,120
And then, of course, I don't know what the first time they ever rhymed rude with dude is, but this is probably in the first 10.

978
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
I think.

979
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Pretty perfect.

980
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,120
Just meant for like, yeah, kids under eight.

981
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Yes, such perfect.

982
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:08,120
And it's from that era where like everybody thought that, you know, rap is disco.

983
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,120
Like, let's acknowledge rap during these three years where wraps around.

984
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,120
We only got about two more years, I think.

985
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,120
And then the shit's done.

986
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,120
But where let's let's just acknowledge this whole rap fad.

987
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,120
I'm realizing now, OK, the Bartman rhymes rude and dude, I think.

988
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,120
Probably I would I would put a lot of money on.

989
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,120
Hey, what's happening, dude?

990
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:35,120
I'm the kid who something being rude or something like that's known for being rude, maybe get attitude in there really.

991
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
Yeah.

992
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,120
So I wonder how many times that around that time this was a rhyme that was made.

993
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,120
Yeah. Yeah.

994
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,120
And a very rap type song.

995
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,120
It's just perfect.

996
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,120
I mean, just imagine if we all saw that we would never forget.

997
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,120
Yeah.

998
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,120
And the kids are dumbfounded.

999
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,120
They are all like they're almost.

1000
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,120
They almost don't even look happy.

1001
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:01,120
They are almost are just like, I don't know how to process this much happiness.

1002
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,120
Look at this wide eyed little girl.

1003
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,120
She says she's not even happy.

1004
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,120
She's just like, can all of life be this right?

1005
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,120
Can I always see the Mario gang?

1006
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
I'll say this.

1007
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,120
My daughter, we're trying to keep her not.

1008
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,120
We're trying to keep her away from the screens right now.

1009
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,120
That's what they say you're supposed to do with very, very young children.

1010
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,120
But sometimes you can't help it.

1011
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,120
And she was watching this.

1012
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,120
Oh, good.

1013
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,120
That look on her face.

1014
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,120
I thought this kind of yes, I got to meet your daughter.

1015
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,120
I thought this was like similar age, similar kind of like, huh?

1016
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,120
Yeah.

1017
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,120
Delightful kid bafflement.

1018
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,120
Yeah. So she did get a glimpse of this.

1019
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,120
Oh, geez.

1020
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,120
Did she was she just she didn't cry.

1021
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,120
She didn't smile.

1022
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
Great.

1023
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,120
But she's absorbed it on some level.

1024
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1025
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,120
So this is a lot of fun.

1026
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,120
And then where do we go from here?

1027
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,120
How do we top a rapping British Koopa?

1028
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,120
Then we go to Princess Toadstool.

1029
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:03,120
This is if anyone would like to explain Princess Toadstool's characterization, would you like to explain it?

1030
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,120
OK, it is I think, Scott, you hit the nail on the head when you first described to us.

1031
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,120
It is like old Mae West.

1032
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,120
Right.

1033
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,120
It is for sure.

1034
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,120
There's a she steals a line from Mae West.

1035
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,120
And I forget what line it is, but there's one like it is.

1036
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,120
Come up and see me.

1037
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,120
Come up and see me.

1038
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,120
OK, it's her most famous line.

1039
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,120
OK, so, yeah, they decide that a peach is Mae West.

1040
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,120
She's not peach, by the way.

1041
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
I was going to ask you about this.

1042
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,120
When does the Toadstool peach split happen?

1043
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,120
I feel like in do they start calling her and forgive me now.

1044
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,120
This is something our listeners would know.

1045
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,120
But I think Peach was officially her name in the Mario 64 era.

1046
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,120
OK, she I feel like was always Princess Peach Toadstool.

1047
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,120
She was Princess technically.

1048
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,120
But right.

1049
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,120
Yes, that's sort of a retroactive.

1050
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,120
But she was Princess Toadstool up until when she became Peach.

1051
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
Can you confirm?

1052
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,120
I've already added myself as the video game Luddite.

1053
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,120
But is Bowser and King Koopa?

1054
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,120
Are those the same characters?

1055
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,120
Is that a similar thing?

1056
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,120
A translation thing?

1057
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,120
Yes, this is confusing because he's only Bowser in Jason Bateman's explanation.

1058
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,120
But the rest he is he's King Koopa.

1059
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,120
OK, I knew them both as a kid.

1060
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,120
I knew both these things.

1061
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,120
Sometimes they're called this and sometimes they're called that.

1062
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,120
OK, so the English version of Yoshi Safari released in nineteen eighty three

1063
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,120
contained the first usage of the name Peach in the western world,

1064
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,120
though she was called Princess Toadstool in Wario Land Super Mario Land 3 released in nineteen eighty four.

1065
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,120
So there's a peach mention in ninety three.

1066
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,120
She's back to Princess Toadstool in Wario Land.

1067
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,120
But then I think at that point Mario 64 on she was for sure Peach.

1068
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,120
This was a thing.

1069
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:47,120
This is like I felt embarrassed somewhere at some point where I like people started saying Peach.

1070
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
And I was like, who's that?

1071
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,120
I missed the change.

1072
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,120
So I was in your Luddite shoes.

1073
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,120
I can only assume.

1074
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,120
Is it Anya Teller-Joy is playing?

1075
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,120
I believe so.

1076
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
In the movie.

1077
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,120
I can only assume she's doing the same Mae West voice in this major motion picture.

1078
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
There's only one way.

1079
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,120
Yeah, there's only one way.

1080
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,120
Can I do video game?

1081
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,120
Video game. Did you play Galaxy Mario Galaxy?

1082
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,120
Yes.

1083
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,120
OK.

1084
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,120
Yeah.

1085
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,120
When he's spinning around the planets.

1086
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,120
That's the wee one.

1087
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
Yeah.

1088
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,120
Yes.

1089
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,120
Yeah.

1090
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,120
Like finish.

1091
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,120
That's probably the last Mario game that I fully did.

1092
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
It's awesome.

1093
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,120
I love it.

1094
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
Yeah.

1095
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
Yeah.

1096
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
I don't really know what.

1097
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Here's a little bit of Mae West.

1098
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,120
The virus is on the loose.

1099
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,120
And you know how painful that can be.

1100
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,120
And now that in addition to the voice, the Koopa virus is on the loose and you know how

1101
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,120
painful that can be.

1102
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,120
Yeah.

1103
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,120
Is this not a venereal disease?

1104
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,120
I mean with Mae West who's very look very sexual.

1105
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,120
Very, very what?

1106
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,120
What word?

1107
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,120
Body.

1108
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,120
Body.

1109
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,120
Mae West's whole act was a little bawdy for the time.

1110
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Now you might be saying it seems like contradiction to be talking about bawdiness when you suggested

1111
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,120
earlier on the podcast that Alf had his mouth on Mr. Belvedere's balls.

1112
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
And you'd be right.

1113
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,120
We all contain multitudes.

1114
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,120
Well hang on.

1115
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,120
That isn't body.

1116
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,120
That's fully explicit.

1117
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,120
What you don't like is when things can't decide.

1118
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,120
You don't like PG.

1119
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,120
You're fine with R and NC 17.

1120
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,120
Yeah.

1121
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,120
I like hardcore stuff.

1122
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,120
You would just prefer the lights slowly dim.

1123
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,120
That's true.

1124
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,120
Sexy.

1125
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,120
When you imagine it.

1126
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,120
One foot is off the couch.

1127
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,120
You know, you're a big Hays code guy.

1128
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,120
I like to see a piece of clothing, not underwear, hit the chair.

1129
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,120
Don't show me a bra hitting the chair.

1130
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,120
That's too much.

1131
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,120
Too much.

1132
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,120
They can keep it on over there as far as I'm concerned.

1133
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,120
And no hosiery either.

1134
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,120
That's just as bad.

1135
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,120
Yes.

1136
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,120
That's underwear to me.

1137
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,120
Yes.

1138
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,120
So the Kupa virus is on the loose and I think this is a job for plumbers.

1139
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,120
Oh, Luigi.

1140
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,120
Oh, Mario.

1141
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:07,120
And then they show up and they show up by flying onto the ice.

1142
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,120
This is where I, it's a perfect level of getting things kind of wrong.

1143
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,120
I love the wrong, like why are they flying?

1144
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,120
Don't know.

1145
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,120
Don't care.

1146
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,120
It's so delightful.

1147
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,120
And they look, they are like, they don't look comfortable flying.

1148
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,120
They are kicking and flailing with whoever is in these costumes.

1149
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,120
I used to get off these wires.

1150
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,120
I felt scared for them because they can't see very well.

1151
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
They're in these big heavy suits.

1152
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,120
They got blades on the bottom of their feet and they're being lowered now.

1153
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,120
Yeah.

1154
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Cause if they were trying to mimic the jumping from the game, you would just put one hand up and like one knee up and just freeze that way.

1155
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,120
And they didn't have, yeah.

1156
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:53,120
In the first game, it's only they're underwater and then they have a fire flower upgrade where he would shoot the fireballs, but they're not flying yet either in the first game.

1157
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,120
So it's not from that either.

1158
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,120
So you're right.

1159
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,120
It's probably just the jumping.

1160
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:02,120
I guess that that's how they thought, oh, we'll have them come in from the sky because they can jump high sometimes.

1161
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,120
Well, or they, I mean, don't you sort of start levels by falling into them sometimes, right?

1162
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,120
You know, you go through a pipe and then you just kind of, I guess, yeah, you know, you're right.

1163
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,120
That's true.

1164
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,120
Or do you just always appear?

1165
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,120
No, I think that if you go down a pipe, you can fall through the pipe and land.

1166
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,120
So that's true.

1167
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:23,120
And you spend a lot of time if you end up on a cloud level and then you're that you could fall for a very long time.

1168
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,120
I'm trying to remember.

1169
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Mario 2 has a lot of falling.

1170
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1171
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,120
Like that didn't happen yet.

1172
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,120
So where are they getting this for?

1173
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,120
Yeah.

1174
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,120
So but you're right.

1175
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,120
The pipe, you could go down a pipe and then come out the bottom of the pipe and fall.

1176
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,120
So that's that's if you want to logic your way in, I think that's the way to get it.

1177
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
Mm hmm.

1178
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,120
How they might have gotten there is I don't know.

1179
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,120
Should they fly in?

1180
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
Sounds good.

1181
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,120
Sounds like Mario Brothers to me.

1182
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,120
These might be the worst costumes in the show.

1183
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,120
Pretty rough.

1184
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,120
I'm letting like I think the Goomba and the Koopa Troopa are pretty fun and silly.

1185
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,120
Yeah.

1186
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:00,120
These guys, they have pretty them and Princess have pretty terrifying, huge, glassy eyes.

1187
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,120
Yeah.

1188
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,120
Yeah.

1189
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:13,120
Which is funny because jumping ahead a little later on, there are skaters in overalls, white overalls with red shirts like when you get a fire flower as Mario.

1190
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,120
And they look pretty good.

1191
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,120
They look like better Mario's than these stuffed creations.

1192
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,120
But maybe they you know, maybe they were thinking about playing to the back row.

1193
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,120
Maybe that's the way it is going to look like Mario from from really far away.

1194
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,120
Right.

1195
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,120
The costumes remain in a similar shape for all of these.

1196
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:37,120
I saw some pretty horrifying Smurfs from other years and you saw the Simpsons from the next year.

1197
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,120
They're crazy.

1198
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,120
They're so scary.

1199
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,120
Yeah.

1200
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,120
Maggie is giant.

1201
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,120
She's somehow the biggest one.

1202
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Yes.

1203
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:52,120
And I think Jane and I watched together and she's like, wait, does the baby just fall down and lie on the floor?

1204
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,120
Like, is that a regular Simpsons joke?

1205
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,120
And I was like, um, no, I guess not.

1206
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Every now and then.

1207
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,120
Yeah.

1208
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,120
I think they would do that.

1209
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,120
I think, yeah, because, you know, in the opening, she's on the flat girl belt.

1210
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,120
She flattens out.

1211
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,120
Yeah, I guess.

1212
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,120
This extreme close up of Princess.

1213
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,120
I mean, these eyes are.

1214
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:16,120
This is this is like somebody who's like an overdose amount of pills deep.

1215
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,120
This is somebody like about to see God.

1216
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,120
That looks like the pans labyrinth.

1217
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,120
I saw the hands.

1218
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,120
Yes.

1219
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,120
Yeah.

1220
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,120
Right on.

1221
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:32,120
So she thanks the Mario Brothers for showing up.

1222
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,120
They I swear Mario is the voice of Fred Flintstone.

1223
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,120
I bet it's the same.

1224
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
Oh, yeah.

1225
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,120
I don't have any affirmation of that, but like they sound pretty crazy.

1226
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,120
They kind of do lame jokes a little bit.

1227
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:51,120
But then the main thing, I mean, the best thing that happens is that the the attack

1228
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,120
sequence is initiated by Bowser.

1229
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,120
He sends each minion one by one.

1230
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:03,120
And there's by this point, there's kind of a line of children all in brick cars,

1231
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:09,120
like smaller versions of what Bowser, which is in an ice capades thing they would do.

1232
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,120
It seems like I saw it from different versions that were like you would bring kids on the ice

1233
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,120
and little cars, essentially like little ride vehicles.

1234
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:21,120
Well, Jason would have loved an early like, oh, you got to sit down on the ice.

1235
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,120
Oh, I got to sit down on the ice because I don't think I've ever ice skated.

1236
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:30,120
Every now and then there would be a trip like Boy Scouts or Youth Group.

1237
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:36,120
And they're like, look, you can ice skate or we'll give you twenty dollars and quarters and you can get hot chocolate and go to the arcade.

1238
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,120
And I'm like, well, you've made my decision for me.

1239
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:45,120
I do not trust dull knives on my feet and I do not trust my balance.

1240
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,120
So Tekken it is ice skate.

1241
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,120
Have you done it only like twice?

1242
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,120
I'm horrible at it. I hated the experience.

1243
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:59,120
Bad. My mom forced me in a class with my sister, who is three years younger and other little kids to do a beginners ice skating class.

1244
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:03,120
And I hated it and I felt embarrassed to be there.

1245
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,120
Yeah. And I didn't like it at all.

1246
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,120
And that was the last time a couple I did.

1247
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,120
I don't think it's on the docket for my kid.

1248
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,120
Now, you know, if he finds that skill on his own.

1249
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,120
Great. Her logic.

1250
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,120
Well, you know what? Maybe there was one birthday.

1251
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,120
Her logic was you're going to have ice skating birthday parties.

1252
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,120
You're going to need to know how to do it.

1253
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,120
And I think there was one.

1254
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,120
And that was it. Yeah.

1255
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,120
So but then Lindsay likes to roller skate and she's made me go roller skating in the last five years.

1256
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,120
How'd that go?

1257
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,120
My legs hurt so bad after it.

1258
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,120
Really? I'm tense. I can do it.

1259
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,120
I've never fallen.

1260
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,120
Okay. But we've gone where it's like packed.

1261
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1262
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,120
And it's like a little stressful.

1263
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,120
Yeah. Because I really don't quite know what I'm doing.

1264
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,120
Right. Right.

1265
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,120
And there are people almost people are wiping out constantly also.

1266
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,120
Yeah. And you're like, I don't know how this is legal still.

1267
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,120
Because I'm just going to get like a head injury.

1268
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Yeah. First or second grade, there was a couple skating birthday parties.

1269
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,120
I had a lot of trouble at first and then I really picked it up.

1270
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,120
Are you a roller skating?

1271
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:11,120
Yeah. And then puberty hit me like a ton of bricks and I became a chubby kid.

1272
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:17,120
And it would become like the regular summer community theater like cast party would be at the skating rink.

1273
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,120
Yeah. And that was just like taking my life into my own hands.

1274
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,120
I would try.

1275
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,120
Really?

1276
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,120
I was bad. I just whatever I learned as a kid.

1277
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,120
So you got puberty and you got bad at things.

1278
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,120
Well, I just I was just put on weight.

1279
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:38,120
My center of gravity just just fucking jumped around and I just was not skilled.

1280
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,120
You just got a massive right butt cheek.

1281
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,120
I got a massive right butt cheek.

1282
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,120
All my weights over here.

1283
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,120
I have a very I can't believe I did this.

1284
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,120
I tried to use a urinal with roller skates on once.

1285
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,120
Oh my God.

1286
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,120
I almost gave myself a concussion because I started skating around.

1287
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,120
This is like 11 or 12.

1288
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,120
I don't think I've ever told this story in my life.

1289
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:04,120
It is so clear to me of just like almost like nailing my head on a urinal.

1290
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,120
On the urinal?

1291
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,120
And I caught myself.

1292
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,120
I braked and caught myself.

1293
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,120
And then I was just like grabbing every surface.

1294
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,120
Oh my God.

1295
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,120
Finishing up.

1296
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,120
It's like a Mr. Bean episode.

1297
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,120
It is a very bean.

1298
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,120
I don't know why I didn't take those skates off.

1299
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,120
I don't know why I didn't switch to sneakers.

1300
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,120
Oh my God.

1301
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,120
Wow.

1302
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,120
Yeah.

1303
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,120
I think Erin has a story from somebody.

1304
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:31,120
I might be getting this wrong, but she knows somebody who did roller derby and it happened to her.

1305
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:39,120
It happened to somebody or she saw it happen that there was a scenario of like trying to change clothes while wearing the skates in a bathroom stall slipped.

1306
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,120
Clothes went flying.

1307
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:50,120
She's now she flies all the way out under the bathroom stall, fully nude with other people in the bathroom.

1308
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:55,120
Can you imagine if you're going to the bathroom and that happens?

1309
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,120
That's did it the wrong order.

1310
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,120
Like when changing, take the skates off first.

1311
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,120
And like if you got to be socks on the bathroom floor, so be it.

1312
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,120
You know, so at least you were closed.

1313
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,120
I was.

1314
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,120
I was.

1315
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,120
I was.

1316
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:18,120
I have no idea why I didn't just stop for a second and go change into my shoes or just brave it with socks.

1317
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:28,120
So if you had been at the urinal and you're if this moment could be combined with something about Mary where her zipper is perfectly stuck.

1318
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,120
Oh my God.

1319
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,120
You go flying.

1320
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,120
Somebody opens the door at that moment.

1321
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,120
You go flying out out of the bathroom.

1322
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,120
A bunch of your friends are there.

1323
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,120
And your.

1324
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,120
I get a heavy injury and a Belvedere injury.

1325
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:44,120
Like, oh my God, that could have been all your clothes flew off.

1326
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,120
I don't like clothes.

1327
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,120
And at that moment, my pizza slice was ready.

1328
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,120
It's really insult to injury.

1329
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:03,120
The person delivering it slips and falls also piping hot pizza lands on your exposed penis.

1330
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,120
Yeah.

1331
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,120
Yeah.

1332
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,120
These are all great scenes to reserve great physical comfort.

1333
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,120
Remember our earnest our our new earnest Dougie is this thing.

1334
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,120
Oh, yeah.

1335
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,120
The new physical.

1336
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,120
I can have it.

1337
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,120
Dougie can have it.

1338
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:27,120
If it's gone from my brain, you know, the thing with the Dougie scenes need to be based on real experience.

1339
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,120
Yeah, it's not true and organic.

1340
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,120
It didn't happen to you and it can't be funny.

1341
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,120
Right.

1342
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:36,120
Whoever fell and exposed their penis while on roller skates.

1343
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,120
There's a line though with God.

1344
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,120
There is a line from endearing to like, what is the matter with you?

1345
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,120
Like, what was wrong with you?

1346
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,120
Dougie will find that line.

1347
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,120
Explore.

1348
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,120
He'll dance on that line.

1349
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,120
Oh, yeah.

1350
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,120
Dougie's tripping over that damn line.

1351
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,120
Dougie is really about trauma is really what I think.

1352
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,120
It's really a reprocessing.

1353
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,120
That's why Dougie is important.

1354
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,120
Yeah.

1355
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:09,120
I was starting to say there's a bunch of children and they're all in little boxcars and they are pulled up to like, you know, flank Mario and Luigi.

1356
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,120
Actually, it's just Luigi for a little only.

1357
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,120
Mario does nothing.

1358
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,120
Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,120
Luigi does most of the work.

1360
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,120
You would take care of this.

1361
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,120
Mario rest up for if I'm really needed.

1362
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:28,120
So Luigi basically each minion skates up while kids all kind of jeer.

1363
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:37,120
And they just kind of really gently pull up to an awaiting Luigi who is holding some kind of how would you describe this?

1364
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,120
A cannon.

1365
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Fire cannon.

1366
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Luigi has a fire cannon.

1367
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,120
Pretty big.

1368
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Yeah, pretty big one, too.

1369
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:53,120
These are really simple, like sweet, dumb organisms pull up.

1370
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,120
I forget who's first.

1371
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,120
Maybe it's a good it's a Koopa Troopa Koopa Troopa attack.

1372
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:08,120
It pulls up and then just this little box weapon and then which Luigi fires, which just blows up the characters sky high.

1373
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,120
Just the turn just powder rises them turning turns them into nothing.

1374
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,120
It's so funny.

1375
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,120
They don't do anything Mario related.

1376
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,120
They just have a cannon and they blow them to Kingdom Come.

1377
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
Yeah.

1378
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,120
It's like the Danny Devito.

1379
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:31,120
It's always sunny moment where he's just like, and then I just start blasting up, you know, Luigi does.

1380
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,120
He just fires a cannon at them.

1381
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
It's so abrasive.

1382
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,120
It's a huge pyro effect.

1383
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,120
And so and the kids all cheer so innocently.

1384
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,120
Yeah.

1385
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
Yeah.

1386
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:52,120
After a very violent explosion, very violent to cartoon characters, because I feel like there was a lot of thought and I don't know this, but a lot of thought put into like how Mario and Luigi would defeat.

1387
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:58,120
The bad guys and they bonk on the head and then the characters kind of fly off the screen as a kid.

1388
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:02,120
I don't think it reads like I mean, you say maybe you kill them, but it's a cute.

1389
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,120
It's cute.

1390
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,120
The way they dispose of enemies is mostly cute.

1391
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,120
Yeah, that's true.

1392
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Yeah, this is more abrasive.

1393
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,120
This is exploding them.

1394
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,120
Well, it being physicalized in the real and it's just such a functional.

1395
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:21,120
I think it might be just like because this doesn't look like if this is a black box with a little black tube sticking out of it.

1396
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,120
I think this is just like a smoke machine.

1397
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,120
Yeah, I think that actually is.

1398
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:31,120
And if you look at the first few flame frames before the flames, it's just firing at them.

1399
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,120
Right.

1400
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,120
So some grip had to deal with this.

1401
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,120
I got a smoke machine in the bag.

1402
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:41,120
Could have been like just done like throwing movements and played the sound effects.

1403
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,120
You know, yeah, that's fireball.

1404
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,120
Yeah, that would make.

1405
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,120
That would have made sense.

1406
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,120
But again, yeah, everyone didn't quite know the game.

1407
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,120
No.

1408
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,120
They were missing a few things.

1409
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,120
They may not have gotten to the point where you got the fire flower.

1410
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:02,120
Well, the writer might not have been of a generation where Mario was really in front of them.

1411
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,120
The writer who I can't say it yet.

1412
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,120
I got it in my pocket.

1413
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,120
I'll wait.

1414
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:11,120
Anyway, one note, there's no villain as any attack.

1415
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,120
They just kind of skate up there.

1416
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,120
First Goomba fails.

1417
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,120
This seems like a two goomba job.

1418
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,120
One skates up, does the same thing.

1419
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,120
No alteration of the plan.

1420
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,120
The same thing.

1421
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:30,120
So after all that, you know, the build up from Bowser, it don't mess around with me.

1422
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:36,120
His plan seems to be send to each minion one by one to do nothing.

1423
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,120
And then they are immediately exploded.

1424
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,120
Right.

1425
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,120
It's really great.

1426
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,120
He doesn't alter the plan to as it's clear.

1427
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,120
This is going to happen to all of the characters.

1428
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,120
You think he doesn't wait a moment.

1429
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,120
Let's go back to the trolling board.

1430
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,120
Should I shift given what I've seen?

1431
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,120
No, no.

1432
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,120
Stick with the plan.

1433
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,120
One of them is bound to there is one who has a weapon.

1434
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:06,120
This the hammer brother pulls up just like so flaccidly whips this cloth hammer around one and a half times.

1435
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,120
Yeah.

1436
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,120
Same thing.

1437
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,120
Explosion.

1438
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,120
Boom.

1439
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,120
It's so high.

1440
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,120
Explosion.

1441
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,120
Wow.

1442
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,120
Explode 50 feet into the air.

1443
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,120
There is no doubt.

1444
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,120
Like in the game, there's a doubt that they've died.

1445
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,120
The characters, maybe they just flew away and they're injured.

1446
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
No doubt in my mind.

1447
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,120
These are all dead characters.

1448
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,120
They have been exploded.

1449
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,120
They have died.

1450
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,120
They're passed on in the next life.

1451
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,120
I want them dead, big boy.

1452
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,120
I don't want a burial for any of them.

1453
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,120
Turn them to dust.

1454
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:43,120
That widow won't be able to identify a corpse.

1455
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,120
That's what I want.

1456
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
No grave visiting.

1457
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,120
Not in my view, I think.

1458
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,120
Killing those guys makes me horny.

1459
01:11:52,120 --> 01:12:00,120
So keep making the explosions larger and larger.

1460
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,120
Come up and see a charred corpse sometime.

1461
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,120
See the dust that remains.

1462
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,120
I make furniture out of dead bodies.

1463
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,120
I'm like the psycho guy.

1464
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,120
So then Bowser decides to take matters into his own hands.

1465
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:20,120
Spiny, now is our time to pull up, do the exact same thing.

1466
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,120
This time Mario gets actually in real.

1467
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,120
Now the kids become part of it.

1468
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,120
They all kind of scoot forward.

1469
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,120
Let's give them nowhere to run.

1470
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:35,120
And then Bowser's plan is to kind of look meaner than before, a little bit.

1471
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:41,120
And then they make the worst joke I've ever heard, which is,

1472
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:46,120
King Koopa, whatever, and down.

1473
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,120
King Koopa, you a chicken.

1474
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,120
Get yourself a new chicken Koopa.

1475
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:59,120
I think maybe that line, having been said, it is the time to reveal the writer of the piece.

1476
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,120
I think it's possible someone could guess the writer of the piece.

1477
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,120
I've watched this clip for years and I'm never delighted by who it is.

1478
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:15,120
If I'm building it up this much, the writer of a big stupid thing that's really hacky and all the references are from the 40s.

1479
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,120
Bruce Valanche?

1480
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,120
Who did you guess?

1481
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,120
I guessed George Burns.

1482
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,120
George Burns.

1483
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,120
George Burns is in for higher writing word for the ice campaigns.

1484
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,120
But Valanche.

1485
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,120
He lives for it.

1486
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,120
Of course it's Valanche.

1487
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,120
It makes all the sense in the world it's Valanche.

1488
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:44,120
All the Oscars, the Brady Bunch variety hour, the Star Wars Holiday Special, some of the finest works ever produced.

1489
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,120
But doesn't that especially explain the Mae West of it?

1490
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,120
Why would he?

1491
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:55,120
Because, like, hmm, you've been given this, I've got to write for this video game thing.

1492
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,120
Hmm, well, write what you know.

1493
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,120
I know Mae West.

1494
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:07,120
I've been, well, I've blocked out when we all watched so much of the Brady Bunch variety hour with Eva.

1495
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:13,120
But doesn't it, I guarantee that Florence Henderson had to talk like Mae West at some point.

1496
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
Oh yeah, you would think so.

1497
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,120
I'm sure.

1498
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:21,120
All of the girls, all of the sisters had to talk like Mae West to their brothers.

1499
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,120
Yeah, I mean, positive that happened.

1500
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:28,120
When Bruce Valanche was on Hollywood Squares, did he ever, like, was he, because he was always center square, I believe?

1501
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,120
Would he ever say, like, come up and see me something, like, to a lower square?

1502
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,120
Probably. There had to be a time.

1503
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,120
There is up to be climbed. You have to go up to see him.

1504
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,120
If somebody has, somebody can find that for us, let us know.

1505
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:44,120
Can I ask a question? Is Valanche working? What in the last couple years?

1506
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,120
I don't know.

1507
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,120
Is he still doing stuff? I mean, I feel like yes, but maybe, maybe not.

1508
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,120
Got to be uncredited on some stuff.

1509
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,120
Or credited.

1510
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,120
And I'm sure credited.

1511
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,120
Because the last, yeah, I, of course, I've said this before.

1512
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:00,120
I saw him and it's probably eight years ago already. Seven years ago.

1513
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:05,120
I saw him perform on stage in Pasadena in the Aladdin.

1514
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,120
Oh, he was in that Aladdin play.

1515
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:18,120
He played the widow Twinkie in Aladdin, which I saw with friends of the show, Ryan Perez and Biz Biz.

1516
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,120
We were front row, I think.

1517
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,120
You were front row at this Aladdin show.

1518
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,120
We were front row at the Aladdin show. That's right.

1519
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,120
And there was a bunch.

1520
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,120
The Aladdin's pal, Wishi Washi.

1521
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,120
Wishi Washi was in it. There was a brunch beforehand that we ate.

1522
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,120
I don't think we knew this was a night.

1523
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,120
There was a brunch beforehand.

1524
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:45,120
And before, while we were eating brunch, Ryan Perez looked at his phone, started laughing and said, Peter O'Toole is dead.

1525
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,120
Oh my God.

1526
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,120
I didn't know if that was going to be Osama Bin Laden.

1527
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,120
No, no.

1528
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,120
Peter O'Toole has been compromised to a permanent end.

1529
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:58,120
So I guess I can know what day we saw it because of when Peter O'Toole was dead.

1530
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,120
Wow. Wow.

1531
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:04,120
And it was oh my God, it's nine years ago, December 14th, 2013.

1532
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,120
Wow. Another date that will live in it for me.

1533
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:13,120
I'm really upset to look at this Wikipedia and see that Bruce Willis was on Shark Tank and I can't recall that instantly.

1534
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,120
Okay. But there's no no credits in the last couple of years.

1535
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,120
Less, but he might be slowing down. I don't know.

1536
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,120
He's up there. He's older than my father.

1537
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,120
He's going to run forever.

1538
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,120
So yeah.

1539
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,120
He still hit writer of the Oscars in 2014.

1540
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,120
Wow.

1541
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,120
Yeah. Okay.

1542
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,120
That's pretty.

1543
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,120
So another great piece of work for Mr. Vellanche.

1544
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,120
Of course. Of course.

1545
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,120
God bless him.

1546
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:40,120
This thing has delighted me always so much and it's from the hand of Vellanche.

1547
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:50,120
Anyway, then all the children wave their foam wrenches gently and Bowser explodes in the same way.

1548
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:54,120
The exact same death has been carried out seven times in a row.

1549
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:57,120
And we start coming to an end.

1550
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:03,120
Princess Toadstool gives Mario and Luigi the purple plunger for bravery.

1551
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,120
It's funny, I guess.

1552
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,120
Sure. Yeah.

1553
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:10,120
Like so many of the land jokes, you go, that's funny, I guess.

1554
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,120
Okay. I see what he did there.

1555
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
I see it. I get it. Yeah.

1556
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,120
Yeah. Well, it proves that he looked up a couple.

1557
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,120
He heard plumbers.

1558
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,120
Yeah. Right.

1559
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,120
I will make a plumber joke.

1560
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,120
That's true.

1561
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,120
So a little bit of homework was done.

1562
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,120
A delightful sequence was created and I've loved this thing for so long.

1563
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,120
God bless him for getting it so right.

1564
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,120
They got it visually just right enough.

1565
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,120
Yeah.

1566
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,120
Thematically writing wise, just wrong enough.

1567
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,120
The rap is just wrong enough.

1568
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:40,120
Mr. Belvedere is just fantastic.

1569
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,120
This is a great piece.

1570
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,120
It is a great piece.

1571
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,120
Yes.

1572
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,120
And more people should see it.

1573
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,120
And I guess they will now.

1574
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,120
Bruce Ville Lange credits the head writer on the comic relief,

1575
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:57,120
the Katrina one where Billy Crystal does the jazz man character.

1576
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,120
No, no, no, no.

1577
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,120
In front of that house.

1578
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,120
In front of the house set.

1579
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,120
Oh God.

1580
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,120
Wow.

1581
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,120
Not blackface in that instance, I don't think.

1582
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,120
I don't think so.

1583
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:14,120
But the last time Billy Crystal hosted the Oscars, which Ville Lange worked on,

1584
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,120
he did play Sammy Davis Jr.

1585
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:21,120
So in this century, Billy Crystal did blackface on the Academy Awards

1586
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,120
and everybody went, hooray.

1587
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,120
How many years ago was that?

1588
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:28,120
That was, well, that was the Funny or Die Oscar.

1589
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,120
I made an Oscar thing and BuzzBuzz did it.

1590
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:36,120
And BuzzBuzz made a video with Billy Crystal and Robin Williams.

1591
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,120
So FOD got involved that year.

1592
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,120
So I know that was 2012 for that reason.

1593
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,120
That's 10 years ago.

1594
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,120
I know.

1595
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,120
No, it was 13.

1596
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,120
I forgot what year it is.

1597
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,120
Wild.

1598
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,120
So it's 10 years ago that I saw Latin.

1599
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,120
So it's great.

1600
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,120
The special continues.

1601
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,120
There is a dog fashion show.

1602
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:01,120
I don't, which is funny, but you feel bad for the dogs.

1603
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:06,120
I forget if there's a televised Barbie part, but Barbie was part of it for a couple of years.

1604
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,120
The world's most beautiful doll, I think they say.

1605
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:13,120
There's like a tad at the start when they're announcing one of these.

1606
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,120
Who's going to, I can't bar you another one.

1607
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,120
Yeah, I can't either.

1608
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,120
Well, you might say Leonardo or I wouldn't call them dolls though.

1609
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,120
That would be the, all right.

1610
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,120
That's all.

1611
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:33,120
There's also, here was the great discovery of seeing the full special is that this was not the final appearance of Mr.

1612
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,120
Belvedere in the special.

1613
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:44,120
But later on he comes back and in this one he is a villainous pirate and he does the exact same performance.

1614
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:50,120
I hate to say this, but I saw his elsewhere in his body of work.

1615
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:57,120
This makes a lot of sense because he played Captain Hook in some production of Peter Pan, which included Sandy Duncan.

1616
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,120
There she is.

1617
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,120
She continues to haunt me around every turn.

1618
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,120
But really great to find out there's more Mr.

1619
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,120
Belvedere and there is more musical villainous Mr. Belvedere.

1620
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,120
Here is this.

1621
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,120
He's singing to a parrot.

1622
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,120
It's that.

1623
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,120
I'm bad.

1624
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,120
I'm bad.

1625
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,120
You know I'm bad.

1626
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,120
You know it.

1627
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,120
I'm really bad.

1628
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,120
I'm bad.

1629
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,120
The whole world has to watch right now.

1630
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,120
Just tell me what to get.

1631
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,120
I'm bad.

1632
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,120
Yay.

1633
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,120
So good.

1634
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,120
I'm a simple man.

1635
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:56,120
If there is a guy over if there is a British villain over pronouncing, especially when it's to contemporary music, I'm smiling and I'm clapping.

1636
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,120
The Casio keyboard version of bad.

1637
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,120
With a much much much much cheaper keyboard.

1638
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,120
Oh boy.

1639
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,120
Oh beautiful.

1640
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:10,120
You know I'm bad.

1641
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,120
Oh boy.

1642
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,120
So glad there was more.

1643
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,120
So glad to get to meditate on this thing for a little while.

1644
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:19,120
Any for any any last observations about this or?

1645
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,120
No, I just yeah it's great.

1646
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:26,120
I would like to issue a correction about the Hogan family and Valerie Harper though.

1647
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,120
Thank God.

1648
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:33,120
Under the show was originally called Valerie because it centered on Valerie Harper and she was raising three sons.

1649
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,120
But after two seasons Harper was replaced.

1650
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,120
Not the first season because she had a contract dispute.

1651
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,120
Oh Valerie is the Hogan family.

1652
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,120
Valerie is the same.

1653
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,120
Valerie is the Hogan family.

1654
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,120
Okay.

1655
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,120
Valerie is okay.

1656
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:51,120
So it's the same format as Roseanne becomes the Connors.

1657
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,120
Yes.

1658
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,120
Albeit with I would imagine their exits were not exactly the same.

1659
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,120
Not the exact same.

1660
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:02,120
Then they killed off the Valerie Harper character and she was replaced with Sandy Duncan.

1661
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,120
What?

1662
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,120
Killed off?

1663
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,120
Killed?

1664
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,120
Yes.

1665
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,120
Sandy Duncan is a killer.

1666
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,120
Yes.

1667
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,120
Sandy Duncan joined the cast.

1668
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,120
This monster must be brought to justice.

1669
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,120
Valerie's sister-in-law and the boy's aunt.

1670
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,120
So I don't think she married the father.

1671
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,120
They Kevin Kenway-ed her.

1672
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,120
They did Kevin Kenway-ed her, yes.

1673
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,120
Yeah.

1674
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,120
Right.

1675
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:26,120
The series was initially retitled Valerie's Family.

1676
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,120
But then season four they changed it to the Hogan family.

1677
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,120
It was briefly so Valerie wasn't on it but it was called Valerie's Family.

1678
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,120
Yes.

1679
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,120
I guess they thought that people would remember what the show was.

1680
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,120
The first two seasons they called it that but I guess then they felt that was weird.

1681
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,120
They had done this move.

1682
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,120
This filth that Roseanne has tweeted.

1683
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,120
She's out of her mind.

1684
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,120
We have to put a stop to this.

1685
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,120
Anyway, the show is now Roseanne's Family.

1686
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,120
Roseanne's Family.

1687
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,120
You're saying season four they changed the name?

1688
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,120
Yes.

1689
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,120
So season one and two it was called Valerie.

1690
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,120
Season three Valerie Harper is out and now it's called Valerie's Family.

1691
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,120
It's family.

1692
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,120
Season four it's now called the Hogan Family which I think people now just think it was

1693
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,120
the Hogan Family the whole time.

1694
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,120
How many seasons did it run?

1695
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,120
Six.

1696
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,120
Mr. Belvedere also ran six seasons.

1697
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,120
Six years ago?

1698
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,120
Did it?

1699
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,120
I thought it was five.

1700
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,120
I thought that's what I saw.

1701
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,120
Maybe it was six.

1702
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,120
Yeah.

1703
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,120
My God.

1704
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,120
But it was always called Mr. Belvedere.

1705
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,120
Yes.

1706
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,120
Yeah.

1707
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,120
Not the family Mr. Belvedere used to work for.

1708
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,120
Right.

1709
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:27,120
Mr. Belvedere's source of employment.

1710
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,120
Six seasons.

1711
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,120
117.

1712
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:34,120
I don't think I've ever seen a single episode of Mr. Belvedere.

1713
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,120
I used to watch it a lot.

1714
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,120
I don't think I've seen full Belvedere either.

1715
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:45,120
It was syndicated always on classic for me wherever in whatever form I was watching it

1716
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,120
but it's really the show whatever it's all about that theme song.

1717
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,120
We know it's all about that theme song.

1718
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,120
The regional syndication is fascinating.

1719
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,120
I haven't seen Mr. Belvedere but I've seen hours of Charles in charge.

1720
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,120
Wow.

1721
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,120
I don't think I've ever seen any Charles in charge.

1722
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,120
Wow.

1723
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,120
I know we're still microphones are still on.

1724
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,120
Have you ever seen the elf holiday special?

1725
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,120
No.

1726
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,120
That was a contender in the Club 3.

1727
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,120
Because I watched it.

1728
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,120
Okay.

1729
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,120
And I'll just tell you what happens because it's not going to make you not want to watch it.

1730
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,120
It's a very serious episode.

1731
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,120
Yes.

1732
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,120
I found I saw that.

1733
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,120
Yeah.

1734
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,120
It's like not that I don't even think there's a live studio audience.

1735
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,120
Maybe that I know there wasn't a regularly but it does it feels differently.

1736
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,120
It's shot like single cam.

1737
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:32,120
Elf accidentally ends up in a hospital with a terminally ill child.

1738
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,120
Then he gives birth.

1739
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:39,120
He helps a woman give birth to a baby because she thinks he's a doctor and they get stuck in an elevator.

1740
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,120
And then third he talks a man off the ledge from trying to kill himself.

1741
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,120
Geez Louise.

1742
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,120
And none of this is played for laughs.

1743
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,120
Barely any of it is played for laughs.

1744
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,120
Oh my God.

1745
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,120
The baby doesn't go like flying out and knocks elf down.

1746
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,120
No not really.

1747
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,120
I mean there's a joke of like elf with the surgical mask on and like you're a doctor.

1748
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,120
Are you sure?

1749
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,120
And yeah I'm a doctor.

1750
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,120
Like a little of that.

1751
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:07,120
But basically like elf helps her deliver the baby because they're stuck in an elevator.

1752
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,120
Wow.

1753
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,120
Wow.

1754
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:16,120
And there is not then elf getting stuck inside the woman before she is there.

1755
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,120
That happens off camera if it happened.

1756
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:22,120
You were supposed to tie a rope around my waist.

1757
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,120
What happened?

1758
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,120
That's the end of that.

1759
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,120
Maybe next holiday we'll do that one.

1760
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,120
Yeah it was a contender.

1761
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,120
We'll see if it makes it back.

1762
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,120
For now you survived podcast throughout the second gate.

1763
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:39,120
Delightful suggestion.

1764
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,120
Thanks Nick for this.

1765
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:46,120
We'll see if there's more Mario nonsense because now is the time to talk Mario.

1766
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,120
There is.

1767
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,120
And I'd love to do more.

1768
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:53,120
So if there's anything else bizarre and Mario related we should be aware of.

1769
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,120
Leave it in the comments.

1770
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:01,120
I'm not going to get into it now but that maybe will give me a window to talk a little bit about the album Nintendo White Knuckle Scorin.

1771
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:06,120
I'll save that for if there's more time to do so.

1772
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,120
I don't know.

1773
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,120
I don't think this maybe it's not even that funny.

1774
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,120
I legitimately the Mario Choose Your Own Adventure books.

1775
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,120
I couldn't have been obsessed with more.

1776
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,120
Really?

1777
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,120
They were more.

1778
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:19,120
They were almost out of print by the time I discovered them.

1779
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,120
So I couldn't get my hands on them and I had like two or three of them.

1780
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,120
But I was obsessed with them.

1781
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,120
Wow.

1782
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,120
And I think you can get them now but they've never reprinted them again.

1783
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,120
So if I can find one or two I wonder if there's anything interesting there.

1784
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,120
Probably not honestly.

1785
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:35,120
Well and then there's and there's that bizarre old TV show that you found.

1786
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,120
Well there's like a local Bowser.

1787
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:42,120
So yeah there's there's well there's the Captain Lou Albano one which everybody probably knows.

1788
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:46,120
Mario Super Show where they had cartoons of Mario and then Zelda.

1789
01:26:46,120 --> 01:27:01,120
But then also my friend of mine just told me about a local Los Angeles show that was King Koopa hosted where he would show like cartoons and it was a Bozo show basically with a live studio audience of kids and he would show cartoons and there's very little of it online.

1790
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,120
And I assume because it was a local show.

1791
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,120
Yeah yeah.

1792
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,120
That who knows if it's been taped over but.

1793
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,120
He looks spectacular.

1794
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,120
It's a crazy Bowser to look at.

1795
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,120
They went a little further with the facial effects than Belvedere and his splatter of green paint.

1796
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:20,120
And he like marches down Hollywood Boulevard with children and.

1797
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,120
The army of children.

1798
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,120
Yeah so I want to see if anybody has any more footage of that somewhere.

1799
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,120
Well let me.

1800
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:31,120
Okay you know and it doesn't have to be this month we could take our time you know it's going to be a Nintendo mania for a little while but.

1801
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,120
Yeah.

1802
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,120
Let's let's make like Club 3 here.

1803
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:40,120
Leave in the comments if there's something crazy in Mario that you want to hear about or you want to expose us to and maybe we'll do something else.

1804
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,120
Seems like it seems like the time.

1805
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:46,120
We even put it up to a poll so we'll do a poll here in regular second gate.

1806
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,120
Sure.

1807
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,120
Always have to be behind.

1808
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,120
There's a number of ways we could.

1809
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,120
Yeah.

1810
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,120
This.

1811
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,120
I guess that that wraps it up.

1812
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,120
I.

1813
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,120
Wait.

1814
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,120
That's like what's the way to do the.

1815
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,120
To end it.

1816
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:05,120
The you know thank you for subscribing to the second gate but of course.

1817
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,120
Life is more than mere subscribing.

1818
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,120
Which is my life.

1819
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,120
The good life.

1820
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,120
Yep.

1821
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,120
Ha ha.

1822
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,120
Oh yes.
