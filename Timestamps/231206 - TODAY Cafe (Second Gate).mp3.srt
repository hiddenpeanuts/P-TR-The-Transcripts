1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:26,760
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate, thankfully avoiding a third full humiliating

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,200
month of neglecting to cover Al Roker's butternut squash tart.

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson grimacing at the thought that a single day would have

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,040
passed longer where we don't discuss this tart.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,640
I was just thinking about how I deserve to be punished more.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,160
I mean, we, I guess all three of us, but I like, I want to take it out on myself too.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
I want to take this.

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,960
You think you deserve to be punished more.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Yeah.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
More.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Huh?

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
More.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
For what, per se?

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
Does anything come to mind?

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
For not getting to it.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Oh, just for, oh, I thought like maybe for things in general.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,600
Well, I guess there are things that you've certainly just have just a general guilt,

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
but no, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
I mean, specifically for this, for the neglect.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
This is, well, I don't know.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,120
I don't, I don't wish the same thing.

23
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,520
I hope there's no more punishments coming your way anytime soon.

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,880
I don't, don't do that to yourself.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
Jason Sheridan.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
Hi.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Hi.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Yeah.

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,440
I mean, I was ready to discuss it the last time we were down, but then I didn't end

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,480
up beating anything there.

31
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,120
So it's probably for the best we didn't.

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
But the menu has changed.

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Yes.

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,120
So it changes all the time.

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Avocado toast is gone.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
It's gone.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
It's long gone.

38
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,880
Oats left behind in 2019.

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
You know, is that right?

40
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,240
I thought they had it still.

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,640
Is there not overnight oats?

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,160
I feel like I didn't see it.

43
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,640
I definitely didn't see Al's avocado toast.

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
No.

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
Well, that shifted as I was saying to Al's butternut squash tart, which is the new thing

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
from a couple months ago.

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,800
And again, if that had gone any longer, I think the listeners would have started to

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,560
notice and started to complain and revolt.

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
But we're here doing it now.

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,120
We're talking about the Today Cafe, which is the Today Show themed restaurant in Universal

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
Orlando.

52
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,000
And look, we've just, you know, we're back from Orlando and we're filled with like a,

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
it's December here.

54
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,400
It's a Santa's bag full of goodies of the rides and attractions and experiences, really

55
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,480
keyword experience that now we can talk about that we haven't been able to for a long time.

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,160
And folks, it's here.

57
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,240
The one you've been begging for, the one you've been asking for.

58
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,760
We're finally doing the Today's Cafe.

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,760
The overnight oats are still there, but the acai bowl appears to be missing in action.

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Oh, jeez.

62
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,640
Possibly replaced with tropical chia pudding.

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Okay.

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Okay.

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,680
These are, well, this gives you, I think, a flavor of the kind of things they have.

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:55,280
You know, these, you know, earthy, balanced, good for you recipes that certainly are real

67
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,960
and well crafted by the artisans who work in this theme park.

68
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,920
Doesn't it feel like overnight oats especially feels like the fakest.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,600
Like what you picture it is versus the container that it is taken out of and put in the microwave.

70
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,440
Yeah, it's, they, it's a, everything sounds classy.

71
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,640
Everything sounds curated and handcrafted.

72
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah.

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,080
But I, there's very few quick service places in any theme park where things are truly handcrafted,

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,520
like handcrafted in front of you.

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,600
I suppose pastries and certain things are made in big bulk amounts.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,720
But I saw the chef without Roker touring the facility at opening.

77
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,640
Well, you know, again, all restaurants have that, like that stretch of time where people

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
are watching and paying attention.

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,520
So they have to be decent impressions of restaurants and then time passes and things kind of fade,

80
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,240
which is a, I imagine a theme that we will be exploring in the, the city walk Orlando

81
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,280
saga, multiverse of madness.

82
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Spoilers.

83
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,680
It's really, you might like, when were these restaurants good?

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
You might want to chart that opening and then look like a month out and how long ago in

85
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,880
the past was that we will see, you know, speaking of that, it is okay.

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,640
So, you know, we're going to be covering that NBC sports grill, which is at city walk Orlando

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
there.

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,960
And then you've got, of course the, so there's an NBC property and restaurant, you know,

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,840
the, the, the spirit of the sports casters and sports enterprise.

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,980
And then you got Jimmy Fallon up the road and obviously the recreation of 30 rock.

91
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,660
That's the biggest scale nod to the corporate overlords.

92
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,320
And then you've got this.

93
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,120
So in the, in kind of a same little loop, if you want to like really keep that NBC spirit

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,760
alive in the most, in the vaguest way, all three probably places where you can get things

95
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,480
that say NBC or you can get like a, I bet all these places have something just called

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,560
like NBC pie.

97
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,720
Does that reflect, does it like, is it based on, do anybody who works there come up with

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
the pie recipe?

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,620
I don't know.

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,180
But if you know, if you're loyal to a brand, then a universal's got the way for you to

101
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
celebrate that.

102
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,420
Yeah, no, it's, it's really, I mean, I, maybe this is for the end, but like, what, like

103
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,700
what else, what else would you want from NBC?

104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,020
Like the NBC property, what other, if you're a fan of the network, I mean, is there famous

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,820
NBC stuff?

106
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,260
Do you want like Brandon Tartakov walk around characters?

107
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,100
Like what, like this is, I guess, probably the optimum way right now that an average

108
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,620
tourist would experience the IP of NBC.

109
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,020
I suppose.

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,980
Yeah, well, that's obviously what I want.

111
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,100
I want to, you know, like, like a cigarette, you know, machine or whatever, but then you

112
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,740
actually get to it and there's kind of like a no, no, no.

113
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,260
And it's Brandon Tartakov with the cast to say by the bell, all saying think twice before

114
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,260
you do that.

115
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,500
Yeah.

116
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,980
The greatest thing they ever aired.

117
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,420
Yeah, I think enough has been enough.

118
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,020
I think it's time to bring cigarette machines back to it.

119
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,500
Even if they're fake out cigarette machines, they're fake out.

120
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,140
Even if you pull on it and it tells you it's just like your favorite embassy, NBC property

121
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,860
telling you.

122
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,580
Right. Right.

123
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,500
Yes. No, no.

124
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,540
The cast of manifest is here to tell you about the dangerous smoking.

125
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,460
Which I'm saying that has shifted to that.

126
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,460
That's one of those shows that's secretly a massive hit for Netflix.

127
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:25,940
I think.

128
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,540
Sure. Sure.

129
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,820
Yeah.

130
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,380
Oh, my God.

131
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,860
What's what's happening?

132
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,700
What?

133
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,100
You absolute fool.

134
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,260
He found you.

135
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,300
I mean, how did he find us in a different location?

136
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,980
It's the minute.

137
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,220
There's no way for him to know the minutes are.

138
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,980
I found us.

139
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,380
Hey, oh, well, yeah.

140
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,060
Being really nice.

141
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,340
Thank you so much.

142
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,460
They're better.

143
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
Yes.

144
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,180
Hello. I guess I should help you with the mic.

145
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,500
Well, you know what?

146
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,300
I didn't plan for I didn't know you were coming minutes.

147
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,460
Oh, my God. The Minotaur who recently visited us to dynasty typewriter is back has rudely

148
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,220
interrupted the today cafe.

149
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,260
But ultimately, I put this on Mike, I would say.

150
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,940
I like you like you. You have to know.

151
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,140
You're the reason this is coming.

152
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,420
I assume so. But let's hear him out here later.

153
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,980
OK, you know what I'll do?

154
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,860
Maybe Minotaur, why don't you take my microphone and I'll go grab that one

155
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,940
on a stand that's set up in the corner here.

156
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,180
Here, here, here. Come switch to mine. OK.

157
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,300
All right. One second. We get some.

158
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,580
All right. Well, yeah, I don't want you to podcast uncomfortably.

159
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,660
Oh, it's going to get it's going to get uncomfortable.

160
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,380
My God. What have I done?

161
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,100
At the level for our level.

162
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,980
And you think you do. OK.

163
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,020
OK, OK. Minotaur levels.

164
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,260
I have to audio engineer my own yelling at my scolding.

165
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,860
I mean, my God, can we do it while we're going live?

166
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,540
I might have to restart and restart. Oh, my God.

167
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,020
I think you're a you're a you're a bad son, but you're a fine engineer.

168
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,060
You'll figure this out. What this is about.

169
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,700
I know it was actually at food.

170
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,460
We like to take a day and we have to talk about it.

171
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,620
But we have to address this.

172
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,580
This is important.

173
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,900
We have to address our sudden. This is important.

174
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,220
But you have to blame Mike for what's happening.

175
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,860
Because you know, well, I do for most things.

176
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,060
Minotaur, do you want a bottle of water while you're getting settled?

177
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,820
That is really polite. I would love a bottle of water.

178
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,020
Thank you. Hold on.

179
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,860
I got to restart and I got to restart. Hold on.

180
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,980
It's done. You hit stop.

181
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,820
Minotaur's really settled in here.

182
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,460
Yeah, you got a water. You're all good to go.

183
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,740
Aggressive. Yeah.

184
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,300
That's aggressive posture.

185
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,500
I just say I just say don't pop the peas.

186
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,740
You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,620
Minotaur is a very thirsty job.

188
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,660
Generally, you're you're you got a bellow.

189
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,900
It's a bellowing job.

190
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,500
I can only imagine. Yeah.

191
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,860
Is this is busy right bellowing distance from the microphone?

192
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,140
I think it's OK. I can hear from over here.

193
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,980
How does that sound? Oh, it sounds fine now.

194
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah. Bellow right in your face.

195
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,300
Oh, that's that's a little too hot.

196
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,980
I guess I'll lower in case you want to have that room.

197
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,100
I mean, that's that's probably what you should be doing,

198
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,700
because I think I have a feeling why you're here.

199
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,380
Yeah. Why you've showed up by by surprise.

200
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Does this have anything to do with what happened

201
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,620
the last time we saw you at our live show?

202
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,260
Yeah, I thought I came to your show.

203
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,820
I had a great time.

204
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,300
Lovely time at the Dines and Typewriter, a beautiful venue, by the way.

205
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,660
Thank you. Well, we agree. Yeah.

206
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,740
No, no, no. Yeah. Really, really comfortable. Good snacks.

207
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,500
Did you get some of the popcorn back?

208
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,060
Yeah. Some sour gummy worms.

209
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,020
That's a really good snack.

210
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,100
Some like peanut butter M&M's is great.

211
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,740
You know, an orthodox topic.

212
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,260
It's kind of, you know, kind of like nice, fun treats like they would have it.

213
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,340
The Today Cafe.

214
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,180
I know, but I guess we have to put that aside for the time being.

215
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,380
OK, so I think I know what's happening.

216
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,980
And to catch the listener up on what's been going on

217
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,580
a little while back, Mike

218
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,260
would would not face the Minotaur in an escape room experience.

219
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,140
You had to tap out of this thing.

220
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,340
And that led to the Minotaur appearing in one of our recent

221
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,460
live shows where he put you to the test.

222
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,420
He made you face one of your biggest fears,

223
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,260
which is the fear of missing out on on great deals.

224
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,500
Yes. Or something that's a limited time release that might go away.

225
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Which I will come open to interpretation.

226
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,180
I let you. Yes. Pick what would work for you.

227
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,300
Yes. And yet and yet.

228
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,260
Yeah. Once a specific was offered.

229
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,780
Yeah. Once you were given.

230
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,420
And look, this all played out on stage as it did.

231
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,820
And you were a champion that night.

232
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,700
Public record. Yeah.

233
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,020
You were told to delete one of the many, many, many home screen

234
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,820
notifications that are on your phone.

235
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,620
That's true. At all times.

236
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,020
And you picked one.

237
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,260
You had one in the chamber ready to go.

238
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,980
You volunteer and sacrifice something called Deal Vibes.

239
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,260
Yes. At Deal Vibes. Yes.

240
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,860
A name that's kept you up at night ever since Minotaur.

241
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,020
Yes. Well, I want to read a little.

242
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,820
I want to read an X that came across my bow.

243
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,340
I don't even have X. I quit X. OK.

244
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,700
You had to go back on it because of all this crap.

245
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,380
People were people were DMing me on Instagram.

246
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,420
And I had to get on X because I was going to go full threats.

247
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,500
And all I had to decide.

248
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,420
Somebody told me to go on X.

249
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,380
And I read this from Michael Carlson at Fat Carlson spelled P.H.

250
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,580
Replying to podcast, right?

251
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,780
Do you guys plug your show and all this stuff? Yeah.

252
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,860
And he's he writes, I refollowed to spit in the face of the Minotaur.

253
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,660
I will not be bullied.

254
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,220
I will defeat it in person.

255
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,740
Oh, ho, ho.

256
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,940
And then you refollowed Deal Vibes. Yeah.

257
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,540
And now we're in person.

258
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,420
That's true. Yeah. It's right here.

259
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,900
What up, dog? OK.

260
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,380
Well, look, when I said I would defeat in a person,

261
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,100
I assumed it would lead to another episode where I went to the Minotaur

262
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,380
to escape room, which I learned is real.

263
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,700
Oh, he's he's living.

264
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,980
But he's thinking about your escape room.

265
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,260
I mean, it's not about the escape room anymore.

266
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,300
Now you're in it. First of all, let me just say this.

267
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,100
I realized weeks, days.

268
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,140
I don't even really remember.

269
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,620
I realized what I was doing.

270
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,060
I deal vibes is so important to my phone ecosystem.

271
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,180
Yes. And I said, there's no fucking way I can unfollow this.

272
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,260
I'm following this again.

273
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,180
Well, this is my question.

274
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,220
I'll wait a little bit more context really quick.

275
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,260
The you unfollow you.

276
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,900
You volunteered unfollowing.

277
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,980
You always said was home screen. Yes.

278
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,300
Acations. Yes. You took that off.

279
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,740
And then as an extra brave boy bonus, you said, and I will unfollow it as well.

280
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,900
Right. You got a big round of applause.

281
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,100
Yeah. Minotaur called you the bravest boy he's ever known.

282
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Yes. Yes. It was a victorious moment.

283
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,300
I gave you paternal approval, an intimate moment of paternal approval.

284
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,980
That's right. Yes.

285
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,180
And I appreciated that.

286
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,020
His biggest desire.

287
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,020
I appreciated that. But then I was I was thinking about it and I was like,

288
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,060
who is this Minotaur?

289
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,220
I don't even I'm just a man on a stage trying to do a little show,

290
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,820
make the people laugh, make the nice people laugh.

291
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,260
I just because I had an anxiety attack, I didn't face the Minotaur once.

292
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,860
And I said, you know what? Who is he to tell me who and what to do?

293
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,780
And I said, I can't.

294
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,060
And then I refollowed deal vibes.

295
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,340
And yeah, I almost immediately was clued in that the new expansion pack

296
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,300
for Disney's Lorcan was now available for like five minutes.

297
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,260
I got a booster box because I refollowed and it justified all of my decisions.

298
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,020
Now I have that kind of box.

299
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,420
Lorcan, a flood born booster box.

300
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,940
That's pretty amazing.

301
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,100
Twenty four packs. This is hard to get, folks.

302
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,860
You're to your to your tip in him a little bit.

303
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,140
I know I have a question.

304
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,380
How soon did you refile?

305
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,580
Because there were two weeks between us recording the live show.

306
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,820
Yeah. And then we put out the episode and I want to shout out listener

307
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,460
Ethan Dickinson.

308
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,100
Thanks for getting on the crime tip line.

309
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,940
Well, he's now listening to the show.

310
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,700
Ethan, you're out.

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,860
If you're on the Patreon, you're going to be blocked.

312
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,380
If you're on X, you'll be blocked from our accounts.

313
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,980
Personal Minotaur.

314
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,300
You're calling out Ethan. Yeah, there were two.

315
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,220
And you get one free trip to the labyrinth.

316
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,740
If you ever want to come to my labyrinth, you can come and check out the labyrinth.

317
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,620
It's really cool.

318
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,020
Well, it's got a lot of like justice based puzzles.

319
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,300
OK, it's going to be great.

320
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,620
Are you going to like eat them or kill them at the end?

321
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,180
Yes. If I do catch you, I will eat you or kill you.

322
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,940
That's kind of my job there.

323
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,100
I guard the treasure.

324
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,820
But there is treasure there, Ethan.

325
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,300
So you could you could be treasure if you're a brave boy.

326
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,020
Yeah. Hey, look, Ethan, I mean, you're much more loyal to the Minotaur than me.

327
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,060
So I think this is where he picked a side.

328
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,500
Yeah, he picked a side. I get it.

329
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,100
And there's something that I want to know from what Ethan found out.

330
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,500
There were exactly two weeks to the day between.

331
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,340
Yeah. Recorded it.

332
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,900
And when he discovered that you were still following deal vibes.

333
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,220
Yeah. How soon after the show did you spit in the Minotaur's face?

334
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,420
Don't I think it was like four or five days.

335
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,580
I think I made it four or five days.

336
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,140
And then I think it pops up a little better.

337
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,180
I wondered if you even like like the night of we're in the venue and decided

338
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,180
and look at you know what happened while I was sitting backstage

339
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,300
eating peanut butter and you would do that secretly on your phone during the show.

340
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,820
You know what happened is I think that X then started showing me deal

341
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,260
vibes as well, because what happens is it doesn't always go to just who you're

342
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,500
following. Oftentimes it clicks over to the for you tab,

343
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,700
which then shows you an algorithm of what you actually might want to see.

344
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,180
So I think I was getting deal vibes and I was just I would I got the FOMO.

345
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,780
I got the deal vibes FOMO.

346
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,380
But that's what you're over.

347
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,300
No, I understand that. I went back on my word.

348
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,700
But really, who was the Minotaur to tell me what to do?

349
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,780
Well, OK. Well, first of all, who are you to sit there and back out on a deal

350
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,860
that you made and you hugged on?

351
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,140
I mean, if Jason would have made a deal like that, he wouldn't have reneged on it

352
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,420
at all. He would have stayed in.

353
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I told I would have never done something like that.

354
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,740
I would have never renamed to know it kept me up at night if I refollowed.

355
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,700
Just like the person who mentioned me and some other of our accounts

356
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,140
in a post and acts and they were like, hey,

357
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,340
you should deal with five pounds of her serum.

358
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,580
Oh, yeah, that's right. We were just fine.

359
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,220
That we were just tagged on a deal vibes,

360
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,060
you know, which could be a good way to suss out like how much of a real problem

361
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,340
we're dealing with, because you're right. OK.

362
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,820
Yeah. Did you get the chocolate, by the way?

363
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,260
The syrup syrup, the syrup? Yeah.

364
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,100
No, no, I don't think I have the room for five to ten pounds of Hershey's syrup.

365
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,900
It is. It's over seven pounds over seven hours.

366
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,180
She's chocolate syrup for under ten dollars.

367
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,500
Too low and ten was too high.

368
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,420
Are you a Hershey's on the on the Sunday guy?

369
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,500
Do you like it? Even at home for a home ice cream?

370
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,780
Do you do it? I usually have something for a home ice cream.

371
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,060
I love to do a Hershey's syrup and then you stir it really fast. Yeah.

372
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,540
I don't mind if it melts a little like it's getting ice cream soup quickly.

373
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,860
You know, you don't just like feast on the on the bones of those who betrayed you.

374
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,540
You you like it just a bit like a like like any of us.

375
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,380
No, but you should try bone ice cream if you've never made bone.

376
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,660
You can home make it. It just takes milk and ice and everything into the bones

377
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,180
of your enemies. Oh, sure.

378
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,220
So it's like a bone broth, honestly, like it's almost like when you're making

379
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,780
bone broth at home, which, you know, is very popular these days.

380
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,700
And it takes a while.

381
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,980
But you instead of using it to make some sort of a broth,

382
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,020
it's like salt straw would have a bone broth ice cream.

383
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,660
I think you could probably get one seasonally.

384
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,060
I'm yeah, I'm betting Jason would bet five real.

385
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,660
I bet it would be good. I'm going to be good. Yeah.

386
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,780
Yeah. But it was Jason's honorable man is what I'm saying.

387
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,500
Well, here let me I hate to bring out contract law into this conversation.

388
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,100
But let me just read a little mighty minutes.

389
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,220
Are you going to use words? Let's just read.

390
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,620
Let's just read. I deal with riddles all the time as well.

391
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,700
Occasionally in a lab or they'll be a riddle.

392
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,900
So I'll listen to this to this contract riddle.

393
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,820
He is sovereign citizen Carlson going off again.

394
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,100
Listen, this is a corporate finance institute dot com, a website

395
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,740
we all know very well.

396
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,020
It says in contract law, duress is used as a form of defense to a crime

397
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,060
where the defendant uses threats to force the plaintiff to commit a crime

398
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,180
that is against their wishes.

399
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,180
A party who is forced into an act or contract under duress

400
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,340
can rescind the contract, rendering it null and void.

401
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,100
Well, can I counter with that? All right.

402
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,380
Were you under duress just because I'm a minotaur?

403
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,540
No, this is how I talk and this is how I look.

404
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,980
And all of a sudden, if I'm asking to do something, it's duress.

405
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,780
Well, I would say that the way you were intimidating me on stage

406
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,020
by charging the stage, we didn't we have to approve everyone.

407
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,740
I charge everywhere I go.

408
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,260
I charge the movies. I charge the grocery store.

409
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,260
I charge. That's how I do.

410
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,060
So you can't you cannot you're incapable of not you're capable of not charging.

411
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,140
I'm not. How did I come in here?

412
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,580
You charged it.

413
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,700
But it's very intimidating.

414
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,380
We heard a little charge. What was that?

415
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,340
Yeah. And he showed up.

416
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,340
After we took a little break because some nice people were walking

417
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,740
through the alleyway.

418
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,100
Yeah. I was really messed up that intro.

419
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,660
Using a residential.

420
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,300
There was an energy.

421
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,820
There was an energy going on here that I couldn't put my finger on.

422
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,700
It was weird. And then the people the dogs walked by.

423
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,300
And then I was like, wait a minute.

424
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,900
And then I said, no, no, no, start recording again.

425
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,380
Yeah. There was a weird, weird energy.

426
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,700
Not that I thought it was a minute.

427
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,980
It's hard approaching necessarily.

428
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,740
Just something was off.

429
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,740
It's got say something was off.

430
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,420
I was like, I never yelled at your rest.

431
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,940
Yeah. That's what I was not doing.

432
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,740
I was just nonchalantly hiding behind a fence outside of the recording studio.

433
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,060
And these people just stopped.

434
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,340
They were underdressed by me being there.

435
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,260
Just a bit of tar with horns and large sound.

436
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,540
And I charged up to the fence.

437
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,220
I believe you could not charge.

438
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,140
I believe you have the ability not to charge.

439
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,180
I believe that you could be slower in your light to not charge.

440
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,900
There's also I think that, you know, there's like a range of intonation

441
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,900
and how something sounds in your head versus how it comes off in reality.

442
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,740
How you presented yourself to us during the show.

443
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,900
What ended up being duress might have been very calm on your scale,

444
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,740
similar to how there's a story I'm trying to remember.

445
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,380
One of us, I can't remember, was used this phrase in a text message.

446
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,980
Counterpoint, you were wrong.

447
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,780
Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,340
Also sounded like a like a very like kind of an angry,

449
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,940
especially angry, sharp threat.

450
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,500
But once Pestered to say it out loud, it was said more like,

451
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,940
look, counterpoint, you were wrong.

452
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,420
I thought it was very clear communication.

453
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,460
That sounds like some of that clear text counterpoint comma.

454
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,940
Was there a comma there?

455
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,900
No, it was a colon.

456
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,700
It's a colon. Yeah.

457
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,580
Looks like the title of the show. Yeah.

458
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,380
So that's like that's like something you would text

459
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,900
and you would you'd be shocked if anybody took that as like that seemed

460
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,860
like like an angry thing.

461
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,980
Exactly. No, I'm just I'm just being a minute.

462
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,180
I'm just doing minute things.

463
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,380
I don't know what your big deal is.

464
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,940
I mean, no one's blaming you for just doing minute.

465
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,420
It's just tests and feats and riddles.

466
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,260
It's just how ideal it's ideal and intimidation in loud voices

467
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,660
and getting in a person's face.

468
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,620
I have been whispering the whole time in my mind.

469
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,740
Well, there you go.

470
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
Come off now.

471
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,460
Whispering, because that's I'm trying not to wake up the neighborhood.

472
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,180
Your whisper is a little loud.

473
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,460
It's a little loud. Yeah, I'm not.

474
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,620
But I'm not. Hey, over here, I'm not mad at you about that.

475
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,460
Other chairs might be. I don't know.

476
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,380
They might say they're under duress right now.

477
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,260
I'm a bit. Yes, I do feel like I'm a bit under duress right now.

478
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,860
All right. Well, let me bring it down.

479
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,340
I'm going to give you a paternal feeling, intimate paternal

480
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,540
disappointment. OK.

481
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,460
Michael Carlson.

482
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,500
You are a bad little boy.

483
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,420
You follow deal vibes when you said you would keep off of it.

484
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,380
And for that, I am sad.

485
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,420
You are not brave.

486
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,580
Hmm. Look, a knife.

487
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,340
It cuts like a knife, but it's like, unfortunately, it's a minotaur.

488
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,580
But not Optimus Prime. But.

489
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,220
You did stand up to a minotaur,

490
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
one of the scariest beasts there is.

491
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,020
And you told him that you would defeat him

492
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,700
and you would spit in his face.

493
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,500
And as a minotaur, I respect that.

494
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,500
You charged onto Twitter and you charged right up to me.

495
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,900
And for that, you are a brave little boy.

496
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,380
Oh, my God. Whoa.

497
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,420
All the way back around.

498
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,620
Wow. Geez.

499
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,580
Yes, you're even to me, which I would count as a victory, honestly.

500
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Yeah, I think maybe we landed at like a spot of peace.

501
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,660
I guess the question, though, is how do we feel about Mike

502
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,980
continuing to follow deal vibes at this point?

503
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,420
Is this his own business?

504
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,740
You've got kind of a respect for him, given what he's how he's behaved lately.

505
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,540
Well, I told him he'd face his greatest fear, which would be to miss out.

506
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,460
And he didn't face that fear.

507
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,340
I feel like that's a fear for him to conquer in the future.

508
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,580
However, he did conquer the fear of a minotaur, which is pretty good.

509
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,740
You know, I think that

510
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,220
I don't know, or I can't believe you got a conic couch for real.

511
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,540
Those are impossible to find.

512
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,700
And then there are the new expansion.

513
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
They're flood.

514
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,100
It's called Floodborne.

515
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,020
That's the new title for the Larkana.

516
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,940
Without you, do you collect Arkana or do you actually play it?

517
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,020
I haven't played it yet, but I do collect it.

518
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,180
It's a game to play, right? That's right. Yeah.

519
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,260
And you haven't played it. Never.

520
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,500
Hmm. This is convicting you now.

521
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,380
Now you don't know what to do.

522
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,300
But it's a collectible card game.

523
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,260
Yes, I know.

524
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,740
But it's like we don't collect magic cards and not play magic.

525
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,620
Some people do. That's foolish.

526
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,060
That's baloney.

527
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,540
Some people do. No way.

528
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
It's true. Toys.

529
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,940
He doesn't take out of the box.

530
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,260
You chose to play with.

531
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,980
Yeah, I understand. I get that.

532
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Like there was more in the box, but it's a card game.

533
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,100
It's not it's not baseball cards.

534
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,380
I would like to play it.

535
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,060
Hopefully I will play it soon.

536
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,220
Would you would you ever play your old man?

537
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,420
Wait, are you calling me?

538
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,500
Are you calling yourself my old man?

539
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,820
I mean, I'm kind of everybody's old man.

540
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,980
I'm an ageless creature of math.

541
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,500
So all of our lineage ultimately goes back to this minotaur.

542
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,900
You've been around for thousands of years.

543
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,980
We're related to you.

544
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,140
So I'm guessing I'll have to curate.

545
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,700
Like I'll have to create a deck because you don't have any more kind of card.

546
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,780
I would have to create a deck for you.

547
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,700
I've been wanting to play.

548
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,340
Well, yeah, you're not following the lives.

549
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,020
Oh, now that he's on a.

550
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,380
He's jumping the air now.

551
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,620
Well, and you're going to want to, you know,

552
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,060
because I started thinking about what am I missing out on?

553
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,940
Not following deal vibes myself.

554
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,780
And, you know, this is the kind of thing that's on the table for Mike.

555
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,100
And it could be for you as well.

556
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,820
Minotaur, you could get deals on lightning McQueen Crocs.

557
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,260
You can get a deal on a grimace from McDonald's Crocs.

558
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,620
You could get a deal on Will Ferrell elf cries.

559
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,060
Yeah, a lot of Crocs in there.

560
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,060
What's the deal like on those grimace Crocs?

561
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,740
Because I've been thinking those are new.

562
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,500
I don't think there's a deal.

563
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,700
I don't think there's a deal on those.

564
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,380
I think those are just sort of like telling you this is a limited edition.

565
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,740
Just letting you know that they exist.

566
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
I think so. Yeah, I can't.

567
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,980
I actually can't tell you that one.

568
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,300
Elf Crocs. And again, this is in the past listeners as you're hearing it.

569
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,500
Fifteen or five, sorry, fifty nine ninety nine with code save fifteen.

570
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,140
But you get I think the links to I'm not going to say the link out loud.

571
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,380
You kind of got to follow deal.

572
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,460
Right. Get it.

573
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,700
I mean, I'm not specifically against deal vibes necessarily.

574
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,820
No, no. Just that you said you had quit it.

575
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,660
You did that. That was the real issue.

576
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,180
We should say also, I think we're kind of getting to be

577
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,860
a little bit friendly with deal vibes as a result of all this,

578
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,580
because they got tagged in all everything that was going on.

579
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,580
And they, you know, they were tagged in Mike issuing a grave

580
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,260
threat about spitting in the face of the Minotaur.

581
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,700
Yeah. So they're seeing all this, whoever deal vibes is.

582
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,740
And they posted this may be my first even good publicity is bad publicity moment.

583
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,420
And then a picture of Thor that says, I have no idea what's going on.

584
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,180
And I tried to explain what we're a podcast about theme parks

585
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,700
and a Minotaur made one of our hosts, Mike, delete one of his many home screen

586
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,020
notifications, and he chose you deal vibes, but immediately

587
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,540
we followed you to get more deals on meatballs.

588
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,500
And now the Minotaur is mad.

589
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,100
But I guess that's not up to date anymore.

590
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,660
It seems like now what's happened is so deal vibes.

591
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,260
If you're listening, if you are on like a fair trade.

592
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,660
Yeah, we fight.

593
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,460
If we all follow deal vibes together, he should be paying for our Patreon.

594
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
I agree. Yeah, we're helping spread his deal.

595
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,540
I have gotten texts and messages from people in the wake of all this saying,

596
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,220
I started following deal vibes and I got some good stuff.

597
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,100
Do you know? Do you know what anybody called out as something that they got from deal

598
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
vibes? Oh, I should. I should look.

599
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,220
Some of there was some like really maybe a cheap couch on target

600
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,340
that somebody tweeted at me. They got like a brutally cheap.

601
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,500
Maybe like it was a glitch like it wouldn't last for like one move, but it's, you know,

602
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,020
you sit on it. No, I think it was just like somebody made an error

603
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,020
writing the price into the target website and they bought it for like 50 bucks or something.

604
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,260
Come on. I think I mean, I saw a deal for 100 feet of

605
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,580
perforated bubble wrap for only thirteen dollars, which is a forty nine dollar value.

606
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,100
Seems pretty good. You never have bubble wrap when you need it.

607
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,220
You just move, you know, you can see it and then it's lingers around

608
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,980
and then I throw it out and then the next day or two, of course, I need it.

609
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,180
That'd be fun to charge on.

610
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Imagine charging on 100 feet of bubble wrap.

611
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,380
My my hooves just hitting it just so satisfying.

612
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,980
I feel that good on fingers. I can only imagine on hooves.

613
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,020
Oh, you could.

614
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,940
Ian, a friend of the show, Ian Riccobani,

615
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,500
you texted me Saturday, November 4th, not for nothing.

616
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,500
I got a fucking steal on the new Mario via QVC due to deal vibes, by the way.

617
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,220
Mario wonder how much was it for?

618
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,580
I think it was thirty dollars.

619
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,020
Thirty dollars. Pretty good.

620
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,900
Oh, sure. Here, let me also let me also just add a little more

621
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,580
please context for what's going on here.

622
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,140
In my mind, I said, let me follow deal vibes and follow when the show comes out

623
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,900
and then follow it a week later and forgot.

624
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Wow. You knew you were going to get caught.

625
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,900
Well, I thought I didn't know I was going to get caught.

626
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,900
But I thought to myself, well, I could follow deal vibes surely for a few days

627
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,740
that unfollow when the show comes out, if anyone wants to search and snitch on me.

628
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,820
And look, things get in the way you forget sometimes.

629
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,740
So somewhere in the run of being a parent to a very young child,

630
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,380
doing three separate gates worth of theme park podcast content.

631
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,820
And again, having 200 home screen notifications

632
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,260
flooding into your phone at all times.

633
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,140
You forgot to do an unfollow.

634
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,780
I forgot to unfollow again as well to avoid this nasty business from even happening.

635
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,860
And look where we are.

636
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,340
Oh, I feel like I could put this to bed.

637
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,260
I think we just have one game of Arcana to the death.

638
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,140
All right, fine.

639
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,340
But you did hear that last part, right, though, to the death.

640
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,540
Yeah. Well, I mean, I generally deal things to the death.

641
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,220
If you got my labyrinth, I'll either kill you or you get the treasure.

642
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,260
And the treasure does. If you do get the treasure, you end up dying.

643
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,060
I perish.

644
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,740
Will you make bone broth ice cream out of me if I lose?

645
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,420
Oh, absolutely. You have great bones.

646
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,660
Do you think so? You got tall bones.

647
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,740
You think tall bones?

648
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,620
You can make a meteorite flavorful.

649
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,380
You think tall means flavorful?

650
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,420
It's like when you make a new like a noodles, you know, you really got to like

651
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,020
spread the, you know, like you got to like really knead the bread and spread it out.

652
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,340
Same thing with bones, like short little bones.

653
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,420
They're like they're like compact and they're still full of marrow.

654
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,380
Your long bones have stretched out.

655
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,460
So it's kind of the marrow is kind of kneaded in.

656
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,900
Do you think that sort of how like things that I do that keep me kind of youthful

657
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,980
in spirit also help keep my bones fresh?

658
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,620
Like like when I'm listening to young person's music and stuff,

659
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,780
like which I do often.

660
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
What's the young person's music?

661
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,820
Do you like Steely DeHaan?

662
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,940
No, no, no, no, no.

663
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,380
Like Olivia Rodrigo's guts.

664
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,460
Olivia Rodrigo's guts, which he listens to for a long time.

665
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,780
He listens to the second half finally.

666
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,260
But now he has heard the full album.

667
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,220
I've heard the full album since she's like 20.

668
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,740
She's a young person and I'm listening to music as if I'm just sort of a peer of hers.

669
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,140
So so would you think that's a fear of hanging out with Olivia at a party?

670
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,100
It's just a kind of a cool friend who looks like a tiny bit older, but barely barely.

671
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,980
You didn't even know.

672
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,860
You're very young.

673
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,900
Shred the boards.

674
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,380
We're all but performers on a stage.

675
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,660
You know, right?

676
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,180
Who's this character that entered?

677
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,860
Who's this character that entered the show?

678
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,340
I just let you love the theater.

679
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,020
It's just me.

680
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,820
You're saying that because Mike is a fellow performer with Olivia Rodrigo.

681
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,580
Yeah, they were camaraderie.

682
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,500
So you're saying that anyone who does anything on a stage should be able to get along.

683
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,980
Like I should be best friends with Jim Brewer because we're all that.

684
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,620
That's true. You have all the same values.

685
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,540
Yeah, you have the same beliefs.

686
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,580
We think all the same things.

687
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,220
Yeah, by the way, I don't like Jim Brewer.

688
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,060
Not for his current steps.

689
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,260
Current stuff is kind of interesting.

690
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,220
But for his old stuff, when he plays Goat Boy, that's kind of.

691
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,140
Oh, yeah.

692
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,740
It's kind of not cool to like play a hoover creature when you're not hoovered.

693
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,580
It's kind of like problematic.

694
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,780
It's just like, I don't know.

695
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,940
It's like we're not jokes.

696
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,180
Like we exist, you know, and I.

697
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,620
Yeah, we get it.

698
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,580
We got it.

699
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,100
I get it.

700
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,860
Yeah, I know. But don't don't cut him a break just for that.

701
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,180
You know, he should be, you know, and he is where he is now.

702
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,020
He's in right wing country as he should.

703
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:42,780
If you see any if you see any or hear any like minotaur comedy on a podcast,

704
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,780
you should pounce and make sure it never happens again.

705
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,580
I'll charge right at it.

706
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,940
It's not happening in my book.

707
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,460
Don't ever participate in it.

708
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,180
You guys first.

709
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,100
It's like I heard like, oh, there's like a minotaur thing that happened on the podcast.

710
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,020
And I go back and listen.

711
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,180
And I, you know, I go back to the backlog.

712
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,020
I only you know, I've been I only listen like the big right episodes.

713
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,420
But oh, yeah, yeah.

714
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,420
A lot of people do that.

715
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,980
Yeah, yeah.

716
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,340
Well, I'm not going to go in like what is like, you know, like David Copperfield.

717
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,820
All I did listen to that particular one.

718
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,900
That's like not the one I normally wouldn't listen to.

719
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,060
Oh, yeah. Well, that's the hovers.

720
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,580
And then we lure you into kind of the more niche topics, which, you know, to that end.

721
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,620
And I don't mean to cut any of this off, but we do.

722
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,820
Look, we you picked a hell of a one to walk into.

723
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,020
We've been looking forward to doing the today cafe a lot.

724
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,900
And at some point, we're going to have to get back to the business of covering the

725
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,940
restaurant based on the Today show.

726
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,740
Oh, that sounds great. Where's it at?

727
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,540
That's it. That's in.

728
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,700
It's in Universal Florida, like the original.

729
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,220
They don't have it here. They don't have it in Hollywood.

730
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,980
So you'd have to go to Florida for that.

731
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,860
But then you were saying you were kind of only like like big rides and stuff.

732
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,660
I mean, does it does today cafe feel to like niche to you or something?

733
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,020
I mean, it's like the biggest television show in the history of television.

734
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,420
Like, really, if you think about it.

735
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,540
You know, it's long running.

736
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,780
Yeah. Quite a while.

737
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,140
And the building is notable as it used to host the Beverly Hills Boulangerie,

738
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,260
which was a lot of getting back in this

739
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,740
20, 30, 30 years.

740
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,940
It was an opening day.

741
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,860
It was Blanchery.

742
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,580
But the first restaurant when you walk in any park is pretty common.

743
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,620
It's kind of generic.

744
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,260
They're going to get people hungry for breakfast. Sure.

745
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,940
But this is kind of a step up because it's

746
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,300
now that it's kind of some cool NBC synergy in effect.

747
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,340
I guess my question is, do you want to like we owe the listener

748
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,700
getting back to the today cafe?

749
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,500
They've all been begging and pleading.

750
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,900
Yeah, probably.

751
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,540
Tweeting at us angrily that we aren't.

752
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,100
If we really I really did plan to like come in here

753
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,100
like Gore Mike with my horns and leave, I wasn't going to take a lot of your time.

754
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,900
I really swear to God, I was like really planning on just a quick murder and gone.

755
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,580
But oh, wow. But now you've decided, you know,

756
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,980
be proud of him for a second.

757
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,100
I thought maybe we were going to like fight a little bit.

758
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,420
It's still good.

759
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,500
Yeah, I was originally going to do like a punch challenge

760
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,060
where we take turns punching each other.

761
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,300
OK, that doesn't seem as fun, honestly.

762
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,660
Well, how about this?

763
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,380
When I let's talk a little about the today cafe.

764
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,660
Sure. Minutes are feel free to hang out and participate.

765
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,940
Yeah, absolutely. You're a guest on the show at this point.

766
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,540
I feel friendly enough with you.

767
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,700
Hang out. Talk about today.

768
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,380
Cafe, we got a lot of great Al Roker stuff to talk about. Yeah.

769
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,660
And then if you guys want to fight it out a little bit while I do the plugs

770
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,500
at the end, maybe then that's up to you guys.

771
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,660
By the way, is one of the few people that got through by labyrinth.

772
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,620
He made it. That's how he got the job. That was his treasure.

773
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,500
That was what he that was the test that he had to pass to be like a guy

774
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,060
who's on television forever.

775
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,100
They killed so many local weathermen trying to figure out who,

776
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,180
you know, could take over the today show.

777
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,900
And Al Roker just went right through.

778
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,460
He's smart. You know, think about a labyrinth.

779
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,260
You just see the end and you go around and get lost. Right.

780
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,820
And then Minotaur comes kills you.

781
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,860
He went right up and over the walls.

782
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,260
So he just scaled it, which is probably you're probably like waiting for.

783
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,460
Why don't more people do that? That's the smart way to do it.

784
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,540
But like cheating is like part of how you get out of a labyrinth.

785
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,820
So yeah, yeah.

786
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,300
You know, vibes just I got an alert.

787
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,860
Twelve pack of Monster Energy Java Nitro Cold Brew.

788
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,580
Only six dollars after sub and save coupon on page at Amazon.

789
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,940
Jason, what do you think of that?

790
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:06,060
Um, Monster Energy Java usually patronize the monster brand.

791
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,820
I'm not a big energy drink guy.

792
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,500
But what if you added the coffee to it?

793
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,020
Yeah, I'm interested in the coffee.

794
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,260
Wait, is that the kind of thing you would drink? No.

795
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,020
Then why do you need to know that or see that?

796
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,980
Well, just because they're going to they're going to really like

797
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,820
cast the net very wide when it comes to deals.

798
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,060
So I'm just I'm bound to like something.

799
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,700
The fact that you also sorry to cut you off, Minotaur.

800
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,980
But the fact that you you not only refollowed,

801
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,740
you also turned to the home screen notifications back.

802
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,380
The entire premise of the thing went away in four days.

803
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,980
I forgot what the specific premise was.

804
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,340
It will. It was only home screen notification.

805
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,340
No, I know now. I remember now.

806
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,060
But you that's two steps.

807
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,140
You have to remember to go back and turn on a little green dial on your phone.

808
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,780
Well, that's the thing.

809
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,460
You're not going to get the deals unless you do it.

810
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
This is the trick. This is what people don't know.

811
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,900
And I shouldn't even reveal it because then I'm going to lose out on in

812
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,660
the next expansion pack for Lorcan, because they're not getting the alerts

813
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,500
directly sent to their home screen.

814
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,580
And you might miss out.

815
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,140
They might be sold out of limited edition Marvel

816
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,260
and Lucky Charms collab Loki Charms.

817
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,340
Imagine if you had to go through life, not having a box of Loki Charms.

818
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,620
Yeah. Which are mischievously delicious.

819
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,780
That's exclusive to Walmart.com, I think.

820
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,540
So you knew that?

821
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,180
Yeah, I knew about Loki Charms.

822
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,780
Oh, my God. You pulled that out.

823
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,260
But that's a Walmart exclusive.

824
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,580
I haven't even opened my box of Carmella Creeper yet.

825
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,060
I finished the Monster Mash.

826
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,780
You have a Carmella Creeper button open?

827
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,860
Carmella Creeper.

828
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,380
Oh, that's going to be like a collector's edition, I think.

829
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,300
Yeah. Oh, maybe.

830
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,540
I don't. Yeah.

831
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,660
We're not going to get into collecting cereal boxes.

832
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,060
Is that a hobby now?

833
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,220
People do it. I don't.

834
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,860
I don't do it.

835
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,140
So people do it somewhere.

836
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,100
Mustang. Oh, we'll see.

837
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,580
Well, I'm sure people are going to start some collections of today's show mugs,

838
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,860
because that's one of the things they have today.

839
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,660
Oh, yeah. They have the very kind of mug that the hosts of the show drink.

840
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,460
And the whole thing, we weren't even into the premise whatsoever.

841
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,340
It's kind of a recreation of Studio One A, where the show comes from.

842
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,900
So if you ever wanted to visit where they where the magic happens,

843
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,740
where Savannah and Hoda and Al entertain and wake up America each morn.

844
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
That's what you get to do right

845
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,700
towards the entrance of the park at Universal Orlando.

846
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,700
So what today's show is like, what's the iconic thing is the big glass

847
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,420
window wall, right? That's the is that the thing of the state is that

848
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,940
recreated in this cafe?

849
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,260
It's not giant.

850
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,900
I'll tell you that.

851
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,340
And I know you'd be looking for giant especially, but I'll pull.

852
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,820
I'll throw it to what Jason said.

853
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,300
You brought up the what it was originally Beverly Hills, Boulangerie.

854
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,860
And I saw pictures of that establishment and I thought it was very closed off

855
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,700
and a little like not as warm as it could be, not as vibrant as it can.

856
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,780
And they and I would say that the today show

857
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,460
can't the today cafe, not the today show cafe.

858
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,620
I know I keep wanting to say that.

859
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
I know. I know.

860
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,900
Well, here, you raise a hoof to make sure next time we do it, to make sure.

861
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,340
Don't let us say the wrong thing.

862
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,260
You've got to respect the cafe today.

863
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,460
Cafe. Well, it's respect.

864
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,060
The rhyme is really what it is.

865
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,180
Hey, look, there's very few.

866
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,300
The Beverly Hills, Boulangerie just opened with the rest of the park.

867
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,900
Today Cafe opened with the taping of Al Roker was down there during a remote.

868
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,060
He went down the receiving line of all your favorite universal friends.

869
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,460
Oh, I've been trying to find the video of Jimmy Fallon doing this.

870
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,860
I know we talked about that on the page.

871
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,620
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

872
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,060
A big high five line, because I'm pretty sure he must have high fived

873
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,100
the bunny from Hopp, who's voiced by Russell Brand.

874
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,820
Something everybody wants to be seen.

875
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,180
Wait, what year was this open?

876
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,460
What year is that line in there?

877
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,860
This this is twenty nineteen twenty nine.

878
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,620
This day cafe is new.

879
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,340
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

880
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,300
I guess we could have gone there last time we were there,

881
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
but we only did it.

882
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,580
We were just in Orlando.

883
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,460
Oh, I did. After we said that's when you were there.

884
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,860
Yeah. First, and I was just kind of waiting, eating my clip bar.

885
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,220
I brought from elsewhere.

886
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,060
So all right.

887
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,300
So your today cafe tip is eat somewhere else and use their chairs.

888
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,180
Well, I mean, I'm saying that's what I did.

889
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,460
But this time I made up for I bought it as you do with 1030

890
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,260
a.m. cannoli and wolf that down.

891
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,060
You were we've been having more meals together recently, I think, with traveling

892
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,460
and prepping for the travel.

893
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,300
I think I've seen you get dessert at every single one of them.

894
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,980
I don't think I've seen you.

895
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,380
Well, how reporter has to do the legwork?

896
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,780
We had a vacation.

897
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,940
Yeah, no, but I'm thinking of the.

898
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,060
Oh, full restaurant.

899
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,980
But watching you eat just like a fruit compote waffle is your lunch.

900
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,140
Not long ago.

901
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,060
Oh, yeah.

902
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,900
It was a place with waffle in the name.

903
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,580
Yes. You got to try the waffle.

904
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,140
It's like, oh, fresh strawberries.

905
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,260
That would be nice.

906
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,020
Can I ask you about your morning cannoli?

907
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,340
You get a coffee with it.

908
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,900
Did you dip the cannoli in the coffee?

909
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,220
Like I'd already had coffee that day.

910
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,380
Oh, yeah, that's that's I would do a morning cannoli now dipping the coffee

911
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,060
and like some of the cream inside the cannoli would get in the car.

912
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
That sounds good.

913
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,180
That sounds like a nice.

914
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,380
Well, that's solid.

915
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,020
And having that with the penguins from Madagascar, Al Rooker

916
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,660
and a full of minions.

917
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,740
You know, lovely.

918
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,540
Wow. Wow. Wow. All our favorites. Yeah.

919
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,540
I did. I did somewhat of a high five line.

920
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,860
I was in Universal Studios, Osaka every once in a while.

921
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,340
I get to travel. Oh, yeah.

922
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,660
And I have my travel bag because I was going to be in Osaka for a little bit.

923
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,180
I have my travel bag in in the in the locker.

924
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,140
They have lockers at the front down Universal City Walk, kind of like right

925
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,220
when you go to the entrance.

926
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,700
And I found one in the back back corner because I had everything in there.

927
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,380
I was very nervous about losing it.

928
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,820
And I was leaving the park because I had to catch a train.

929
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,020
And I pulled my bag out and I and I hear this music and it's like

930
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,700
celebrate good times come on and a line.

931
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,820
I'm not joking. 30 Minions walked around the corner.

932
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
The 30 like in a costume.

933
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,340
And they were and they were very much walking like they were like not on shift.

934
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,980
They were walking, not like minions.

935
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,100
And then because they thought they were alone at this point of the park.

936
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,860
Then they saw me and they had to start acting like minions.

937
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,380
And I was just into it. So I started high fiving them.

938
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,820
And they just didn't stop coming in. I high fived every minion. Wow.

939
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,860
It was an incredible experience.

940
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,180
What a dream. Magic. I'll never forget.

941
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,740
That is awesome. It's so cool. Wow.

942
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,100
And the loopiness of that, you're on the other side of the way.

943
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,620
I mean, I assume your base is kind of more I don't know where you live exactly.

944
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,820
Kind of the California area. The labyrinth.

945
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,180
I live in the labyrinth. Right. Right.

946
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,700
Yeah. There's probably this labyrinthian parts that can take you like burrow

947
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,980
under the world. Sure. Yeah.

948
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,220
You've got to pop out of many different places in the labyrinth.

949
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,140
Yeah, that's right. That's nice. That makes travel pretty easy.

950
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,020
It takes a while. It's so convenient.

951
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,180
You know, know where you're going, but not everybody does.

952
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Sure. Sure. Just get a real fast charge going.

953
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,860
That means that you have been to or at least maybe just

954
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,580
you must have might have had to charge right through it.

955
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,540
But CityWalk, Osaka.

956
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,780
Yes, I did go to CityWalk, Osaka.

957
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,860
You're a rare person, rare or rare being, I guess,

958
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,900
we've had on the show who's been to CityWalk, Osaka.

959
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,980
I don't want to skip ahead because we still have to deal with Orlando.

960
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,220
We've got our work cut out for us Orlando wise.

961
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,740
Anything interesting in notable you noticed in CityWalk, Japan?

962
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,420
Who's been to CityWalk, Osaka? CityWalk, Osaka?

963
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,020
No, never. No one here has.

964
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,540
So there is a store at the very beginning of it.

965
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,900
And I don't know what's around. I went in 2019.

966
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:19,380
There's a store that's like like America Cowboy Store.

967
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,860
Like I think it's called Western America or something like that.

968
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,020
And you walk in and it's like it's all American

969
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,500
kitschy stuff and cowboy things and American flags.

970
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,140
They sell like it's like a cowboy store.

971
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,220
And they have like an arcade, like shoot them up game.

972
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,380
And like you draw a pilgrim gate. And it was really amazing.

973
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,540
But then then what's almost more surreal besides that, it's just like

974
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,900
seeing a bubblegum shrimp in Osaka seems.

975
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,260
They still.

976
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,980
So if we ever were to do the CityWalk, Japan Saga, we would have.

977
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,860
We have once again be back.

978
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,580
Yes, if when when when when when I go, we're going to have to.

979
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,660
We will once again have to handle Bubba Gump.

980
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,180
There's the third time, maybe more depending on.

981
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,380
I don't know where else we're going to go.

982
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,700
There's also a TGI Fridays.

983
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,420
I believe so. I mean, I think there's a conventional everything.

984
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,780
There's a few conventional restaurants.

985
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,020
Yeah. TGI Fridays, a Bubba Gump.

986
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,260
And I got Tokyo Dome City as a bubblegum and TGI.

987
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
Does it really? I thought so.

988
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,220
I'm not sure.

989
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,420
I got to go back and look at look at my photos and see.

990
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,620
But yeah, you know what?

991
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,900
I think that Universal Japan still has this restaurant,

992
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,500
Beverly Hills Boulangerie, I think because it was just one of their like

993
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,940
they probably recreated the kind of generic

994
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,140
Hollywood Beverly Hills like opening area. Yeah.

995
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,260
So I think they have and probably the Today Show means nothing to them.

996
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,260
So they don't have a cafe.

997
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,100
But you might have passed right by that

998
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,820
that Beverly Hills Boulangerie, the thing we've been talking about.

999
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,500
Wow. That that would be incredible.

1000
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,420
I just didn't even know like two ships in the night.

1001
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,620
Something we didn't know about or care about until cultural days ago.

1002
00:42:54,620 --> 00:43:00,220
Dangerous clammy club sandwiches on the other side of the world.

1003
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,140
To our Japanese brothers and sisters.

1004
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,460
Well, what's some other stuff about this place?

1005
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,180
Well, all right. So you had a canola.

1006
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,860
How did you feel about that canola?

1007
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,580
I thought it was good. Yeah.

1008
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,620
I thought it was pretty solid.

1009
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,580
Jane really like the breakfast sandwich on everything.

1010
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,780
Croissant.

1011
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,140
Oh, no. Oh, go ahead.

1012
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,820
It's actually smashed avocado, devine, tomatoes, which

1013
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,500
devine tomato. I looked it up.

1014
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,900
It's just roasted tomatoes on everything.

1015
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,740
Bagel seasoning, croissant served with side of fruit.

1016
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,060
She did that without the sausage, but she had high marks for that.

1017
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,100
I'm going to confuse you a little here

1018
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,980
because do you remember what that was called by any chance?

1019
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,060
Was it just like, oh, that was just breakfast sandwich.

1020
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,380
Everything, croissant.

1021
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,860
Here's a weird thing that they do at this place.

1022
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:54,020
And maybe this this almost in a way mirrors the kind of bizarre politics

1023
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,620
and infighting that we know about from the Today Show over the years.

1024
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,900
You started saying that sandwich recipe.

1025
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,180
I'm like, that sounds familiar because I looked that up

1026
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,780
because I watched a segment from a couple of years ago

1027
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,180
where that was called Savannah's Dream Croissant Sandwich.

1028
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,620
And now it's just called breakfast.

1029
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,220
Croissant sandwich.

1030
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,420
Yeah. What happened?

1031
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,780
Why was Savannah Guthrie stripped of her sandwich title?

1032
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,860
Which is very odd because she's kind of I would say the rock of the Today Show.

1033
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,900
Like I used to catch 20, 30 minutes of the Day Show when I was getting ready

1034
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,340
for my old job.

1035
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,900
And I was like, oh, I like Savannah Guthrie.

1036
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,060
She's like personable and normal.

1037
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,420
And has weathered all the storms of the Today Show.

1038
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:43,180
Her and Al Roker and later in the day, Hoda and Kathy Lee.

1039
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,860
Kathy Lee, I believe, is retired at this point.

1040
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,940
I don't think she's there. Not there anymore.

1041
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,700
Not there.

1042
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,300
I know that. And Jenna Bush.

1043
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,700
Jenna is there.

1044
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
Not in a Bush.

1045
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,460
George W. Bush's daughter.

1046
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,820
Her daughter. Yeah, the party girl.

1047
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,220
She's not partying anymore.

1048
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,020
I know. She's grown up.

1049
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,540
Yeah, grown up.

1050
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:06,540
And she's got some things to say about international events, unfortunately.

1051
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Oh, no, no, no.

1052
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,820
And she's going to be honest.

1053
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,700
You get away with more of that.

1054
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,620
She just went by Jenna Hager.

1055
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,660
Why does she have to like you still carry the book?

1056
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,540
I mean, I get it. It's how she got the job.

1057
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,700
But it's also like, you don't have to, you know, yeah.

1058
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,220
Like day to day.

1059
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,100
I've seen is so great anymore.

1060
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,980
Yeah, yeah.

1061
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,100
Although as time goes by, we all forget.

1062
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,860
We start forgiving the bushes.

1063
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,180
Everyone pretends being happy with their performances on the third hour

1064
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,140
of the Today show.

1065
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:38,020
I like I'm sort of endeared, though, weirdly, to Jenna Bush from her pre

1066
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:42,180
Hager went because she is in there's all these.

1067
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,620
Have I ever talked to the show before about the the videos that they made

1068
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,540
for the White House dog, Barney, the Bush dog, Barney?

1069
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,580
Oh, maybe they made every year.

1070
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,100
This is the kind of thing that's like this is fucking toast and Trump era.

1071
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,740
No, I'm not making little dog videos.

1072
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,260
But every year they made a different thing where George W.

1073
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,100
Bush had to like act with his dog and like got big responsibility.

1074
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,580
Barney, we got to clear out all we got to get this tree going.

1075
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,180
I get that tinsel up.

1076
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,660
And she, Jenna was the worst actor in the entire thing.

1077
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,420
My leaps and bounds like, yes, Barney,

1078
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,620
oh, you are excited for another classic holiday around the White House.

1079
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,060
And she's looking every which way.

1080
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,980
She does not know how to be on camera. Just screaming.

1081
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,900
I can't believe that she is a daily television personality from her beginning.

1082
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,180
I mean, she has come a long way, although I wish she I wish she was still as like

1083
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,300
funny and cruddy as she was in the Barney holiday video.

1084
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,900
Well, they do.

1085
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,940
Well, first off, today's show is like what?

1086
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,340
Four hours of broad. Four hours. Yeah.

1087
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,780
So like occasionally, like we learned recently about, you know,

1088
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,220
Copperfield based events.

1089
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,420
And it's like, oh, Carson Daly pops in.

1090
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,500
It does hosting on the today show.

1091
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,220
That's true. You seem very shocked by that.

1092
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,660
I feel like you had never heard that Carson Daly was a host.

1093
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:05,420
I knew they kept him like on contract, but it didn't dawn on me when he is.

1094
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,780
I had seen him host other NBC stuff after his show ended.

1095
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,180
But he didn't dawn on me. Yeah. Yeah.

1096
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,060
Boys, he's on the news right now.

1097
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,180
Is he permanent New Year's? Right?

1098
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,140
I'm not sure the status of the permanent

1099
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,140
ness of his hosting duties. I'm not sure of any. Yeah.

1100
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,740
Is anyone?

1101
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,700
Well, but I mean, there's Seacrest.

1102
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,100
There's the Andy Cohen.

1103
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,140
There's I don't know who's permanent and who's not.

1104
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,820
I don't know. I think he's been on New Year's.

1105
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,020
I'm not sure. We haven't seen the contracts.

1106
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,020
I can't speak to how permanent is.

1107
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,940
Carson Daly's rocket New Year's Eve.

1108
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,780
No, it's still Dick Clark's rocket.

1109
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,900
Dick Clark has it in his ironclad contract that it's still called

1110
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,740
Dick Clark's rocket New Year's Eve.

1111
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,820
Wow. For some stupid reason.

1112
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,340
A Minotaur level of like seeing these things through, following the letter

1113
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,660
of the law, you feel like Dick Clark would, you know, charge back up.

1114
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,780
Here, if you ever saw that name come off the right.

1115
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,580
If you're in Hades right now, talk to my dad, Zeus.

1116
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,420
He will get you back on the show. He can get you back.

1117
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,500
Dick Clark will have a bowlhead, but he could get you back.

1118
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,460
There will be his hand goes right through Hollywood Forever Cemetery lawn.

1119
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,420
As soon as they get rid of that name, he's coming fucking back.

1120
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,260
That'd be the baby, the biggest ratings you've ever seen.

1121
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,820
We'd finally be excited about New Year's.

1122
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,940
Oh, zombie Dick Clark introducing Megan Trainor.

1123
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:28,700
Olivia Rodriguez, Rodrigo, Rodrigo, he knows that he might has.

1124
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,300
You didn't stop at the first half of her last name.

1125
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,060
Did you know that young people are back on in sync?

1126
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,740
In sync is now popular among young people again.

1127
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,380
Well, they reunite and they have a song.

1128
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,540
The Trolls Trolls Trolls Trolls did hot ones around hot ones.

1129
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:50,660
I was I was I saw a group of kids all like 15, 16, 17, and they were

1130
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,220
they had windows down. They were blasting an in sync song.

1131
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,780
And they were just like, they're like, this is like a classic one.

1132
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,820
Yeah, like one of the tearing up my heart.

1133
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,420
OK, you're one of those like ones.

1134
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,500
I think I've been much stranger if they were blasting the new one, the trolls.

1135
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,620
Yeah. They're troll soundtrack fans.

1136
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,700
Well, it's like us when we were young, cool high schoolers

1137
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,980
and we had the windows down with a CD of Sean on up.

1138
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,100
The big Sean on our revival.

1139
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,940
We are part of the revivals in the 90s, 2000s.

1140
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,860
Did you did you eat or drink anything at the Today Cafe?

1141
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,860
I had a coffee. Well, how was it?

1142
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,700
Exclusive, exclusive roast of coffee.

1143
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,260
How was that was the roast of the dark light?

1144
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,060
I felt like it was a medium roast.

1145
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,580
I didn't feel like it was.

1146
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,820
Yeah. Yeah.

1147
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:42,020
But I mean, they put a lot of creamer in there, so it's kind of just, you know,

1148
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,820
we've got to pre-made so you don't you don't take your coffee black.

1149
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,220
No, I do. I do.

1150
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,220
Or she don't.

1151
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,180
Is that an insult against my man and my manhood?

1152
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,340
You know, I drink it however you want.

1153
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,940
You know, the caramel drops or whatever the hell you put it in.

1154
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,940
Oh, karma. I don't have caramel drops, but I do.

1155
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,100
Yeah, I could drink it black, though.

1156
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,340
OK, OK. I could do it.

1157
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,460
We don't all drink our coffee, have our base goods

1158
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,180
with like a squeeze of of ocular jelly.

1159
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:14,620
Oh, I just I just I just chew the beans and I greased up all ocular jelly.

1160
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,460
But I used to just put it in there.

1161
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,820
You know, however you want, but you know, that's why I have it.

1162
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,500
Now, sure, there's the there's the food, which is all kind of like

1163
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,100
the sandwiches are all like New York seems like the idea here.

1164
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,420
The Carnegie platter and the big apple cheese platter,

1165
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,780
the bulls and the bears platter is because of the sketch.

1166
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,140
Why or is it because of bull market?

1167
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,140
I think it's a market.

1168
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,340
I believe it's a market thing.

1169
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,260
Yeah. OK.

1170
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,020
And I know I go to the Today show for all my financial suggestions.

1171
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,180
You know, Kramer's off, you know, because he's pretty sharp.

1172
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,260
Yeah. In the rare event.

1173
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,420
The Kramer host a New Year's Eve event.

1174
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,580
Do we know? Oh, just yelling about.

1175
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,500
Yeah. The CNBC New Year's.

1176
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,780
Well, he was one of those people hiding in the Bernie Sanders talking in the primaries.

1177
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,700
I think Jim Kramer and no, he was one of the guys scared.

1178
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,940
He was about to get his head lopped off.

1179
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,260
Yeah, that's right.

1180
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,180
Glad he's OK. Yeah. Yeah.

1181
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,420
This is so embarrassing because of, you know, who I am,

1182
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,900
but I actually could never tell there's been a bull in a bear market.

1183
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,500
Which one's good? Which one's bad?

1184
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,860
You're not. I don't think we're the people to ask.

1185
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,780
I don't know. I know the answer.

1186
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,860
I think if you know how to play them, they're both advantageous.

1187
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,420
Well, that's true. That's right.

1188
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,420
He's right about that.

1189
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,180
Bull is good bulls when everything's going up.

1190
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,220
The rise bear is when everything's going down.

1191
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,540
It's bearing down. Yeah, that makes sense.

1192
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,620
Yeah. Yeah. I like that.

1193
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,580
I think that's cool.

1194
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,540
Well, because you're sort of bull like you're there.

1195
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,420
And I'm half bull, not like bullish bull.

1196
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,660
I'm bullish, which is what they say about the market.

1197
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,460
It's bullish or bearish. It's right. Yeah.

1198
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,220
And I'm you know, I've been bullish on the episode, I think, since you

1199
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,580
I mean, as much I like, I'm glad I thought it was going to be a packed one.

1200
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,900
But now that I've heard, you know, like they were kind of talking about,

1201
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,500
like the coffee was fine, the cannoli was fine.

1202
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,180
It's almost like maybe this kind of was one where there was some room to

1203
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,060
to chat with a mentor for a little bit.

1204
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,900
Oh, I'm sure.

1205
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,900
But I know people want to hear about the Today Show Cafe.

1206
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,220
So start at night. 2019.

1207
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,140
Yes. Yeah, you're right.

1208
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,420
Well, let's make sure we get our facts.

1209
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,700
Yeah. Well, it opened in May.

1210
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,580
Opening ceremony with Al Roker.

1211
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,660
I mean, like the thing that we got to give a little love to before we

1212
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,380
we wind it down, unless anybody had big.

1213
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,740
I did. You guys have like special guests are going to come into the garage.

1214
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,180
Well, we're crowded out now by what's happened.

1215
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,780
Well, like Randy Runyon's great grandson

1216
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,300
happens to be around the corner.

1217
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,380
And I'm waiting for him to show up because he's going to put on his great

1218
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,660
grandfather's choco outfit and run in here.

1219
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,340
But I guess I don't know, maybe we're a little too packed.

1220
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,660
Oh, we don't have time for it.

1221
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,780
Young Sheldon was hanging out in his car and I texted him.

1222
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,380
I was like, hey, man, it's getting too packed. This one.

1223
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,980
You know, man, you know, but you just meet me in an outburger.

1224
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,820
I'll be there soon.

1225
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,100
I just got canceled, though. He must be so bummed.

1226
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,500
Young Sheldon got canceled. Yeah. Yeah.

1227
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,540
The show, the show, not.

1228
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,900
Oh, I know.

1229
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,300
He's great. He's a great guy.

1230
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1231
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,020
Young Sheldon is fine. The show is canceled.

1232
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,220
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The old the old kind of guy. Yeah.

1233
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,580
Yeah. I but here's let's talk for a second.

1234
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,900
The thing I mentioned at the beginning, which is so a couple of months ago,

1235
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,660
Minotaur, they introduced as I was saying, they kind of shift these hosts

1236
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,900
around. They like are at Savannah has an everything croissant one day

1237
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,820
and then her name's not on it the next day.

1238
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,820
It's like they're trying to keep these hosts on their toes.

1239
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,420
When she in this very segment brought up to Al, don't you have an avocado toast?

1240
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,460
He said kind of rushing through it like, oh, I think they took that off

1241
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,220
for one or two years ago.

1242
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,100
And so like, what is this?

1243
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:03,300
Why are they hiring and retiring hosts in terms of sandwich ownership?

1244
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,700
Good question.

1245
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,100
Al has a different item, but she doesn't.

1246
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,620
Yeah. Yeah. She wasn't given the opportunity.

1247
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:14,540
No, it was originally opened with like the marketing of like.

1248
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:18,700
And a lot of these are Al Roker's recipes because he's written a lot of cookbooks

1249
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,820
over the years. OK.

1250
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,900
A more healthy.

1251
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,340
He did keto for a while. Right.

1252
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,420
Lost a bunch of weight doing that.

1253
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,980
So I think there are some healthier things on the menu.

1254
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,100
It is funny. They led with that marketing of like it's Al.

1255
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,860
Al's recipes and it's healthy.

1256
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,380
There are a lot of sweets on the menu.

1257
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,580
Yeah, it's so much. Yeah.

1258
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,700
Confetti cake.

1259
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,500
Where there's big macarons on top.

1260
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,540
You do want some sweets with your coffee.

1261
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,260
You're at a theme park. You're having fun.

1262
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,180
I believe they used to.

1263
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,260
I almost got it.

1264
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:56,620
I think last time I was there, they had like, oh, a chicken biscuit sliders.

1265
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,020
I was like, oh, that sounds good.

1266
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,220
And then it said that's that grilled chicken.

1267
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,300
Oh, grill. Oh, grill.

1268
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,780
I was like, oh, I'm not a grill of the chicken at the bar.

1269
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,500
It's usually pretty gross.

1270
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,500
Very can I say something about grilled chicken, though, in general?

1271
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,580
Because I feel like health wise, if we could have just gotten away

1272
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:17,060
from chicken nuggets and gotten more towards pieces of grilled chicken,

1273
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,340
I feel like maybe we like I don't always want to fried things.

1274
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,660
Really, what I'm saying, you go to a state fair, you go to any

1275
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,780
almost any fast food restaurant, you're not often even given the option

1276
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,940
to not have like a fried piece of chicken.

1277
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,900
If we just had grilled chicken on the menu,

1278
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,100
you could even have like little tenders and you could dip

1279
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,900
the grilled chicken in some sauce and you get your flavor that way.

1280
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,980
I just feel like it's usually underseasoned or dried out.

1281
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,220
Oh, but that's correct.

1282
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,060
I also think your premise is strange.

1283
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,820
I was at a restaurant last night where there was the full gamut of options.

1284
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,020
Was it a fast food?

1285
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,060
Food? Fast food restaurant was not a fast.

1286
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,100
Oh, you're talking about.

1287
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,180
Oh, I'm talking about. Yeah.

1288
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,460
Food isn't going to.

1289
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,060
Why are you going to fast food for grilled chicken?

1290
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,780
Because I want once in a while, if you need to eat something late or or quick,

1291
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,500
you know, you don't necessarily want the worst thing you could possibly eat.

1292
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,940
Don't you think you'd be immediately complaining about how crappy the grill

1293
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,140
would be bad, but the sauce would make it taste better

1294
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,220
because the sauces are always very good. That's true.

1295
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:16,420
I want to sauce counteract the healthiness of the to some degree it does.

1296
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,180
But at least the fried, we should not get in the fried stuff.

1297
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,380
OK, but I think the fried stuff easier to make in big portions

1298
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,180
and usually more consistent.

1299
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,940
I tried the blackened chicken sandwich of Popeyes and it was nasty.

1300
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,180
Yeah, your point is like think about a fried thing.

1301
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,140
It's frozen.

1302
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,860
The it's easier to do.

1303
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,860
I understand. Inside it is juicy.

1304
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,980
Even if it's on a heat lamp.

1305
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,460
Well, it's easier to do, but also because it's easy.

1306
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,340
Well, it's easier to do.

1307
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,180
And it also tastes better when it's bad.

1308
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,820
Yeah. Yeah. That's also an issue with it.

1309
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,820
I'm just saying once in a while, if I'm like trying to get something quick,

1310
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,020
it would be nice to McDonald's.

1311
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,660
They don't McDonald's even have like an option for a grilled chicken sandwich.

1312
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,260
You can't even get a grilled chicken.

1313
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,380
There you go. But it all is bad.

1314
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,980
All of the fast food is well, I would eat the whole thing.

1315
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,340
But I know for you guys, you wouldn't want to eat it with even a little bit

1316
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,940
of pink in there and you'd have a teenager make it be bad.

1317
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,820
Well, you like it with.

1318
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:15,060
Yeah. No, your way of chicken preparation is like feathered, beaked alive,

1319
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,060
feathered, beaked alive.

1320
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:20,020
That's your one of my victims that I bite that guy's head off with the chicken

1321
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,060
inside of it. And then the chicken double up.

1322
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,940
Yeah. Chicken is in your stomach alive for at least an hour.

1323
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,940
Making for a streaming and agony.

1324
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:27,980
The juices. Yeah.

1325
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,140
Before you can listen to hear the juices destroying it, your stomach acid

1326
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,580
destroying the chicken and then you get and you I assume you get some sort of

1327
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,500
like arousal from hearing the chicken dying.

1328
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,780
All right. No, hold on.

1329
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,100
I don't talk about my sexual dispersal.

1330
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,340
Well, you're an evil creature, obviously, like you're getting off.

1331
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,260
You're getting off on your Minotaur.

1332
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,980
You're getting on, Mike, everyone.

1333
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,100
And you know, we're probably ending this episode.

1334
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,780
Maybe we won't be trimming anything out conveniently.

1335
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,780
You're getting your fucking rocks off hearing a chicken scream.

1336
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,740
You won't even recognize us as sexual creatures, but you're King

1337
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:06,460
Shearing. Well, I'm OK with certain boundaries, but yeah.

1338
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,300
You won't do Jason eats chicken McNuggets.

1339
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,740
He gets his rocks off, too.

1340
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,220
It's the same fucking thing.

1341
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,660
That's not on Mike.

1342
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,220
Bring up that Jason gets aroused when eating chicken McNuggets.

1343
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,580
That actually is the time the dipping sauce is still a lot of the heavy left.

1344
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,620
Yeah, you mean some special hard made.

1345
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,020
Erotic. They come in a little too.

1346
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,220
Yeah. There's Mambo and sweet and spicy jam right now.

1347
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,180
They will charge you extra for that.

1348
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,900
What do you think about that?

1349
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,820
What do you think about Mambo and sweet and spicy?

1350
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,940
Mambo is very good.

1351
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,380
I didn't try the sweet and spicy jam because I heard it's just jam.

1352
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,100
But I like the sweet and spicy jam more than the Mambo.

1353
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,100
I do. I don't think it's a great execution of Mambo.

1354
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,300
Mambo is the regional DC sauce on a lot of stuff.

1355
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,300
Is that right? Yeah, I'm not familiar with it.

1356
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,660
I don't know anything that's like an analog to a but let me tell you about sweet and spicy jam.

1357
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,300
You get a sausage, egg and cheese McGriddle.

1358
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,740
Yeah, take that sweet and spicy jam.

1359
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,340
You put it on top of there a little bit sweet with the with the spice, that sausage patty.

1360
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,540
It is a good, good breakfast.

1361
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,140
That sounds good. It sounds good. Yeah.

1362
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,380
Or even just a sweet and spicy jam on a plain hash brown, that crunch

1363
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,140
and the sweet and spicy jam.

1364
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,820
I highly recommend it.

1365
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,220
Yeah, I hear that.

1366
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,380
I'm going to snap my man.

1367
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,620
I know you're a big fast food guy.

1368
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,620
I remember for the one time a year I go to McDonald's.

1369
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,020
And then I regret it immediately.

1370
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,420
You love the YouTube channels where it's someone eating the new fast

1371
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,980
food items in their cars.

1372
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,500
Oh, God.

1373
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,180
Are you watching? It doesn't sound sad.

1374
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,860
Are you watching my new guy, Luke Foods?

1375
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,140
No, I watch.

1376
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,140
Because I'm into my this is a new guy, Luke Foods, and he just tried

1377
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,740
Indian food for the first time a couple of weeks ago and it was going viral.

1378
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,020
You saw Luke Foods. OK.

1379
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,820
Oh, I saw the Indian food, the guy in the shirt and tie.

1380
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,980
And he was really sweet.

1381
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:49,940
He's just very nice.

1382
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,980
He was in Nintendo Land the other day yesterday.

1383
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,100
Oh, wow. He's really making the thing of it.

1384
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,820
Yeah. What did he think of that food?

1385
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,820
I haven't watched it, actually. Yeah. I just saw he was there.

1386
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:01,180
She's if I go to Nintendo Land first time, what's the number one thing

1387
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,340
I should eat besides toad?

1388
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:06,620
I'm going to eat some some some food from home before you get there.

1389
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,460
Yeah, far from.

1390
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,860
I like the little cake that looks like the green like hills.

1391
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,180
You tell us. Yeah, that's pretty.

1392
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,540
Yeah, a little tear. Yeah.

1393
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,420
And there's a little flag that goes in.

1394
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,460
Yeah, dessert.

1395
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,900
But then you would be shocked by the level of rigor,

1396
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,580
more role of like what it takes to get a cute little dessert.

1397
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,220
Yeah, you have to have a reservation.

1398
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,420
Stool cafe.

1399
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,860
Unless that's not the case anymore.

1400
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:32,980
I don't know. Yeah.

1401
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,700
It was when I was there in November.

1402
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,420
It's still like insane there.

1403
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:42,100
There's still the ad hoc website set up with the reservation.

1404
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,340
I thought that was a mistake.

1405
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,380
It was the shadiest website that a theme park has sent me to,

1406
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,340
and that includes Go Dotcom.

1407
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,620
I live in a labyrinth and I'm scared to go to Nintendo Land.

1408
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,300
I'm like worried I'm going to be stuck in a line and I'm going to be like,

1409
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,340
oh, this is where I'm too much of a home.

1410
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,700
You know what I mean? Yeah, I hear you.

1411
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,820
Yeah, even the other lot.

1412
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,660
Yeah, you live in a labyrinth.

1413
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,220
And yet I think that the the Genie Plus lightning lane situation,

1414
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,780
Mike can found you not to mention as much as me.

1415
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,820
New brand new ride.

1416
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,300
They could have engineered it any way they want to.

1417
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,580
Apparently doesn't fit Minotaur sized people.

1418
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,060
Ah, yes.

1419
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,620
On a video game where Donkey Kong and Bowser

1420
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,380
Bowser can be in a cart.

1421
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,060
It's unbelievable that the Minotaur couldn't fit in there.

1422
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,380
And unlock incredible powers with their size and heft.

1423
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,620
You can get you can get going so fast if you're one of them.

1424
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,540
You can get going on acceleration.

1425
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,740
No, yeah, but they're not there.

1426
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,700
They wouldn't even be allowed.

1427
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,100
Wario would be turned away.

1428
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,620
Listen, I can understand like the Harry Potter ride

1429
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,420
being not Minotaur sized people, but like, but

1430
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,700
but the life of pets.

1431
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,900
Come on. What are you doing?

1432
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,980
That's a that's a flippin dark ride.

1433
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,180
You can't fit on that.

1434
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,340
They could have made that any way they want to.

1435
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,260
Could have done it. Yeah.

1436
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,660
One mile an hour.

1437
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,180
You know, feels like they just have it against Minotaur's

1438
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,700
and people the size of Minotaur's, to be honest.

1439
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,580
Like they literally could do it any way they want to.

1440
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,660
That's how they chose.

1441
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,940
Sorry, I'm out of my hobby horse.

1442
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,300
Oh, I understand what you mean.

1443
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,620
Yeah, this is your area.

1444
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,340
Our guests get to express any theme park opinions they have.

1445
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,300
And I'm glad you're here.

1446
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,380
And then you have a bunch that you've been to Osaka.

1447
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,700
One thing that I think you'd be but that ride was wouldn't really do it for you.

1448
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,020
Because part of the novelty is like you see yourself on a screen

1449
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,700
and it's like you're a little animal.

1450
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,420
You're a little puppy, but you're already half right.

1451
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,420
I don't want to get anything wrong.

1452
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,580
Oh, yeah.

1453
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,660
So just filling in that extra half wouldn't be that fun for you.

1454
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:28,540
I'd be OK because I would be one third ball, one third human, one third puppy.

1455
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,700
I think that's kind of cute.

1456
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,980
I think that'd be kind of fun.

1457
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,580
And then you get adopted at the end.

1458
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,300
Oh, really? Yeah.

1459
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,540
That's what happens.

1460
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,620
Thanks for selling me on a ride.

1461
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,300
I can't go. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1462
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,140
I'm sorry. I was trying to tell you.

1463
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:41,500
Keep stepping in it.

1464
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,140
I tell you, let me go back to what I was saying a little while ago,

1465
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:50,460
which is that they they they trade these hosts in and out in a very cruel fashion.

1466
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,940
But sometimes they throw them a bone and Al and Al Roker gets to rise back

1467
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,540
to the top and have a new item.

1468
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:00,780
Now, I don't know if anybody in our group tried Al Roker's butternut squash tart.

1469
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,460
So I can't really speak to that.

1470
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,740
I'm going on a little bit of a tangent here

1471
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:12,780
because I'm going to show a video from when he debuted Al's butternut squash tart.

1472
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:18,940
They sent Al down to Orlando to talk about not just the tart.

1473
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,500
I guess they thought the tart wouldn't fill an entire segment.

1474
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,540
So they decided that maybe he should talk about some other stuff

1475
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:28,660
like the Minion attractions that are are pretty new down there.

1476
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,340
The whole Minion land and the Minion Cafe.

1477
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,660
And he talks a little bit about the Minion Cafe.

1478
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,700
And I found Al Roker's thoughts on this a little bit more interesting than his tart.

1479
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,460
Minion brains when they when they bring it out, it looks it looks grim,

1480
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,180
but it tastes fantastic.

1481
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,460
There's a lot of yellow.

1482
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,500
OK, it is this.

1483
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,820
Al had the soup that that looks like Minion brains.

1484
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:24,140
And now I heard that and thought, well, that maybe that's something that they have.

1485
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:27,620
But then I looked up the actual name of the item.

1486
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,940
This is just called Otto's Noodle Bowl.

1487
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,820
Yeah, this is not called Minion.

1488
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,380
I actually remember seeing it.

1489
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:37,460
Yeah, I saw this. OK, it's just a bowl that looks like a minion, right?

1490
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,180
It does a regular soup. Yes, this is a visual clarity.

1491
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:45,420
You're correct that like it comes in a clear bowl.

1492
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:50,580
And the yellow is provided not by the bowl itself, but by the noodles,

1493
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,100
which are bright yellow.

1494
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,900
And then you kind of like turn it and dump it onto your plate

1495
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,540
and mix it with the other ingredients.

1496
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:02,180
But I don't think the intention here was for it to be Minion brain soup,

1497
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,460
which makes it all the more strange when the host kind of grimace

1498
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:09,340
and then he says, sounds grim, but tastes great.

1499
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,300
That was because I had a difference.

1500
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,460
I had the green tomato soup, which I think is just tomato soup.

1501
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,620
But it doesn't look like a brain or a liver.

1502
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,740
And I know there was pork belly in it.

1503
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:24,500
There was Minions, pork belly, some little red flavor.

1504
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:25,900
And a tomato soup.

1505
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,500
It was surprisingly good.

1506
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,340
And then it came with a little pimento cheese, grilled cheese.

1507
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,300
It was delicious.

1508
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,580
Yeah, that sounds like, you know, I, you know, just like we're going to end up

1509
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,660
like pining for the other restaurant instead of the one we're supposed

1510
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,580
to be talking about. Yeah. As Al did, I thought Al was more fascinating

1511
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,300
talking about Minion Cafe.

1512
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,020
We haven't even gotten into these tots.

1513
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,020
I'm excited to hear about the tots.

1514
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,300
By the way, I also like that clip how he was actively trying to ferment

1515
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,860
a fight between butternut squash and pumpkin spice.

1516
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,020
Oh, yes. At the very top of that.

1517
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,140
Yeah, there's a constraint because his thing is butternut squash.

1518
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:02,340
And he says, like, well, unlike, you know, all that pumpkin spice,

1519
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,540
who likes pumpkin spice and kind of gets nothing either way.

1520
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:09,140
He doesn't get like a boo. Yeah, I'm kind of like, I don't know.

1521
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:13,060
I don't think anyone knows what they're doing exactly with the hatred

1522
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,780
of pumpkin spice. Oh, yeah.

1523
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,140
Is it? It's just one of those things people have started doing.

1524
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,140
And do they mean it?

1525
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:22,500
Is it just like a fun game for everybody to participate in?

1526
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:25,180
I did is I like the people in that restaurant

1527
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,620
and confused by it and have no opinion either way.

1528
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:32,700
Hmm. I it feels like it's just maybe it's so everywhere now

1529
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,180
than that people are annoyed by it.

1530
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,500
I think the ubiquity.

1531
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,460
But is it also just is it like does it have something to do with like

1532
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,620
like you're so you're like soft as well as it like one of those Minotaur slams?

1533
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,740
Well, it's like it's so fully a full hearty.

1534
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,380
Yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure.

1535
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,660
I think it feels very like I'm not sure what people can identify

1536
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:56,060
what's going on here exactly, other than like I see it too much.

1537
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,540
I would listen.

1538
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:01,060
I would pumpkin spice the neck of my enemy and then like, great.

1539
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,100
Get your rocks off that way.

1540
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,700
Actually, I had a pumpkin filled ravioli the other day.

1541
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,220
It was some red sauce. It was great.

1542
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,300
It's like a little sweet.

1543
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,340
Oh, yeah. And it's a sweetness.

1544
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,380
It's not too overpowering.

1545
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,020
It doesn't feel like you're having a sore.

1546
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,500
So you can mix it with something savory.

1547
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,060
I think it's fine. Yeah.

1548
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,060
I've been I've been eating the

1549
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,740
Dunkin branded goldfish pumpkin spice goldfish.

1550
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,020
Oh, wow. Really?

1551
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,420
Hold on a second.

1552
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,100
Hold on. Different things fighting.

1553
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:34,220
I've been really into the the sweet goldfish lately.

1554
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,060
So I got the elf one.

1555
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,140
I got the 20th anniversary maple spice.

1556
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,500
You're leaving me in the dust here.

1557
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,180
So yeah, goldfish, the official goldfish cracker crackers.

1558
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,140
They have a cookie.

1559
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,100
They have a sweet one.

1560
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,260
They have a cookie line.

1561
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,180
Yeah. Oh, the goldfish, the same like crispy, like a cheesy one.

1562
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:55,700
Is it like, no, it's like a like a thinner crispy butter cookie.

1563
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,140
Oh, but the same size is like a size of goldfish.

1564
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,420
Oh, wow. OK.

1565
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,900
You know what I had that was kind of an interesting combo recently was

1566
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:09,300
that Campbell's is doing a chunky ghost pepper chicken noodle,

1567
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,020
which sounds like kind of a weird.

1568
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,340
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't mean I did. I say that I had that.

1569
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,740
I didn't. That was just something that I saw on deal vibes.

1570
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,580
Yeah, that's an exclusive deal. It looks good.

1571
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:19,660
I actually missed that one.

1572
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,940
The heads up on what's happening.

1573
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,620
Progressive or whatever that soup cans of ones.

1574
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:28,540
They are making spicy soups and they are so spicy.

1575
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,460
Wow. Really? Really?

1576
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:33,500
It's a real spicy like the chicken tortilla soup and like a spicy chicken noodle.

1577
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:35,460
So I guess Campbell's is getting the games, too.

1578
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,660
So interesting.

1579
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,340
Like I was like, OK, whatever.

1580
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,220
They're going to sell spicy stuff at the grocery store.

1581
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,700
Right. It killed me.

1582
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,220
Wow. Oh, my God.

1583
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,620
And this is you we're talking about.

1584
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,300
You were like you were like down on your back for a little bit.

1585
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,540
Yeah, I'm somewhat of a heat seeker myself.

1586
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,740
So I don't want to start any more rivalries.

1587
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,300
If you start stealing people's catchphrases, catchphrase from what?

1588
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,180
This is other podcast as there's a whole.

1589
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,140
This is the first time I've ever listened to because I got tagged to this.

1590
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:05,660
Oh, you know, not only did we bring you to X, you got you've never listened

1591
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:08,220
to a podcast at all. Wow. Wow.

1592
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:12,340
This is like the radio, but it's like you download it or it's on an app.

1593
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,180
It's yeah. Yeah, you got it.

1594
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,500
It is like the radio. Yeah.

1595
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,820
Check it out a lot. It is a little confusing.

1596
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:21,500
Just be be a little careful about the kinds of things like

1597
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,940
if you're passionate about like a hot salad, right?

1598
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,540
The podcast forum, I think that area is kind of covered by this other guy.

1599
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,780
OK, OK, I won't I won't touch you guys.

1600
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,100
I mean, I don't have many food opinions.

1601
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,620
You know, I like I go to the restaurants.

1602
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,020
I'm like, you know, the McDonald's like I said, I'll tell you what,

1603
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:42,100
the spicy jam, I'd give it like if I was bringing like one to five

1604
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,420
little forks.

1605
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,020
Oh, it's like fire.

1606
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,500
Careful, folks, two times.

1607
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,660
Make it like make it like pitchforks or something.

1608
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:51,220
Yeah, that's good. Yeah, that's good.

1609
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,740
Yeah. We held that you're in that conception, the devil.

1610
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,420
I'll read it for to have battle axes.

1611
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,260
Yeah. So eight blades and nine blades total on my battle.

1612
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,780
That's not bad. That's not bad.

1613
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:05,420
You could also you could make it out of like six six six.

1614
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,380
That might kind of like get you away from the.

1615
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,980
You're thinking of like a demon thing.

1616
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:12,060
I'm more from like the Greek thing, not like the William Blake.

1617
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:14,140
Right. Christian. Right.

1618
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,100
I'm more of like a Greek Zeus's son, I think.

1619
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,300
I said sounds right.

1620
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,820
It was a long time ago. Yeah, it seems all right.

1621
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,140
Like he made love to a boy.

1622
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,540
You haven't done you don't know your own.

1623
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,660
And you haven't done like an ancestry on yourself.

1624
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,100
So you don't know exactly what you are.

1625
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:27,940
I don't know. I don't know.

1626
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,860
Is there a Christian Minotaur? I'm looking it up.

1627
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:33,740
I'm sure we've been like appropriated by certain religions.

1628
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,460
Great. It says what religion is the Minotaur and it's Greek.

1629
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:38,420
It is Greek mythology. Yeah, that makes sense.

1630
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:41,420
No, my favorite religion, Greek Greek is the religion.

1631
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,900
I was your Mount Rushmore of religious

1632
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,780
Greek Roman Persian.

1633
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,780
American. Yeah, American number one.

1634
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:57,460
Well, then let me let me let me tie it all together with food opinions.

1635
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,700
You haven't done this yourself and they aren't, you know,

1636
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,300
you just high five minions while they went by.

1637
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,540
If you had to take a guess

1638
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:10,380
and follow Al's error and crack open a minion skull and eat the innards inside,

1639
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,700
if you would you have a good do you think that would taste good?

1640
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,620
Any any thoughts?

1641
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,540
Honest, my first thought, maybe just because we were talking about,

1642
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:19,140
I honestly think the brains would be a little pumpkin spice flavored,

1643
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,700
a little like cinnamon.

1644
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,540
What did you know?

1645
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,620
So we broke down what pumpkin spice actually is.

1646
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:24,900
It's not anything to do with pumpkin.

1647
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,940
Have you heard this? No, I forget.

1648
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,580
Somebody broke it down.

1649
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:31,620
It's like it's like it's like cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, nutmeg.

1650
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,060
And it's a specific mix.

1651
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,540
What you put into the pie. Yes.

1652
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,660
Yeah, exactly.

1653
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,780
So the pumpkin itself is not necessarily like part.

1654
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,460
If that's why it's pumpkin spice, not pumpkin.

1655
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,140
It's the spice of a pumpkin.

1656
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,140
The spice of a pumpkin pie.

1657
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:45,940
Yeah. Wow.

1658
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,700
Like it's like it's the brain, the brains of a minion.

1659
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,780
But should be pumpkin pie spice then.

1660
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:55,860
I have had some pumpkin pie lattes I've been seeing on coffee shops

1661
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,780
and you since a little sweeter.

1662
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,820
But I'm saying if it's called pumpkin spice

1663
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,580
and it's really just the spice you put in a pumpkin pie,

1664
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,500
the pie part really should really be in the title.

1665
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:06,700
You're correct.

1666
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,940
But I think that does make me now I start leaning that that's sweet.

1667
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,580
Yeah, I'm avoiding that.

1668
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,820
Because I think a pumpkin ravioli or a pumpkin bread,

1669
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:19,300
you would get similar spice profiles.

1670
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,620
So there's room for savoriness in the general description.

1671
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:28,420
Wouldn't a minion taste like a banana because they eat so many bananas?

1672
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,900
I just think they have good bones.

1673
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,300
They'd be a good bone ice cream.

1674
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:36,460
OK, so probably with at some point, there's so much banana

1675
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:39,100
that some of that banana is going to filter down to the bone.

1676
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,340
And then you've got a natural flavor that, like, say the bones of a Mike

1677
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:47,980
might not inherently have long bones, long, youthful,

1678
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:50,380
as long as he can his forked tongue.

1679
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,380
Oh, he's licking his tongue.

1680
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,020
He's licking, licking with his tongue.

1681
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,260
One time, I actually can lick his.

1682
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,620
Wow. Oh, that's cool.

1683
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,620
That's a dream.

1684
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,900
Is he ever wanted to lick tongue, bro?

1685
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,500
Somebody else's?

1686
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,060
No, no, no. Your own.

1687
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,220
That's right.

1688
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,420
So I got to ask this with one of my biggest regrets.

1689
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,660
Talk about universal socket.

1690
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,420
I don't want to keep bringing up.

1691
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:19,100
I'm not doing it to brag.

1692
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,180
It just happens to be a lot of minion stuff over there.

1693
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,900
I regret not getting there was a minion burger that was a perfectly yellow bun.

1694
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:28,140
Oh, yeah. With a little eyeball in the center of it.

1695
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,900
And I'm sure the hamburger was just kind of normal.

1696
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:33,300
I'm sure the bread wasn't flavored, but it looked beautiful.

1697
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,660
Like, it's so cool.

1698
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,060
Like, I really like that.

1699
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,500
Like, I had the I had some mochi ice cream at the Tokyo Disney

1700
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,980
Sea that looked like the little little green guys.

1701
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,500
Oh, yes. That was great.

1702
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,820
Yeah. That was also really good.

1703
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:46,500
That was tough.

1704
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,060
And for some reason, maybe I trust that kind of thing to be done

1705
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,540
better in the Japanese parks.

1706
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,340
And well, there's stuff like that in Mario.

1707
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:58,340
I feel like that's like I don't think I don't want I don't want any color on my

1708
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,140
my burger bun. That's what I'm I have.

1709
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,300
Have you guys had a good iteration of that?

1710
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,340
No.

1711
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:09,620
Only if it's like steered, like if they see her like an image or something.

1712
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:11,140
Oh, that's fine. Yeah.

1713
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,780
But not that would I want to eat the black bun at Burger King.

1714
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,740
Yeah. Oh, that's right.

1715
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:17,820
They've done that. Yeah.

1716
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,620
Yeah. Wow.

1717
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,220
Well, it's that dye that probably turns your poop neon blue.

1718
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,420
It's right. You know what I'm saying, buddy?

1719
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:24,900
Lully. Yeah.

1720
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:28,020
It's happened because I had the black slurpee like 20 years ago.

1721
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,460
Yeah. And I shit neon blue.

1722
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,180
Oh, yeah.

1723
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,500
There's a few blue poops laying around the labyrinth right now.

1724
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,660
OK. All right.

1725
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:37,020
I hear you.

1726
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,380
I hear you. Oh, no.

1727
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,740
Well, any any closing thoughts on on today, Cafe?

1728
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,540
I know you haven't been in it.

1729
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,420
Does this all make you excited to go?

1730
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,260
I would definitely.

1731
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:51,100
I mean, it seems it seems like let me ask is it's if today's show stuff taken away,

1732
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:55,140
is it a serviceable good cafe for like a coffee and a serviceable?

1733
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,580
Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of variety.

1734
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,660
And it was fine.

1735
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:02,340
As I said, it is a more pleasant environment, I think, than the previous

1736
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,940
establishment was.

1737
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,380
It's right at the front of the park.

1738
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,100
So it's convenient.

1739
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:12,460
I feel like I think park habits wise, I feel like I'm really trying to get a coffee

1740
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:16,740
before I get into the park wherever I am, because I think it's going to be more of a hassle.

1741
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:21,020
And, you know, if like in Orlando, I'm in a hotel where I know that's going to be a quick

1742
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:27,780
Starbucks there, I don't I'd like my coffee to kick in before I am in the park.

1743
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,140
But are you guys that way?

1744
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:34,460
Are you willing to have your your morning jolts in the park itself?

1745
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:35,780
I'm willing.

1746
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:37,900
But I do think it's nice to do it on the way.

1747
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,820
I mean, the best is if you can, if you're going to Disneyland, for instance,

1748
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,940
your mobile order is you're like walking down downtown Disney for that Starbucks there.

1749
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:46,260
And you grab it.

1750
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:48,780
That is a nice thing to walk in with a little cup.

1751
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:53,260
I like to get like a deal on like a 12 pack of Java Monster Energy.

1752
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,580
Well, yeah, I think that on the drive down to the train right over, you drink all 12 on

1753
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,340
the way down. And then you're ready.

1754
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:01,220
Sure. Coffee's not bad or else you're going to be hoofing it to that

1755
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:04,300
parking garage restaurant.

1756
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,300
That's right. I've always up in it everywhere I go.

1757
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,380
You know, it started tense, but I feel like things worked out.

1758
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:16,300
And now I'm so happy to say Minotaur, you survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

1759
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,820
I'm so glad you could join us.

1760
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,500
Wow. That's amazing.

1761
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,940
It's like this labyrinth of a podcast that you talk about

1762
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,180
was actually a lot more fun than mine.

1763
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,860
I didn't feel like I was going to die at all once.

1764
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:30,540
It's a little easier than the one you preside over.

1765
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:31,780
I'd say, you know what?

1766
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:35,540
Let's let's give you the opportunity to exit through the gift shop.

1767
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,860
Is there anything that you Minotaur would like to plug?

1768
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,100
Sure. Yeah, yeah, of course. Of course. Come to my labyrinth.

1769
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,260
There is great treasure and reward at the end of it.

1770
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:47,500
If you could solve my riddles and puzzles and survive me trying to kill you. Sure.

1771
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,660
Also, gosh, I just saw this Indiegogo.

1772
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:54,140
There's a great filmmaker named Matt Mazzotti, who has an Indiegogo.

1773
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,860
He's trying to raise some money for a short film starring Mike Mitchell

1774
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,140
from some other podcast called the Doughboys.

1775
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,180
That's the Minotaur. That's so crazy.

1776
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:05,100
You bring that up. That's what I was alluding to with the fork scores and everything.

1777
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:08,300
That's the podcast that that guy is on. Mike Mitchell.

1778
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,460
I just read on his Wikipedia. I didn't even know what it was.

1779
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,420
I was just being polite.

1780
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,500
That's this whole other podcast. It's good.

1781
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,820
I mean, we're way more popular. Don't tell him.

1782
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:20,540
We're pockets are insanely more popular than Doughboys, but still a good one.

1783
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,060
A good pocket.

1784
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,860
Because theme parks are much more universal than food.

1785
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:25,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No.

1786
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:28,780
Very old-fashioned and broad. Sure. I'll take it.

1787
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:32,100
But Indiegogo for a short called Big Brothers.

1788
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:34,220
Matt Mazzotti, look it up if you can't donate.

1789
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,460
If you can, you try to raise some money for this film.

1790
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,540
So check that out. Wow. Wow. Hey.

1791
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:41,700
And you know, Matt Mazzotti, it's funny you just happen to catch that.

1792
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,860
And a good man.

1793
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:46,260
And I think he's going to make a good film and he's going to be good to the crew on that.

1794
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,940
This is a guy who's good to the crews.

1795
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,860
I know you can expect. You're a Minotaur of the people.

1796
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:52,860
Sure. Yeah.

1797
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:57,660
You treat you treat people right before you start cracking their necks open.

1798
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:58,900
And chopping their heads off.

1799
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:03,580
Will there be some sort of new like what sauce would Matt Mazzotti lay out for the

1800
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,660
crew like crafty section, do you think?

1801
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,380
There's be lots of sweet and spicy.

1802
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,620
That's what I'm asking. OK, well, there'll be some spicy.

1803
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,660
Got the mongo.

1804
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:13,060
Mambo. Mambo sauce.

1805
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:13,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1806
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,300
Mambo. See, we're not in D.C.

1807
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,700
You know what? I have a few packs of Mambo sauce right.

1808
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,020
East Coast Brothers and Sisters. All right.

1809
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,020
Sure. We're fine.

1810
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,460
We're fine with Mambo.

1811
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,780
How do you guys do you want to like

1812
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,060
a rattle a little bit? It's really up to you.

1813
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,020
It's an audio podcast is a problem.

1814
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,020
We don't really have three cameras.

1815
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:33,900
Should I maybe can?

1816
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,420
It's going to sound like Foley, which we've all learned.

1817
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,500
The mentor.

1818
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,700
I'm a big foley.

1819
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,220
Do you hear the scrapes listeners?

1820
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,540
Foley.

1821
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,540
He's charging.

1822
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,580
Oh, no, no, no.

1823
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,540
The second game. If you want to dig even deeper.

1824
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,820
Turn on your VIP manager.

1825
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,260
Club three where you get one more bonus episode every month and our regular

1826
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,820
episodes ad free.

1827
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,580
Please. I thought you guys ended up in a good place.

1828
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,260
Spare our co-host Mike.

1829
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,340
I'm more than likely killing him.

1830
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,620
Oh, he's getting his rocks off while he's doing it.

1831
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,020
I can tell. He's clearly aroused.

1832
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:03,820
Mike was right.
