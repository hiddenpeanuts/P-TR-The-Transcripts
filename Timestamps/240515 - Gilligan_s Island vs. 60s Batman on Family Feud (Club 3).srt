1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Club 3

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The Gilligan family and the Batman family on your marks

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're the winning contestants on Carlson's Club 3

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Clash of the Kitch

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's it, right? That's the right song

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I know I just watched this

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Or is that Price is Right?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I think so

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Shit!

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is Price

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Family Feud is the jazzier

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, yeah

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Even as I hum that, I feel am I doing the Elvis walkout music

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's very similar

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It is similar

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, yeah, kind of big fanfare

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Can't believe I blew that

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Look, we did our home

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We all watched it

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I watched it

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We will prove it with our YouTube search history

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We did despite any fuzziness we have about the music

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So Mike, here we are

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is the result of a poll in which many of your last place to second to last place candidates from Club 3 polls passed

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All went up against each other

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And what I think is quite remarkable is that in a competition of last place finishers

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You managed to insert a new last place to be the last place to not rule them all

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was entirely just to recap for any

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Listen, if you don't know what we're talking about

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, we're kind of revisiting old topics all suggested by Mike

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
All of which kind of have like 60s, 70s kitsch about them at the center of them

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All suggested by listeners who are like after your heart

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They're chasing you and a number of these would be a lot of fun

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
At the last minute in the last Club 3 episode we inserted into the poll a new idea never tested in a poll

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Which was Waylon Flowers and Madame

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Madame, yes

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who still require context despite us having talked about it

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Because I do believe nobody knows what this is or doesn't care, I don't know

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's like very 60s, 70s variety show mainstay ventriloquist act

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We put that in, let's try that

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Within the episode I'm starting to think

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh my god, this might take it

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Because it's the energy of the new

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And also it's needling me

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And maybe that all will dovetail into

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's an easy win for Waylon Flowers and Madame

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Instead, last place, straight to last place

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There was never a moment in the poll where it wasn't last place

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
People looked into this and said no

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I mean one photo is all you need to know

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you're not into the photo

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There's no way to get you back on board

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And I feel like that was kind of my arc

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Where I initially was like you know what

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I really don't know that much about Waylon Flowers and Madame

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This could be very interesting

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's often how I pick a Club 3

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm like oh that could be very interesting

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A chance to learn, yes

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then I saw one photo and I'm like

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm gonna watch something, I'm gonna put a movie on

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes, anything else

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you showing us Mike?

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm showing a photo of Madame, the puppet

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The old lady puppet

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And she's bathing a man

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think it's the third episode of her sitcom Madame's Place

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Which I think has over 70 episodes

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And I don't know if this, to me

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This makes me want to talk about it more

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But I think to the general population

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And even to the freaks on Club 3

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I say that in a good way

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is too much for them

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's still, you managed to find something

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That was too far even for who we've gathered here

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And again, I really

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think it managed to make it over an incredible hump

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That like, I played into it too

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You predicted that I would recoil at whatever you were gonna say

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then you said that and I did

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I was like

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is gonna get picked to troll me

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And even that was not enticing enough

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
People still, it was, yeah

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And what you're showing, it's a good litmus test

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You see an old lady puppet giving a sponge bath to a man

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A human man

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Do we know who the human man is?

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think it's Eddie

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm not sure which character that is

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Again, because we didn't get to do the research

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We didn't get to learn like Jason wanted

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because we were not given that assignment

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How about this though?

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When I say this to you

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Will it make you want to see it more?

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Madame's Place specifically

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Corey Feldman plays Buzzy St. James

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Like Buzzy as a kid

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is like presumably

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is like on the way to Goonies

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You know, I'll be honest

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I've been to a Corey Feldman concert

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have engaged with the Corey Feldman phenomenon

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know how much further I want to engage

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Even with that, even having attended a show

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I might have hit peak Corey personally

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
As much as the name is pretty good

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You had to let one of the angels down

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're like, I'm sorry

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I met someone

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Her name's Erin

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
She's really great

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, I'm so sorry

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, I met someone, Erin

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
She's my wife

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's how I met her

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No, no, I was saying it was like

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is a history

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It was will they, won't they

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And you were with you and Erin

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And you and one of Corey Feldman's angels

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I had to choose

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ultimately

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Love won

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I chose to stay on earth instead of go to heaven

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Anyway, I don't

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I mean, now where does this leave you

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Does this make you more determined

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Does it make it more likely to be a birthday shot

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Where are you left with Madam given the last place finish

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
In some ways it's the least successful choice ever

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I feel like by some metrics

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That it lost to all losers

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Right, all losers beat it

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So it's the least popular choice of all time

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Which makes it very attractive

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I might be a little more curious now

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because I feel like

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ages and ages ago

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you put blanks place

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Like that was an easy set

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, it's called so and so's

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, it was just like Jason

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And it wasn't successful

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It only ran for like a hundred and nine episodes

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Everyone only made ten million dollars

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Off of it

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But it was a failure

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Off the thing that no one remembers

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
On this earth

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
No, Jason, you were right before

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
When you declared you weren't interested in

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We got to get you back to where you were

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
When you saw the photograph

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That was right

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You overshot it

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here's what's going to happen

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
One day

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm going to bring two bags here

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
One with the recording equipment

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And the second

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Containing a madam puppet

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's what's going to happen

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, I'm resigned

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And you know what

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You said it the last time this came up

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You said

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What you need to do, Scott

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is just delay this as long as you possibly can

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But that correctly calibrated me

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Where I'm like

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I know I can't push it off forever

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It is going to happen

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She is coming

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
She is coming

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's just a matter of when

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
One day

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now, madam would say

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
She would really like that

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's like a double entendre

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't have the voice down yet

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I'm not saying it in a double entendre way

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You could do any voice

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And convince me it's the voice

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm not sure

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think anytime these characters

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Have appeared on screen

196
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have shut off what I am watching

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So quickly that I don't even get to hear the voice

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not sure I've ever heard madam speak

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I'd like to keep it that way

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, one day it will change

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I don't know what day that is

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But you're saying

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you had to do an impression

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's like

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's kind of like that

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, shocking

209
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Innovative

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
All right

211
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, we await the arrival of the bag

212
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But for now

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I do think that the poll landed

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In the most pleasant place

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Given the possibility of unpleasantness

216
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Throughout this

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think anything besides madam

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I would have been cool with

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hopefully you definitely would have been cool with, Mike

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The runner up Paul Linde Halloween special

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm shocked this didn't win

222
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, you made some calls about

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You thought it was going to be this or

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ah, now it's not coming to me

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Superheroes

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Legends or whatever of superheroes

227
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah

228
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or Spiderman

229
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The musical thing

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, that could have been it too

231
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Didn't make it

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think maybe Paul Linde Halloween

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Just didn't feel right

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Because it's not Halloween

235
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah

236
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But given that we tend to

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Carry over the runner ups

238
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Into another poll

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I think it makes all the sense in the world

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
To put this into the Halloween poll

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Where it had lost previously

242
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right

243
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But we'll put it in the Crypt 3 poll

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Sure, yeah

245
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Which will be in September

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In preparation for October

247
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Makes sense

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You earned it, Paul Linde

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Good job

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You hung in there

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But this one

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, wait

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And next month

254
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where there is no theme

255
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And no particular direction

256
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Club 3 subscribers

257
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Throw ideas into the comments as always

258
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think we have good ideas from previous polls

259
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That I'll throw in

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But new stuff would be good too

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And that will all go up against

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
American Girl Cafe

263
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Which remains

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In the running

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A previous runner up

267
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But for now

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's read the suggestion

270
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Which I had to go way back into the archives

271
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And figure out

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
When this was even from

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is from Matt Kamegis

274
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Who I feel like suggested

275
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Another one recently

276
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Listeners, it's on you

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
To track how many of these

278
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You have won

279
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Because I think

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That a number of people have won too

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And I'd like to celebrate

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Whoever gets to three

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't want to

284
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's a good achievement

285
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So Matt, if it's you

286
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let us know

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you get three on Club 3

288
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Please tell us

289
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But the suggestion

290
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In 1983

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The cast of Gilligan's Island

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Went up against the cast of 66 Batman

293
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
On the family feud

294
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Bob Denver is AWOL

295
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Big spoiler

296
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What a bummer at the top

297
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But that is made up by the fact

298
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That Vincent Price is on the Batman team

299
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And of course

300
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Alan Hale is there

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can find several versions of this on YouTube

302
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This was in a

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was in a poll way back

304
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And it came in

305
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Second to last

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Against Warner Brothers Studio Store

307
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Which took it all the way

308
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And we did an episode about

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But thank you Matt

310
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Eventually it came to pass

311
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And here we are

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And thank you for

313
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
About as pleasant of a viewing assignment

314
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
As we could be

315
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because we've gotten some bad ones

316
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We've gotten some

317
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like long watches

318
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That were very dispiriting

319
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And here we're just watching an old

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Pleasant episode of a game show

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
With people we love

322
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wonderful

323
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you very much

325
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Family Feud fans here

326
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I feel like it's probably

327
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I guess my favorite game show

328
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And not just because Steve Harvey

329
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Now hosts Family Feud

330
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah

331
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No those

332
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When you're seeing a Steve Harvey clip

333
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
From Family Feud going viral

334
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
When you're seeing

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I was thinking about this

336
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
How he really

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Jason we were on a text thread recently

338
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Where Jack Benny came up

339
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I feel like he is

340
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Is he the current Jack Benny?

341
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
In a lot of ways

342
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Is he the guy who can get

343
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The most laughs out of

344
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Not saying any words

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Or even making too much of an expression

346
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes

347
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're just so loaded for Bear

348
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That when Steve Harvey walks away

349
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
From the desk towards us

350
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Looking worn down and upset

351
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He can milk that for like a full minute

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Before he even says anything specific

353
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
About the suggestion that he

354
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's pretty amazing

355
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It is amazing

356
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He does that better than anybody

357
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Maybe even better

358
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Jack Benny would do that

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But he has the same kind of move

360
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He would do

361
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He would just put his hand

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The hand

363
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But then he looked to the side

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Like he was exasperated

365
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Steve will do it in different ways

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I feel like

367
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He's got a couple different

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Variant ways he can do

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The I can't believe you just said that

370
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm offended by that

371
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a matter of how much

373
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Does he walk around

374
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Right

375
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah does he throw a hand up

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
On the head

377
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Does he like bend down

378
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah

379
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Have worn down

380
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Head in hands

381
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah

382
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He is the best family feud

383
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Host of all time

384
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Have I said that on the show before?

385
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think he got it

386
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah

387
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm with you

388
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Not that it's

389
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I mean I like Louis Anderson

390
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I like Richard Carn

391
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't

392
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But Steve Harvey

393
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I want to say

394
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That I like John O'Hurley

395
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But I think I like him

396
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
From other things

397
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And frankly forgot

398
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That he was the host

399
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Until looking at a Wikipedia earlier

400
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And that

401
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've seen a few of those

402
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And though that's fun

403
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But Harvey

404
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's the best

405
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He's the longest running now

406
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's 14 years

407
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh and he realized that

408
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's been that long

409
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Which I think

410
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Richard Dawson

411
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Who was hosting

412
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In this era

413
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And kind of the like

414
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You know main classic one

415
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That you think of

416
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think nine years for him

417
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And then some comeback

418
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A little bit after

419
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Later day

420
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
After the thing happened

421
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But

422
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
After the thing happened

423
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh right right

424
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Which thing

425
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh the thing

426
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah but

427
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Steve Harvey

428
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Longest running

429
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think yeah

430
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think it's his

431
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah

432
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know

433
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't see anyone ever

434
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Beating him either

435
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah

436
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Now that's all great

437
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Love the deadpan

438
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Really good host

439
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm not going to go

440
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
All the way with you Mike

441
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And think that

442
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I should be following

443
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
His health regiments

444
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay alright

445
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You don't want to get hit

446
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
With a red light

447
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Fine

448
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He was the red light

449
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I got confused

450
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There were a lot of

451
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Celebrities in black

452
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Ice bath and red light

453
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
He has some sort of

454
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Machine that bathes him

455
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In red light

456
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Steve Harvey's

457
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Red light special

458
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes yes

459
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So there's that

460
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But yeah Steve

461
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I do watch

462
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I feel like I watch

463
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Show more now

464
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Than I maybe even did

465
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
As a kid

466
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because like Dawson

467
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is not really our era

468
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's like a little bit

469
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Before

470
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I watched it a lot

471
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
On the game show network

472
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah

473
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Although watching this

474
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Made me realize like

475
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't

476
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I didn't remember

477
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The mechanics of

478
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Family Feud

479
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Everyone knows

480
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Survey says

481
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And then you like

482
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh also

483
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You get together

484
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And stuff

485
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And then

486
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I really didn't remember

487
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The final

488
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Where it's like

489
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Turn around

490
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And here's your results

491
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And someone else is

492
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Out of the room

493
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And they have to do it

494
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah and you need

495
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
A combined 200

496
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So you want to do

497
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
As well as the camera

498
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That was exciting

499
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It was exciting to watch

500
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But I forgot about

501
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The steal of like

502
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I feel like you're

503
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Not a real Feud fan

504
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Huh?

505
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I feel like you're

506
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Not a real Feud fan

507
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You are bringing up

508
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The basics of it

509
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah I didn't remember

510
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Any of that

511
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What was your game show

512
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Then?

513
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Jeopardy

514
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh Mr. Smart Guy

515
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Over here

516
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm a big trivia there

517
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He loves to learn

518
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I love to learn

519
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I am dog shit at

520
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Wheel of Fortune

521
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Solving the puzzle

522
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Solving the puzzle

523
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I was going to say

524
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going to say

525
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh solving the puzzle

526
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Solving the puzzle

527
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I was going to say

528
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Have you practiced

529
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Spinning the wheel

530
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Are you bad at that too?

531
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No I bet I would be

532
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm a little guy

533
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That wheel is massive

534
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Fair enough

535
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It is a big wheel

536
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
These are big pieces

537
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah

538
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I tried

539
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I did

540
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
There were so many

541
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Levels for Teen Jeopardy

542
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I just did the test

543
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At my school

544
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh wow

545
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Like once

546
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And did not

547
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Did not get passed

548
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You weren't smart enough

549
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah I was not smart enough

550
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Did anybody

551
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
At the school?

552
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I think one or two people

553
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Went on to region

554
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But no one got on the show

555
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay okay

556
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And then you probably

557
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You got to like camera

558
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You got to like

559
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay you're smart

560
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But are you

561
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Awful to

562
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Look at

563
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you comfortable

564
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah yeah

565
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
On camera

566
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Can you do the buzzer right

567
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Like

568
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Buzzer is what

569
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Everyone says is tough

570
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah that seems

571
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
To be the thing

572
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You got to nail that

573
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And timing is more important

574
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It was fascinating

575
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Watching people do the

576
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Buzzer

577
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
On this

578
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Cause they had their hands

579
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Flat

580
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Like as close as

581
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They could get

582
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Can we get you on

583
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Celebrity Jeopardy

584
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Or something

585
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Like podcast Celebrity Jeopardy

586
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh I'd love that

587
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Cause then they'd make

588
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The questions dumber

589
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Celebrity

590
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No offense

591
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But Celebrity Jeopardy

592
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They usually

593
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Dumb it down

594
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I think if they did

595
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Podcast Celebrity Jeopardy

596
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It'd be nice for them

597
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
To like

598
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Take a break from

599
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
All those ratings

600
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Just to like get

601
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Take off the pressure

602
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Of the people

603
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Are watching the show

604
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah

605
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It'll be like

606
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh this is

607
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
All right

608
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We can just

609
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Fuck off here

610
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Because absolutely

611
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No one is watching

612
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The podcast Celebrity

613
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Well but then Jason gets

614
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
To live a dream

615
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So that'll be nice

616
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah

617
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Works works for everybody

618
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Takes the pressure down

619
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I was a dummy little kid

620
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Who just like

621
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I like Price is Right

622
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I like Family Feud

623
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Like

624
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's what I like

625
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I would like some of these

626
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There was this like

627
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Kind of like

628
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
One with attitude

629
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Then where there was like

630
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Cut a little deeper

631
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Pop culture wise

632
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That I want to say

633
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Lifetime

634
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
With Wink Martindale

635
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Who's like

636
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Throwback game show host

637
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah

638
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But now I don't remember

639
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Was it possibly

640
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Det was Det the name

641
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Of the show

642
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I remember Det

643
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Because I would like

644
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Things like that

645
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Or win Ben Stein's money

646
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Right

647
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Where there's kind of

648
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This odd premise

649
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
To where the money

650
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is coming from

651
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I like kind of like

652
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Deconstructionist 90s

653
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Game shows

654
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah

655
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I really liked

656
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The syndicated reruns

657
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Of Let's Make a Deal

658
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes that too I liked

659
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah

660
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm fond of both now

661
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That my wife has appeared on

662
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Both times

663
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Right

664
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm so proud of her

665
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's still what she will

666
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She will find a way

667
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
To turn conversations to this

668
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If possible in social settings

669
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Right

670
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
She should

671
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
As she should

672
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I've never seen it fail

673
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I've never seen people

674
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Not go really

675
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah

676
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah

677
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
She did good on both

678
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
She got me a wallet

679
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I got a nice new wallet

680
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Out of

681
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay

682
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Out of Let's Make a Deal

683
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You know

684
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And which has made me

685
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You know

686
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Very fond of Drew Carey

687
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah

688
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
At this point

689
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
As if there was

690
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
All right

691
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
There was that

692
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He was apparently so nice

693
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And commercial breaks

694
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And all that

695
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And then all the strike stuff

696
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Paying for all the Bob's Big Boy

697
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And now that he's

698
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Explained to us

699
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That going

700
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And seeing Fish

701
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
At Sphere

702
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Was like

703
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Having a pussy

704
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah

705
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It was an incredible

706
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Now I'm like

707
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Series of tweets

708
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I thought he was just like

709
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Kind of a guy on TV

710
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But there's a lot of guys

711
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
On TV forever

712
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is Ryan Seacrest

713
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Or whatever

714
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Ryan Seacrest has never

715
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Tweeted anything

716
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
As insane

717
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
As Drew Carey

718
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah

719
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The tweets

720
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Sphere giving him a pussy

721
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Or the tweets

722
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah

723
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's like a new

724
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You know what

725
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because I always found

726
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That Kevin Smith one

727
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So unpleasant

728
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Right

729
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This is like

730
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's weird

731
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is good

732
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But what a blast

733
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Did you like the follow up

734
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That Fish sent him a blender

735
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I didn't hear that

736
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No

737
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Water blender

738
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Because he said like

739
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh I would put my dick

740
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
In a blender

741
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Wow

742
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's also like

743
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He's the host of

744
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The Price is Right Still

745
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So it's like

746
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Bob Barker never

747
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Went to a show

748
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And tweeted

749
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That he felt like

750
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He had a pussy

751
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes for something

752
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That is meant for

753
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like you know

754
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Not entirely

755
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But like

756
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You know

757
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They try to make that

758
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
A show that

759
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Old people

760
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Right

761
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Can watch

762
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And it just goes

763
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Down pleasant

764
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's one of the

765
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Crazier things

766
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That like

767
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
A middle America mom

768
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Type celebrity

769
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Has ever done or said

770
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is Bob Barker

771
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Elvis Presley's residency

772
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
In the International Hotel

773
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In Las Vegas

774
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Was so good

775
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I would like

776
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Someone to harvest

777
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
My prostate

778
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And throw it in

779
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
A trash compactor

780
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And he said that on the news

781
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Or something

782
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Because at the time

783
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There was no Twitter

784
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah yeah

785
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He issued a statement

786
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Now we go live to

787
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Bob Barker for a statement

788
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Back to the desk

789
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The Chernobyl incident

790
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Continues to get worse

791
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It was so to

792
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Experience something

793
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Like this again

794
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I would gladly

795
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Spay or neuter myself

796
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Right

797
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay but this feud

798
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So we go back to 1983

799
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
For this

800
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And this pairing of

801
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Batman and Gilligan's Island

802
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Comes as a result of a week

803
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Of classic TV family pairings

804
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah

805
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Now they obviously have to

806
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Break from the family thing

807
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
A little bit

808
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Of the family thing

809
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And either one of these

810
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is a family proper

811
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Right

812
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The howls are related

813
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But other than that

814
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You know

815
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Now this

816
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I looked up the full context

817
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Of this

818
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
These all are

819
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
By the way this is

820
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
All these episodes aired

821
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This very week

822
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
41 years ago

823
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Wow

824
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's what we're dealing with

825
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
April

826
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Or wait aired in

827
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
May 83 I think

828
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
May 83

829
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Okay

830
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So this particular week

831
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This was number two

832
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Of TV's all time favorites week

833
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
In addition to Batman and

834
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Gilligan's Island

835
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You had Lost in Space

836
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah

837
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
In the Running

838
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Led by June Lockhart

839
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And Hawaiian Eye

840
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Which is a show

841
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I have no

842
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Familiarity with

843
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What so ever

844
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Connie Stevens

845
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Troy Donahue

846
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Poncey Ponce

847
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Wow

848
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It had Poncey Ponce

849
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Whoa

850
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A name I've never seen

851
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In my life

852
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No

853
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I've heard the phrase

854
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hawaiian Eye

855
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And never investigated

856
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Any further

857
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But I did

858
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It was just that you thought

859
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It was a disease

860
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You were worried you'd get

861
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I probably just confused it

862
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
With Hawaii Five-O

863
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't know if I want to

864
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Go to Hawaii

865
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You can end up coming back

866
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
With Hawaiian Eye

867
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I did

868
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I watched the finale

869
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Of this week

870
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh

871
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
With Lost in Space

872
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Versus

873
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh oh

874
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Spoiler alert

875
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Gilligan's Island

876
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh you ruined it

877
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I ruined it

878
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You made it to the

879
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Gilligan's Island

880
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Cleaned the clock

881
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Of the Batman family

882
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Very

883
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I feel like

884
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Everyone's playing like

885
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Very strategically in the

886
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Like in terms of

887
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There's a good amount of

888
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Passing

889
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What do you mean?

890
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like they pass it

891
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Do you want to play

892
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Or do you want to pass

893
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh I see

894
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And they're

895
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Once or twice

896
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Dawson was like

897
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Really?

898
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like

899
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It doesn't mean

900
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They're playing correctly

901
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Sure

902
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But it does happen

903
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But it is

904
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Very strange not to have

905
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Bob Denver

906
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
When the Batman family

907
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Which is a term in

908
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Comic book parlance

909
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That you use the phrase

910
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The Bat Family

911
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And that's

912
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's Batman Robin

913
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Batgirl

914
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's like the people

915
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
On that side

916
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Nightwing

917
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Asriel

918
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
All the others

919
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There's many others

920
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oracle

921
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like all the extended

922
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Cast

923
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Alford obviously

924
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But yeah

925
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
They have the three

926
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The core three

927
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Here

928
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Batman

929
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And the other family

930
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Food

931
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah and that's

932
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's the

933
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Batman family

934
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
As the core three

935
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And you've got

936
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Most of the

937
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Primary

938
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Gilligan's Island

939
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Primary

940
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Gilligan's Island

941
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well yeah

942
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's talk about

943
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Who we got here

944
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah

945
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Gilligan's Island

946
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is a little more

947
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Besides not having

948
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Gilligan himself

949
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I think

950
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You know hey

951
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The skipper being

952
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The leader is

953
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Probably a more

954
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And he's got the hat

955
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Way to go

956
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Right

957
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Of course

958
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He dresses somewhat

959
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The part

960
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And he does like

961
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Disney bounding

962
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He does skipper bounding

963
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It like suggests it

964
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Without being fully

965
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The costume

966
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Which I think he did

967
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Most of his life

968
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I think so

969
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He did it at the restaurant

970
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Which is

971
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah which

972
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And this must be

973
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Some of the reason

974
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This came up

975
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And was suggested

976
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
By Matt is that

977
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We did cover

978
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Alan Hale's lobster barrel

979
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Right

980
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
His restaurant

981
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
On La Cienega

982
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
When we covered

983
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
A bunch of celebrity

984
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Owned restaurants

985
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yes

986
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And it seems like

987
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
In that setting

988
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He would just

989
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Walk around

990
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Fully skipperfied

991
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes

992
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And it's

993
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And Richard Dawson

994
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Mentions it

995
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes

996
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Which is so exciting

997
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah

998
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You know what

999
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
If we hadn't done

1000
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Celebruary

1001
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This might have passed

1002
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah

1003
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And I would have not

1004
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Known what he's

1005
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Talking about

1006
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But when they're

1007
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Making small talk

1008
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Right

1009
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It is such a

1010
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Friendly familiar

1011
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's what it's

1012
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Something like

1013
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I think when he's

1014
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Asking about

1015
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What the cause is

1016
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And what they're

1017
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Playing for

1018
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And he says

1019
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then like

1020
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Sounds good

1021
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Very good

1022
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Wow

1023
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Which that

1024
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's so familiar

1025
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That you're like

1026
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Dawson must have gone

1027
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah

1028
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I think so

1029
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Boy all the

1030
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Who wasn't there

1031
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Caesar Romero

1032
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Would probably pop over

1033
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
After

1034
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I forget what his thing

1035
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Was called

1036
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah I forget

1037
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Whatever

1038
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Celebrity restaurant row

1039
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Casa de Joker

1040
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah

1041
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
God

1042
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I don't think he

1043
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Dressed as Joker

1044
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Every night

1045
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But I could be wrong

1046
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's more of an effort

1047
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah that's true

1048
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah yeah

1049
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And then

1050
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
All the makeup

1051
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Probably not

1052
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Probably not

1053
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But yeah this was

1054
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This was

1055
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
This got a pop

1056
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I got a big pop

1057
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Out of me for this

1058
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Because I go

1059
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Because I've never

1060
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Really seen it referenced

1061
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
With the old stars

1062
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I've never

1063
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I've never seen

1064
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Johnny Carson say it

1065
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
On an old clip

1066
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I've never seen

1067
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't know

1068
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I've never seen it

1069
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Referenced until now

1070
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I've only seen

1071
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah like little cutouts

1072
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
From newspapers

1073
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Right

1074
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
When trying to find

1075
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Any material

1076
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
To do an episode about

1077
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But it is real

1078
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
All the biggest

1079
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Oldest stars in Hollywood

1080
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Drunkest stars

1081
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yes they were all there

1082
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The oldest

1083
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Drunkest stars

1084
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The most red faced

1085
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Hollywood denizens

1086
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Always there every night

1087
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah

1088
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So Alan Ayl Jr.

1089
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Skipper leads it

1090
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Then you got the Howells

1091
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Jim Backus

1092
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Backus

1093
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Backus maybe

1094
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Voice of Mr. Magoo

1095
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah

1096
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Right we got Magoo

1097
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
In the house

1098
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Which is

1099
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And some of the fun

1100
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Of this entire episode

1101
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That we had

1102
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
We had

1103
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We had

1104
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We had

1105
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We had

1106
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We had

1107
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Which the whole

1108
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Entire

1109
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Entire

1110
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Episode is hearing voices

1111
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
That you know

1112
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
From other

1113
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Contexts

1114
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah

1115
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Kind of shout

1116
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Answers excitedly

1117
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But in a voice

1118
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That you know

1119
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Right

1120
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Not to jump around

1121
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Too much

1122
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But there's

1123
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I think one of the

1124
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Categories

1125
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Is something about

1126
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Ways that

1127
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You relax

1128
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What are ways

1129
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That you relax

1130
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And you get to hear

1131
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Mr Howell

1132
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Slash Mr.

1133
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Magoo

1134
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Say make love

1135
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
He might be the

1136
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I missed, I forgot or never knew that he was Magoo.

1137
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
I missed that as I was looking at pictures

1138
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
of all of them and stuff.

1139
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,480
But his timing is really good.

1140
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Him and Vincent Price are in the race for MVP of this.

1141
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,280
What crazy people to see in the wild.

1142
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,000
They all feel like wax figures.

1143
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,160
It's kind of strange to see them doing something

1144
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,480
as themselves.

1145
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,640
I mean, I'm sure all these people,

1146
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,720
I'm just not as familiar.

1147
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,800
I haven't seen many hours of match game or whatever.

1148
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,920
But I also don't know if those people

1149
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,000
did that sort of thing often.

1150
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,060
Some of these are special.

1151
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,520
I don't think Adam Wiss was doing it.

1152
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,880
He was not like a mainstay of game shows or anything.

1153
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,840
No, but back as in Vincent Price,

1154
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,200
a lot of them, it just evolves

1155
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,520
into friendly conversation with Dawson.

1156
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,140
It doesn't even hit banter level.

1157
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,840
Cause I'm like, oh, are they all bomb?

1158
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,080
And I'm like, oh no, they're not really thinking

1159
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
about this as performing.

1160
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,720
But Vincent Price and Bacchus,

1161
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,800
and Alan Hale especially too,

1162
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,680
are like, oh, I'm on camera.

1163
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,240
This is a chance, I, you know.

1164
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,080
They go for it.

1165
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,000
Perform a little.

1166
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,880
They were their pops.

1167
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,880
All right, you got Natalie Schaefer, lovey.

1168
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,720
Lovey.

1169
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,200
Lovey.

1170
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,160
You got Russell Johnson, the professor,

1171
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,880
and Don Wells, Marianne.

1172
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,860
They are, aren't those the characters who were paired

1173
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,940
in the original insulting opening as and the rest?

1174
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,760
Oh, well, Skilly and the skipper too.

1175
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Don Wells was Marianne?

1176
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,200
Yeah.

1177
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
Professor Anne, Marianne.

1178
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,420
Yes, but wasn't there an original version

1179
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,120
where it was and the rest?

1180
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,960
Oh, I don't know that.

1181
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,800
I believe so.

1182
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,560
I think they were like, even though there's only two left,

1183
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,600
they would get through movie star and the rest.

1184
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,040
And at some point there was,

1185
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
I don't believe I'm making that up.

1186
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,600
Yeah, they were just like, there's no time.

1187
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,560
Like the composer, like, I can't do it.

1188
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,400
I can't do it.

1189
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,720
There's no way to fit in professor and Marianne.

1190
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
And the producers are like,

1191
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,660
well, what if it's just like professor and Marianne?

1192
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,280
Too much, too much, too many syllables.

1193
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,160
Get out of here.

1194
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,560
Let the music guy do the music guy's thing.

1195
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,880
I can't fit it in.

1196
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,320
And then after season one, like, are you sure?

1197
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,080
Are you sure there's not a way?

1198
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,480
These people are gonna quit.

1199
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,200
All right, you're right, I tried it.

1200
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,360
I've never seen a full episode of Gilligan's Island,

1201
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,200
I don't think.

1202
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,160
Maybe one, maybe one.

1203
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,680
It feels crazy to me that you would know.

1204
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,600
And it does, doesn't it?

1205
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,440
Wow, wow.

1206
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,280
I don't think I've ever seen a full one.

1207
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,000
At least I don't remember a full one.

1208
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,040
I've seen clips, I've seen the like Harlem Globetrotters

1209
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
clips from that.

1210
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
Oh boy.

1211
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,560
And that stuff's great. Throwing sharks in the basket.

1212
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,480
Throwing sharks, sorry.

1213
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,120
Throwing basketballs in the shark's mouth.

1214
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,160
Yeah, I love the idea of Gilligan's Island, obviously.

1215
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,480
Yeah, well, but it's, yeah, there's probably,

1216
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,240
you know what, there's a lot of these shows

1217
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,960
that I probably have not watched all of and I'm just,

1218
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,200
that went a little bit more.

1219
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,360
I remember watching that on a little bad black and white TV

1220
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,320
that got hot as hell when I'm at home sick,

1221
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,960
when it's on at just 10 a.m. on a channel

1222
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,400
that doesn't even have a name.

1223
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,440
But yeah, part of me is like,

1224
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,640
you've never seen Gilligan's Island?

1225
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,520
It's one of the classic,

1226
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,120
and then you stop and think about it and go like,

1227
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,360
was this good?

1228
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,040
I mean, I think at the time it was probably,

1229
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,000
if you're like a snooty TV critic,

1230
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,720
you're like, it's the same thing every day.

1231
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,080
And how do they not figure out how to get out of the island

1232
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,640
and they keep repeating ways that they could get off

1233
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,400
and it never happens.

1234
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,520
But Gilligan feels like the,

1235
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,760
whereas Batman, I think, holds up and is clever

1236
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,920
and has these levels in writing, you know,

1237
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,440
Gilligan feels more in the category of like,

1238
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,560
is it remembered pop culture because it's good

1239
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,480
or remembered because it was on?

1240
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,960
I would say more of that.

1241
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,280
Probably, yeah.

1242
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,720
I think in terms of kitschy shows,

1243
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,320
I dream of Genie, probably stronger show

1244
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,000
than Gilligan's Island.

1245
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,120
And one of my favorites, Green Acres.

1246
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,320
You're a Green Acre, that makes sense.

1247
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,240
I was a big Green Acres kid.

1248
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,080
Sure, sure.

1249
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,880
I didn't watch,

1250
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,720
I would say I'm more familiar with Gilligan.

1251
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,560
Okay.

1252
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,160
And overall, if you're taking all this into account,

1253
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,560
Brady Bunch all the way.

1254
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,400
Yeah.

1255
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,440
That is one I've watched a lot of Brady Bunch.

1256
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,360
I think I've seen all of the Brady Bunch at some point.

1257
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
That's like the one that reads the most.

1258
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,440
That's the most like, to me, compelling,

1259
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,760
everybody's fun to watch, but also bad.

1260
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,200
And they're like, the good and the bad

1261
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,080
are fighting constantly and just aesthetically

1262
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,520
so pleasant and musically great.

1263
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,840
Mm-hmm.

1264
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,440
So yeah, would you say Green Acres number one

1265
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,040
of all of these kinds of shows?

1266
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,920
If we're including Batman, I mean, I guess Batmans

1267
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,640
Yeah, I think Batman.

1268
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,840
Yeah.

1269
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,640
Probably Batman, but yeah, it depends.

1270
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,480
There's the tiers.

1271
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,400
Like the Dick Van Dyke show is a better show

1272
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,200
than all these shows, probably.

1273
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Yeah.

1274
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,400
Yeah, Dick Van Dyke, Be Witch.

1275
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,640
But it's almost in another.

1276
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,720
Yeah, it's a different category, I suppose.

1277
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,440
The fact that everybody's got such pedigree

1278
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,560
and Carl Reiner and these people who are true

1279
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,120
great minds and writers.

1280
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,400
Yeah, it's maybe not what we're dealing with with the,

1281
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,800
no offense to Sherwood Shore,

1282
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,640
it's a hooligan and Brady. Perhaps,

1283
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,280
not on the same level, perhaps.

1284
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,160
He was just, he's the TGIF guy of his era.

1285
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,720
That's a good way to put it, yeah.

1286
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,400
Yeah, yeah, they carved the way for,

1287
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,760
they paved the way for all those kinds of shows.

1288
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,560
Russell Johnson, by the way, the professor,

1289
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,640
I didn't know he was like,

1290
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,600
he was in the, he was in World War II,

1291
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,560
he was shot down in the Philippines,

1292
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,320
he broke both his ankles, his co-pilot died,

1293
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,960
but he survived, he got a purple heart.

1294
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,400
Wow, and now he's here playing the Feud.

1295
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,240
Wow.

1296
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,000
And everybody just thinking of him as like,

1297
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,960
oh, hey, all right, yeah, the professor.

1298
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,200
And boy, he never, how did they have the professor?

1299
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,120
And he made the stuff out of coconuts,

1300
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,520
but he couldn't get him off the island.

1301
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,280
You know, this guy was like a true hero,

1302
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,160
like narrowly escaped death when his friend did not.

1303
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,520
Like, what an amazing man.

1304
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,040
Most people are just like,

1305
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,240
hey, you were on the show with the island.

1306
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,480
You're like a joke, right?

1307
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,080
You're like a living joke, right?

1308
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,240
Isn't that right, professor?

1309
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,840
I remember, I feel like an old Conan O'Brien

1310
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,960
has referenced Russell Johnson a few times

1311
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,400
as a joke of like, who he could get as like,

1312
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,280
early on in the early days of the show, maybe?

1313
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,120
Yeah.

1314
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,320
Or like, Ralph Malf or Donnie Most.

1315
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,680
Oh, sure, yes, yeah, yeah, that's who would say yes

1316
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,880
in early late night days.

1317
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,720
Right, right.

1318
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,800
But I think Russell Johnson popped up as one of his.

1319
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,400
That's also like who he would want to.

1320
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,240
Yeah, yeah.

1321
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,080
Yeah.

1322
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,680
You'd have to imagine.

1323
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,520
But okay, on the, let's go to the Batman side,

1324
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
which is pretty stacked.

1325
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,360
You got Batman and Robin themselves,

1326
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,520
Adam West, Burt Ward.

1327
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,400
Pretty stacked.

1328
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,640
I wonder how they went about,

1329
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,600
was that the first Catwoman they asked?

1330
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,440
Or was that?

1331
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,760
That's a very good question

1332
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,360
because she's only in the movie.

1333
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,000
Leave me alone, is the only in the movie,

1334
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
she did not have most appearances.

1335
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,040
And they refer to, like Adam West says,

1336
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,200
and she would, she'd try to get me on the show,

1337
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,240
but she was not on the show.

1338
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,080
Not on the show.

1339
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,920
Not on the show.

1340
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,080
And yet, I think due to the movie,

1341
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,160
which is the height of the franchise, I think.

1342
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
Right, that's the best.

1343
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,320
Could be the best Catwoman.

1344
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,080
I really like her as Miss Kitka, the alternate identity.

1345
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,520
And the two of them are like in the back of a limo

1346
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,840
and like, you know.

1347
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,680
Oh, the romance.

1348
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Cooing to each other.

1349
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,520
Yeah.

1350
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,040
These insane poetic romantic lines.

1351
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,440
But what is action?

1352
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,680
Or what is an idea, if not a course for action?

1353
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,880
Which is like what preludes him kissing her on the ear.

1354
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,360
Yes, it's ridiculous.

1355
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,760
Seeing Bruce Wayne romantic and talking and that insane,

1356
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,600
it's so good.

1357
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,760
He is doing like reserved, like Bruce Commissioner.

1358
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,400
Like he's doing the Bruce, I don't know,

1359
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,200
he seems so dignified.

1360
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,760
And I gotta say, I like his vest.

1361
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,240
I like his vest, but I really like Burt Ward's outfit.

1362
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,760
The green shirt, the striped tie, the blue blade.

1363
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,120
I'm like, oh, I would wear that.

1364
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,560
I would wear that now.

1365
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,080
I didn't clock this.

1366
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,920
I don't remember either.

1367
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,760
It makes sense, though, that you would take

1368
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,480
fashion tips from Burt Ward.

1369
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,560
Burt Ward looked pretty good, I thought.

1370
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,400
I'm not denying it.

1371
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,840
I just don't remember it either, really.

1372
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,280
I think he looked fine in my memory,

1373
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,880
but I don't remember the actual outfit.

1374
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,920
I feel like, and Vincent Price looking good.

1375
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,880
I feel like the Batman family bringing it,

1376
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,080
the fellas bringing it with style.

1377
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,920
Sure, sure.

1378
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,560
Hey, but don't leave the ladies out of it.

1379
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Lee Merriweather, as Adam points out, of Miss America.

1380
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
I didn't realize that.

1381
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,880
Miss America, 55.

1382
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,240
Yvonne Craig, beautiful and very charismatic.

1383
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,080
Sure, yeah.

1384
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,320
Batgirl, which I'm not unbelievably familiar

1385
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,640
with Batgirl, because it's kind of later.

1386
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,480
They added her later, yeah.

1387
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,440
We're getting into some Cousin Oliver territory.

1388
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,600
They were trying to spin it off,

1389
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
and it was a gustful spin-off grip.

1390
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
Motorcycle, yeah.

1391
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,240
Good motorcycle, I like the motorcycle.

1392
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,080
Very cool motorcycle, yeah.

1393
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,360
But I don't remember any moments

1394
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
with Batgirl, particularly.

1395
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,480
I don't know that I have one that sticks out

1396
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,240
that's like, oh, that was an amazing one.

1397
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,160
Bit of a cursed character, in a way,

1398
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,440
because there's no, you know, hasn't shown up in new ones.

1399
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,880
No place for Batgirl, really, in the Nolan verse.

1400
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,680
Yeah.

1401
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,120
Alicia Silverstone is in, Batman and Robin.

1402
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,960
Trying her best.

1403
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,000
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

1404
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,640
Alfred's niece, that's right.

1405
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,520
So that is, when they have to repeat the suit-up sequence

1406
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,400
with the push-ins to the body parts.

1407
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,240
Oh, yeah.

1408
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,200
It is really unfortunate.

1409
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,880
I feel like, do we have to do this

1410
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,720
for what you've presented as a young girl character?

1411
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,880
No nipples on that bat suit would be very inappropriate.

1412
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,120
Yeah, yeah, they should.

1413
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,960
That was tasteful.

1414
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,800
It's one area where they were tasteful.

1415
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,640
Thank you, Joel.

1416
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,960
That was tasteful, finally.

1417
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,160
Yes.

1418
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,840
But yeah, she kind of like, you know,

1419
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,440
is the beginning of the end.

1420
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,600
It's not because of her.

1421
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,560
There's plenty wrong with Batman and Robin.

1422
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,400
Sure.

1423
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
It's funny that she shows up, and then the three,

1424
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,040
it's, at the end, it's the three of them

1425
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,880
running through the bat signal.

1426
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
They're like, now it's them forever.

1427
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,400
Get ready for, you're gonna see them soon,

1428
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,000
Batman triumphant or whatever.

1429
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,320
And nope, we didn't get to see him fight Howard Stern.

1430
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,560
Something I have never believed is actually was true.

1431
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, was Goldblum or Howard Stern

1432
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
were the two rumors for that?

1433
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,280
Both as Scarecrow was the thought.

1434
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,120
I mean, I feel like they both would have been great.

1435
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,040
It's possible.

1436
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,880
I mean, Goldblum for sure.

1437
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,960
Goldblum, yes.

1438
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,360
I don't know that Howard is that good of an actor.

1439
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,440
He made it through private parts,

1440
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,640
he's good in private parts as himself.

1441
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,600
Could he have been...

1442
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,880
I don't know. Sorry to imagine it.

1443
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,440
Yeah, in the wake of the scenery chew

1444
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,480
of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones.

1445
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,720
I mean, maybe with the right outfit.

1446
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,560
And I mean, with Schumacher.

1447
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,400
Perhaps it would have been fine.

1448
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,880
Schumacher around him directing.

1449
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,960
But yeah, I don't know that he would have.

1450
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,000
He would have gotten the best performance out of it,

1451
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,840
as he always did.

1452
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,480
He pulls. As he got everyone's

1453
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,680
favorite performances of their whole careers.

1454
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,520
That's true, yeah.

1455
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,760
Every, it might not have popped.

1456
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,720
Carrey and Joe, I think they are both pretty funny.

1457
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,680
Yeah, and I think we're, yes, of course.

1458
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,200
It's the greatest thing, yeah.

1459
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,600
And Tommy Lee Jones seems like he's just trying

1460
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,760
to outdo Jim Carrey, because he hated him so much.

1461
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,280
I mean, according to Jim Carrey, he hated him,

1462
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,760
which I don't think that's an exaggeration.

1463
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,840
But it is, if you watch now, you're like,

1464
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,440
why are these guys both playing the same thing?

1465
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Amped up.

1466
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,560
Both of them are playing the same energy.

1467
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,120
Taking it to 12.

1468
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,200
They've gone past 11.

1469
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,640
Because Two-Face, in general, in my mind,

1470
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,960
as a character, is just more of a low-key guy.

1471
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,920
I guess Eckhart played him more like that in Dark Knight.

1472
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
But he's obviously explosive.

1473
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,240
But Tommy Lee Jones is not letting the foot

1474
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,440
off the gas in that movie.

1475
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,280
No.

1476
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
And I have a feeling it's because he's like,

1477
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,000
I am not letting this fucking punk outshine me.

1478
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,080
I can do this crap, too.

1479
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,520
I can yell and be big.

1480
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,640
I can be for babies.

1481
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,440
Right, yes.

1482
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,160
He's so reserved in the Batman animated series.

1483
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,280
Unless he's losing his coin, then he freaks out.

1484
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,040
And Schumacher hated working with Tommy Lee Jones.

1485
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,760
He said he did not like working with Tommy Lee Jones

1486
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,080
or Val Kilmer.

1487
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,840
But Jim Carrey, he loved working with.

1488
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
Of course.

1489
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,520
So there you go.

1490
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,240
And then reunited for one of the greatest films

1491
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,640
ever made, number 23.

1492
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,480
Of course.

1493
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,760
Yeah.

1494
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,480
OK, so that's our take.

1495
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Oh, wait, and then Vincent Price becomes kind of a motley crew

1496
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,280
hero, where it's heroes, all three of the heroes,

1497
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,840
and then a Catwoman who was only Catwoman once,

1498
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,200
although a great Catwoman.

1499
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,840
And then you think of the big four,

1500
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,880
and Egghead is not necessarily in the big four.

1501
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,440
But what a delight, too.

1502
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah.

1503
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,080
Had any of them passed away by this point?

1504
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,680
I think so.

1505
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,480
Maybe they're building options are limited.

1506
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,240
I don't know.

1507
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,920
I don't think so.

1508
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,840
Maybe Caesar, no, Caesar Mero probably a little bit later.

1509
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,200
But no, Gorshin was alive, and Burgess

1510
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,040
was alive well into the 90s, at least the 90s.

1511
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,960
So yeah, I don't know.

1512
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,920
It's a good question.

1513
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,040
Somebody just wanted Vincent Price on there, I guess.

1514
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,920
As do we.

1515
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah.

1516
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:35,960
It's great.

1517
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,320
It's great to remember the existence of Egghead.

1518
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,800
And that also, I can't, Egghead's theme was eggs.

1519
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,240
And he had a bald head, like an egg shell.

1520
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,740
Right.

1521
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,680
And did his henchmen also, were they like egg men?

1522
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,240
Kind of, yeah, I think.

1523
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,920
Yeah.

1524
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,840
And if he was going to make a pun,

1525
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,360
what is the nature of a pun?

1526
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,120
Eggcellent?

1527
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,960
What is it, just eggcellent?

1528
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,880
In the same way that I feel like there is so much perfect

1529
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,640
with Catwoman.

1530
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,280
Yeah.

1531
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,720
I think every single appearance of her, they hit that perfect.

1532
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,520
Right.

1533
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,600
But eggcellent is a harder one.

1534
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
I don't know how much juice you can get out of.

1535
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,360
He's sleeping in a big half egg here on one of the episodes?

1536
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,320
Oh, OK, yes.

1537
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,960
OK, you're showing me an egg bed.

1538
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,000
And then there is bacon on the walls.

1539
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,480
And this answers a question for me,

1540
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,320
is if bacon is in play in the theme of Egghead.

1541
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,520
Absolutely, yeah.

1542
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,880
He can talk about, if he robs a bank,

1543
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,760
he can talk about bringing home the bacon.

1544
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,280
Right.

1545
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,480
That would be acceptable.

1546
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,600
Yes, I think so.

1547
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,560
All right, good to know.

1548
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Burgess Meredith, I looked at, likely not here

1549
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,000
because he's working a lot.

1550
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The Rocky movies.

1551
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,720
He's such a legitimate actor.

1552
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,760
When does foul play, he's in foul play as well.

1553
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,040
That's around this time.

1554
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,640
Yeah, foul play.

1555
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,800
The Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn.

1556
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,960
Yeah.

1557
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,040
Clash of the Titans was only two years before.

1558
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,680
Guy worked.

1559
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,640
I'm looking at, I'm like, OK, let's see some quotes.

1560
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,560
We don't stop at eggcellent.

1561
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,760
OK, eggcellent, I might even go so far as to say exquisite.

1562
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,840
Then later, I for one am exhausted.

1563
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,200
This isn't a pun, but I like it.

1564
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,320
I for one am exhausted.

1565
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,640
It's been a trying day, and I must rest my fantastic brain

1566
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,760
for tonight.

1567
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,560
So that's part of, that's egghead too, is that he's smart.

1568
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,360
Because I guess egghead is important.

1569
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,840
I just didn't know that was part of him as well.

1570
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,560
He's smart.

1571
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,640
Yeah, egghead, yes, yeah, he is smart.

1572
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,720
He could have made that, I have to rest my giant,

1573
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,640
I feel like he could have been like,

1574
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,800
I've got to rest and harden my yolk.

1575
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,400
OK, that's a good plus up, yeah.

1576
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,120
That sounds like it, yeah, yeah.

1577
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,240
He's also got a henchman or a sidekick named Miss Bacon.

1578
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,880
There you go, we're filling it all in together.

1579
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,920
Great egg-spectations.

1580
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,760
You may have the import egg-sport concession

1581
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,320
for such and such.

1582
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,200
How egg-sasperated.

1583
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,920
I got to give these writers more credit.

1584
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,840
They figured out a lot.

1585
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,440
They figured out a lot of these.

1586
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,800
There are a lot there, yeah.

1587
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,880
And they couldn't even go to dictionary.com.

1588
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,400
They had to have a physical copy and filter

1589
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,240
through those EX words.

1590
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Find them all, make sure that it was ones

1591
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,680
that kids could understand.

1592
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,960
You can't have too massive of a six syllable term there,

1593
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,400
or you lose the kiddos.

1594
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:27,920
Great job.

1595
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,280
There's also an episode of Batman

1596
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,960
with a guest starring spot for Al and Hale Jr.

1597
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,240
I don't know if you saw this.

1598
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,680
Oh, I was wondering about that.

1599
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,720
And egghead is egghead, he's on it.

1600
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,320
Oh, really?

1601
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,000
Yes.

1602
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,040
And the joke in the scene is that Chief O'Hara is there.

1603
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,760
I think he's like a bartender, or Al and Hale's

1604
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,720
like a bartender.

1605
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,960
And Chief O'Hara keeps going, hey, Gilligan.

1606
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,880
So the joke is that he's calling him Gilligan.

1607
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,240
It's not his character's name.

1608
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,840
But then egghead shows up in the scene.

1609
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,760
So they kind of have a little tiny thing.

1610
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,240
Really?

1611
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,640
That's the chemistry that comes from this entire thing.

1612
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,080
They didn't work on set together,

1613
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,920
then they're hanging out at the lobster barrel.

1614
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,400
Of course.

1615
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:05,920
Yeah.

1616
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,040
It's practically heat.

1617
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,920
It's Pacino and De Niro together.

1618
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,480
Practically heat, I agree.

1619
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,160
Basically the same thing.

1620
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,320
So that's the groups, that's the families.

1621
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,120
By the way, I just did some calculations.

1622
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,320
When did these shows go off the air in comparison

1623
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,600
to this in 1883?

1624
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,760
These shows went off the air 15 and 17 years prior,

1625
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,080
which that would be the equivalent of today,

1626
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,040
a family feud that is a classic TV

1627
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,160
reunion of the casts of According to Jim

1628
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,640
and That's So Raven.

1629
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,760
That is how long ago.

1630
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,480
That's the exact length of time.

1631
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,640
I was going to say like, oh, it's the OC family

1632
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,440
versus the Gossip Girl family.

1633
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,360
Of course, now we've already gotten to Gossip Girl reboot.

1634
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,040
Gossip Girl versus Gossip Girl would be great.

1635
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,800
Let's focus on each other.

1636
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,080
That's good.

1637
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,520
I feel like they do do these kind of,

1638
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,280
because there was a pretty viral thing with Jackass.

1639
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,600
I don't remember what it was in Steve Harvey era.

1640
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,640
I think they do a lot of casts.

1641
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,720
Oh, Jackass did family feud.

1642
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,840
Yes, that's right.

1643
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,920
Yeah, I don't remember what the thing was.

1644
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,800
I don't know what made Steve make the face.

1645
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,320
Oh, I think they were getting a little nasty.

1646
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,240
Those guys, what?

1647
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,880
We save it for your unrated movies.

1648
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,960
Well, we just took a break.

1649
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,200
I just want to say that here, because Jason,

1650
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,160
on the way to the restroom, made some just observation

1651
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,080
about Richard Dawson.

1652
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,920
I said, Jason, what are you doing this?

1653
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,160
Don't say it on the mic.

1654
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,960
Well, I didn't want to forget.

1655
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,640
Oh, OK.

1656
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,360
That's why I was saying it.

1657
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,800
I was just worried you weren't going to do it.

1658
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,720
So I just want to make sure the audience knows

1659
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,280
that I freaked out, because I was like,

1660
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
Jason burned off a funny comment.

1661
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
The question was interesting.

1662
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,880
Yeah, yeah, you broke your phone.

1663
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,280
You threw it at me.

1664
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,400
Yes, I did throw it at you.

1665
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,200
Shut up.

1666
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,400
Right.

1667
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,960
Do not speak unless microphones are for weird things.

1668
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,760
It's very cold.

1669
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,880
We don't talk before or after these episodes.

1670
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,560
Well, we haven't talked much about Dawson.

1671
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,120
You're right.

1672
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,200
Let's bring it around to Dawson, graduate of Hogan's Heroes,

1673
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,680
known maybe even more as the host of this show,

1674
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,640
and known for, within this show, smooching.

1675
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,120
Yeah, kissing on the mouth.

1676
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,480
Kissing the ladies on the mouth.

1677
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,080
On the mouth, which I'm like, in 2024, I'm like,

1678
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,400
you should kiss the fellas on the mouth.

1679
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,040
You should kiss everybody.

1680
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,560
You should just equalize it.

1681
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,720
He's very intimate with the men, too, when he grabs Adam.

1682
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,000
He's always pulling them in to watch those final scores

1683
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,280
in the last round.

1684
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,600
So he's showing them a lot.

1685
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,520
They're arm in arm.

1686
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,120
Some touching.

1687
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,880
There's touching.

1688
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,360
But you want it to go further.

1689
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,600
But everyone seemed prepared for it.

1690
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,880
Everyone seemed like they had.

1691
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,680
OK, so he comes around.

1692
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,400
If you haven't ever seen this before, there's a long intro.

1693
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,920
And I feel like the intro's a little shorter these days.

1694
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,680
Yeah, because you kind of meet everybody.

1695
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,520
They introduce all the hosts.

1696
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,000
And then he goes down the line and talks to them all.

1697
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,560
So there's two introductory rounds.

1698
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,200
And maybe it's because they're celebrities.

1699
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,440
They're taking a little longer.

1700
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,880
Yeah, if they were just common riff raff, junk people.

1701
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,560
Of course.

1702
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,880
But he goes person by person.

1703
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,640
And if it's a lady that you have,

1704
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,520
I don't know if a producer yelled at them,

1705
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,080
like, you have to kiss this man.

1706
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,600
But he kind of put his hands on their arms.

1707
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,000
And then he'll like, I don't know

1708
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,520
that he requires a mouth kiss.

1709
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,280
But he'll kiss them in some ways.

1710
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,440
I think every woman on this episode

1711
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,440
kissed him on the mouth.

1712
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,840
And by the way, in some cases at least, because it's not,

1713
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,680
sometimes it's just like, all right,

1714
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,960
it's a quick little moment.

1715
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,280
Maybe they try to play it off like it's nice.

1716
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,440
But Lee Merriwether, they lock in.

1717
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,680
And she actually comes in with like, this one's for my mother.

1718
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,840
This one's for my sister.

1719
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,200
And this one's for me.

1720
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,960
She goes like cheek, cheek, and then mouth.

1721
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,160
Yeah, she goes for it.

1722
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,520
And that is a flirtatious moment.

1723
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,960
Solid bit.

1724
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,040
I swear on most of their eyes, I sense

1725
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,920
that they were all like, OK, here we go.

1726
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
We've gotten through that.

1727
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,400
I know I have to do it.

1728
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,520
Which culturally, I think, was, I bet,

1729
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,280
in this era, which is my parents' era,

1730
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,440
where you kiss your friend's wives on the mouth.

1731
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,240
This was still, I've seen this happen

1732
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,360
with my parents' generation.

1733
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,160
Wow, really?

1734
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,520
Yes, yes.

1735
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,240
Jason, you've seen that with your parents?

1736
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,280
I've seen, like, a quick, like, a cheek kiss.

1737
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,720
I know the cheek, yes.

1738
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,680
I've never seen mouth-o.

1739
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:50,000
And I think that was allowed on family feuds sometimes.

1740
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,320
They would throw the cheek at Dawson.

1741
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,280
They really don't want it, yeah.

1742
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,320
Just give him something.

1743
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,920
But he's sitcom royalty, so I guess

1744
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,760
you have to kiss him on the mouth if you're

1745
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,280
all in the sitcom families.

1746
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,920
It's very off-putting.

1747
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,440
It's so weird.

1748
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,000
I knew it would come up in this.

1749
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,360
And you could say, like, yeah, well,

1750
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,800
under 2024 standards, it's a little bit.

1751
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,120
I think in 1983 standards, this was weird.

1752
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,880
People thought it was weird.

1753
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,360
Absolutely.

1754
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,160
People definitely thought it was weird.

1755
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,560
People absolutely thought it was weird at the time.

1756
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,760
I think it was complained about, and then maybe they

1757
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,280
tried to stop doing it, but then other viewers, oh, wait.

1758
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,960
I think they actually ran a poll.

1759
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,160
And most people were like, no, I like the kissing.

1760
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,240
That's part of it.

1761
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,000
But it grew from a small minority.

1762
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,200
This is strange.

1763
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,720
And he is not European, I feel like, in Europe,

1764
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,960
different standards, so maybe a little more common.

1765
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,760
Is he British, though?

1766
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,840
Oh, is he British?

1767
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,000
Is that the excuse?

1768
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,120
Maybe he is.

1769
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,280
I think the accent really disappeared, but I believe.

1770
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:46,800
Yeah, he is.

1771
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,280
You're right.

1772
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,320
The other thing I mentioned during the break

1773
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,640
when Mike knocked over all the Mike stands in Fury,

1774
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,480
Dawson in a full tuxedo for sitcom week.

1775
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,520
Yeah.

1776
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,760
Was he not typically in a full tuxedo?

1777
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,040
I think he usually dressed up.

1778
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,320
Well, that's what I thought.

1779
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:08,080
He was always in a nice, but he might have been a tuxedo.

1780
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,320
Here's what I'll say about Richard Dawson.

1781
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,480
As a kid, I did like seeing the old episodes

1782
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,960
with Richard Dawson hosting.

1783
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,000
I was not a Big Hogan's Heroes kid or anything.

1784
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,160
I saw it.

1785
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,560
I will say that in my mind, I want

1786
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,680
to like Richard Dawson more than any time I see him now.

1787
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,960
Yeah, because the energy is.

1788
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,320
He's just like, I don't know if he's drunk

1789
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,920
or doesn't care or both.

1790
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,520
He's like under his breath meanders.

1791
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,760
And sometimes you really end up in a territory,

1792
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,440
sometimes where he's so like, because this

1793
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,360
is the round where you get the score and blah, blah, blah.

1794
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,040
Like he gets slurry at the end of this one.

1795
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,440
Yeah, he might be drunk.

1796
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,520
I mean, that would be believable.

1797
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,680
But I also like even some scene clips of him on Hogan's Heroes,

1798
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,320
I hate to say this about an old character actor,

1799
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,000
but I don't see it.

1800
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,200
I don't know that I see it.

1801
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,600
You've got so many to choose from as it is.

1802
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,600
You're already exploding with love for so many of these men.

1803
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,040
In the front of my mind, I want to say Richard Dawson, that's

1804
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,400
one of those crazy 70s, 60s celebrities.

1805
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,760
It's fun to go back and watch him.

1806
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,840
And I'm like, maybe it's not.

1807
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,480
Maybe it's not so fun for Richard.

1808
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,000
I know what you mean.

1809
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,160
No, I'm much more put off by the kissing.

1810
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,480
And I'm not just trying to.

1811
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,160
OK, Dawson, often in a three piece suit,

1812
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,680
I think this is sometimes in the tux for special episodes,

1813
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,160
it looks like, but sometimes just in a suit.

1814
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,320
But wait, do we get to what your question was,

1815
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,360
involving the tux?

1816
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,280
Well, I think the tux is for celebrity.

1817
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,920
No, but what you had asked during the break was,

1818
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,640
is the kissing better or worse?

1819
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,960
Oh, is it better or worse?

1820
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,560
Yeah, I don't know.

1821
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,120
I don't know.

1822
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,840
Is the kissing better or worse in a tuxedo?

1823
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,440
Like he's, with a tux, you start thinking,

1824
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,040
well, this is James Bond.

1825
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,720
How can you resist a kiss from the debonair?

1826
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,960
It's tricky because it's TV and it is still a performance,

1827
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,000
but everyone's there themselves.

1828
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,360
Obviously, you're not offended necessarily

1829
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,520
by a kiss on a sitcom because it's written into the script.

1830
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,440
But here, it's reality, but you are playing the role

1831
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,240
of someone who has to tolerate a kiss

1832
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,120
from a drunk Richard Dawson.

1833
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,400
And that's really where, tux or no tux,

1834
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,760
when those lips get close to you

1835
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,920
and you feel the booze.

1836
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,120
The anxiety, I'm sure you would feel.

1837
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,120
Yeah, yeah.

1838
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,400
And that's why I think even like Lee Merriwether,

1839
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,080
who went in hard, was just like,

1840
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,320
all right, I'm biting a bolt,

1841
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,200
like biting down on the leather strap.

1842
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,040
I'm gonna control the situation.

1843
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,560
Yes, that's what I sensed.

1844
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,440
Most of them wanted to control the situation.

1845
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,920
They're like, I'm not letting this motherfucker

1846
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,200
put his tongue in my mouth or anything on the air.

1847
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,640
Like, if I have to do this,

1848
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,600
because he's gonna be weird

1849
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,160
or the producer's gonna yell at me,

1850
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,960
I'm in charge, I'll give him the smooch,

1851
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,160
not the other way around.

1852
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,000
Yeah.

1853
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,920
Control the narrative.

1854
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,840
Exactly.

1855
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,080
I'm looking at the hosts and announcers section

1856
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,520
of the Wikipedia, and I read this about the kissing.

1857
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,840
Dawson showed himself to have insistent affection.

1858
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,320
Oh, I do not like that phrase.

1859
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,720
Showed himself to have insistent affections

1860
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,760
for all of the female members of each family

1861
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,560
that competed on the show, regardless of age.

1862
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,400
Kissing them, an act that attracted some controversy

1863
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,680
then among viewers.

1864
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,680
And then right after that, citation needed.

1865
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,000
I like that, that somebody's perusing this Wikipedia

1866
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,680
and then like, I don't understand,

1867
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,760
people didn't like the kissing?

1868
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,920
What, where, where?

1869
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,240
Show me, citation needed.

1870
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,080
Show your proof.

1871
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,240
Hey, come on, oh really?

1872
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,480
People didn't like it, huh?

1873
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,560
Well then why didn't they ever put pen to paper

1874
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,840
and say in the media that they didn't like it?

1875
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,440
This is fake, this whole thing is fake.

1876
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,000
Everyone loved the kissing.

1877
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,080
I'm taking to Wikipedia, I'm gonna write this wrong

1878
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,600
on behalf of dead Richard Dawson.

1879
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,320
This is like Jordan Peterson would take this up

1880
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,600
or something, or like, Elon Musk would be like,

1881
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,000
we have to defend the honor of Richard Dawson's estate.

1882
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,760
Jordan Peterson just openly weeping.

1883
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,240
Right, Richard Dawson was a.

1884
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,160
Some people are trying to take away his kissing.

1885
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,040
He was a wonderful.

1886
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,040
The young men don't have any guidance.

1887
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,480
Somebody, yeah, somebody really cares

1888
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,320
to preserve the magic of the kissing.

1889
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,960
Yeah, I will not let this be said.

1890
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,760
Apparently the defense of the kissing was that like,

1891
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,880
well you know what, you know what made it good

1892
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
is that it was equal opportunity.

1893
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,600
He kissed everyone.

1894
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,800
And there was even the defense that like.

1895
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,720
Oh, he kissed like grandma.

1896
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,720
And not only that, but like racially,

1897
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,400
he will, at a time where on television

1898
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,120
you don't really see that.

1899
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,960
But I'm still like.

1900
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,200
I mean, it's still weird.

1901
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,040
No, no, no.

1902
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,600
That's a nice thought, I suppose.

1903
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,840
That took some real spin room,

1904
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,080
like let's put our heads together.

1905
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,480
How are we gonna make this kissing?

1906
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,800
Okay, it's progressive kissing, don't you see?

1907
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,160
If you're kissing everyone,

1908
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,400
you should kiss dad and grandpa too.

1909
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
And that is real, that's, you're right.

1910
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,840
He could have gotten away.

1911
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,160
Like truly, if it was equal opportunity,

1912
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,000
you kiss everybody in that family.

1913
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,400
He truly would have gotten away with it

1914
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,800
if he could have just kissed dad and grandpa as well.

1915
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1916
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,920
They deserve it too.

1917
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,760
Give it the cheeks, the cheeks.

1918
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,600
They work hard.

1919
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,720
Some of these grandpas probably in the war,

1920
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,360
like Russell Johnson. Yes.

1921
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,200
Kiss Russell Johnson.

1922
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
He has a purple heart.

1923
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,360
Kiss him on the mouth.

1924
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,080
Yeah, for sure.

1925
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,000
He needs some more.

1926
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,560
Kiss your heroes. Open mouth, open mouth.

1927
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,640
He deserves some. Open mouth.

1928
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,200
The whole audience should have enchanting that.

1929
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,720
The other weird little affect, if the Richard does it,

1930
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,200
because we're watching some like blurry old copies

1931
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,280
of this on YouTube.

1932
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,280
And there's these kind of like trees next to the podiums.

1933
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,680
I'm like, what's these trees?

1934
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,840
And I, because of the blurriness,

1935
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,520
I was baffled when they reached for the trees

1936
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,440
and pull out like Tootsie Pops.

1937
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,600
This was part of it. Oh, yeah.

1938
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,120
There was a, like truly it looks like a potted plant to me.

1939
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,160
And like, wait a minute,

1940
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,720
all the branches of this are Tootsie Pops?

1941
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,320
And that was a thing on this show,

1942
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,880
was that he always had a big array of Tootsie Pops

1943
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,440
to so many things, a lot of things on this show.

1944
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,280
Yeah.

1945
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,160
Vincent Price had a marker.

1946
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,560
There's a bit about his marker,

1947
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,640
and then they start scribbling on the Tootsie Pops.

1948
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,800
That was confusing.

1949
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,480
Was that like a, he was doing like a,

1950
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,960
was that a gag?

1951
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,160
He thought he was on match game or something else?

1952
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,000
No idea.

1953
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,560
My notes just say what is going on.

1954
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,400
I know, I also was like, what is this?

1955
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,880
No idea, yeah.

1956
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,280
This is, and really, much like this episode

1957
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,280
where we were probably taking more time to talk

1958
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,880
to like set the table than to actually talk about the game.

1959
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,600
There's so much, I feel like they're not playing

1960
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,680
for like 15 minutes, which is fine.

1961
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1962
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,920
We want to hang out with these guys.

1963
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,720
The game is as good as any game, but it's not like there's-

1964
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,560
It's not about that.

1965
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,600
No, no, no.

1966
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,200
To me, if we start getting into the gameplay,

1967
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,800
any moments that jumped out as like,

1968
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,120
well, it was cool to hear these sitcom people

1969
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,840
say these things.

1970
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,160
No, because it never gets too like naughty or anything

1971
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,640
because that's always an aspect of the show.

1972
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,960
But did anything jump out?

1973
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,840
Here's a moment in the gameplay that I like.

1974
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:14,840
When Mr. Magoo says, when he talks about Ronald Reagan,

1975
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,000
and he goes, what does he say after a word?

1976
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,640
He goes like, great man or something.

1977
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,560
God bless him. God bless him.

1978
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,400
That's what he says.

1979
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,680
Yeah, the category is name a celebrity

1980
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,480
who is also a political activist.

1981
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,320
Yeah.

1982
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,080
Jane Fonda, top answer on the board

1983
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,760
with 78 out of possible hundreds.

1984
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,480
So clearly, the like absolutely like dominates,

1985
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,480
but maybe it feels like she was almost one

1986
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,920
of the only ones at the time.

1987
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,760
Yeah.

1988
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,920
People here in 2024, people are still mad at her.

1989
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,760
Yeah, it does be.

1990
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,580
Sure.

1991
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,960
Our current right winger would still say Hanoi Jane.

1992
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,040
We're talking about things from-

1993
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,880
50 years ago.

1994
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,720
Yeah.

1995
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,540
My God.

1996
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,080
Their vote counts the same as ours.

1997
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,920
That's great.

1998
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,560
Paul Newman's also in there

1999
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,160
and then Ronald Reagan's number three.

2000
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,040
Ronald Reagan, God bless him.

2001
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,760
Great moment.

2002
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,800
And then right after-

2003
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,080
I was shocked by this actually.

2004
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,080
Even though I know this.

2005
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,960
I didn't know it.

2006
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,800
Ed Asner.

2007
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,620
Yeah.

2008
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,760
I did not know the strong political meanings of Ed Asner.

2009
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,920
He got 10 points, so people knew this.

2010
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,840
A real lefty.

2011
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,520
A democratic socialist and a fierce opponent of Ronald Reagan.

2012
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,360
Right.

2013
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,200
So how must Bacchus have felt?

2014
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,720
He must have known Asner was possibly coming.

2015
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,280
So he's got to like get ahead of,

2016
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,120
I got to plant my Reagan flag

2017
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,640
before that devil Asner is mentioned.

2018
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,480
He must.

2019
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,400
Well, you know what?

2020
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,880
He, when he had the spinoff, The Lou Grant Show,

2021
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,080
which was a like serious spinoff of Mary Tyler Moore,

2022
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,400
where he played like, he ran a newspaper, I believe.

2023
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,160
You can do a Lou Grant's Place

2024
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,960
where Madame has given him a back massage.

2025
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,360
Oh my God, did Madame ever appear on Lou Grant?

2026
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,880
Even as in a serious role.

2027
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,800
Yeah, it was a serious episode about,

2028
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,280
they were trying to do an article about redlining.

2029
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,120
Yeah.

2030
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,120
And Madame was like pro redlining, I don't know.

2031
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,560
But I think Ed Asner claims

2032
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,240
that his political beliefs canceled,

2033
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,760
just got the show canceled.

2034
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,440
That's what he says or said.

2035
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,280
Wow.

2036
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,080
Well, thank God we've come such a long way

2037
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,280
in terms of actors being able to say

2038
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,640
whatever they think about current events.

2039
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,800
That's true.

2040
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,560
Don't ignore all articles about the Scream franchise.

2041
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,280
Yeah, the Scream franchise.

2042
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,080
Some, a member of the Scream franchise

2043
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,280
acknowledged Palestinians' humanity and she's out.

2044
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,120
Scream family, come on down.

2045
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,720
Why are there only three people on this team

2046
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,960
in the Scream theme?

2047
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,720
One of you was an extra in the movie.

2048
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,600
I was still in the movie though.

2049
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,160
It's just three people with masks.

2050
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,760
They can't all be the mask guy.

2051
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,520
Other categories, I mean, things have just jumped out

2052
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,160
like Aries Sejimbekis, Make Love.

2053
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,360
I think one of them is like,

2054
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,440
Oh, Things to Buy Before Boarding a Plane.

2055
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,760
It's one of those where just anything Vincent Price says

2056
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,000
is gonna be music to his ears

2057
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,160
because he just says something to read.

2058
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,560
It's great, it's nothing, anything would be good.

2059
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,800
So good.

2060
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,440
He also, in Most Relaxing Thing You Do,

2061
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,800
he says, for me, the most relaxing thing is gardening.

2062
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,560
Perfect, what a nice garden.

2063
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,080
That was a buzzer, that was an X.

2064
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,480
And I was like at home going like,

2065
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,760
you're right, Vincent Price, the people are wrong.

2066
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,680
Like, yeah, working with Lance is very relaxing.

2067
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,320
Not in the top though, what can you say?

2068
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,760
Who are they interviewing?

2069
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,600
Who in general, how do they do these polls?

2070
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,880
And are they made up?

2071
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,040
Is somebody going out there, somebody knocking on doors?

2072
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,960
Hello, I'm from Family Feud.

2073
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,200
I feel like someone said this,

2074
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,480
this is not sourced at all,

2075
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,280
so I don't take this as an actual answer,

2076
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,880
but I feel like they would poll people

2077
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,520
in a mall in the Midwest.

2078
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,360
Ah, sure.

2079
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,200
I don't know if they'd contract a company to do it

2080
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,200
or something, but you just,

2081
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,840
somebody's job was to ask people at a mall.

2082
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,560
That being said, easily could fake all this.

2083
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,760
Yeah, yeah, if they just need to get it done.

2084
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,960
It does seem like, because today this seems like a show

2085
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,520
where they're probably filming seven in a day.

2086
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,840
Let's crank these out, no one looks Steve in the eye.

2087
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,720
If we throw him, we'll lose one of these episodes.

2088
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,240
Even back then it seemed like they were filming a lot

2089
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,640
in a day. I'm sure, yeah.

2090
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,000
This entire thing might've been,

2091
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,720
they might've done this full celebrity week,

2092
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,440
because they all just, you know,

2093
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,720
you could say that Gilligan won the whole thing,

2094
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,840
but I feel like they all got a chance to win and lose.

2095
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,920
I think all the shows won at some point

2096
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,840
and all the shows lost at some point.

2097
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,800
Yeah, and everyone's charity got some money.

2098
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,640
Regardless.

2099
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,160
Regardless.

2100
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,640
Lost in Space family, by the way, no Dr. Smith.

2101
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,760
Well, that's a, that's all I'm saying.

2102
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,640
Which is a tragedy.

2103
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,460
Passed away?

2104
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,300
No.

2105
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,200
No, he's in Bug's Life, he's a voice in Bug's Life.

2106
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,600
Oh, right, right, right, right, that's right.

2107
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,960
Yeah, that's crazy.

2108
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,120
Maybe he was working.

2109
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,320
Yes.

2110
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,400
They do have somebody who they just credit him

2111
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,840
as the robot, because I watched,

2112
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,840
I ended up watching the other Batman one,

2113
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,680
Batman versus Lost in Space.

2114
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,200
And there's nothing too notable there,

2115
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:20,200
except that in that one, Richard Dawson says to Yvonne Craig,

2116
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,200
you have the best legs in the business

2117
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,320
and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

2118
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,920
He also looks at her legs under the desk

2119
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,240
in the other episode too, he like peers,

2120
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,320
yeah, he does a real leery creep thing, yeah.

2121
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,960
Yikes.

2122
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,520
That one, there's a kind of a creepier category.

2123
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,680
Not creepy, it's funny, it's like a funny

2124
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,500
little scandalous category.

2125
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,000
Innuendo was always, it was a good reminder

2126
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,160
watching these, like, oh yeah,

2127
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,200
it didn't start with Steve Harvey.

2128
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,040
Yeah.

2129
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,320
Steve Harvey just is very funny.

2130
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,160
He perfected it.

2131
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,040
Yeah, he perfected it, but there were always some innuendo.

2132
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,200
Too bad you don't get the kiss from Steve,

2133
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,840
because imagine the relaxation

2134
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,360
of getting brushed by that mustache.

2135
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,840
Imagine a little brush from Steve.

2136
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,680
Oh, yeah.

2137
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,960
And how thick that is, that hasn't moved in years.

2138
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,880
So there's gotta be a lady who's tried to kiss him

2139
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,120
on the show before.

2140
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,960
Yeah, probably.

2141
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,160
There's gotta be a clip or two of that.

2142
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,960
Yeah, and he like, he propels backwards.

2143
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,800
Yeah.

2144
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,120
Eyes pop all the way out of the head.

2145
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,960
Right.

2146
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,240
The other one that, I mean, Lost in Space

2147
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,800
has the category, places for where a hubby goes

2148
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,200
to make it with his number two.

2149
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,000
That's like where you go to cheat on your wife.

2150
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,600
Which Adam West gets X'd with the response, parking lot.

2151
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,400
He gets the X and then says, I'm on a cheap date.

2152
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,680
How, real quick side note, Batman versus Lost in Space

2153
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,840
sounds like the coolest 60s show you could've done.

2154
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,680
Oh, yeah.

2155
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,500
Yeah.

2156
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,340
That would've been awesome.

2157
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,320
They really should've done some competitions more.

2158
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:54,320
The dirtiest category on the Batman,

2159
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,320
Batman, Gilgamesh Island episode,

2160
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:02,320
there's like, name a magazine with like, sex tips?

2161
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,200
Is that what it is?

2162
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,080
Is that in one of these?

2163
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,320
Oh, I don't know.

2164
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,160
I didn't see that one.

2165
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,000
Well, the answers are like,

2166
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,960
Cosmo, Playboy, Hustler, Playgirl.

2167
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,120
Oh, I didn't see that.

2168
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,040
Was that in the other one?

2169
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,880
Was that Lost in Space?

2170
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,720
Maybe that's on the other one.

2171
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,480
Yeah, I don't remember that.

2172
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,600
Cause we would've been scandalized.

2173
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,880
We would've come in with a lot of like,

2174
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,400
Playgirl, did my virgin ears hear Playgirl magazine?

2175
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,360
Which, I mean, yeah, once you get Cosmo knocked out,

2176
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,040
it's just dirty magazines afterwards.

2177
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,800
Adam West should've done Playgirl.

2178
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,640
Yeah.

2179
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,480
Oh, yeah.

2180
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,300
In the 90s.

2181
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:39,600
If Lookwell had gone forward.

2182
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,440
Oh, God.

2183
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they would've demanded it.

2184
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,480
Pure West.

2185
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,400
Big, like, bat, you know, like a boomerang,

2186
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,320
like a batarang, like just covering the girl.

2187
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,040
Yeah, that's right.

2188
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,280
Yep, he would've done it, would've been packin'.

2189
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,200
So, what else?

2190
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,520
You know what, I think, as much as I thought

2191
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,200
it'd be the most fun to see the Batman gang,

2192
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,560
I like seeing the Gilligan gang work together,

2193
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,520
because that's what they did on the show.

2194
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,400
They put their heads together and worked through a fix.

2195
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,760
So I like seeing Alan Hale seize the group

2196
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,720
and like, come on gang, let's, let's huddle.

2197
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,720
That felt the most like the show is back.

2198
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,020
He just, he's dressed like Skipper

2199
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,100
and he's acting like Skipper.

2200
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,100
And he seems like, just like, oh, the nicest older guy.

2201
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,080
Okay, that's so great, he seems so supportive.

2202
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,060
Like we hear those stories about Alan Hale's lobster barrel

2203
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,400
where he was like hangin' around,

2204
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,140
it was the nicest guy to everybody.

2205
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,120
It seems maybe, I mean, he could be performing here,

2206
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,540
but it seems like maybe that is,

2207
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,580
he just became the nice guy Skipper.

2208
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,540
Yeah, yeah.

2209
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,320
Well, the proof, the ultimate proof would've been

2210
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,100
if Bob Denver was there, got X'd a bunch of times.

2211
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:47,940
Right.

2212
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,960
What do you've gotten hit with the hat?

2213
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,520
I think that's why Bob Denver wasn't there.

2214
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,080
Cause he knew, he knew that the hits were real.

2215
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:55,920
Right.

2216
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,600
And what we saw on the show were second takes

2217
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,320
after first takes where the hat hitting was so furious.

2218
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,160
Right.

2219
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,320
Where Alan Hale started putting rocks in his pocket,

2220
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,880
putting them in the hat so that the hats

2221
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,920
could have more impact.

2222
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,760
Yeah.

2223
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,520
And actually bludgeon Gilligan.

2224
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,360
And he knew it, yeah.

2225
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,180
So he was.

2226
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,800
He saved his monsterism.

2227
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,940
As long as you weren't Gilligan, he was nice,

2228
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,480
but watch out if you're Bob Denver.

2229
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,000
Well, maybe if, yeah, the other thing,

2230
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,880
maybe Bob Denver just didn't wanna wear the bucket hat.

2231
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,420
Cause if he was gonna be there,

2232
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,920
they would've made him wear the bucket hat, I feel like.

2233
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,760
Possibly.

2234
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,580
It's possible.

2235
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,400
I mean, I guess if Alan is dressed like Skipper,

2236
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,160
there's more pressure on you to do that now.

2237
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,000
Yeah.

2238
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,160
And they might've, then they just keep going further

2239
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,960
and they, instead of X's, they plant coconuts

2240
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,440
up above their heads so that those drop on you

2241
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,280
when you get a wrong answer.

2242
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,600
The slippery slope is dressing like the Skipper

2243
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,320
cause then that side has to be, yeah.

2244
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,760
It's an arms race.

2245
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,160
Batman, other than just Vincent Price being himself,

2246
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,000
they were not playing the characters.

2247
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,440
Not so much, but you get little flickers of it

2248
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,720
like when Burt Ward, he gets an answer wrong at some point

2249
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,400
and he says, DRAP!

2250
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,600
You get a little Robin.

2251
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,600
That's true, that's true.

2252
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,560
And one thing that I might notch up the other episode,

2253
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,360
Batman versus Lost in Space,

2254
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,660
is that Batman and Robin do the end round together

2255
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:15,160
where you gotta pick two of the five to come out.

2256
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,260
And the two of them kinda like hustle out

2257
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,860
towards the podium or towards center stage or whatever

2258
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:21,340
and I'm like, this is like the opening.

2259
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,180
That's true, yeah.

2260
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,060
The two of them doing their little run.

2261
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,340
That was more of a Batman and Robin are back moment

2262
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,140
than the other, this main episode.

2263
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:33,140
In the Gilligan Lost in Space finale,

2264
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:38,140
all of the Gilligan family gets giant trophies.

2265
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,300
Cool!

2266
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,140
Oh, good!

2267
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,820
Giant cup trophies.

2268
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,660
That's great.

2269
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,140
And Bacchus just seems very confused

2270
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,620
why he's being handed this large cup.

2271
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,460
It's...

2272
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,660
Well, what other moments are we missing?

2273
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,540
I mean, that's a lot of the fun stuff.

2274
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:57,900
You know what, I learned two fun facts about Burt Ward,

2275
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,860
just to get him out before we wrap this up,

2276
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:04,860
which is one that he got paid sag scale to play Robin

2277
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,780
and because he was so cheap,

2278
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,700
but getting a stunt man for Robin was more expensive,

2279
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,500
they would often have him do his own stunts

2280
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,940
just to not bring in another guy.

2281
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,100
So here, Robin, you think he got it made,

2282
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,340
he's a TV icon, and instead it's like,

2283
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,900
hey, let the guy who's making pennies

2284
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,020
make him jump off the building onto the boat.

2285
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,580
They both had to do stunts, him and Adam, I think.

2286
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,860
They both kind of got hurt, I think, decent.

2287
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,420
And it's funny too, because you see it

2288
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,860
and you think, oh, somebody got hurt doing a stunt.

2289
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,980
It must be the most amazing, crazy looking thing

2290
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,060
and it's just like the sloppiest,

2291
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:46,580
poorly choreographed fight scene.

2292
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,420
And it's like, oh yeah, I guess you could easily

2293
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,340
dislocate a shoulder just taking a wild swing

2294
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,900
at Egghead's goon.

2295
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,060
You're right, it does not have to be like Tom Cruise

2296
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,580
jumping between the buildings and the motorcycle.

2297
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,020
Yeah, you can hurt yourself horribly

2298
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,060
and it looks like shit.

2299
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,100
Exactly, yeah.

2300
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,300
So it happened all the time, I think, on that show.

2301
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2302
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,940
They were often very uncoordinated

2303
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,500
and I love at the end of Batman 66, the movie,

2304
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,980
when all the villains and heroes

2305
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,500
and all their henchmen who are pirates

2306
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,820
are all just in a big tank next to a submarine,

2307
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,540
all just bashing each other with wet hats.

2308
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,060
It is the least coordination of an action sequence

2309
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,060
I've ever seen, but it's so great.

2310
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,900
It's just such pure chaos.

2311
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,180
They're all wet.

2312
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:32,540
The direction given was action.

2313
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,380
The end.

2314
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,260
That's how this episode should have ended.

2315
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,900
They all should have been hitting each other

2316
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,660
with wet hats and laughing.

2317
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,940
But they are older now.

2318
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:40,900
They are older.

2319
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:45,460
They are older, which, that plays into,

2320
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,500
I thought maybe a decent way to end this

2321
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,140
could be playing a little bit of Feud ourselves.

2322
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:51,980
Oh, yeah.

2323
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,980
Mike, come on down.

2324
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,020
Jason, come on down.

2325
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,060
Okay.

2326
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,020
Mike, it's good to see you.

2327
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,900
You have the most beautiful, oh, your shorts.

2328
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,380
I can, mwah, mwah, mwah.

2329
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,700
Can I kiss those legs?

2330
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,780
Thank you for kissing my little legs.

2331
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,500
Oh, and not to leave out Jason.

2332
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,940
Oh, my, my, my.

2333
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,620
Let me take those glasses off so they don't fog up.

2334
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:13,620
This is one from me, one from me, one from me,

2335
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:15,220
and one more from me.

2336
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,060
Wow.

2337
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,180
I hope there's a lot more of you where that came from.

2338
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:22,220
Okay, so. There is, there is.

2339
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,060
Thank God.

2340
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,660
All right, after the show.

2341
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,740
You're not going anywhere.

2342
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,020
Stay in the green room.

2343
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:27,860
Okay.

2344
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:32,700
Okay, so top nine answers on the board.

2345
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:36,780
Name of people on the stage

2346
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:41,460
for this Batman versus Gilligan on Family Feud.

2347
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:46,460
Name the performer who died the soonest

2348
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,660
after this 1983 taping.

2349
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,500
Jason.

2350
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,660
Jim Baucus.

2351
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,500
You got it.

2352
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,860
Number one, number one answer.

2353
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:57,260
For bonus points, you want to guess how long after?

2354
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:00,580
Two months?

2355
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,380
Not quite, a little bit, a little bit longer.

2356
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,220
Six years.

2357
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,180
Six years, okay.

2358
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,180
Well, here, do you want to stay on a streak,

2359
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,580
but Mike could steal?

2360
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,420
Okay.

2361
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,260
Can you go for number two?

2362
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,100
Well, he can do it or he can pass it.

2363
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:13,940
Oh, that's true.

2364
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, if you want to keep.

2365
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,940
I'll do it, I'll do it.

2366
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,780
Go ahead.

2367
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,460
Okay, all right, number two.

2368
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,660
Oh, number two, I'm confused.

2369
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:28,460
Number two of actors who died the soonest after Jim Baucus.

2370
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:34,780
Is it Vincent Price?

2371
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,580
It is not Vincent Price.

2372
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,460
Yeah, yeah, all right, do you want to go for Mike?

2373
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,900
I mean, I guess, secondly, he could,

2374
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,900
well, no, yeah, he's got three strikes,

2375
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,220
but we're not playing the official game.

2376
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, we gotta keep it short.

2377
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,940
Is it Alan Hale?

2378
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:46,780
It's not Alan Hale.

2379
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,620
Damn it.

2380
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,440
Natalie Schafer.

2381
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,280
Oh, wow.

2382
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,100
Because the answer's seven years late, I think,

2383
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,700
unless they're like, I don't know,

2384
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:52,540
that's just a guess.

2385
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,700
We're doing some kind of, I believe so,

2386
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,900
but yeah, much more Gilligan cast members lost before,

2387
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:01,820
Vincent Price was the first in like 92, I believe,

2388
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,700
which lines up with him having been able to do

2389
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,900
that voiceover for Phantom Manor.

2390
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,140
Yeah, in my head, I was doing the math

2391
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,820
of when would Phantom Manor be?

2392
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:13,940
Yeah, yeah, so there you go, excellent, excellent work,

2393
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,060
Jim Baucus, soonest deceased.

2394
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:16,900
Wow.

2395
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,500
I'm gonna check that, wait, oh yeah,

2396
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,020
Alan Hale made it to 1990,

2397
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,500
so I believe it is Natalie Schafer.

2398
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,660
Got it.

2399
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,980
Well, any further observations,

2400
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,380
questions before we wind it down?

2401
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:33,500
Yeah, I just, it's interesting that

2402
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:36,380
these crossovers happened on Family Feud

2403
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:38,020
and many years later,

2404
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,180
because as I said, Lost in Space,

2405
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,940
if it was in the heyday of both shows,

2406
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,740
even though they didn't quite overlap, or maybe they did,

2407
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:48,420
actually seeing crossovers would have been very exciting.

2408
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,420
But we got that Alan Hale cameo,

2409
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,940
so there was a little bit of the funny,

2410
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:54,400
fun business, I'll call it.

2411
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,660
Wait a minute, I have checked the results,

2412
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,380
I have double checked the results.

2413
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,940
Mike, you in fact were correct.

2414
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,140
Alan Hale was number two,

2415
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,980
that means the points go to you.

2416
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:04,460
Holy shit.

2417
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:07,900
And the points, of course, in this game are smooches.

2418
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,860
Come back this way.

2419
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,900
Okay, on my legs, please.

2420
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,220
Ah, yes, oh, they're good.

2421
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,180
Kneecaps, please.

2422
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,180
Much more room than on a human face.

2423
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,020
Yeah, of course.

2424
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:17,100
The legs, I could do this for hours and hours.

2425
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,860
Thank you so much, this is so nice.

2426
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,700
I appreciate this.

2427
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,540
I'm glad we're finally acknowledging each other's

2428
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:29,020
no, no, don't say it. Sexual beings.

2429
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,780
For some reason, I'm more comfortable pretending

2430
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,180
to kiss both of you than that particular phrase.

2431
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:38,060
I don't know what it is about it.

2432
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,860
Too any, acknowledging each other.

2433
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,180
Jason's saying it specifically, too.

2434
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,460
Well, is it better or worse that I'm wearing a full tuxedo

2435
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,300
as I do every recording?

2436
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,060
Oh, Dan, you know what you're at.

2437
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,180
I wonder why I was more charmed by that phrase

2438
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,060
than previously.

2439
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,340
Well, I think that winds it down.

2440
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:59,220
I think you survived podcast The Ride.

2441
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,300
Hey, what a fun one.

2442
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,500
Thank you for this assignment, Matt.

2443
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,260
Best of luck as you try to make it to number three

2444
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:11,020
to get three green check marks instead of Xs.

2445
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,420
Maybe somebody has already.

2446
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,260
I wanna know.

2447
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,740
I don't know.

2448
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:19,220
It's not like, it's a little person to have a suggestion

2449
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,540
that's good enough that we take it

2450
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,420
and then that the audience has to choose it.

2451
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,580
We do a survey just like Family Feud.

2452
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:27,660
So good work.

2453
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:31,620
And I throw that assignment out to everybody else, too.

2454
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,100
Let's see what goes up against American Girl Cafe

2455
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,540
next month.

2456
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,260
Your Bravery Saved the Podcast.

2457
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,580
Well done, Freedom Fighters.

2458
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,340
And I don't know, does he say,

2459
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,020
does Richard Dawson say anything at the end?

2460
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,900
He just like mumbles and slurs, I guess.

2461
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,820
Yeah, falls over.

2462
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,660
Yeah, yeah.

2463
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:51,260
All right, so from all of us here at Family Feud,

2464
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,300
make sure to gaborata.

2465
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,780
Make sure to use a.

2466
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,940
Oh no.

2467
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,780
Scott actually did that, too.

2468
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,780
Oh, Scott spilled his seven and seven.

2469
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,980
That was not just theater of the mind.

2470
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,940
He fell over out of the chair to make that sound.

2471
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:04,100
I just wanna let everyone know that

2472
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,180
because maybe people would think he threw a book.

2473
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,620
Now he's grunting and he's rolling around the floor.

2474
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:12,060
All right, just appreciate what he did.
