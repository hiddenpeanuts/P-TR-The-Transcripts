1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,600
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,760
the theme park podcast that's more fun

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,040
than a bucket of pig juice.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,920
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Jason Sheridan.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,120
Yeah, I think I'd rather drink pig juice

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,200
than watch videos of this.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,520
Is it Jason again?

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,280
Let's be honest, you used to have a glass

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,560
of pig juice every morning.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,400
Well, look, the high protein kick, that's Mike Carlson.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I'm here and I'm talking about Jason

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,440
drinking pig juice as a child.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,600
It happened, we all know it happened.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,920
It's a Pennsylvania thing.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,760
Yeah, that's not what we know.

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
Oh, you never heard of pig juice?

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
That's really what I expected.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,440
Like ham salad or Scrapple or whatever.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
Right, right, pig juice.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
That is the one comment that's really excited to like,

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,360
are totally, but Mike and Scott are fools

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,360
for not knowing that everybody wakes up

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,080
to a glass of pig juice.

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,440
That's about too long of a paragraph.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,680
Yes, it'll happen, yeah.

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,040
They did not realize that in some parts of the state,

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,600
you put butter on the bread

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,160
before you start making the sandwich.

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,880
And then if you want mayonnaise or mustard,

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,520
that goes on top of the butter.

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,600
Is that one, is that one come up or is that,

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,680
are you forgoing a future one by getting it out?

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm burning that off, yeah.

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,000
Which one, which one, what was that?

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
What were you just describing?

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
In some of the like areas

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
close to Pennsylvania Dutch country,

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,680
like sandwiches would have butter put on them.

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,880
But like on the bread, sorry.

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,360
Like on the bread, yeah.

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
That's not so weird.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,320
It's not so weird, but it's very specific.

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
Before the rest of the ingredients.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,080
Yeah.

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
What's the point of that?

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,440
I don't know.

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,120
It might be a holdover from when food

49
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,760
didn't really taste good.

50
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,000
I mean, you can get a buttery roll for,

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,680
depending on what you're having a sandwich.

52
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,760
And if you choose a bread of,

53
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,440
as Jason would say, a croissant,

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,400
there's buttery bread, I think.

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,040
So I feel like that's not such a hard thing.

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,120
Well, a buttered roll,

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,800
that's a Philadelphia breakfast go-to.

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,640
It's just a butter roll with like your coffee.

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,680
Well, that's not so crazy either.

60
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,400
No, that's not that unusual.

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,240
These are probably normal.

62
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Yeah, these are normal.

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,240
They have raisin bran in Pennsylvania as well.

64
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
In Pennsylvania, they'll take an egg

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,840
and kind of whip it up in a pan

66
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,320
and then serve that on a, they put it on a plate.

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,760
But people are very serious about the buttered roll.

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
Like there's been New York Times,

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,480
New York Magazine article,

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,680
it's about the node to the buttered roll.

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
What kind of a roll is it?

72
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,840
Like a chewy roll, like an Italian roll.

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,760
Like a hard roll?

74
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,920
Like a harder roll, yeah.

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,600
Okay, because like, is that like,

76
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,960
you could go to a California pizza kitchen

77
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,080
and they have a real hard piece of bread

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,760
that they give you before the meal.

79
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,280
Is it like that?

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
Is it that hard?

81
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,960
I guess it's sort of.

82
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,040
The middle isn't so hard, but the outside is.

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,880
It's kind of a snazzy sort of a chewy snazzy.

84
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,680
It's like a ciabatta kind of bread.

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
It's not, yeah, an inside is not so hard

86
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,480
at the California pizza kitchen.

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,600
And you would dip it in that so you get it a little wet.

88
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,920
That softens you up, yeah.

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
It softens you right up, so.

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,880
I'll bring you up.

91
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,400
Well, it's all, you know, that's stuff you can ask for

92
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,520
if you find yourself doing a Fear Factor Live challenge

93
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,800
and you're not just like,

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,160
I don't know how comfortable I am eating the bull testicles,

95
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,480
so maybe a little bit of butter would soften it up

96
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,120
or make it more palatable.

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
They might not grant that request,

98
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,560
but you know, you could throw it out there.

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,400
Not sure of the rules.

100
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,880
However, ain't nobody doing any Fear Factor Live challenges

101
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,160
because this attraction is closed forever,

102
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,920
thus prompting an episode about it.

103
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
This is one of these, if you don't know,

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,840
this is a, I'd say a long past universal Hollywood

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,200
attraction, but a universal Florida attraction

106
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,440
that drastically outlived the multiple iterations

107
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,240
of the series Fear Factor.

108
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,560
It's been going for a long time,

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,400
but it became one of those seasonal,

110
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,560
kind of in the day in the park with Barney Lane of,

111
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,120
do they still do that?

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,640
And especially it was in question after COVID

113
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,520
and now they have answered, we do not still do this.

114
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,800
And the show is disappearing as of this month, week,

115
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,200
or around this stretch of time.

116
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, it was news to me that as of like the spring of 2020,

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
it was still considered running.

118
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,640
But yeah, and so obviously it shut down.

119
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,240
I don't think it ever, it never reopened.

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
Yeah, and so, but they officially announced, yeah,

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
the nail in the coffin in the fall of 2021

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,120
that it's like, it's done.

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,440
Yeah, and not only that, but this entire venue

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,160
is going away.

125
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,640
If you don't know universal Florida that well,

126
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,120
it has been done in this theater that's kind of on the,

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
well, I based on the entrance, the East end of universal.

128
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,800
I don't know if that's accurate, the actual,

129
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,960
that's actual East, but it's over by,

130
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,960
it's between Diagon Alley and the Men in Black ride.

131
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,280
There's been this big like festival seating type venue

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,520
that was built for something called

133
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,400
the Wild Wild Wild West stunt show.

134
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,160
It was that first, some of the DNA of this,

135
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
this is pretty evident, I'd say.

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,680
Yeah.

137
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,000
In felt very, very evident in Fear Factor Live.

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
And it's been Fear Factor Live for a long time,

139
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,080
mixed with Halloween events.

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,720
They do things at Halloween Horror Nights over there.

141
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,040
But kind of, it's always struck me as odd space,

142
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
as things at Universal get increasingly

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
more and more blockbuster.

144
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,320
I mean, its neighbors are pretty high end, you know?

145
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
It's like this venue's been priced out.

146
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,560
This is expensive real estate.

147
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Yeah.

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,080
Like theme park acreage is highly coveted.

149
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,880
Like this is a waste of space.

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,720
Like for some.

151
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,760
Well, universal acreages, the Disney world

152
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,360
will just let shit rot for 25 years without addressing it.

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,080
But Universal actually takes the time to do stuff.

154
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, a little more of a limited footprint,

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,760
although expanding every year seemingly.

156
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,760
But still, like the central campus, you know, more limited.

157
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,760
And yeah, this is hung around for a while.

158
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,520
Wait a minute, you're saying Fear Factor

159
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,640
is not as beloved as Harry Potter

160
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,280
or Men in Black or The Simpsons?

161
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,560
You're saying that this might be a waste here?

162
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,960
I think it's not as beloved as like

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the Coke freestyle machines by the Men in Black.

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,040
I can agree with that.

165
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,880
Somebody on Twitter said that those were bad

166
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,720
and I was upset by that take.

167
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,440
There's a lot of bad takes on Twitter, but.

168
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,600
Oh, that the Coke, oh, I saw this going around.

169
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
That's the one that broke you?

170
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,360
Yeah, Coke freestyle rocks.

171
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
Every other take.

172
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,240
Every other take I see, I love.

173
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Most takes, even if I don't agree,

174
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm glad they're getting an out there.

175
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,400
Good for you.

176
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,800
Every take's a perfect take

177
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
because I'm excited you're having a take.

178
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,000
But this freestyle thing.

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
But I love a Coke freestyle, yeah.

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,000
So yeah, Jason's correct.

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm sure Coke freestyle's more beloved

182
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
than Fear Factor at this point.

183
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
But maybe I'm wrong.

184
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
Maybe we're making people mad.

185
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,800
And this is, this attraction is technically,

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I saw it was originally part of the San Francisco area

187
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,480
and then it was annexed into World Expo,

188
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,960
which is what they call like Men in Black and such,

189
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,760
that area.

190
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,720
So I guess they just like leapfrogged Amity.

191
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,640
Like, so for a period of time,

192
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,920
San Francisco went around like Amity

193
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,880
or crossed that one foot bridge.

194
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
And like, this was technically

195
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,320
in the San Francisco section of the park.

196
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,160
So.

197
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,520
It was a non-contiguous area of San Francisco.

198
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,560
This is like, Universal San Francisco was like

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,080
a mainland America and Hawaii,

200
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,240
where there's a little extra bit,

201
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,080
really away removed.

202
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Yeah.

203
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760
Yeah.

204
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,320
A shitty little, like, but Hawaii is a paradise.

205
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,680
This is a shitty little.

206
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,600
It's an inverse.

207
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
It's so Hawaii.

208
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,280
Yeah.

209
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,840
It's an inverse.

210
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,640
Yeah, man, we're watching this.

211
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,000
I was just, ugh, yeah, this was rough.

212
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,440
I remember watching it.

213
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
Yeah.

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,120
Yeah.

215
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
I've never seen it.

216
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,360
I didn't know it was there.

217
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
Wow.

218
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,920
I didn't know it was there the last time we were there.

219
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,160
This is exactly the same as you were.

220
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,080
As I recall, you were really unfamiliar

221
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,040
with there being a Barney show.

222
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Didn't know.

223
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,760
As opposed to me, who was familiar that there was this

224
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,240
and had never seen it or pursued seeing it.

225
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,720
Sure, sure.

226
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,480
A world of difference between our opinions.

227
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm sure I looked right at the sign

228
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
and it just didn't register.

229
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,120
Didn't even look like letters to me.

230
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,080
I know the Fear Factor logo, but I was like, oh, okay.

231
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,000
That must just be, they're advertising the show

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
in the middle of the sign of a map for Universal Studios.

233
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,520
Got it, okay.

234
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,600
Which if that's you, an avid Theme Park fan,

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,520
then that really shows you how people can miss stuff.

236
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
Yeah, you would think I would have known.

237
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
And not pay attention.

238
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,120
No, I didn't.

239
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,560
Also, the Fear Factor logo is so industrial

240
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,120
and functional.

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,720
I could see you staring at it and thinking it said,

242
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,000
authorized personnel only.

243
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
That's true.

244
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,400
With a little bit of attitude.

245
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Like it was spray painted on there and you just went,

246
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,680
I better not go over there.

247
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,520
I don't work here.

248
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,360
That's very possible.

249
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Yeah, I was looking through, yeah.

250
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,520
Maybe I've seen it a hundred times.

251
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Maybe I thought it was the No Fear logo,

252
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,440
the popular clothing that we all wore.

253
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
And they just made a deal with Universal.

254
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Just a random billboard in the park, sure.

255
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Just like they were advertising the No Fear gift shop.

256
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,880
It's not dissimilar too to the warnings of,

257
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,760
this show gets a little bawdy or like, I don't know,

258
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,880
maybe the kids should sit this one,

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
leave the kids at five-els if you're gonna watch this show.

260
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,320
Yeah, but not in this one, the kids are complicit in this.

261
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,280
The kids get involved.

262
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,800
Yeah, in this.

263
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,080
I didn't see any versions where kids get involved.

264
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Oh really?

265
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,760
I didn't know.

266
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,520
We might've all watched different videos

267
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,760
because there's no real, this is one of the,

268
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,080
you know how, maybe you guys have this when you're like,

269
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,840
okay, we have picked a topic and let me dive into

270
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,720
what videos exist of the topic.

271
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,720
And when you see, you know, a defunct land or a Martin's vids

272
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,200
or I feel like these are the other ones

273
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm forgetting that I like, but like,

274
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,240
oh, there's like a clean video about this.

275
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,440
Review time, that's the one.

276
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,360
Oh my God, somebody made a nice little video about this

277
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,400
and I don't just have to sift through

278
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,160
home video recordings of it.

279
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,600
And this is one where like, boy, I really could have used,

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,080
even just like a press kit,

281
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,960
give me like some boring guy going,

282
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,640
Fear of Actual Life is gonna give the audience

283
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
the opportunity to get involved in a fair show

284
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,640
and a fair stunt.

285
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,000
Just like that would be, I'll get something out of that.

286
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,720
Give me anything that isn't camcorder footage

287
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,880
from the back of the room.

288
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,320
Yeah, but yeah, I think there was like two,

289
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,840
there's two main ones.

290
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,440
Did you watch 2019 or 2016?

291
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
Did you not either?

292
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,720
I don't recall the year.

293
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh really? I don't recall.

294
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,640
I watched 2016.

295
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,840
I did the punishing one

296
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,040
because that is about 10 minutes longer

297
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,200
because I saw online that if it was a slow season,

298
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,880
there's kind of an abbreviated version of the show

299
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,040
with less contestants.

300
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,640
And I was like, I should watch this whole thing.

301
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
And I regret it.

302
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
I regret the time I spent watching it, honestly.

303
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
Sure.

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,920
Well, you didn't, 2016 is the one.

305
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Did you see children involved?

306
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
Do you know what I'm talking about?

307
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,080
Are they spraying fans or water and stuff?

308
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,160
Well, okay, so I guess I'm getting ahead of myself,

309
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,000
but I have to say it now.

310
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,480
On paper, it said you had to be 18 to do the stunts.

311
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
Right, yes.

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,600
So the people doing anything that's considered a stunt

313
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,000
are over 18, but they get children involved.

314
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,280
They dangle people.

315
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
That's like the first thing they do

316
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
is like dangle people.

317
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
They have to hang on this.

318
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,280
I don't forget what they call the thing.

319
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
That's the first part of it.

320
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
It's weird though, it looks like bike handlebars

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,600
that are attached to a bungee cord sort of thing.

322
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
Yeah, and they're three stories up.

323
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,640
And you're just your full upper body strength

324
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,560
to hang on to the top of the venue as long as you can.

325
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,080
Yeah, and they basically, yeah,

326
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,160
like obviously they have cables on them, they drop,

327
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,960
and the cable catches them or whatever.

328
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,920
And whoever's the first person down, I think, is eliminated.

329
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,960
For the version I saw, they bring a child down

330
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,200
in the front of the stage, and they tell the child

331
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
that after 12 seconds, you're gonna turn on fans

332
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,000
that are going to hit these people in the face

333
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,040
while they're hanging.

334
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,920
Yeah. But it's a child.

335
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,680
It's like a child doing like a Milgram's experiment

336
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,480
of like, we want you to harm some other people.

337
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
Would like stranger grownup hit this button

338
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
and fuck with these adults.

339
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,000
The other room, yeah, someone will get electrocuted.

340
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,080
Yeah, and they bring another child down

341
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,320
to watch like them throw like a scorpion on a woman's face.

342
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,520
She has to be like, she's like right there.

343
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,520
I have a photo, it's really disturbing,

344
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,160
of this child taking an iPhone photo or video.

345
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,640
I don't know, I don't think it's a relation.

346
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,480
I don't think it's like this person's mother, but who knows?

347
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
I don't know if you can see, that's a bad one.

348
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,120
This girl has an iPhone and she's just taking it.

349
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,320
That's the box with the woman's head.

350
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

351
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,600
It's like right there.

352
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,520
And she's getting, she has scorpions being put on her head

353
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,920
in this glass cube.

354
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,240
Yeah, so yeah, imagine a kid you were afraid of

355
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,600
like pinhead, well, what about scorpion head?

356
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,200
And you're right there and he's alive or she's alive.

357
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,840
And they might scream, they might,

358
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,440
at least they don't wanna be scorpion

359
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,480
or they only just found out

360
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,840
they were gonna be scorpion head five seconds ago.

361
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Right, cause there's a wheel, you spin a wheel.

362
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
Again, I'm getting ahead of myself.

363
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,960
The wheel of creatures.

364
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,760
The creature silhouette.

365
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,320
The wheel of creatures.

366
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,920
Maybe you like this more than Jason is what I'm intuiting

368
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,520
or at least got more enjoyment out of.

369
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,640
I definitely got more enjoyment out of going,

370
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,360
what are they gonna make the kids do?

371
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,600
Why are they letting the kids get so close to this?

372
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,440
This is horrible.

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
Like this would have scared the shit out of me.

374
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Well, at some point I think there was like foam ball cannons

375
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,040
similar I saw to like curious, like other attract,

376
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,680
like light American gladiators.

377
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,920
Like we're gonna make this harder for you.

378
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,200
Obstacles, yeah.

379
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,360
Cause that was the thing I had forgotten about Fear Factor

380
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,920
that they totally ripped off both Steve Jobs

381
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,240
and Lieutenant Columbo with the like,

382
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,000
and there's one more thing.

383
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,520
Oh, whoa.

384
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,720
I don't think, I think if that had been like,

385
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,960
if that was a Jeopardy clue I had to back into,

386
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,360
I don't think I would have realized there's kind of

387
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,360
a common thing between Steve Jobs and Columbo.

388
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
Between all three.

389
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
And Fear Factor.

390
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,480
Yeah, and I don't, I mean obviously Columbo was first

391
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,400
and I think Steve Jobs used it in a different way.

392
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,360
So I think it differentiates itself enough.

393
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,200
But like-

394
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,080
It was not solving a mystery, no.

395
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,600
Yeah, but as you're getting to,

396
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,760
cause Fear Factor is a TV,

397
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,040
I remember hating Fear Factor as a TV show when it was on.

398
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,680
Like looking back I'm like, yeah this was a real,

399
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,560
I don't, I like a lot of trash.

400
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,880
I don't often go in on the dumbing of America sort of thing.

401
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,840
But it's like Fear Factor sucks.

402
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,640
Fear Factor was like one of the panic shows done

403
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,240
in response to the hit that was Survivor.

404
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,360
Like every network scrambled to have their own Survivor.

405
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,560
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

406
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,440
So like something, and this one,

407
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,720
like even like cheaper, I suppose.

408
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,120
Where Survivor they gotta go somewhere cool to shoot it.

409
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,040
This is how can we torture people but in a warehouse

410
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,320
in an awful deep downtown LA.

411
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,120
Yeah, and even Rogan, like there was a thing

412
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,480
where he was like, this is gonna get canceled so quickly,

413
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,360
I bet I'll get some stories for standup.

414
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,880
Like I saw that anecdote about him.

415
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,160
I did a little bit of flipping through

416
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,600
because if you don't recall the show being on,

417
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,960
but there was a brief iteration on MTV

418
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,120
hosted by Ludacris that I never heard of until right now.

419
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,880
But mainly this was on NBC and the host was Joe Rogan,

420
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,760
the most popular person on the planet Earth somehow

421
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,760
in like the last year and a half became the,

422
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,560
that King of All Media phrase

423
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,800
that Howard Stern used to throw around.

424
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
I don't think he was even close.

425
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,000
No.

426
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,600
Yeah, Rogan is bigger than, how many podcasts the ride?

427
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,560
1,000.

428
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Yeah, I'm sure probably has to be.

429
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Apparently and like, I don't, I think I saw the clips

430
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,560
of Bernie Sanders on it and that it's the most

431
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,600
I've ever watched besides when he says something insane

432
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,760
and that gets clipped and uploaded on Twitter.

433
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,400
But, and I don't really get recommended them

434
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,360
but I did see on the YouTube homepage,

435
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,800
like most popular ones recently and was like,

436
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,760
Joe Rogan episode 500, Jewel.

437
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,480
It's like the singer Jewel and I was like,

438
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,600
what is going, what?

439
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,160
When you click on it as 1.2 million views,

440
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,080
something with Jewel, yes, like the most relevant person,

441
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,320
Jewel, we're all thinking about Jewel

442
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
and what Jewel's up to or you know, Jim Brewer's the one.

443
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,520
I always write, he's like a, he's a firestorm.

444
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,000
Everyone's talking about Joe Rogan all the time, always.

445
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,560
What did he do this week?

446
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,520
Like the way he had Jim Brewer on,

447
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,960
to tell his story about why he got let go from SNL.

448
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,480
Has that ever been, I'm not sure he's ever told that anywhere.

449
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm not sure that's ever been discussed.

450
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,480
Has anyone ever talked about their experience

451
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,280
working on SNL, let alone Jim Brewer?

452
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,200
I just feel like, yeah, no, everyone keeps that quiet.

453
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,040
It's sort of a code thing.

454
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,720
You're really not allowed to talk about it

455
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,960
outside of the halls.

456
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,360
I'll say this though, that being said,

457
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,520
also he'll have like Robert Downey Jr. on.

458
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,800
Like it's like, it doesn't, it goes wildly back and forth.

459
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
It's not like he always has this niche people on.

460
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,600
It's just like, oh yeah.

461
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,680
It would not shock me if like Michelle Obama was on today

462
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
or something.

463
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,840
Like if you go, Michelle Obama was on Joe Rogan today.

464
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,920
Yeah, or like a, it's like the most famous people

465
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,480
in the world and then some Peter Thiel psycho.

466
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,280
Then Jimmy Dore's on for a full week.

467
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,680
The thought leaders of America, oh, they're all here.

468
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
Yeah.

469
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,480
Is your third thought leaders of America reference

470
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,040
in like three weeks?

471
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,400
I truly feel like I'm losing my mind.

472
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,240
Like everything has gotten to the point where it's like,

473
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,920
oh good, I'm losing my mind again.

474
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Great, cool.

475
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,880
Yeah.

476
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,560
We've got to stay, well, this can flash you back

477
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,400
to Rogan 1.0.

478
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,240
The good old days.

479
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,640
When he only has like two shows.

480
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,880
He yelled at Carlos Mencia.

481
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,200
He supervised people getting tortured.

482
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,840
Extremely pleasant video.

483
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,680
Very pleasant.

484
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,360
Carlos Mencia exposure.

485
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,200
Yes.

486
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,120
He's screaming and then it gets too quiet to hear

487
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,560
and then music is louder than the screaming.

488
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,400
Yeah.

489
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,280
Now I watched it multiple times.

490
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,120
Sure.

491
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,240
I really like Mencia very much.

492
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,080
So I was sort of like, all right, this is something.

493
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,560
But then like, Rogan versus Mencia was one of those,

494
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,360
whoever wins, we lose.

495
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,200
Sure, yeah.

496
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,440
I'm not sure I like either side of this.

497
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,600
But in 2000, he's only like a year out from News Radio,

498
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,160
which let's say is one of the best sitcoms.

499
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah.

500
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,880
He's got great Phil Hartman stories.

501
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,720
I'll tell you that.

502
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,560
I heard him tell some Phil Hartman stories.

503
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,000
Obviously I'm such a Phil Hartman fan.

504
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,840
I want to hear.

505
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
Yeah.

506
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,640
Also, like it's an inescapable algorithm.

507
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
That's the other thing to say about Joe Rogan.

508
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,560
That like right now, you the listener,

509
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,840
because we're on your phones and we're saying,

510
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,400
Joe Rogan, YouTube, a clip on YouTube of Joe Rogan.

511
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,720
Joe Rogan clip, JRE, powerful JRE.

512
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,280
But you're now going to get even five times more

513
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,040
Joe Rogan recommended to you

514
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,960
because of my voice than you would be anyway.

515
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,440
You're really screwing everyone over here on the Patreon.

516
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,360
So if you've been nice enough to support us,

517
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,560
you're now getting screwed over.

518
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,200
You're getting like, I'm triggering ads

519
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,800
for something that we don't advertise or benefit from.

520
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,320
But just all the algorithm's just addicted.

521
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,800
I think by saying the word Joe Rogan,

522
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,920
my name just, or that name just traveled on the wind,

523
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
like to somebody two miles away

524
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,120
and they're getting an ad for it.

525
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,960
It's true.

526
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Hopefully it will just pull up like my,

527
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,920
because it's podcast the riot

528
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,240
and the most viral I've ever been on Twitter

529
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,520
is when I clipped a Joe Rogan talking about avatar.

530
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,240
Oh yeah, what was this again?

531
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,640
And basically, and I added it.

532
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,280
He had been talking a little bit about avatar

533
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
and then he seemed like he was on a totally different topic

534
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,680
talking about a man.

535
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,560
He went on and felt like a minute and a half

536
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,360
of talking about this man who felt like

537
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,680
you have to leave technology behind.

538
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
So he went up, he took his family, he went into the woods

539
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,360
and he decided to live off the grid

540
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,640
and they lived off of the land.

541
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,560
They grew things, they were one with nature

542
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,400
and he's going on and on for 90 seconds

543
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,880
and he goes, and that's what the Navi did as well.

544
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,520
All of a sudden he takes a hard left turn

545
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,960
back into Avatar Town and it's so great.

546
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,840
Is he just talking at a comedian friend?

547
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,680
I think so.

548
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,000
I really remember how it started.

549
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,680
They had started talking a little bit about avatar.

550
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,160
I remember some people were like,

551
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,680
you selectively clipped this to make it seem

552
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,400
like he wasn't talking about avatar before I go,

553
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,040
yeah, but it really felt like he was done

554
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,240
talking about avatar.

555
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
There's only two minutes on Twitter.

556
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,160
You selectively edited this raw footage

557
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,720
to make it more consumable and funny

558
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,360
and give it a punchline.

559
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
How dare you?

560
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,240
Yes, I think the algorithm suggested to me

561
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,000
like Joe Rogan talks about avatar, but maybe I'm wrong.

562
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
I may be misremembering that.

563
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,560
Seems like everybody's gonna get that clip now.

564
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,880
He loves avatar.

565
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
Wow.

566
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,960
Fucking loves avatar.

567
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,680
And isn't that one of those clues that tells you

568
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,160
that Avatar 2, whenever it comes out,

569
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,880
it's gonna be the biggest movie ever.

570
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,800
Will it be weeks away from Haunted Mansion 5,

571
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,480
our episode, I don't know.

572
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
We will determine this next year.

573
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,080
Yeah.

574
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,800
But Joe Rogan will be there and he will be

575
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
on all sorts of medication.

576
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,560
Yes, HGH, testosterone pills.

577
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,480
Still doing ivermectin just for fun.

578
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,520
He's doing the cocktail, the COVID cocktail.

579
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,360
Perk up.

580
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,800
Preventative ivermectin.

581
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,560
Yeah, now he took, you know what I really don't like?

582
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm really annoyed when he is able to own people

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,680
because CNN reported that he took the horse,

584
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,640
because there's two ivermectins.

585
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,920
There's the horse ivermectin

586
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,280
and there's the one they prescribed to humans

587
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,320
and his doctor prescribed him the real one.

588
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,160
And then he had like Sanjay Goop done

589
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,840
and he just kept playing the clip from CNN

590
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
where they said he took the horse one.

591
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Yeah.

592
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,600
Which is funny, but I get why he's like,

593
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,480
this is like irresponsible.

594
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,600
Yeah. God damn it.

595
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,760
I know, I know.

596
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,000
I watched the video thinking like,

597
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,200
I'll find a reason to still be mad at Joe

598
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,440
and I'm like, ah, damn it.

599
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,280
I think he's moving right now.

600
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,120
So annoying.

601
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,600
I'm so annoyed when he's like dunking on CNN,

602
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,000
although this happens all the time when I'm like,

603
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,960
so like I'm annoyed at Bill Nye

604
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
for not dunking on Tucker Carlson better.

605
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,280
Come on.

606
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,040
Believable, believable that he'd be taking the horse one.

607
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,640
That says something.

608
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,480
Yes and no.

609
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,280
And also what quack doctor is prescribing the non-horse one.

610
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
Well, I think a lot of doctors are prescribing it.

611
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
Yeah, there's a lot of quacks in America.

612
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,800
It's, yeah, sure.

613
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,360
I mean, I think it's just, I don't know.

614
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,720
It's just annoying to me.

615
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,760
It's annoying.

616
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,600
I got it.

617
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, but then the other, yeah, that was annoying.

618
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,800
It's like just Mencia all over again.

619
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,240
Both sides are annoying.

620
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,320
I don't want to support Mencia,

621
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,520
but also this loud video about how he stole

622
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,440
everything is annoying.

623
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,720
Rogan's annoying at Gupta,

624
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
but then you watch the clip and like,

625
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,160
Mr. Rogan, who took horse medicine?

626
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes, I know.

627
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,760
Let me say that again and underline it with my voice.

628
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,720
Horse medicine.

629
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,080
And like, it's not true.

630
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,200
And even if it was true,

631
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
you're so annoying in the way you're.

632
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,920
I know, I know.

633
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,880
Everything's annoying.

634
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,720
All things are.

635
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,840
Everything's annoying all at once.

636
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,080
I had a little Joe Rogan experience of my own.

637
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,920
Really?

638
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,760
Also, Reese,

639
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,960
I think you guys were aware of this one and a half,

640
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,120
a couple of weeks ago where I was out with a couple friends

641
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,560
and I went to the bathroom and I checked Twitter really quick

642
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,120
and a friend and Doughboy's logo designer,

643
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,080
Chris VanArtsdelen had tweeted at me,

644
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,560
hey, you're on Rogan.

645
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,560
And it was the video version of the show.

646
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,000
There was the video feed of it.

647
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
And there was a still that I did recognize of me

648
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,640
from a Funny or Die video from 10 years ago.

649
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
And I wanted to go back out and see my friends

650
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,560
and not explore the full context of what was going on.

651
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,400
But I had so many mentions and anytime at this point,

652
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,280
I checked Twitter and I have more than like two

653
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,680
on the little bell and like, well, canceled.

654
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,200
So long everyone.

655
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,400
So I guess I'll go home, pack up the family,

656
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,160
get out of town.

657
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,880
And I was not canceled, but I was definitely like,

658
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,280
then I asked, I think I just responded like, oh God, why?

659
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,120
And somebody filled in the context,

660
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,680
which I mean, the context doesn't,

661
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,600
he was just playing a clip.

662
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,320
He wanted to make fun of this real video

663
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,080
I was in a parody, it was making fun of it.

664
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,200
And he played the parody and laughed at it,

665
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,280
cut it off not long after I appeared.

666
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,360
And then said this thing about like,

667
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,680
like God, they couldn't do,

668
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,160
they'd never let you do this today.

669
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,080
Like PC world, like this has never happened these days.

670
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,760
I'm like, no, stop, don't any, I didn't even,

671
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,680
I didn't write it.

672
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,960
I'm just in it for a second.

673
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,720
I don't even want to want something with my face

674
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,160
anywhere near that conversation.

675
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,960
Oh man, now I have to be,

676
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,560
now I'm fighting the PC police because of this thing.

677
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,400
Now you're a hero.

678
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,320
You're out, you're flying out to Chappelle's

679
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
hometown comedy gigs.

680
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,400
I don't even want to.

681
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm there in all the photos with Louie and Jolena White.

682
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,400
I don't even look happy.

683
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,200
They made me cum.

684
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
You're part of it.

685
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,600
You're part of this now, Scott,

686
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,200
whether you like it or not.

687
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,040
You're on, I, you're on, I-

688
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,720
There is a freedom fighter.

689
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,000
You're on Regeneron and HGH and stuff too.

690
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,720
Super spread and laughs.

691
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,240
You're on the cocktail as well now.

692
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,080
That's just it.

693
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,920
That's just the case.

694
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,080
They made me take it at the freedom ranch.

695
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,200
The reality though is our podcast

696
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,840
is skyrocketing in popularity.

697
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,560
If you could just get in this clique.

698
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,280
Well, it's a point of view.

699
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,480
Look, we're all sort of of the same,

700
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,960
you know, worldview a little bit.

701
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
Like we're all, we're all just like 2% different

702
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,040
in our opinions about politics and new Star Wars.

703
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,200
And that's about it.

704
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,480
What we need is somebody who's like 70% different.

705
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,160
Let's represent all other point of view.

706
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,280
And that's what we, that's what we don't have.

707
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,640
And that's what new Scott, when they make me have the,

708
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,920
when they, they do a fear factor test on me

709
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,760
and force me to have a lot of hyperventilator.

710
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,520
We've injected this spider with Regeneron.

711
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,680
We're going to unleash it in your mouth.

712
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,960
Spider will sting you.

713
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,200
You just shot it up.

714
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,000
So it's gonna get bigger in there.

715
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,440
It's gonna become radio.

716
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,320
So I'm going to become a real life Spider-Man.

717
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
Yes.

718
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,480
As, as I consume the Regeneron spiders.

719
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,880
Yes, yes, exactly.

720
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
And if you can handle that, you can hang.

721
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,760
No man, don't make me Bob Saget or whatever comedians

722
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,000
hang out with all these guys.

723
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,840
Saget is cool.

724
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,240
Scott, guess who's talking about Haunted Mansion

725
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
for Haunted Mansion five.

726
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,560
Why look, his bestselling author and idiot

727
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,800
Senate candidate, JD Vance.

728
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
He's a truth teller.

729
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,000
And one of the dumbest people in America.

730
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
He thinks the 900.

731
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,080
JD's gonna, JD's gonna bring all perspective

732
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,640
to the Hatbox ghosts that we never would have had.

733
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,680
Okay, JD Vance has run out of the room.

734
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,160
He thought the ghosts were real.

735
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,560
He's very dumb man.

736
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,000
Well, very dumb man.

737
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,600
Hey, check out the movie starring Glenn Close

738
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,680
and Amy Adams on Netflix.

739
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,600
You lost me here.

740
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,440
What is that?

741
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,400
Oh, this was an adaptation of Hillbilly Elegy,

742
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,680
directed by Ron Howard on Netflix.

743
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,880
And now I'm sure everyone is distancing themselves

744
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
as he goes crazier and crazier on Twitter.

745
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,840
Right, right.

746
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,600
Well, yeah, look, it's, what I'm saying is I lived a fear.

747
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,400
I had a fear factor moment, which is worried,

748
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,760
seeing in a blur, seeing my name next to Rogan on Twitter

749
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,240
and worried I'd been canceled.

750
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,080
This guy.

751
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
That's a modern fear.

752
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,520
There's no bug I could eat.

753
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,800
There's no like, there's no scorpion I'm more afraid of.

754
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,640
Who would be canceled?

755
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,480
It would be funny.

756
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,960
He's like, he's like sitting there with,

757
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,360
he's sitting there with like the most,

758
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,000
like Tom Cruise or something, but you'll be canceled.

759
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,800
It's like my guy, Scott Gardner here.

760
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,080
I love all this stuff.

761
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,280
They never let Scott Gardner specifically,

762
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,600
and I'm not worried about the dozens of other people

763
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,440
in this whole video.

764
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,040
Scott Gardner would never be able to do this today.

765
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,440
Have you heard his podcast?

766
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,280
Dude, he fucking, oh, he fucking goes there, dude.

767
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,120
Dude, for real, seriously.

768
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,000
Wait, I had a little, here, I'd been thinking about this

769
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,760
of like what, because knowing that Rogan

770
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
was gonna be talked about for a while on this,

771
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,840
I was like, what am I really,

772
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,880
am I bothered by anything specifically that it's like,

773
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,840
and I'm sure there's, you could point me to the examples

774
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
of things that are upsetting and bad on his show,

775
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,000
but I feel like it's like, it's the tone more than anything.

776
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,120
And I wanted to do a little experiment,

777
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,120
which is if Joe Rogan was the fourth co-host of this show,

778
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,280
I can't say this is, I could do an impression,

779
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,440
but I think I can get the vibe.

780
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,840
And this is what I think is weird to me about

781
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,200
that this is the most popular thing on earth.

782
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,200
So Mike, will you just give me a ride, any ride?

783
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,160
Sure, Secret Life of Pets.

784
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,080
Dude, have you fucking done Secret Life of Pets?

785
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,880
Dude, that shit's fucking insane.

786
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,920
They actually turn you into, they have like a machine

787
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,600
that turns you into a pet and shit.

788
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,440
And then you're riding around

789
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,720
and like you're gonna get fucking adopted,

790
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,600
it's fucking crazy, dude.

791
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,200
You gotta fucking do that shit.

792
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,080
Jason, what's a ride you've done lately?

793
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,400
Oh, gosh, well of course I rode my beloved

794
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,880
Mark Twain riverboat a few weeks ago.

795
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,600
Oh, dude, Mark Twain, fucking insane,

796
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,720
it's like a fucking trip into the past, dude.

797
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
Dude, it's like you literally go back

798
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
into the 1800s or whatever.

799
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,560
That shit's insane, like,

800
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,360
and they'd never let you do that shit today.

801
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,320
Like Mark Twain, they're kids,

802
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,960
like, they're not letting kids read Mark Twain.

803
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,880
So they're not gonna be letting people

804
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,800
go on that riverboat soon.

805
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,200
That's fucking crazy, dude.

806
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,120
I noticed as you were speaking,

807
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,240
every can of beer you ever drunk is on a shelf above you,

808
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,880
like a freshman dorm room, has appeared,

809
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,440
just materialized.

810
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,000
Is it, I can't, well, I'm having trouble seeing it

811
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,880
through the thick fog of smoke that is in this room

812
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,160
from joints and cigars combined.

813
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh, yeah, Elon.

814
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,880
Let me see if, yeah, there's a couple,

815
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,080
yeah, there's some beer cans up here.

816
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,120
Elon's took such a big hit.

817
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,880
His smoke is still lingering all these years later.

818
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,520
Dude, it's still him from fucking seven months ago, dude.

819
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,360
It's just fucking insane.

820
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,080
He left such a fucking cloud of smoke.

821
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,680
You ever seen Phantasmic, dude?

822
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,280
That shit's, like, that's pyro,

823
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,400
that pyro's off the fucking hood, bro.

824
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,320
Jamie, Jamie, pull up a clip of Phantasmic.

825
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Dude, you gotta see, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, pull it up.

826
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,000
No, that's not, no, no, you put in Phantastic,

827
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,480
it's Phantasmic.

828
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,360
You're gonna, dude, you're gonna freak out.

829
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,120
Dude, Andy Dick, you're gonna go nuts

830
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,200
when you see Phantasmic, Mickey fights a dra,

831
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,120
like a literal dragon, it's like he's on fucking Iowaska,

832
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,960
dude.

833
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,680
And scene.

834
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,200
Walter Cronkite, Joe Rogan, the two most trusted

835
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,800
men of opinion in America.

836
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,680
Andy Dick also escorted out of,

837
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,520
escorted out of the Rogan studio.

838
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,800
Miraculous, first, first, first one to do that.

839
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,280
First one to do that.

840
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,120
He gets himself kicked out of a place.

841
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,000
If he enters a building, he's, he's showing the exit.

842
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,360
He will be forced out, yes.

843
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,200
Trouble man, shouldn't joke.

844
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,800
I don't know, maybe we might already have,

845
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,200
if maybe if we clip that segment,

846
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,400
that we might already have more listeners already

847
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,600
because I finally got rid of my hoity-toity tone

848
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,520
I usually have and I finally spoke to the real guys.

849
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,240
I've said it many times that if we just said,

850
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,200
if we just had a podcast that sounded like that,

851
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,280
we would be 10 times more popular.

852
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,120
That's what we're like.

853
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,920
Female listenership disappears entirely,

854
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,640
male listenership goes, yes, 600%.

855
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
It's like, yeah, these guys are cool.

856
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,640
This is comfortable to my masculinity.

857
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,760
This is so comfortable.

858
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,640
Like that's really, I honestly, I think that's the big deal.

859
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,560
It's like, he is so comfortable to traditional masculinity

860
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,640
that people are like, cool, I can go down a weird,

861
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,080
like longevity scientist rabbit hole with him.

862
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,560
Like, like I'll go along on this journey

863
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,080
because of how security makes me feel.

864
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,200
Is that what traditional masculinity is?

865
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,080
Well, I think he, oh my God.

866
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,040
You're fucking Jack, dude.

867
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,240
Yeah, it's like having like the biggest shoulders,

868
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,680
the bigger the traps, the bigger shoulders.

869
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,520
You know.

870
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,360
DMT.

871
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,920
DMT, psychedelics, yeah, all that stuff.

872
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,720
Face puff.

873
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,800
Nobody on TV, none of the late night hosts

874
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,160
are traditionally masculine like that.

875
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,000
Do you know what I'm saying?

876
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,840
Right, yeah.

877
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,040
These are like theater boys, you know.

878
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,360
Yeah, Colbert is jumping around doing his space work.

879
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,480
Exactly.

880
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
This is-

881
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,240
Appreciating theater.

882
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,080
There's never been-

883
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,400
Not Rogan, Rogan has never seen, will never see a play.

884
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's never been that guy before

885
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,520
on T, like a late night host, really.

886
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,920
I mean, who's, I don't know,

887
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,960
can you even get a guy who's close?

888
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,080
What if you asked him like,

889
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,720
hey Joe, what's your favorite poem?

890
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,600
What was that word?

891
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,240
Did you just like sneeze or something?

892
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,080
What was it, what the fuck was that?

893
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,200
It was like a short, like a little short,

894
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,000
like a little short, a really short, short story.

895
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,840
See, we're getting into dangerous territory here

896
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,040
because then you're gonna say book

897
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,240
and then you're gonna ask me

898
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,080
and then I'm gonna look like a fucking idiot.

899
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,480
No, no, no, Michael, no,

900
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,760
I won't put you on the spot like that.

901
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,840
Yeah, no, we do the same, the exact same bit

902
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,680
with no dialect change.

903
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,400
If you asked me, Scott, what my favorite poem is.

904
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,600
That's fine, that's fine.

905
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,480
Does Grim Grin and Ghost count as a poem?

906
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,200
That's what the ghost toast says count as a poem.

907
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,680
But I think even just connecting poetry to verse, to song,

908
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,480
I think you're already a step a mile ahead of him.

909
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,400
You know what though, if I could go back,

910
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,960
one of the things I was gonna say

911
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,720
when we started talking about Rogan is that I did,

912
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,080
I watched a video where I did laugh at

913
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,680
the way that he framed a fear factor story,

914
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,440
which is he was talking about his reticence to go back

915
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,560
and to do it and now it's kind of purely for the money

916
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,160
and then he regretted it right away

917
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,000
and now it's tough to get through something,

918
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,040
it's just for the money.

919
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,320
And then he said, and then we got canceled

920
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,200
from making people drink donkey jizz.

921
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,040
Now is that?

922
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,080
And I was like, wow, hearing that,

923
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,640
all right, maybe I've heard this before,

924
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,160
but I wasn't sure and it sounded familiar.

925
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,520
And then, yeah, so the second iteration of it

926
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,520
went off the air because the word leaked on TMZ

927
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,440
that they did a stunt where people had,

928
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,440
you threw horseshoes towards buckets

929
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,040
and then whatever your horseshoe landed near,

930
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,640
you had to drink and one was donkey urine

931
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,520
and one was donkey jizz.

932
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,400
Yeah, I found an article on Screen Rant,

933
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,600
I don't know, I mean, I guess it's more than movies,

934
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,280
but it's the top 10 grossest things

935
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,040
they ever did on Fear Factor.

936
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,400
This being number one and the headline for their number one

937
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,640
is The Time They Went Too Far,

938
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
which I really like the way they phrased that

939
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,080
and apparently, yeah, it did not air.

940
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,480
Yeah, and the reason it exists seemingly to watch

941
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,720
is that it aired on Danish television.

942
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,560
No!

943
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,440
So it got through them, it leaked into Europe,

944
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,080
so there is footage of it, but it's, yeah,

945
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,080
which brings us to the sort of hellish nature of the show

946
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,520
and not just that, but also,

947
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,200
this is one of my qualms with it in general was

948
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,280
some of these things are a little too specific

949
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,080
to call it a fear.

950
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,920
Yeah.

951
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,760
I can't say I would have even,

952
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,200
it never would have occurred to me

953
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,280
that there would have been a moment

954
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,120
where I had to drink multiple gallons of donkey semen.

955
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,480
So I know I'm not afraid of that

956
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
because I sort of doubt it's gonna happen.

957
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,440
But it is, I think you would have immediate fear.

958
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,000
If it, you're right, if it, here it is.

959
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,840
Sudden fear.

960
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,800
Do it, yeah.

961
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Yeah, it's not a long-standing fear.

962
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,080
I mean, most of the stuff on this top 10 list

963
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,880
is not a long-standing fear of mine,

964
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
or I guess some, yeah, most of it's not.

965
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,800
Mm-hmm.

966
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,160
What's of interest on the list?

967
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,480
Well, number 10 is bobbing in cow blood.

968
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,840
There's like a big bathtub.

969
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,680
This looks like a fake, this looks fake

970
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,600
like in a horror movie.

971
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,320
There's a big bathtub of cow's blood

972
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,680
and they'd have to dunk themselves, their head into it

973
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,320
to retrieve rings from the bottom.

974
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,800
There were 13 rings in all,

975
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,960
so they had to submerge into the blood over and over.

976
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,800
That's pretty bad.

977
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,680
I don't wanna be in a lot of blood.

978
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,520
Yeah.

979
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,360
Really, yeah.

980
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,120
That's up there for me.

981
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,320
Let's see here.

982
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,600
Eight, they had to milk a goat with their own mouths.

983
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,160
I don't, yeah, these are like bizarre,

984
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,720
like being the story, like the person,

985
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,440
the contest or the game generator for this show

986
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,000
must have been very odd.

987
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
So much of it is like,

988
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,320
should we call it gross factor or something?

989
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,160
Yeah.

990
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,000
Because like here I get heights,

991
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
those are the traditional ones, and spiders, sure.

992
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,160
I don't have a, I don't technically have like

993
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,800
a fear of scorpions, but I would have one,

994
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,640
a fear of them if they were on my face.

995
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,120
Wasps, there's one in the garage right now

996
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
where maybe face, let's just,

997
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,440
I guess we'll just eat it is the way out of this.

998
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,280
Yeah.

999
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,240
So if the wasp gets close to you, just eat it.

1000
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,320
Number six, they made contestants eat horse rectum.

1001
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,080
A little of this comes in in the Universal.

1002
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,760
There's some gross out eating.

1003
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,600
Right, yes, for sure.

1004
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,760
In like one of the mini games in the Universal show.

1005
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,440
Yes, it's not a long standing fear of mine,

1006
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,000
but I would be very afraid of it.

1007
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,360
Team challenge, this is just the preamble.

1008
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,320
Basically, in this season seven installment,

1009
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,480
one team member had to sit in a bathtub full of leeches.

1010
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,920
Some were in tears as the creatures

1011
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,520
crawled all over their skin.

1012
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,000
Their partners had it worse because their goal

1013
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,360
was to suck the leeches off of them.

1014
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,200
Jesus Christ.

1015
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,560
Once they sucked the leeches out, wait, just wait,

1016
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,320
they had to eat them.

1017
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,480
Wait, just wait.

1018
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,120
The gross moment came when one of the leeches

1019
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,520
latched onto someone's throat.

1020
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,880
It caused him to cough up the leech

1021
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,600
along with a fair amount of blood.

1022
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,480
So I am afraid of that now.

1023
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,960
I am, yeah.

1024
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,000
I, oh.

1025
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,720
Now that's how they would have cured COVID in the year 800.

1026
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,560
Yeah, I think we're all gonna try.

1027
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,400
They might be right.

1028
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,240
And into as, yeah, they might.

1029
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,360
We're all gonna try a couple leeches.

1030
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,200
Why not?

1031
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,480
I got a leech guy from Fear Factor.

1032
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,640
I got a leech guy.

1033
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,160
You just gotta balance your humors, bro.

1034
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,920
You've got too much black bile and not enough yellow bile.

1035
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,360
Vitamin D and leeches, bro.

1036
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,080
That's what really is kind of the cure.

1037
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,640
That's fucking better than getting the shot.

1038
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
That's like, I'm gonna be, and plus I'm strong.

1039
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,920
So I got leeches, I'm strong.

1040
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,960
I'm not gonna get it.

1041
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

1042
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,520
That's the other, the show was confusing.

1043
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,840
First off, I didn't realize it was based on a Dutch show

1044
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,840
called Now or Neverland, which is weird in its own naming.

1045
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,160
But like, the show and the Universal show is weird

1046
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,680
in the way to where it splits the difference.

1047
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
It's like gross out stuff like this.

1048
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,800
And it's like jump from one shipping container

1049
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,720
to another 10 stories up.

1050
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,960
It's like, so wait, it's half stunts.

1051
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,880
And then it's like, I feel like this came up recently,

1052
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,280
like hands on a hard body.

1053
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,320
Some endurance test.

1054
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,160
Endurance, like gross out endurance.

1055
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,480
Yeah, this is the only theme park attraction

1056
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,520
I can think of that involves both live animal

1057
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,000
and dead animal carcasses involved.

1058
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like, and scorpions, the scorpions and the mini game.

1059
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,800
Yeah, so they put, so probably a poor thing

1060
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,400
they did in the show and the thing they did on the episodes,

1061
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,200
they would put you in like a box,

1062
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,200
and your head in a box and then dump shit in there.

1063
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah.

1064
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,840
Bees, rats, it's all, yeah.

1065
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,360
Over and over again, I go, was this show was popular?

1066
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,000
This show was successful.

1067
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,200
Yeah, yeah.

1068
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,040
It is gross.

1069
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,680
I mean, I get, I kinda get it just cause it's one,

1070
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
it's a similar thing to like horror movies

1071
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,200
where it's like, there's something that your brain,

1072
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,880
you wanna look at something truly grotesque.

1073
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,920
There's something, I mean, not everybody,

1074
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
but a lot of people, there's something inside our brains

1075
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,400
that's just like, oh God, but you do wanna look at rats

1076
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,120
climbing all over a person.

1077
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
But why did this happen then?

1078
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,840
Why did all, why did TV become so thoroughly this?

1079
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,680
What year, is it 2005?

1080
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,080
Was it just that the sitcoms got bad?

1081
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,520
No, it was just cheap.

1082
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,320
It was 2000. Cheap in the reality show rise

1083
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,960
of the 2000s. Yeah, Survivor

1084
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,000
was such a massive hit, like all these things kept hitting

1085
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,600
that no one first saw this Survivor

1086
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,400
who wants to be a millionaire.

1087
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,040
So then you get like Fear Factor,

1088
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,760
you get the American version of the weakest link,

1089
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,160
which shows stuff more popular in Britain.

1090
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,760
Yeah. In a much meaner time,

1091
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,600
I mean the 90s and the 2000s, a much meaner time.

1092
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,920
Meaner. Punishing.

1093
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,040
Like now you look at American Idol or something,

1094
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,120
I could be wrong, like the judges aren't mean anymore.

1095
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,680
Everybody's like so nice.

1096
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,880
You used to be like Simon would be the mean,

1097
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,160
there'd be always be like Piers Morgan was the mean judge.

1098
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,000
But now like everyone's nice.

1099
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,360
Like there's a different, I feel like there's a different

1100
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,040
vibe going on in like television and reality.

1101
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,480
Because the meanest judge, a literal mean reality judge

1102
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,120
got elected president.

1103
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,080
Yes, that's true. So we had to go,

1104
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,520
we went so far the other way.

1105
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,960
Now we like, we all have to live under a mean judge.

1106
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,960
So meaner than Frollo himself.

1107
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,960
And, you know, so everything had to get like,

1108
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,760
everything's mega positive, which is not the worst outcome

1109
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,320
because yeah, he's the worst thing that came out of that.

1110
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,160
That era. Yeah.

1111
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,600
So now I assume Simon Cowell is like,

1112
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,200
I thought everyone was great.

1113
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,640
Everyone was so perfect. I loved it.

1114
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,080
He's like, I don't know if that's the case,

1115
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,440
but I feel like it is. It's gone.

1116
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,080
So yeah, it was a darker time.

1117
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,560
It is a darker time.

1118
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,640
And I think we're missing a big thing.

1119
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,960
Reality TV compared to scripted TV, dirt cheap.

1120
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,160
A lot of unions not involved.

1121
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,040
I worked in reality TV for like a year

1122
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,640
when I first moved out here,

1123
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,800
coincided with the writer's strike of 2007, 2008.

1124
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,720
They were just grinding out shit.

1125
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,280
Like everything was dirt cheap,

1126
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,240
corners cut, people working, a 12 hour days at best.

1127
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,600
If not, I worked a 21 hour day,

1128
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,240
insane, just violating every safety thing under the sun.

1129
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,160
You did that?

1130
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,000
Yes.

1131
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,400
This is a different time for Jason too.

1132
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,040
Yeah, for American gladiators.

1133
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,680
But then people are working insane days to grind out,

1134
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
are you smarter than a fifth grader?

1135
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,520
Yeah.

1136
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,720
Like the bleakest shit.

1137
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,280
Some of the dumbest.

1138
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,840
Yeah, again, I've talked about this before

1139
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,920
and I felt a little bad about it afterwards.

1140
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,640
And then recent events have made me go like,

1141
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,760
oh no, there was really dangerous and stupid people

1142
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,160
in charge of stuff and they just didn't give a shit.

1143
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,640
And yeah, awful, awful world.

1144
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,280
I'm assuming a little better now reality TV.

1145
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,600
Better to watch, I understand the Vanderpumps

1146
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
and the Below Decks,

1147
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,400
because it's just like, oh, you're watching asocial freaks.

1148
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,800
You're watching these maniacs.

1149
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,160
Like, yes, this is entertaining.

1150
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,560
Right, right.

1151
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,400
So you're American gladiators, you worked 20 hours,

1152
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,640
what were you trying to finish up shooting

1153
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,000
on American gladiators for 21 hours?

1154
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,080
It was just, they didn't like, they're like,

1155
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,160
oh, we'll bring in hundreds of people

1156
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,280
in a soundstage filled with bleachers

1157
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,880
and they'll just want to hang out all this time.

1158
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,760
They'll be so entertained watching the same event

1159
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,600
a dozen times so we can be.

1160
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,720
So it was just a block TV taping.

1161
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,680
It was just a block TV taping.

1162
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,680
Everything was disorganized.

1163
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,160
The SOTY picture safety department shut down stuff

1164
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,120
because they were like, oh, we'll just hold people

1165
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,760
in the parking garage.

1166
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,040
And they're like, no, this is an active parking garage.

1167
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,360
You're done, you're done for the day.

1168
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,600
Like the operations department kept shutting shit down.

1169
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,320
Yeah, so I'm trying to remember,

1170
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,360
what was the, I hate to steer this in the light.

1171
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,720
What were the names of the gladiators again?

1172
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,280
I mean, they were all nice.

1173
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,120
They were all nice.

1174
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,800
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not trying to blame the gladiators.

1175
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,680
Wolf was like the biggest sweetheart.

1176
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,680
I feel like I cannot remember any of the other names.

1177
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,640
Cruncho.

1178
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,480
Of the Cruncho, Gina Carano.

1179
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:02,920
Squibby.

1180
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,760
Squibby.

1181
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,200
Got it.

1182
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
All sweethearts got all fun.

1183
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,720
Except, yeah, I don't think I ever met her, met her,

1184
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,760
but she was one of the gladiators.

1185
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,680
This is before the Soderbergh movie,

1186
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,200
before the Mandalorian and before the turn.

1187
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
But she was one of them.

1188
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,840
I think this must have come up.

1189
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,680
I think it did, yeah.

1190
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,840
I think it did come up, I said the same thing.

1191
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,640
Oh, I was surprised by that and I forgot about it in time.

1192
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,920
This thing, the live show, which is a,

1193
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,120
it is this weird, it's a little gladiator-ish

1194
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,640
because how do you, you can't just do gross out stuff

1195
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,920
all the time, and it's gotta be something

1196
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,440
they can do over and over again.

1197
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,680
It's a little bit like a scary adult double dare,

1198
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,480
in a way, it's sort of like obstacle courses.

1199
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,040
And relay races, but with edge.

1200
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,000
Bungie harnesses are a big part of it, in a way,

1201
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,360
I feel like we're kind of secondary nature on the TV show.

1202
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,080
Like, there is safety, but here they're like,

1203
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,440
well, if you fall, you're gonna get caught immediately

1204
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,080
by a very secure bungie.

1205
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,040
Yeah, I'd say that, and I guess I saw reviews of it,

1206
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,840
of people who saw it who were kind of like,

1207
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,440
yeah, it was like, it was fun format-wise

1208
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,080
and something different, and that they're,

1209
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,240
the way they're filming it, and the camera

1210
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,760
that's getting you up close to the gross stuff,

1211
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,200
but that ultimately, how many times do you wanna go back

1212
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,080
and see five random guys hang from a pole?

1213
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,680
It's so visually, like, it's not that interesting visually.

1214
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,440
Yes, it's a pretty not dynamic start.

1215
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,120
And then any of these ending competitions

1216
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,600
seemed sort of not particularly thrilling.

1217
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,960
I watched a video of the Hollywood version,

1218
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,640
which was indoors, the other one's a little more open air,

1219
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,640
amphitheater, this was in the castle theater,

1220
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,680
which is still there, which is sort of a cursed venue,

1221
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,080
I feel, this was between, what was the, it was-

1222
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,960
Replace the Spider-Man musical.

1223
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,040
Replace the Spider-Man musical.

1224
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,560
Yes, before Julie Tamar did it.

1225
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,560
And preceded Creature from the Black Lagoon, the musical,

1226
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,600
which this has maybe come up before,

1227
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,040
this happened when I worked there,

1228
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,200
and all the employees were invited to go see

1229
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,600
Creature from the Black Lagoon, the musical,

1230
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,360
it was tough for even the universal lackeys

1231
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,120
to put a good face on it.

1232
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,280
Like there was some, like everybody who saw

1233
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,560
the corporatey people were like,

1234
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,360
well, that was different, wasn't it?

1235
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,920
They're taking a swing, aren't they?

1236
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,440
Pretty, we'll have to visit that.

1237
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,160
At some unpleasant point.

1238
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,160
Anyway, all that to say, it was in this castle theater venue,

1239
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,040
and they, these shows, the Florida one, as we said,

1240
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,240
kind of tried to reuse infrastructure of what replaced it,

1241
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,200
and since all of the things in this venue prior,

1242
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,040
like Spider-Man Rocks, or the Beetlejuice show,

1243
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,480
or the Conan the Barbarian stunt show,

1244
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,960
like it was a venue made for pyrotechnics,

1245
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,800
all right, so it's like strung up,

1246
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,280
it's rigged up for pyro up along the wall,

1247
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,200
so we gotta get pyro involved.

1248
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Why exactly?

1249
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,200
I don't know, okay, so the contestants have to make

1250
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,200
electricity via weird bike machines, like proto-pelotons,

1251
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,200
so they have to pedal really, really fast,

1252
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,280
and then the one who doesn't make enough power

1253
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,960
gets yanked back on a bungee cord, we're using that again.

1254
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,960
And then the other one wins, they fill up a fake meter

1255
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,960
of power, and then it causes pyro to go off

1256
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,080
all over the room.

1257
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,440
Why, and was that a fear?

1258
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,080
Is it the fear of getting electrocuted,

1259
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,800
of having to work for the power company?

1260
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,280
Yeah, like sparked by a JoyBuzzer level,

1261
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,280
shocked by a JoyBuzzer, and then the pyro also is like

1262
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,480
weak welding sparks.

1263
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,480
It's not like Indiana Jones stunt show level pyro.

1264
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,960
It's what just is like incidentally going off

1265
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,120
in the background of a bad boy music video,

1266
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,000
like just on the ground, you aren't even thinking about that,

1267
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,280
you're looking at the dancers and the wet down floor

1268
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,840
and the costumes, so like of course there's sparks,

1269
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,240
I'm not even looking at the sparks.

1270
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,000
I mean, it feels like the budget wasn't so high

1271
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,400
and they were just like, we gotta make something visually

1272
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,680
interesting out of this, and we're just gonna do our,

1273
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,200
because yeah, what is that?

1274
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,120
It doesn't really make sense, but it's also,

1275
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,880
the show premise of it being a fear is sort of flawed too,

1276
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,840
already, so it's like, I don't know.

1277
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,200
It's a little out of the place.

1278
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,000
Not to, I don't know if it's a problem to cut to the end

1279
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
here, but on this topic of using what was there before,

1280
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,520
the video I saw and probably the video you guys saw

1281
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,080
had the grand finale of the Florida version

1282
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,960
where there's something going on with,

1283
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,200
okay, the one I saw involved your like,

1284
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,200
there's two cars that are getting slowly elevated.

1285
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,320
Again, I did see this in person, it was bewildering.

1286
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,320
For one thing, I always loved the Wild Wild West on show.

1287
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,440
It moved at a great pace.

1288
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,280
Well, yeah.

1289
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,760
It was very exciting.

1290
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,800
Any Wild West stunt show is better than Fear Factor Live.

1291
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,640
Oh yeah.

1292
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,720
There's no way it's not.

1293
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,000
If you got the guy falling off the railing, doing the flip,

1294
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,080
if that happens, perfect, better than anything

1295
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,920
in Fear Factor.

1296
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,280
Falling into a well, the sort of like,

1297
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,240
between the big scene, like the guys messing around

1298
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,000
and the audience, the little clown bits.

1299
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,960
Yes. Great.

1300
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,200
We've talked about, I'd say very little old West stunt shows

1301
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,880
which this is a genre of, there's like 400 of them.

1302
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,720
Oh yeah.

1303
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,680
Or have been across this country.

1304
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,560
There's the one at Knott's Berry Farm that I enjoy

1305
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,960
that has to compete with the sound

1306
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,840
of a roller coaster passing by.

1307
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,160
That's probably the thing at Six Flags a lot too.

1308
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,840
It's, all right, really project guys,

1309
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,080
really make sure you're loud.

1310
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,640
There's people, there will be people screaming

1311
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,600
on top of you every 10 seconds.

1312
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,200
It rattles the theater every six or four minutes

1313
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,480
or whatever it is when those cars blow by.

1314
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,520
Hard to ignore. Very funny.

1315
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,200
So yeah, it's using this venue

1316
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,160
that was this Wild West stunt show

1317
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,360
and you can kind of tell when at the end

1318
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,360
there's a big pyro blast and then on the back wall

1319
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,080
of whatever this set is supposed to be,

1320
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,240
a huge, like the entire wall of this little building facade

1321
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,760
comes down and lands right on top of a person.

1322
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,720
Oh my God, they'll be crushed to death.

1323
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,960
That's it for them.

1324
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
No, no, no.

1325
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,320
There is a window exactly in the area

1326
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
where they were standing and they went,

1327
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
the window went right through them.

1328
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,320
So like the thing Buster Keaton is famous for,

1329
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,600
like clearly, no matter how you paint it,

1330
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,240
I know this is what, and I can only assume,

1331
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,040
I don't have that Wild West show memorized,

1332
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,160
but I can only assume that that's what it culminated in

1333
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,440
was the Buster Keaton Wild West window.

1334
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,480
Any episodes of the Fear Factor TV show

1335
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,600
where someone's like, hey, I'm Mike,

1336
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,120
I'm from Chicago, Illinois,

1337
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,840
and my biggest fear is being crushed

1338
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,760
by a house Buster Keaton style.

1339
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,160
Rest in peace Buster Keaton.

1340
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,000
I love you Buster.

1341
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,920
Rest in peace, I love you,

1342
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,300
would have loved to do a collab with you.

1343
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,520
I'm gonna be pulled by a train, by my pants.

1344
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,200
Shout out to Buster.

1345
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,640
Oh Buster, love when you showed up in the poker scene

1346
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,680
of Sunset Boulevard with all the other weird old creeps.

1347
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,920
I'm gonna take the dangling off

1348
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,560
of a big clock hand challenge.

1349
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,440
This is the dangling off the big clock hand challenge.

1350
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,440
Ba ba ba bam.

1351
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,440
For raising money for causes, unclear what the cause is.

1352
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,840
Buster Keaton presents Fear Factor.

1353
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,000
Maybe that's kind of the way to bring it back.

1354
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,840
Oh man.

1355
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,960
It's all classic Keaton stuff.

1356
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,880
Well when did all his things happen?

1357
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,200
I know there's like a 20 year itch.

1358
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,040
Is there a 100 year itch?

1359
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,920
110 year itch?

1360
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,760
110 year itch I think.

1361
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,360
People wanna see old silent film hijinks

1362
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,720
on reality, on Merced Reality TV?

1363
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,920
Is that the next TikTok,

1364
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,800
like as we're coming off the weeks when Vox is like,

1365
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,720
the mountain goats are huge on TikTok right now.

1366
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,320
Oh right, right, yeah.

1367
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,760
Buster Keaton running in front of the train,

1368
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,520
it's very popular.

1369
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,040
I kind of believe, and I'm sure Joe Rogan's

1370
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,960
interviewed a scientist that has the same theory,

1371
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,400
that in the next like 100 years,

1372
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,440
all of a sudden there'll just be an article

1373
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,800
that says like Buster Keaton is back,

1374
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,680
and it's just he's alive again,

1375
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,800
and we have to figure out how that happened.

1376
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
Like scientists are bringing.

1377
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,360
Oh not even, oh not the trend of his comedy.

1378
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,200
He's back.

1379
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,240
Buster Keaton is alive.

1380
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,280
That'll be like in a morning we'll wake up

1381
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,000
and there'll be just some dead person that's alive again,

1382
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,600
and we'll be like they figured it out,

1383
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,920
and the first one they brought back was Buster Keaton,

1384
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,520
and he's back, and oh look at this,

1385
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,680
he's already in the hospital,

1386
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,160
he's doing stunts on the roof.

1387
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,920
This is a storyline in the current X-Men comics

1388
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,200
where the humans are like,

1389
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,840
hey weren't a bunch of these guys dead

1390
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,280
that are like hanging out?

1391
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,760
Who's the X-Men that can lay eggs?

1392
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,000
Or is that the, there's a whole like,

1393
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,640
X-Men are like hatching out of eggs, reborn.

1394
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,120
Yeah, well there's five of them that help with that process.

1395
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,960
I forget, I read all of it two years ago,

1396
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,800
and I can't remember.

1397
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,840
The chicken lady, it's from Kids in the Hall.

1398
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,680
It's the second lady.

1399
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,920
From the Kids in the Hall.

1400
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,560
More chicken ladies in X-Men now?

1401
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,960
I feel like we're underselling how weird

1402
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,080
that final challenge of the Fear Factor live show is.

1403
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,360
There's two, like.

1404
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,880
So, okay, so you had to climb the fake facade

1405
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,000
of the old West Hound to get flags.

1406
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,720
You're knocking off flags, similar to Double Dare.

1407
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,440
Then you slide down a fireman's pole.

1408
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,760
Then you each get in a yellow convertible.

1409
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,640
Start it, do not get out of the car

1410
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,520
until it's gonna be raised like 20 feet in the air.

1411
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,360
By wires, what's happening?

1412
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,560
By wires.

1413
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,680
Pull it up.

1414
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,160
Pull it up, do not move from the driver's seat

1415
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,160
until you're told you can.

1416
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,160
And then you have to climb to the front and the back

1417
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,000
and get more flags.

1418
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,800
And get more flags, and is it also,

1419
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,440
it's not raining during all this.

1420
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,600
They didn't combine this with rain.

1421
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Cause some of the challenges have rain,

1422
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,400
like water's pouring on.

1423
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
I don't think so.

1424
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,000
But if you fall off the front of the car,

1425
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,080
which is slightly tilted, you're out.

1426
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,800
And then if you can get to the back seat of the car,

1427
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,960
there's a rocket launcher.

1428
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,880
The rocket launcher blows up a center target

1429
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,280
that causes the facade to fall down.

1430
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,840
Again, we should say it falls,

1431
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,560
but it falls one third of the speed

1432
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,120
as it fell at the stunt show.

1433
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,880
Probably because the master of ceremony's host

1434
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,520
is not a trained stunt performer,

1435
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,520
like the cowboys in the stunt show.

1436
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1437
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,120
So you can't be as dangerous.

1438
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,960
Yeah.

1439
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,520
You might not handle, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1440
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,360
Weird.

1441
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,240
Yeah, you know, your fear of being made to climb a building,

1442
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,720
get flags, get into a car, stay in the car,

1443
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,840
then get out of the car, go on the hood in the back.

1444
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,400
That's the fear we all have.

1445
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,560
That's the fear we all have.

1446
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,400
We all share it.

1447
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,840
It's as if like, there's things in Mario

1448
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,920
that are scary to do, but my,

1449
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,160
I've never thought that a fear would be

1450
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,400
to go in and out of pipes and have little guys

1451
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,400
that look like hamburgers go at like,

1452
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,960
like that I have to stomp on and then hit my head on a block

1453
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,160
and a shell is coming at me.

1454
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,800
It's not, it might be scary.

1455
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,000
I don't know if it's a fear.

1456
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,040
Well, you'll be able to live your fear

1457
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,240
in May of next year, probably.

1458
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,200
Oh, that's true.

1459
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,040
You're gonna have to actually do that for real.

1460
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,280
I'm not afraid of, although as you know,

1461
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,800
maybe if there is like the,

1462
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,680
if there's a big thing in Mario, I might be afraid.

1463
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,680
Did anybody else, I just threw that out there

1464
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,720
and it sounded weird as soon as I said it.

1465
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,320
I really thought that the Goombas looked like hamburgers,

1466
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,240
like basic McDonald's hamburgers.

1467
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,160
You know what, I think,

1468
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,000
I don't think that's that weird.

1469
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,120
I can say it. I don't think that's that weird.

1470
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,080
I think- Is it food stuff in Mario?

1471
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,560
Yeah, I don't think it's that weird.

1472
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,400
I don't know, maybe I did, man.

1473
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,280
I was like, oh, there's a hamburger coming.

1474
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,280
Wait, I have to, I'm not supposed to eat it?

1475
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,320
I gotta kill the hamburger?

1476
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,360
I think you're onto something there.

1477
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,520
I don't know that I,

1478
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,920
I don't have a memory of being a hamburger,

1479
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,440
but I remember being confused by it.

1480
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,960
You know what, actually, now that I'm thinking about it,

1481
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,760
the real reason I'm thinking hamburger Goomba

1482
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,040
is because of the McDonald's toys that you got,

1483
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,800
which was a Goomba and it would like spring load

1484
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,240
and it would flip, I believe.

1485
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,200
So maybe that's why I'm thinking hamburger.

1486
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,080
Oh yeah, those are cool.

1487
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,280
But I definitely misidentified

1488
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,560
a lot of the different Mario enemies,

1489
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,720
or like the, I don't know what you call them, lackeys?

1490
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,600
I don't know.

1491
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,440
Sure.

1492
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,240
But yeah.

1493
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,280
Baddies.

1494
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,440
Baddies?

1495
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,360
I guess I wouldn't call it that.

1496
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:21,120
There's a, in Mario 2, Birdo, Birdo hits,

1497
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,680
shoots the eggs out of her snout.

1498
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,520
Yeah.

1499
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,360
So you got that.

1500
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,200
Snout, I guess.

1501
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,520
Well, what else would it be?

1502
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Bird, was it, wait, was Birdo a bird though?

1503
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,160
No, Birdo's like a weird dinosaur or something.

1504
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,800
I guess it'd be a snout.

1505
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,600
Yeah, it's gotta be, it's a snout.

1506
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,320
I suppose so.

1507
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,160
I could say mouth, I suppose,

1508
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,000
but it's fully nose and mouth.

1509
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,120
I don't know if it is a snout,

1510
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,080
because it's not a different color.

1511
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,120
I think it's a mouth.

1512
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,480
When I looked it up, Birdo's are dinosaur-like creatures

1513
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,320
with large snouts.

1514
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,160
There you go.

1515
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,040
I mean, you just use snout in your day-to-day

1516
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,040
a lot more than I do.

1517
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:54,880
Well, you know what?

1518
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,120
I actually use snoot a lot more.

1519
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,400
Yeah, I know, that too.

1520
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,160
I was surprised that one wasn't snoot.

1521
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,300
Well, I say, yeah, I use snoot so much at home.

1522
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,040
It's nice to use snout when I'm out in the public,

1523
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,080
in the public and the real world.

1524
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,360
So.

1525
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,240
Why is Birdo hated?

1526
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,880
That's a big question, Google.

1527
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,720
Yeah.

1528
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,160
He's blasting me with eggs all the time.

1529
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,120
She is.

1530
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,920
Birdo?

1531
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,760
Yeah.

1532
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,600
Yeah, that's what I said.

1533
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,720
Not a short answer.

1534
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,440
It seems complicated.

1535
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,280
Yeah.

1536
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,960
And then a giant list of bad qualities and good qualities.

1537
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,800
We're gonna do-

1538
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,560
Birdo has seven bad qualities, four good qualities.

1539
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,800
The last bad quality is he or she

1540
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,600
has little to no personality.

1541
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,600
Oh, man. Maybe a little.

1542
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,920
Oh, man. That's a little cruel.

1543
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,040
Birdo has a little personality.

1544
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,120
We really, we really, because we've teased,

1545
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,960
we've teased so many new episodes lately.

1546
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,480
We've teased a full Koopa Kids episode recently too.

1547
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,320
Oh, that's right.

1548
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,080
We probably should do it all in a chunk

1549
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,200
when Nintendo Land opens out here,

1550
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,040
hopefully like around Memorial Day.

1551
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,000
Oh yeah, it's like the ancillary Mario content.

1552
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,840
That's a great idea.

1553
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,680
That's fun.

1554
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,500
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1555
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,340
We'll try to get-

1556
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,180
We'll go Mario event.

1557
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,200
Try to get their opening day.

1558
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,040
Why not?

1559
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,880
Maybe.

1560
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,700
Sure.

1561
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,560
But it'll probably soft open a bunch like Harry Potter did.

1562
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,040
Sure.

1563
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,920
So we'll stalk it.

1564
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,960
Anyways, yeah, very strange game.

1565
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,840
There's a thing in the middle where you gotta,

1566
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,400
it's similar, it's running back and forth,

1567
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,320
at least in the Hollywood world.

1568
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,160
Maybe you guys didn't see this.

1569
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,520
I saw one in Hollywood where you gotta get flags

1570
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,520
and you gotta get them out of a tank that's full of eels.

1571
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,360
That's in Florida.

1572
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1573
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,760
They're flexing.

1574
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,000
Then you have to, well, this is a big thing in a lot of them.

1575
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,840
So we gotta talk about this.

1576
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,100
You have to, there is a, you do a big relay race,

1577
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,040
you're running back and forth.

1578
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,400
Maybe there's kids shooting cannons at you,

1579
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,000
whatever the obstacles are.

1580
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,080
Either way, it's difficult, it's confusing,

1581
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,880
but at the end, you have the biggest challenge of all,

1582
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,560
which is that you have to chug a weird concoction

1583
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,360
that I think that there's a fake out to it,

1584
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,600
at least in the video I saw,

1585
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,880
where they say, audience, do you want the one

1586
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,880
that is full of dead fish guts marinated in pig juice?

1587
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,760
Or do you want the one that's like a bunch of bugs

1588
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,600
or something?

1589
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,280
And then they cheer and then like, well, who wants both?

1590
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,560
And then they combine them.

1591
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,400
Right.

1592
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,440
And then they top it off with sour milk,

1593
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,440
which here's really where you're gonna do this.

1594
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,680
Imagine doing this more than once at Universal Studios,

1595
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,640
going and watching people chug just that part.

1596
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,000
Actually, just the sour milk almost bothers me more

1597
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,360
than all of the bug stuff.

1598
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,200
Yeah.

1599
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,680
Well, right, cause actually like bugs are food.

1600
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,200
Regardless of-

1601
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,520
Maybe nutrition, if you can get past that, it's gross.

1602
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,360
Right.

1603
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,440
Just cause of the way they look.

1604
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,040
But yes, sour milk.

1605
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,480
I mean, also, is it really sour milk?

1606
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,480
Is it really sour?

1607
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,560
Maybe not, maybe not.

1608
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,720
Like there's no way they're feeding guests

1609
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,480
like milk that will literally make them ill.

1610
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,640
I mean, this would make anyone ill

1611
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,360
just cause of like the psychological factor

1612
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,720
of eating bugs if you don't eat bugs.

1613
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,720
But very small cups in the Orlando,

1614
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,800
like they had to chug.

1615
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,480
Yeah, but I bet sour milk is like buttermilk.

1616
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,320
I have a feeling technically in the way that like,

1617
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,880
yeah, if you let something or it becomes cheese,

1618
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,040
maybe it's like a, it's something it's just, it's brie.

1619
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,680
They put a bunch of brie in a blender.

1620
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,520
Cause this has to be theme park safe.

1621
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,880
Like you can't really have it,

1622
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,760
like people getting violently ill.

1623
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,000
No, I mean, the mini games,

1624
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,600
first of all, the mini games are pretty boring.

1625
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,400
A lot of this is very boring.

1626
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,360
And the three big events are all right.

1627
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,440
The audience seems into it,

1628
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,400
but the audience largely seems dead.

1629
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,240
Like very quiet.

1630
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,880
There in one of the videos, like 15 people,

1631
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,640
a dozen people get up and leave before the final event.

1632
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,800
And like, you can see that because the camera,

1633
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,240
like they stand up there in the rows in front of the camera

1634
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,680
and they're like, let's get out of here before it's over.

1635
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,240
Like clearly not entertained because it takes so long

1636
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:54,240
to safely set up all of these complicated, bizarre events.

1637
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,880
Yeah.

1638
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,720
Yeah.

1639
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,520
I thought honestly, I would just,

1640
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,480
the first thing I did preparing for this

1641
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,560
was watch the 2016 one.

1642
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,040
And I at first thought that everyone involved was plants

1643
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,440
except for like the kids.

1644
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,160
Because in the 2016 one, they only have three contestants.

1645
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,800
In the 2019, there's like six people that are hanging.

1646
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,480
So during slow times, there would only be three.

1647
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,600
Right. So they only have three dudes.

1648
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,840
And the first two guys,

1649
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,000
cause they put them up on the screen,

1650
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,120
they do it like the show.

1651
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,280
They have people go, hey, I'm so and so from wherever.

1652
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,400
And the first two guys, the one, the video goes,

1653
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,440
hey, I'm Nick from Utica, New York

1654
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,000
and I'm ready to win on fear factor or whatever.

1655
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,360
And the next guy goes, hi, I'm Nick from Utica, New York.

1656
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,720
I'm gonna win cause I'm from New York.

1657
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,400
And I was like, oh, is it, it's gotta be a bit, right?

1658
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,120
And then the next guy was from some other place

1659
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,640
and he was just like, I wanna win to prove to my kids

1660
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,480
I'm not too old.

1661
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,600
And I was like, oh, that's good.

1662
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,960
And I'm watching this clip going,

1663
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,200
oh, look at the subtle acting these guys are doing.

1664
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,840
Cause that I see like the little smile,

1665
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,960
like he seems like he's nervous,

1666
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,720
but he must do this all the time.

1667
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,720
And I was like, oh, I guess that's not what it was.

1668
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,560
I could see, but I don't know a lot of it being plants.

1669
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,400
It could be plants.

1670
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,360
They're really getting enough volunteers

1671
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,080
to do a bunch of shows every day for this thing.

1672
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,080
Yeah, cause they had to, I saw they had to get

1673
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,720
for like the main challenges, they had to like, you know,

1674
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,920
check people out a while beforehand

1675
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,600
and for the little mini challenges,

1676
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,280
you could do it like 20, 30 minutes before the show.

1677
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,120
Right.

1678
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,360
Yeah, so they had like, I was, yeah,

1679
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,280
reading about where you could check in for the challenges,

1680
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,760
but I, yeah, I was like, are they real?

1681
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,720
Cause there's not a, again, for some reason,

1682
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,280
even the top heavy hitters of theme park,

1683
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,760
like history and research did have not really gone hard

1684
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,800
on Fear Factor Live.

1685
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,720
So I was like, is there ever plants

1686
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,840
or they just got like one of their stunt performers to go,

1687
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,240
yeah, just hang up there for a little while.

1688
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,280
Then they did have to spend money for like animal handlers.

1689
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,200
Like someone- Sure, there's so many different animals.

1690
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,280
So many different animals.

1691
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,720
First off, some of those eels definitely ate it.

1692
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,200
Like someone definitely like punched an eel

1693
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,320
or like fucked up an eel or something.

1694
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,000
How durable is an eel, do you think?

1695
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,200
I think they're pretty, they are pretty durable,

1696
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,440
but like the scorpions, they are so gingerly placing them

1697
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,280
on the head and taking them off the head,

1698
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,000
I suppose not to agitate them,

1699
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,720
but they must've had to have anti-venom standing by, right?

1700
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,200
Or like, is there a way to,

1701
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,120
you don't wanna de-fang or de-venom

1702
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,720
like any animal that's cruel, you know?

1703
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,680
The idea that they have anti-venom hanging around

1704
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,520
is really funny.

1705
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,800
Well, if someone just starts getting stung by scorpion,

1706
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,640
like a guest- But they can't,

1707
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,800
this is a theme park.

1708
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,400
There's no way there's a good chance,

1709
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,840
even a 10% chance that the scorpion

1710
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,080
is just gonna start stinging a guest.

1711
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,480
There's no way.

1712
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,280
So either it has to be a real guest

1713
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,440
and then somebody's gonna say we're idiots

1714
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,000
and they're gonna blow the whole lid off,

1715
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,120
hopefully they'll message us,

1716
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,080
but like there's just no way

1717
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,000
that either what you're saying,

1718
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
they've de-venomed, de-clawed every one of these animals

1719
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,320
or there's just no way it's anti-venom.

1720
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,800
We got the anti-venom of this poor mom

1721
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,960
who's here for her one trip out of every 10 years,

1722
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,040
gets fucked up by our scorpion.

1723
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,120
Well, it's like how a lot of places in LA,

1724
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,680
like veterinarian hospital,

1725
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,440
but like places have anti-venom for rattlesnakes.

1726
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,640
Well, sure, I'm saying you're right,

1727
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,760
it makes sense to do that.

1728
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,640
I'm just saying that logistically,

1729
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,120
this is madness of universal studio.

1730
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,560
This isn't Six Flags, this is universal.

1731
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,120
They're not gonna have even a chance

1732
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,520
that somebody gets stung in the face.

1733
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,360
That's fair.

1734
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,200
That's what I'm saying.

1735
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,920
So I'm suspicious of some of this still,

1736
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,520
but according to the literature,

1737
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,000
you could sign up for stuff like this.

1738
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,320
I just was like, anti-venom, is that right?

1739
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,360
And I guess so, because there was recently

1740
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,480
the first ever FDA approved scorpion anti-venom

1741
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,720
and it's called Anascorp.

1742
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,200
Well, look, we know Joe Rogan took Anascorp also for COVID.

1743
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,480
Yeah, dude, take an Anascorp.

1744
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,600
I took Anascorp, I took...

1745
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,440
For general...

1746
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,280
Doctor prescribed.

1747
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,480
No, it's the anti-scorp, no, I didn't,

1748
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,960
it's not medicine for scorpions,

1749
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:15,920
it's medicine for people who get bit by scorpions.

1750
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,680
You fucking lied, they lied on the air.

1751
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,120
There's two versions of it, okay?

1752
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,720
I might be showing my ignorance too.

1753
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,640
Someone in the Southwest listening might,

1754
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,400
this could be a thing where it's like,

1755
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,520
oh no, scorpions are really like fire ants

1756
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,040
where if you're a full, like a healthy adult,

1757
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,720
it would sting and it would suck,

1758
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,560
but like you'll be fine as long as you're...

1759
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,720
There's no way they're letting people

1760
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,920
get stung by scorpions though, there's no way.

1761
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,720
Scorpions, I'm saying scorpions might be like quicksand

1762
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,640
in kids movies where it's like,

1763
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,520
oh, it's not gonna kill you, it's fine.

1764
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,280
You're acknowledging that you may not know

1765
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,520
everything about scorpions.

1766
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,360
Yeah.

1767
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,960
Which I hear you, I don't know anything about scorpions.

1768
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,800
I mean, I know the band...

1769
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,640
I'm just saying there's no...

1770
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,840
I'm doing my own research about scorpions.

1771
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,280
I'm trying to find out what I wanna find out,

1772
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,040
but you gotta be careful where you're getting your info.

1773
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,920
DYOR about scorpions is what we're saying,

1774
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,800
but I'm just saying that it's,

1775
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,360
I would think that I would be more willing

1776
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,120
as like a lawyer at Universal to put people

1777
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,680
in a harness three stories up,

1778
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,600
but even that to me is a little bit like,

1779
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,800
some guy's gonna freak out in a harness up there.

1780
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,400
We saw what happened to me on the Minotaur.

1781
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,240
You know what I mean?

1782
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,320
Like you don't wanna have like dad having a mental,

1783
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,280
like a nervous breakdown, I like when he's hanging.

1784
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,240
So I'm, I don't know.

1785
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,080
I am suspicious.

1786
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,680
And your old thing was being concerned

1787
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,480
that there wasn't anti-Minotaur.

1788
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,360
Anti-Minotaur, anti-Minotaur.

1789
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,200
Anti-Min.

1790
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,280
Anti-Min.

1791
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,360
Anti-Min, yeah.

1792
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,200
Anti-Min.

1793
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,040
Anti-Min.

1794
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,480
Do you have anti-Min on hand?

1795
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,360
Excuse me.

1796
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,240
I have a quick question.

1797
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,640
I think it might like take the Minotaur

1798
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,840
and shrink it down till it was just like the size of a puppy.

1799
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,960
So then it wasn't a threat anymore.

1800
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,560
Like this big, it's like the Star Trek.

1801
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,720
They would like shoot it right into your neck.

1802
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,800
Like the hypo spray and stuff.

1803
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,160
You were very concerned that there were other like

1804
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,800
creatures of legend in that,

1805
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,040
like there's no oracles back there, right?

1806
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,480
There's no like.

1807
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,320
Are there trolls?

1808
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,960
Are there?

1809
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,280
Do I have to guess anyone's name

1810
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,040
or else they take my child or dog or.

1811
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:13,880
Or gold.

1812
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,200
Or gold, like yeah.

1813
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,000
I have a lot of gold on me right now

1814
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,920
and I do not want to lose it.

1815
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,800
In a game of wits with a troll, sir.

1816
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,120
Is there a Medusa back there?

1817
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,160
Is there a Medusa?

1818
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,240
I don't have a sword.

1819
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,320
I can't be cutting snakes off of a woman's hair.

1820
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,400
Are there attractive, are there sirens on cliffs?

1821
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,880
Are there small cliffs?

1822
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,640
What is the salt circle situation like back

1823
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,480
in the escape room?

1824
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,520
Yeah.

1825
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,360
Yeah, no.

1826
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,400
Yeah, that was mostly what my problem was.

1827
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,280
So I'm just saying I'm skeptical.

1828
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,880
Somebody let us know we're ignorant.

1829
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,000
Were these people plants?

1830
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,600
Were some of them plants?

1831
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,440
This is all of it.

1832
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,440
Are we like really not getting the code

1833
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,760
that this was all entirely fake show?

1834
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,280
I mean, it makes sense.

1835
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,000
I it's interesting to really like have the,

1836
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,080
I feel like the fog might be lifting as we talk.

1837
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,120
Cause like, cause okay, maybe like the drink was real.

1838
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,960
And those people, cause those people could have been

1839
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,440
really drinking something and maybe,

1840
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,280
but maybe there was a fake out as far as like the blender

1841
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,880
or something where it was like,

1842
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,000
you're really just drinking like, I don't know,

1843
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,840
ground up cereal or something.

1844
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,240
That's, but it's all just so boring.

1845
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,280
You're watching these people like running a blend

1846
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,480
and like, Ooh, like making a little,

1847
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,600
while like other people behind them are like working

1848
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,360
with carabiners and like, all right, make sure the flag.

1849
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,200
I agree with you.

1850
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,040
I'm just saying that I,

1851
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,920
I'm suspicious that a theme park would ever want

1852
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,200
any sort of liability.

1853
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,040
No, I agree.

1854
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,720
Cause like you get, you like,

1855
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,440
dad drinks the insects and the milk

1856
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,680
and then he just has diarrhea the rest of the day.

1857
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,280
Like they're not gonna take a chance with that.

1858
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,960
Like he's gonna go to guest services.

1859
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,640
Like I have had diarrhea since I did Fear Factor Live.

1860
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,360
Please, I've not been able to keep down the pizza

1861
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,880
from the New York area.

1862
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,960
Please, you have to give me some Pepto Bismol.

1863
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,000
I didn't even get the nutrients from the pizza

1864
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,320
because of the Fear Factor diarrhea that I've been having.

1865
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,120
And it's lasted days now.

1866
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,520
Like still going on every ride.

1867
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,880
This puddle is a big puddle on Men in Black Alien Attack.

1868
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,800
There would be, everybody would have be having diarrhea

1869
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,920
after this doing Fear Factor Live.

1870
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,640
It doesn't make sense.

1871
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,120
It doesn't make sense that they would actually do this.

1872
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,960
It has to be something that is edible though, gross.

1873
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:26,800
It has to be-

1874
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,620
They didn't change it up.

1875
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,760
They weren't doing experiment.

1876
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,480
Nobody chugs donkey semen on stage.

1877
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,320
Right.

1878
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,160
They were not doing that.

1879
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,360
Unless they brought it from home

1880
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,680
and didn't say what it was.

1881
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,220
Unless the host did it from a container,

1882
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,480
discreetly, because it got them through the show.

1883
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,800
Dad had a little flask in his boot

1884
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,960
and he pulled it up when he put the donkey semen in

1885
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,800
when no one was looking.

1886
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,360
Sir, please no food and beverage

1887
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,040
in a day in the park with Barney.

1888
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,400
Please no food and beverage in here.

1889
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,840
These costumes are very hard to clean.

1890
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,520
It was Bob Cummings.

1891
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,080
Bob Cummings is my grandson.

1892
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,280
I got five kids.

1893
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,840
Anything else you think I'm gonna get through this day?

1894
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,960
A hot theme park day?

1895
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,480
Yeah, I just, it doesn't make sense.

1896
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,880
I mean, it's like the Copperfield thing

1897
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,240
where we think we've now realized

1898
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:10,200
that every Copperfield person in the audience

1899
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,880
is a plant that interacts with them.

1900
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,720
Sure.

1901
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,160
At the very least, yeah, a lot of them.

1902
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,600
So, yeah.

1903
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,760
I am suspicious.

1904
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,120
I'm highly suspicious.

1905
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,240
We're on to you seasonal show that is closing

1906
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,700
and that hasn't really been running lately.

1907
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,540
Yeah.

1908
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,820
And that no one, that the other theme park people

1909
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,720
weren't interested enough to do videos about.

1910
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,560
The most boring-

1911
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,640
Or through the looking glass.

1912
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,080
Every other thing we've ever looked up or talked about,

1913
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,960
I'm like, whoa, there's a thing about that, huh?

1914
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,040
All right, not this.

1915
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:43,040
I mean, I'm sure it was like a decent gig for like the whole,

1916
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,600
I mean, what do you mostly have to do?

1917
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,440
You would describe what the challenges are

1918
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,200
and you try to keep the audience energy up.

1919
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,800
Like they're doing their job.

1920
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,680
They're doing, and the safety people are clearly,

1921
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,280
they gotta double check everything.

1922
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,680
Like they're, everyone is doing their job,

1923
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,180
but like, yeah, this show,

1924
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:03,060
it's just a worse kind of corporate synergy.

1925
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,980
Like I'd be begging to go on Race Through New York

1926
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,820
after sitting through this.

1927
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,660
Oh, Race Through New York is way better than this.

1928
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:09,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1929
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,580
Stuff happens.

1930
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1931
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:15,060
You aren't like sitting far away from a cage

1932
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:20,060
that requires a grainy mini DV camera in 2006

1933
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,900
to show me sort of what's happening.

1934
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,100
And it's, I'll even say this,

1935
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,300
the property itself would be a good horror night's maze.

1936
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,900
You could do something like that

1937
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,100
where people are walking by,

1938
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,420
like people doing awful things.

1939
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,740
Oh, or like the shit, like, well, they wouldn't do this.

1940
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,980
I was gonna say like, it's an episode gone wrong,

1941
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,820
but they never do that.

1942
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:40,660
Yeah, they don't wanna say.

1943
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:41,740
Because they can't say that.

1944
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,000
But like, you know, you have like different,

1945
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,660
you have like 10 actors playing Joe Rogan

1946
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,340
throughout the maze and he's in every,

1947
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,540
he's supervising every room.

1948
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:50,380
And then, yeah, one of them,

1949
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,740
they're in the bucket of blood

1950
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,580
and one of them, they're covered in rats.

1951
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,420
You could do it.

1952
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,900
You could do a good tableaus

1953
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:59,980
of the greatest hits of Fear Factor for a maze.

1954
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:00,980
And that would be effective.

1955
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,300
That would be gross and scary.

1956
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,340
Yeah, you could do,

1957
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,340
if you didn't wanna make actors do this all day,

1958
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,080
you could have an animatronic on loop,

1959
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:11,860
sucking a penis of, what did they have to,

1960
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,380
who, what penis was sucked?

1961
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:14,220
Oh, I don't know.

1962
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,060
It was udders, it was goat udders.

1963
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:15,900
Oh, it was udders.

1964
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,740
It wasn't, okay, okay.

1965
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,380
I thought there was a different,

1966
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:20,660
that's a different show, Scott.

1967
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,500
It was a while ago.

1968
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,320
I didn't remember.

1969
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,620
I was flashing a Tom Green, pretty good fingered.

1970
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,700
Oh yeah, yeah.

1971
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,900
Well, that would be a good maze too.

1972
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,740
Horror Nights Maze 2, Freddy got fingered.

1973
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,780
Oh my God.

1974
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:34,620
Oda V in the room with all the sausages on the strings.

1975
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,460
Oh my God.

1976
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,780
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

1977
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,220
And then a Tom Green animatronic

1978
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,460
or an actor playing him, jerking off a horse.

1979
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,300
Yeah, yeah.

1980
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,260
Rubber Tom Green mask.

1981
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,060
And Daddy, you like some sausage,

1982
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:51,380
is played at like 11 on like the spinal tap speaker.

1983
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:53,580
Like it's gonna be so loud.

1984
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,980
Like as soon as you walk into that maze, that house,

1985
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,420
it's just gonna be blaring,

1986
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,900
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

1987
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,660
That's really, we've talked about doing our own haunt,

1988
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,820
but maybe we just get the rights to a movie

1989
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,020
like Freddy got fingered and make our own version.

1990
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,020
Oh my God.

1991
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,080
Being in a, it's not specifically scary,

1992
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,620
but you know when he has to like stack up

1993
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:13,420
all the slices of American cheese?

1994
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:16,820
If you're in a room with too much American cheese in it,

1995
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,260
that'd be scary as hell.

1996
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,100
So gross.

1997
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,060
At least it's like a sort of demented fun house kind of,

1998
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,180
this is a great.

1999
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,020
It's a great idea.

2000
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,700
Yeah, this would have like propped up the movie,

2001
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,460
I feel like if they've done the synergy, right?

2002
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,300
Are the articles,

2003
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,140
is this as like the Freddy got fingered Renaissance happened?

2004
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,820
You know, Clifford had its moment.

2005
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:38,560
I think it's gone as far as it's gonna go.

2006
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,340
It gets the article once every two years.

2007
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:44,580
It gets the rewatch for me once every several years,

2008
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:46,460
which I do enjoy.

2009
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,140
But then there's a moment where like,

2010
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:50,260
I am tired of watching Freddy got fingered.

2011
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,460
It's pretty exhausting.

2012
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,300
Yes.

2013
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,540
I think it's,

2014
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:56,580
what's crazy is that more people didn't understand like,

2015
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:59,740
no, he, this is a prank of a movie.

2016
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,260
The movie is a, it's his biggest joke.

2017
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:03,100
Hold on.

2018
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:03,920
Yes.

2019
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,180
I'm an, hello?

2020
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,020
Hello.

2021
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,600
Are you guys asleep?

2022
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:15,260
You have a package of 23 Ninja Turtles

2023
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,600
and outrageous swim shorts.

2024
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:23,360
It's not, we need you to help get it out of the truck.

2025
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,980
We got the, Freddy got fingered Donatello.

2026
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:31,860
Donatello covered in a.

2027
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,820
Leonardo stacking the cheese.

2028
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,120
It was a call from an unknown number

2029
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,440
and then I got a text that says Amazon driver chat.

2030
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,480
An Amazon delivery driver needs help with your order.

2031
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,640
We just made an edit because Mike just went

2032
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,600
to take a phone call,

2033
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,320
but Jason and I, while he was gone, decided that it was,

2034
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,440
cause he was getting a package.

2035
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,280
He was getting a phone call.

2036
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,120
Yeah. Yeah.

2037
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,600
We decided he was getting the Freddy got fingered brand

2038
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,640
Ninja Turtles.

2039
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,160
Freddy got fingered Ninja Turtles crossover.

2040
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2041
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,960
Donatello's in a deer high, a bloody deer hide.

2042
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,580
With the pace of how much stuff they're making

2043
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,840
for Ninja Turtles for the adult collector,

2044
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,380
it's sophisticated adult collector.

2045
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,040
It's unlikely what you're saying would come true,

2046
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,240
but it's not out of the question.

2047
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:23,760
It's a Michelangelo crossed with Harlan Williams

2048
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,760
and he hit a nail on the homemade skate ramp.

2049
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,380
So has, you can see bone in his knee screaming.

2050
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,220
Yeah. Yeah.

2051
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,060
Yeah.

2052
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,400
Ripped horn splinter, I guess.

2053
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,640
Ripped horn splinter is an amazing crossover.

2054
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,720
Yeah. Yeah.

2055
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,560
That's good.

2056
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,300
They did not get enough pre-orders

2057
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,480
from the Euro trip bebop and rock study.

2058
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,960
That's sad.

2059
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,800
Yeah.

2060
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,760
Euro trip renaissance has not happened.

2061
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,200
Now we're sure of.

2062
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,120
What else about this?

2063
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,620
Cause I feel this is like, I mean,

2064
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,040
I've said all I want to say about the show.

2065
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,000
I have some thoughts about some related things,

2066
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,960
but does anybody want to,

2067
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,600
anything else you want to say or plus up about

2068
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,760
any wishes you have or are you sad that it's,

2069
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,840
anything that you're sad about that won't happen anymore?

2070
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,240
It's funny to see it.

2071
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,860
Like I saw it and it would be funny

2072
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,220
and I wish I could have seen it.

2073
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:20,300
So I would have like just more, more jokes,

2074
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,380
I guess about it.

2075
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:25,920
Cause it was just, it's just so ill equipped for this place,

2076
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,760
for this theater.

2077
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,620
Like they didn't create a new theater for it.

2078
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,420
And it doesn't have to be a maze,

2079
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:34,260
but I'm sure there is like some weird,

2080
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:37,860
like smaller setup where it's like,

2081
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:39,600
if you want to go see a gross show, here it is,

2082
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,780
or a scary show, but it's not this setup.

2083
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,400
It's not this venue.

2084
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,780
It just kind of didn't work.

2085
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,220
It was not the right venue for the show.

2086
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,540
And that's why it only ran 15 years.

2087
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,500
Well, this is not unprecedented in the theme park world.

2088
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,880
I was wrong.

2089
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,900
I was very wrong.

2090
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,420
I was like, this show isn't even on the air.

2091
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:01,320
Why is it still running?

2092
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,900
Forgetting that it had been rebooted 2011 to 2012,

2093
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,100
and then 2017 to 2018.

2094
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,620
I think that last one is the MTV,

2095
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,260
the Ludacris one.

2096
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,380
Donald Trump squirted in and the executive of MTV

2097
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,700
are like, oh, these hogs will watch this again.

2098
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,860
These idiots.

2099
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,220
Drink your pig juice, hogs.

2100
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,700
Drink your pig juice, idiots.

2101
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2102
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,100
It was on TV.

2103
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,700
It makes sense that like they would keep something

2104
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,480
on theme parks that was on the air.

2105
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,380
So it isn't as crazy as it sounds

2106
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:35,380
that it's existed that long, but it lasted a while.

2107
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,620
I think it's funny that Universal,

2108
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:43,900
I give Universal credit for having changeover and turnover,

2109
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,860
not being afraid to get rid of old attractions.

2110
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,900
But by that, I mean like things that last for 15 years.

2111
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:57,100
I'm like, boy, the progressive organization

2112
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:00,100
that'll get rid of a show after 15 years

2113
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,740
that's based on a TV show that isn't on the air anymore.

2114
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:05,820
That still is better to me than like Disney

2115
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:09,020
letting parts of Epcot rot forever.

2116
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,540
Like it's gonna end up being 50 years

2117
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,100
celebrating the anniversary of something closing in 1987

2118
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,220
and not getting replaced.

2119
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,660
We're gonna have the anniversary

2120
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:23,540
of the Wonders of Life Pavilion being the festival center,

2121
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,460
a half-open building, a half-done building

2122
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,820
before the Play Pavilion opens.

2123
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:29,920
Yeah, yeah.

2124
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,660
But this is, Universal's taking the ax to stuff.

2125
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:37,020
Because Barney's out, Fear Factor is out,

2126
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,460
Trek 4D is out.

2127
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,300
Oh, oh, I don't know why I'm saying this.

2128
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,580
It's very exciting.

2129
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:48,340
The prize bag, the prize, if you won Fear Factor Live,

2130
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:53,340
appeared to be, I saw it referred to as Universal swag bag.

2131
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,220
Like, so it's what you think.

2132
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,700
Maybe two shirts are among-

2133
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,180
Megamind sweatshirts. Maybe tickets.

2134
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:01,820
Oh, they wish they got a Megamind sweatshirt, you know?

2135
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,140
Yeah, it's not that good.

2136
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,180
Yeah, it doesn't have the Intel logo very large on it

2137
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,380
next to Megamind.

2138
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,220
That's true.

2139
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:11,660
It's like one of the Oscars they have lying around

2140
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,660
from the world's greatest math students.

2141
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,620
But I'm a 55-year-old man.

2142
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,040
Look, this is what we got.

2143
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,020
You want it or not?

2144
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,620
No, no, no, sure, yeah, I know, I'll take it.

2145
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,620
I was just complaining.

2146
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,020
Just pointing something out.

2147
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,660
I think maybe to go out,

2148
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,660
I'd like to nod to something that the venue

2149
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,500
has been used for recently.

2150
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,220
Because as I said, we're losing

2151
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:40,500
this entire live show facility.

2152
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:45,500
We don't have the skip, the scoop on,

2153
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,860
I need to eat something, so not fish guts.

2154
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,580
We don't have the scoop on what's replacing this.

2155
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,980
I saw the rumor out there that it's more Diagon.

2156
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,300
Makes sense to me.

2157
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,180
Saw some weird thing about that.

2158
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,340
It's like a VR Harry Potter experience,

2159
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:58,660
but who knows where that comes from.

2160
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,100
It would make total sense if it was,

2161
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:04,100
but that's like sizable space to do something major.

2162
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,780
So of course, yeah, it makes all the sense in the world.

2163
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:10,100
There's so many great universal rumors,

2164
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,780
and there's just no great Disney rumors.

2165
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,100
I mean, I guess there's the Disneyland, the expansion,

2166
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,860
if that goes through, obviously that would be big,

2167
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,140
big deal, but like.

2168
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:22,500
I heard a rumor they're gonna raise parking even more.

2169
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,940
Oh, the rumor came true.

2170
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,660
It's a great time to be a magic key holder.

2171
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:30,260
I heard that Bob Chapek paid American Airlines

2172
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:34,180
for how they change pricing for airline tickets

2173
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,540
and make it dynamic so they can make the most money

2174
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,660
depending on the demand for the ticket

2175
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,140
for the theme park tickets now.

2176
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:41,180
Wouldn't that be cool?

2177
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,940
Like that's what, that's really what we're dealing with here.

2178
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,180
Hot Disney scoop.

2179
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:50,940
They're actively threatening the stars of their movies

2180
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,220
in the press now.

2181
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,300
Hooray.

2182
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,740
And it's hot Disney.

2183
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:59,580
Retweeted an OC register article saying that

2184
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:03,460
Disney offers more value per ride the universal,

2185
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:07,180
and they were trying to slam dunk onto universal on Twitter.

2186
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,140
They did quite a dunk.

2187
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,900
They really dunked on Twitter.

2188
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,180
Quote tweeted an Orange County register article.

2189
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,340
Devastating.

2190
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,140
Hank Hill has entered the chat.

2191
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,220
Your Hank Hill voice has entered the chat.

2192
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,740
It sounded like you were doing Hank Hill.

2193
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,540
Oh, Hank Hill, yeah.

2194
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,380
Hank Hill, oh man, what would Hank Hill make of this?

2195
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:29,180
What would Hank Hill make of this show?

2196
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,500
I would confuse him, I think.

2197
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,620
It ain't right.

2198
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:34,700
That's right.

2199
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:38,780
But, you know, we do, by not having this venue around,

2200
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,180
we lose universal live entertainment.

2201
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,860
They don't have a venue to put on things

2202
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:47,220
like the Bill and Ted show trend in this venue for many years.

2203
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:49,780
And a thing that's happening currently

2204
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:53,020
that is called Halloween Nightmare Fuel.

2205
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,740
This is what is running. Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.

2206
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,380
This is a Halloween Horror Nights live show.

2207
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,220
Okay, yeah.

2208
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:01,940
And I was interested in like,

2209
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,580
what's using this venue right now?

2210
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,460
And I looked it up and there were some Reddit comments

2211
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,900
that said, I don't know about that show.

2212
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,180
It's a bit too sexy for me.

2213
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:14,260
I heard there's like a lot of like, S&M type.

2214
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,180
That's what they said, it's a very S&M,

2215
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:19,300
it's an S&M show and I don't know how I feel about that.

2216
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,140
Burlesque and like dancing and sword squallowing,

2217
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,100
like is that about right?

2218
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,100
Yeah, well, here's a little taste of it.

2219
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:29,300
I don't know if you guys can see this the best.

2220
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:30,580
I'll turn up my brightness.

2221
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,980
But it does, I think you'll,

2222
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:37,500
the soundtrack is relevant to our recent interests.

2223
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,100
Here's a little taste of Halloween Nightmare Fuel.

2224
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,540
["Drag Your Love"]

2225
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,900
["Drag Your Love"]

2226
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,340
["Drag Your Love"]

2227
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,060
Oh, we've got the-

2228
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:57,900
I forget what that's called.

2229
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,980
Remix of Dragula.

2230
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:03,820
The drapes, the drape dance, it's very impressive.

2231
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,740
I'm always impressed by the people who can do that dancing.

2232
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:07,580
Like they're-

2233
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,140
We've never known what that's called

2234
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:09,980
and we've tried to say it.

2235
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,300
I've never known what it's called.

2236
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,140
Drape dancing.

2237
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:16,180
It's very circus and Cirque du Soleil and stuff.

2238
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,180
And I could never in a million years do it.

2239
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:19,860
So I'm always impressed by it.

2240
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,420
Yeah.

2241
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,660
Now I don't know if that's too far away for you to see.

2242
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:27,260
Did that seem too sexy to you?

2243
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,100
How are your feelings to SNME?

2244
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,700
While the sexiness is far away,

2245
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,300
you could sit far back in the arena.

2246
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,740
So I could really, it wouldn't be so in my face.

2247
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,860
You're not in the splash zone.

2248
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:40,060
You're not in the gush zone.

2249
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:40,900
I'll say the-

2250
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:45,300
I don't even know how to proceed.

2251
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,540
I was-

2252
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,380
It was a very loud thing out there.

2253
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:49,820
I don't know if the audience can hear that.

2254
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:50,660
Probably door wrapping up.

2255
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,500
Might be able to.

2256
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,860
It's a drill, drill or something.

2257
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:56,500
It's Jay Fett with one of the Horror Nights chainsaws.

2258
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,340
Here it is.

2259
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:58,180
Here it is.

2260
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,500
You're gonna pay more for barking

2261
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,340
and you're gonna love it.

2262
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,740
Do you wanna come or not?

2263
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,420
Do you wanna be in the park or not?

2264
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:06,420
Disney's absolutely epic parking charge increase.

2265
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,260
It's nigh.

2266
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,300
I was just saying that I did,

2267
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,580
and whenever Eva's back on,

2268
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,500
there's a couple Eva business things

2269
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,420
we have to talk about before we head over the topic will be.

2270
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:20,660
But I did do a haunt.

2271
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,260
I didn't do the Minotaur.

2272
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,620
That I'll have to conquer that another time,

2273
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,220
but it's another Zombie Joe,

2274
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,780
which is a little theater that does shows.

2275
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,460
And they do a little maze,

2276
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:32,660
a very small maze in the lobby and then a show.

2277
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,980
And I have seen a few of these shows,

2278
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,500
but not for a long time.

2279
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,900
And as we're going through the maze,

2280
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,340
you have little flashlights

2281
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,220
because it's pitch black in there.

2282
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:43,660
And there's this black light flashlight.

2283
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:45,980
So you barely can see what you're,

2284
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:46,860
anything in front of you.

2285
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:48,540
So you gotta get real close to whatever,

2286
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:52,740
whoever's about to scare you to see you there.

2287
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,380
And it is scary.

2288
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:56,540
And I made people go ahead of me.

2289
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,580
And the thing I forgot about Zombie Joe's

2290
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,460
is I turned the flashlight and I was like,

2291
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:07,300
oh, there's just a naked woman standing next to me

2292
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,020
in the dark.

2293
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:09,860
So the most-

2294
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:10,700
You are engaged, son.

2295
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,260
I know.

2296
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,140
Yes, this is days after engagement.

2297
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:15,620
And I went right home.

2298
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,660
This is gonna crumble if she only knew.

2299
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:19,900
Yeah, this is not, yeah.

2300
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,940
So this is a show, it's a Halloween show,

2301
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,980
but there's some nudity.

2302
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,180
If you don't bring the children,

2303
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,220
is what I'm saying to this.

2304
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:31,220
You just shine a flashlight suddenly onto a naked body.

2305
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:32,580
Interesting.

2306
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,420
Yeah.

2307
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,940
So you've experienced true sultriness.

2308
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:41,020
Ultra sultra.

2309
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:44,180
Yeah, I experienced sultriness in between

2310
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,700
being worried that I would have another anxiety attack

2311
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,900
because I had a mask on.

2312
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,500
Down the block from a pie.

2313
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,340
What's that cheat called?

2314
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,500
Oh, God.

2315
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,740
It used to be the Rita's Water Ice, but it closed.

2316
01:27:58,740 --> 01:27:59,580
Well, yeah.

2317
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,420
Your beloved Rita's Water Ice from back-

2318
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:02,140
Don't get me started on that.

2319
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:02,980
Yeah.

2320
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,300
It opened here a couple of years ago.

2321
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,340
Jason was so excited and now it's closed.

2322
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:07,420
Yeah.

2323
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,500
But there's a lot of interesting things on,

2324
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,780
isn't like ha-has, there's a comedy club or yuck-yucks.

2325
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,340
The ha-ha comedy cafe.

2326
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,180
Something like that.

2327
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:17,020
Yeah.

2328
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:20,860
And they turned the French restaurant from Punch-Strom Glove

2329
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:23,420
into the comedy chateau.

2330
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:24,260
Is that true?

2331
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,820
Yeah, they painted it bright periwinkle.

2332
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:27,660
Wow.

2333
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:28,900
Now it's a comedy club.

2334
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:29,740
That's good.

2335
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:33,100
So there's so many treasures on Lancashire in the Valley.

2336
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,060
So yeah, anyway, all that to sum up is really,

2337
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,700
I just wanted to say that, yeah,

2338
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:38,740
if the bodiness is far away,

2339
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,660
it won't shock me as much as something

2340
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:44,260
that literally is less than two feet from me.

2341
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:49,260
So somebody in a, like a red leather strap is not,

2342
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:51,540
is not literal nightmare fuel for you.

2343
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,900
Red leather strap makes me think of an X-Men character,

2344
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:54,940
Eric the Red.

2345
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,620
So I am comfortable with that outfit

2346
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:01,060
because I saw it 30 years ago on a cartoon.

2347
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,660
You also would be, if you're sitting far back,

2348
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,620
you can just look at Twitter toy accounts and text me

2349
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,820
as you did the other day when you were at Disneyland

2350
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,380
and sending me toy updates.

2351
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,500
I went to Disneyland alone a couple of days ago

2352
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,860
at this point and yeah, I spent on two rides.

2353
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,780
And I was just sitting down.

2354
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:21,620
Regular stuff.

2355
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,860
Yeah, yeah, no normal stuff.

2356
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,780
Get some email done, get some work done.

2357
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:26,540
Thinking of some, yeah, working on a few things

2358
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:29,460
and then I went on two rides and no way left.

2359
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:30,300
It's great.

2360
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,100
But yeah, I texted you a few toy reveals.

2361
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:33,940
Good scoops.

2362
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:39,540
Well, that was Fear Factor.

2363
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:41,940
Live, I suppose.

2364
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,660
We're losing a lot there.

2365
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:46,900
RIP, thanks for your service.

2366
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,820
Let's all drink some sour milk.

2367
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:52,660
Let's all go outside, find three bugs.

2368
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:55,780
Get that wasp from earlier, put it in a blender

2369
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:58,580
and pour one out.

2370
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,780
But not out of the grid, I wouldn't count.

2371
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:02,500
We have to pour one out into our throats.

2372
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:08,620
And did your dad, listeners, did your dad get diarrhea

2373
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,420
after doing Fear Factor Live?

2374
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:12,940
Let us know, please, I want to know.

2375
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:15,420
Did your dad get diarrhea?

2376
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,100
Hashtag did your dad get diarrhea?

2377
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:22,100
If possible with a photo of him making a pouty face.

2378
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,020
Like today, he could texture one

2379
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,220
if he didn't get one right after it happened.

2380
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:32,620
It's up to you.

2381
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:33,460
Let us know.

2382
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,300
Customize it.

2383
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:36,700
But for now, you survived podcast the ride

2384
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:37,980
the second gate.

2385
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,340
Fear Factor Live Edition, keep it tuned here

2386
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,580
to podcast the ride the second gate

2387
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,780
for three bonus episodes every month.

2388
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:45,180
Keep it tuned to the main feed.

2389
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,980
I think some really fun guests coming up.

2390
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,700
Check, so keep your eye, why wouldn't you?

2391
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,260
If you're here, you're not gonna ignore the,

2392
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:55,300
maybe some people retired the main feed.

2393
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:56,860
It's not strong enough for them anymore.

2394
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,540
I'm only on second gate.

2395
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:01,620
Yeah, they want the nightmare fuel on the second gate.

2396
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,740
I want to be on that.

2397
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:04,980
I pay to go where they're brave enough

2398
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:08,860
to talk nightmare fuel and Rob Zombie remixes

2399
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:12,340
and two inch wide leather straps.

2400
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,420
And what's the appeal of Joe Rogan?

2401
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:17,300
And don't forget to check your sensory deprivation tank

2402
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,380
for scorpions if you live in the Southwest.

2403
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,060
Load up on Anascorp.

2404
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:27,460
If you're afraid of getting COVID, load up on Anascorp.

2405
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:28,300
That's a tip from me.

2406
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:30,260
That was a fucking sick episode, wasn't it bro?

2407
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:31,380
Dude, that was fucking crazy.

2408
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,660
They would never let us do that episode today.

2409
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:35,500
In 2021?

2410
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,140
That fear factor was, fuck that shit.

2411
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,540
They'd never let you do that.

2412
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:43,020
Anascorp was outlawed by American government.

2413
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,220
Anascorp is actually a thing that heals,

2414
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,980
actually heals almost all the different diseases

2415
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,980
and illnesses you can possibly get.

2416
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,100
Alex Jones, he's on the show a lot.

2417
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:51,940
Yeah, sure.
