1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:28,120
And it came to pass in those days that Angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city named Burbank.

3
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,600
He came to three not terribly wise boys named Mike, Scott, and Jason.

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,640
The boys were not virgins, but they certainly act and speak as if they are.

5
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,560
The angels said, behold, you shall conceive and bring forth a podcast and you shall call

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,920
it podcast the ride the second gate.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, it's us, the boys, Scott here, Mike there, Jason there.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,800
Hi, excited to take Christianity down a few pegs today.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Is that what you're a genius?

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Oh, that's right.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
Uh oh.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
It's the big threat.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Richard Dawkins, Michael, Christopher Hitchens.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Ricky Gervais.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
Ricky Gervais.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
And then there's me.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,040
There's nothing people love more than the take down.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,360
Hey, you forgot our pal Bill Maher and his scathing religious.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Religious.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
Religious.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,160
Well, there's a guy who loves to laugh and make people laugh.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,880
This is this was already I only know about this because it was roasted by Heidecker on

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,680
office hours, but I believe he's been quote, I think on a club random or something he was

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
saying out.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,760
I may, you know, I've been thinking about making religious too.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Yes, I've heard of this.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,280
But but this time the religion is wokeness.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,160
I heard him say that exact sentence.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,560
Yeah, I think like he thinks us if he saw a picture of us, he would just OK, got it.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,880
I know what these guys are.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,240
They are just I can tell by their hoodies and glasses.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,400
These are guys who are converts of the religion of wokeness.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,080
And maybe I, their favorite comedian, can get through to them and break the spell.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:10,080
I'm a 66 year old man who's been very rich for a very long time, who lives part of the

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,160
time in a creepy basement with bad lighting and brings over very young women and I, but

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
I know young people and very old men.

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
Well, it's for a club random.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Yeah.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,160
Did Henry Kissinger get to do club random before?

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
I don't think he did.

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
Well, we don't know.

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,320
There could be a delay on those things.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,880
Oh, maybe there's a couple in the can.

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,080
Yeah.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,920
Also, look, I don't feel like Bill Maher was very respectful of the strikes.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,320
And I also don't know if Kissinger appeared in enough stuff to have had a SAG card.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,800
But maybe there was some risk.

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,080
Maybe Kissinger like, we cannot, I must do the rules of the.

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
Wasn't he on like Arthur or something like, wasn't he a character on a cartoon for

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,640
children? Am I crazy that he was like a cartoon?

51
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,360
I mean, look this up.

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,080
He showed up and said, Bill, I would love to come over, but I have to respect the

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,120
picket line, but please send me some of that dank sticky shit.

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,800
You've got a pretty good Kissinger.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,800
Oh, wait a minute.

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
It was just take that.

57
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,160
You know, what's crazy is that doing a Kissinger impression where he is, he lived,

58
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,800
it lived to be obscenely old and yet an impression of him is what he sounded like

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,880
when he was youthful.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,280
Like you're doing the voice we're both doing is him at like a spry 60.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
Yeah, that's a good point.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,400
So if you find it was on a cartoon called he was on a cartoon called Happily Ever

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,280
After on HBO and he was ducky daddles.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,680
Henry Kissinger is ducky daddles.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,880
Cartoon duck who looks like Henry Kissinger.

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:56,400
Yeah, it looks like it is a chicken little type overlay because there's a political

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
reporter, Henny Penny, played by Sharon Stone.

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Ducky daddles.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,200
Wow.

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,520
Now that Henry is gone, ducky daddles is up for, he's Scott found something new.

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,200
I was just going to throw Jason out for the new ducky daddles.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,760
Just, you know, in case you're doing this again, everything's getting rebooted.

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,280
And we may find a new ducky daddles soon and it should be Jason.

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,600
Beware the ducky daddles curse though.

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
Everyone who plays ducky daddles ends up dying at a hundred.

76
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,400
That's right.

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,200
My clapping of excitement was seeing the casting of Foxy Loxy.

78
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,640
Foxy Loxy was played by Johnny Cochran.

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,520
Oh my God.

80
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,040
Really?

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,520
Wow.

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,120
Why have we not talked about whatever the fuck this is?

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,640
Ducky daddles, Foxy Loxy.

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,040
Is this on Max?

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,280
Has this been booted on Max?

86
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
Is it taxed right off?

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,320
You know?

88
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah, I don't know Zezlov's plans with the franchise.

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,560
Johnny L.

90
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,400
Cochran Jr.

91
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,080
as Foxy Woxy?

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,120
Is Foxy Woxy different than Foxy Loxy?

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,120
Oh wait.

94
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,600
Oh my God.

95
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,840
And this, this is from the AV.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,640
This is AV Club about ducky daddles about Kissinger.

97
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,840
But apparently in the 1999 on a single season sitcom Brothers

98
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,160
Keeper, he played himself as a guest on Bill Mars, Politically Incorrect.

99
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,320
Wow.

100
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,600
Yeah.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
It all came together.

102
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,040
Yeah.

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,720
How about that?

104
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,360
Oh man.

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,720
Of course, of course they would want, that's a perfect.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,760
Brothers Keeper.

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
Do we know what that is?

108
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
That's the kind of thing.

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,520
Well, would the listeners be delighted by or terribly offended by an episode about

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,160
the acting work of Henry Kissinger?

111
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,960
It's kind of making fun of them.

112
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,240
Yeah.

113
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,680
Bad guy.

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,160
You die.

115
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,920
It sounds like a roller coaster ride.

116
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,400
Uh huh.

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,960
Right?

118
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,440
Right?

119
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
That's your, your tying it back.

120
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,000
That's my justification.

121
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,320
Yeah.

122
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,200
Look, you do enough improv classes.

123
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,760
They really drill justification into your head.

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
And eventually you realize that justification can be very thin.

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,800
Like Kissinger's justification for the invasion and bombing of the many nations.

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,320
Oh yeah.

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,840
Yeah.

128
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,480
They're very thin justification.

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,480
Um, first, let me touch on what we're doing and my kind of biblical

130
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,560
intro was, is based on the, the, uh, the script and the copy for these events.

131
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,840
Disney's candlelight processionals.

132
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,240
Uh, I mean, I guess you'd call it the Disneyland or the Disney world or Epcot,

133
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,320
or depending on, on where you are.

134
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,680
But the, the short, uh, Cliff notes version of this is that, uh, this has been

135
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,800
a tradition in Disneyland and then carried over to Disney world since the fifties.

136
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,400
That there is a, a big, uh, performance with, uh, choirs and an orchestra and a

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,640
bit, a big, uh, procession down main street that is all a, a big Christmas

138
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,240
celebration and the centerpiece of it is a reading of the nativity story involving

139
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,640
celebrity narrators.

140
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,960
And this is a thing I feel like either you pay a lot of attention to the parks,

141
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
to the Disney parks and the park stuff.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,760
And you're very aware of this or you, you heard what I just said and went, what

143
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,480
they do a, like a religious ceremony almost at the Disney parks.

144
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,440
I would say almost, I mean, pretty, some people may not know this happens at all.

145
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,560
And I, it's only been faint in my head.

146
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Aaron didn't know.

147
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,520
Yeah.

148
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,240
This is, um, I'm going to say it's a little weird, right?

149
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,360
For a company that avoids religion pretty much at every turn, you just

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,200
then turn around and do, this is basically a Protestant Christmas Eve service for

151
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,520
two nights at Disneyland and then weeks and weeks at Disney world.

152
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,240
I didn't realize how much they did.

153
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,200
It's a, it's a big celebration.

154
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,840
Also incredibly star studded.

155
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,440
So I just, one, I will pick this year.

156
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,680
Brendan Fraser is doing a night.

157
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,720
He's one of the best actor Oscar.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,520
Yeah, it's not even, and I, cause in my head, what I lodged in the back of my

159
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,480
head was that, oh yeah, they used to do this thing with kind of actors that my

160
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,680
mom likes, like Rock Hudson and Howard Kiel.

161
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,600
Sure.

162
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,560
Maybe they do like a smaller version of it today?

163
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,400
Question mark cut to we prep for this.

164
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
No, they do.

165
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,840
It's as big as it ever was bigger in Epcot, giant relevant stars who appear.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Dare I say some of them more relevant than some of the bands that

167
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
play at eat to the beat.

168
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, hold on a minute.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,400
Now I'm being sacrilegious.

170
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,680
Now I'm offended.

171
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,680
My religion has been offended.

172
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,000
My brain is hard, like fighting with each other of like, who's more relevant,

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,640
the Baja men or Ann Margaret, you know, who we wish the best.

174
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,840
It was supposed to do two nights this year only did one because of like a

175
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,760
health concern, I think the second day.

176
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,440
That Ann Margaret is doing anything these days is remarkable.

177
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,760
I wanted to say the quick version of all that.

178
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,360
Just because right before we get things cooking, there's something else I wanted

179
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,040
to bring up this.

180
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,720
There's been like kind of a brain, a brain worm that I have, and I don't think I can

181
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,600
get rid of the worm unless I pass it to you guys and then the listeners.

182
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,640
But you will, you'll understand why this is related when I'm about to say, because

183
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,640
what we're talking about today, the candlelight processional kind of a rare

184
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,200
intersection of theme parks and Christianity.

185
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,400
Doesn't happen a lot, as you noted, sort of weird.

186
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,920
Maybe the only one in the Disney world, the Disney parks world.

187
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,680
Yeah, usually more of a secular Christmas.

188
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, very much so.

189
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,720
But of course, we have done episodes for many years about theme parks

190
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
that intersect with Christianity.

191
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,080
And this is this we typically do on Easter week.

192
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,800
We've covered a number of these extremely unpleasant places.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,120
And I'm going to take us back to maybe the most unpleasant one.

194
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,240
Maybe this is a run.

195
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,240
This is a candidate, I would say, for the most unpleasant thing

196
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,880
we've ever talked about on the show.

197
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,320
And that is Ken Ham's Ark encounter.

198
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,560
Yes, of course.

199
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,040
Do you either don't say if you know, do you have any idea

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,360
why I'd be bringing up the Ark encounter right now?

201
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
I mean, I thought it was going to be Holy Land experience,

202
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
which is being progressively bold.

203
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
It was. Yes. Yeah.

204
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
We're becoming a health care center of some kind.

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
I there's something with Ark encounter.

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,880
You know, you've maybe caught it.

207
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,720
Is there a fudge development?

208
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,200
Is there another video? I wish I could tell you I was bringing it up

209
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,280
because they have a great new kind of fudge.

210
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,400
And now they're selling it in California stores.

211
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,720
And you don't even need to go be on the bad or to get the fudge.

212
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,480
What is this? I just heard Ken Ham's name, too.

213
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,800
Yeah, it's been around.

214
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,200
You'll figure out why. You will figure out why.

215
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,840
Let me let me let me get to get through it.

216
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,040
If you don't remember, this is this creationist

217
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,480
Noah's Ark exhibit in Kentucky.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
They've recreated the biblical dimensions of Noah's Ark.

219
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,600
And it kind of exists to do a lot of that.

220
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,760
It's like, see, that's exactly what it was in the Bible.

221
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,120
And exactly what's in the Bible is what you should everyone should study

222
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,760
and pay attention to, such as that, you know, there's only been around

223
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,760
for 5000 years and there were dinosaurs on Noah's Ark.

224
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,000
It's run by this this guy, Ken Ham, maybe the least charismatic man.

225
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,520
Very uncarismatic.

226
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,600
Basically, in 20, it was finished in 2016.

227
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,200
In 2014, they lobbied to get tax breaks to build the Ark.

228
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
And they did so successfully.

229
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,880
This was approved and the state of Kentucky was going to pay for the Ark.

230
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,000
Then the governor of Kentucky, a Democrat, revoked and overturned

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,800
the decision, said, wait a minute, I've seen how this is coming together.

232
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
And this is much more of a religious institution.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,480
We have separation of church and state.

234
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,520
And I don't think the taxpayers should be paying for this thing

235
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,160
with a very specific religious agenda.

236
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,000
Not happening. We're not paying for the Ark.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,160
Classic demon rat behavior.

238
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes. A traitor.

239
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,200
So what does Ken Ham do?

240
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,760
Well, Ken Ham reaches out to an organization called Freedom Guard,

241
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,320
which is run by the CEO and chief counsel of Freedom Guard.

242
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,160
Is this really pasty, smarmy lawyer guy?

243
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
Real weasel, right?

244
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,000
And I know this because you can watch a long video, a 24 minute video.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
That's a conversation between this lawyer and Ken Ham.

246
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,000
And they talk about why Kentucky must build and pay for the Ark.

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,280
We have to, you know, it's the First Amendment dictates that they must.

248
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,800
And they cite freedom of religion and free exercise of religion

249
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,360
and freedom of speech in this great nation of America.

250
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,600
And they badgered and lobbied and spent a lot of money

251
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,000
to get this thing overturned, to get Kentucky to pay for the Ark.

252
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,280
They were successful.

253
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,600
They did it not only to Kentucky pay for the Ark,

254
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,240
but Kentucky taxpayers had to pay for Ken Ham's legal fees.

255
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,640
Oh, my God. This guy didn't pay.

256
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,760
He hasn't paid a cent for any of this.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Why have I brought this up?

258
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,480
And why did I not name the smarmy lawyer man?

259
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,120
You may have heard his name in the recent past because that lobbyist,

260
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
Ken Ham's pasty, weird lawyer,

261
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,880
is named Mike Johnson.

262
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,120
That is the newly appointed speaker of the House,

263
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,720
the leader of the US House of Representatives.

264
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,240
After all that shit with all the who's the guy McCarthy and McCarthy,

265
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,560
who gets ousted and they tried all those other people and none of them were.

266
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,400
And then suddenly it landed on all right, it's going to be Mike Johnson.

267
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,800
Who the hell is Mike Johnson?

268
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,960
Well, Mike Johnson is a lobbyist for a bad Ark.

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,600
Oh, my God. Wow.

270
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,680
He's a guy that was a representative is now run by a guy

271
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,480
who thinks Ken Ham is tolerable to be around.

272
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
I would say more than 24 minutes.

273
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes. The pornography accountability guy.

274
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes. The guy with the kiss.

275
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,960
When his son, they had a pact that they would look at each other's

276
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,200
Internet histories. I believe is how it played out.

277
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,080
They promised and wouldn't look at pornography and they could look at each

278
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,320
other's browser history to check.

279
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,080
This is so you've ever wanted to make sure your dad to see the web.

280
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,600
Every website, your dad is going to.

281
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,840
Now, what the speaker of the House apparently

282
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,120
doesn't quite know about private browsing windows.

283
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,200
But, you know, I it's that sounds complicated.

284
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,760
I must be I must involve a massive amount of code.

285
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,640
Easier way is to get tied to like a buzzer system with your kid.

286
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,880
Congresspeople are often defeated by very basic technology functionality.

287
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,400
Well, this wasn't Ted Cruz.

288
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,760
Like he was searching for porn, but he ended up just putting it into Twitter.

289
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,520
Yeah. Is that what it was?

290
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,840
And that was on September 11th. Yeah.

291
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,320
I forget what it was. It was.

292
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,160
I forget what he was searching for.

293
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,960
It was on September 11th.

294
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,440
Can Jason I do a quick improv here?

295
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,440
It's playing father and son.

296
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,600
Sure. Oh, well, and this, Jason, I want you to approach me.

297
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,560
Because you found something on my computer that is a little bit untoward.

298
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,280
And I'd like you to confront me about it.

299
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,080
And it's also Christmas Day.

300
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,920
Hey, Dad, thanks for the PlayStation five.

301
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,520
Oh, yeah, of course. Merry Christmas, son.

302
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,640
Merry Christmas to you, Dad.

303
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,160
I found these JPEGs of Mia Khalifa

304
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
on your on your desktop, on your gateway.

305
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,280
Oh, I know who it is.

306
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,840
I know who it is.

307
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
You know who it is.

308
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,000
I know who it is. Yeah.

309
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,480
That's not fair.

310
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,720
No, you're right. You're right.

311
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,120
You took my Del away.

312
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,640
I took your Del away because I found JPEGs of Jenna Jamison on your.

313
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,800
My favorite. Yeah.

314
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,760
Yeah, you said you were my favorite special lady.

315
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
Yeah. No, you're right.

316
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,720
And I I have let you down, son.

317
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,720
Did you delete all the JPEGs of Mia Khalifa?

318
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,960
Well, I put them.

319
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,480
I deleted them from your computer, but I put them on this thumb drive

320
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,960
so that I never forget how you disappointed me.

321
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,440
OK, what are you doing with the drive?

322
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,240
And then I copy the thumb drive to another thumb drive.

323
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,680
Wait, what? And I

324
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,520
I gave all my buddies the thumb drives.

325
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,160
OK, now you're spreading the porn.

326
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
You're putting your pornography around.

327
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
Now, this is unchristian of you.

328
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
Well, I guess you could call it that.

329
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
I yes, I could call it that.

330
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,120
But but I think that you should.

331
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,280
I called accountability, Dad.

332
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
OK, well, that's true.

333
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,240
I'm Speaker of the House, by the way.

334
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,160
And I'm going to tell the American people what's happened here today.

335
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,520
Thank you for keeping me accountable.

336
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,760
Please pass more tax cuts for a stat so we can buy more PlayStation 5.

337
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm way ahead of you. OK.

338
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Emergency press conference called in Congress on Christmas Day.

339
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,240
We're told that we've seen transcripts of the remarks,

340
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,040
and it seems that Mike Johnson is going to admit to looking at Mia Khalifa.

341
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes, JPEG's JPEG.

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm sorry. I've got to have administered a correction.

343
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,840
It was JPEG's. It was JPEG.

344
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,160
They are not moving.

345
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,680
And we're also probably probably makes the file small enough to fit onto a thumb drive.

346
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:37,280
We're also hearing reports that his son's friends now have thumb drives full of JPEG's.

347
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,560
We've managed to all outlets have attained copies of these thumb drives.

348
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,760
All we had to do was ask the son and they were readily provided.

349
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,600
Instantly copied to 200 major media outlets.

350
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,000
You really. OK. End of the end of that.

351
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,520
I'm sorry. It's a great scene that you're probably right.

352
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,000
He is probably looking at JPEG's.

353
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,880
That is a really good poll, I think.

354
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,720
Yeah, that seems right for like this type of guy.

355
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,240
It's not it's not.

356
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,760
He's not as savvy as Dean Norris, who was looking for sex.

357
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,880
Yes, another famous like Twitter accidental tweet.

358
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,520
That was just like probably a search meant for Google.

359
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah. Sex GIFs.

360
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
We need to see conflating those things.

361
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,840
I'm sorry. It was the Ted Cruz liked a pornographic tweet on 9 11.

362
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
He didn't know. OK.

363
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,200
I think he's done accidental tweeting of other stuff like passwords. Right.

364
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,400
But in this case, it was you could see it just blur.

365
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,200
That's right. It was from an account called Sexual Posts, two L's and sexual.

366
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,880
And he liked it on 9 11.

367
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,000
And then he said the wall, right?

368
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,880
Like looking. Yeah. An intern.

369
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,840
He said an intern did someone just wasn't on his all.

370
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,960
You got to be careful to be on your all.

371
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,600
Oh, boy. Well, politicians are our betters.

372
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
Anyway, I was excited by that.

373
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,040
I heard this info, by the way, on QAnon anonymous to grip podcast.

374
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,120
But I like I'm like, I need to make sure that our listeners are aware.

375
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,400
Maybe there'll be an arc encounter like two that will be in Washington, D.C.

376
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Oh, I hope so, because like he's obviously a fan of the project.

377
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,240
So who knows what we'll get to that a little sort around the world.

378
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,600
What do you want?

379
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,680
But the Museum of the Bible.

380
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,720
Did anyone encounter this looking into flying theaters?

381
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,200
No. Well, we're many steps ahead.

382
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
I don't know. Yeah.

383
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, yeah.

384
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,320
Yeah, there's a flying theater

385
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,000
that zooms around a kind of PlayStation three level,

386
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,920
D.C. PlayStation three graphics level, D.C.

387
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,680
that finds all the quotes of scripture around historic buildings

388
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,560
and monuments in D.C.

389
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,520
Oh, my God. We got to do that for Easter this year.

390
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,240
Maybe or next year. Oh, maybe. Yeah.

391
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,480
Could be. Well, I was going to say, I think I think fake Soren's as its own.

392
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

393
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
That off as its own.

394
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,080
Let's let's soak these Soren's for as many episodes as they're worth.

395
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,640
Yeah. Anyway, now that now that that is out,

396
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,080
you know, actually, that that kind of shows you the spectrum to me,

397
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,600
that Arc Encounter is the worst possible

398
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,040
intersection of faith and theme park.

399
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,040
This is like fine, I think.

400
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,080
Well, it's not hurting anybody.

401
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,560
It's a leftover thing.

402
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,320
Like, obviously, if Disney was starting new today, this wouldn't have had

403
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,840
like they wouldn't be doing this version of the show, I don't think.

404
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,440
And you can tell. I believe that at least in Epcot,

405
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,320
one of the first things that the celebrity narrator says

406
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,800
when they arrive at the microphone is, did you know that Walt Disney, everyone?

407
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,080
OK, Walt Disney started this tradition in the 50s.

408
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,760
And there's many things at these parks that are traditions that Walt Disney started.

409
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,000
And we wouldn't stop doing the traditions.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,200
Now, would we? Just because one of them is related to faith

411
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,600
and we're in kind of a divided and battle to Walt.

412
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,000
Just so when you see all this, think of Walt.

413
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,680
Yeah, I think this I believe I saw pictures of the like,

414
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,560
I think this crowd kind of hit the opening night of the

415
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,160
oh, I'm going to get it wrong at the Dome.

416
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,640
Lumosity, the story of us.

417
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,560
Luminosity, luminous, that's it.

418
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,920
Luminous, the story of us is the new Epcot show.

419
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,360
OK, show. And the crowds for that and the crowds for this kind of like

420
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
intersected at one point.

421
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,680
The other night.

422
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,120
So very dangerous.

423
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,840
Yeah, it sounds like they're going to be a battle or some kind.

424
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,840
It's like the games of New York meeting.

425
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,040
We were watching Thanksgiving.

426
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,400
We were watching or not.

427
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,320
I just say Thanksgiving.

428
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,760
I meant the week after Thanksgiving, the Charlie Brown Christmas.

429
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
And I haven't seen it in a few years.

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,280
And like Linus just does the Bible like he does a big religious speech.

431
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,400
And you're like, yeah, I don't know.

432
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,800
It's it's like some of the stuff where it was like if this was made today,

433
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't think this is going in there.

434
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,160
Or it could, I suppose.

435
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,360
But it just was it was just much more.

436
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,600
It was much more around at the time.

437
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,280
Yeah. Whether a person was actually.

438
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,720
I think there's certain stories that kind of cross from Christianity

439
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,680
into like the secular mainstream just from being so you bet.

440
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,440
The story of Christmas,

441
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,040
Noah's Ark, Canaanite, but like stuff just becomes.

442
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,760
Yeah, sure.

443
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,680
It doesn't feel as like it's tied to like a strong belief system.

444
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,880
Yeah. It's like a story here.

445
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,200
It should really be a Cain and Abel stunt show in a theme park somewhere.

446
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah.

447
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,160
It's one of the classic tales.

448
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,040
Yeah. Kill each other. Yeah.

449
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,480
But I think you see the sitcoms even, you know,

450
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,680
the first few decades of sitcoms on TV, there were a lot more episodes,

451
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,200
even up to The Simpsons with Reverend Reverend Lovejoy and Mrs.

452
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
Lovejoy. The Simpsons went to.

453
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,360
I always laughed when The Simpsons went to church because it reminded me

454
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,880
of our church, like we were Presbyterian, but it was a very chill.

455
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,240
It wasn't like the Cuckoo Calvinists like

456
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,360
or the Cuckoo Christians of student 16.

457
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,680
You went into like Trump or something there.

458
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

459
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,040
That had an arm gesture that was very, you know, actually,

460
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,160
you know what it reminded me of?

461
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,640
That was like Jason just suddenly became Paul Schaefer.

462
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,720
The Cuckoo Calvinists.

463
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,320
It was a lot more hip control.

465
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,840
Maybe you're good or bad when you're bored.

466
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,440
So, yeah, it's weird that it's happening, but it's also like, yeah,

467
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,320
that's a lot of versions of this happening.

468
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,640
Other places that it's like sort of grand.

469
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
It's grandfathered in.

470
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Yes, you're not going to.

471
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,760
I don't think there's going to be a Nativity celebration, an epic universe.

472
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,560
Maybe, I don't know.

473
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,120
Like where the epic universe where Mario and Frankenstein and Christ all

474
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,080
share a space and have a great time.

475
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,880
Bowser, Bowser Junior is born and they plant him in a manger made of mushrooms.

476
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,200
I don't know.

477
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,400
He celebrates with Bowser celebrates with a big like fire breath to the sky.

478
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,720
Right.

479
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,080
All your friends at how to train your dragon land will tell you,

480
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,560
like, check out the new Stella Nova Hotel,

481
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,720
but don't be spilling your seed when you get over there.

482
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,920
So be still.

483
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,360
No, no. Oh, wow.

484
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,320
Wait a minute. I got I got lost in there.

485
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,360
You also dropped the name of a hotel somewhere in there.

486
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,120
Oh, yeah.

487
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,200
Stella Nova is one of the two.

488
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,400
Like hell of a way to find out on the way to something about spilling seeds.

489
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,440
Two new hotels, Stella Nova and Luna.

490
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,360
Luna Nova.

491
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,280
Luminous.

492
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,440
No, no, no, no.

493
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,840
OK. Luna Nova.

494
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,760
The making of me is the making of me, not the story of us.

495
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,840
You're very close.

496
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,600
There's seed involved in that.

497
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,600
But that's you want to buy Avatar three isn't called the seed bearer anymore.

498
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,520
Well, no longer.

499
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,560
So there won't be seed spilling there.

500
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,240
No.

501
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,400
Stella Nova, though, the rooms there look like star cruiser rooms.

502
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,960
If you look, they look like this galactic star cruiser rooms.

503
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,960
But we like a little bit more inviting. Yes.

504
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,040
What's the theme?

505
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
Like space.

506
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,200
That's a space. They're baking a space hotel.

507
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,920
Yeah, but it's $100 a night.

508
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,880
And they're it's mostly a standard Lowe's hotel room.

509
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,280
But also, there's a space screen.

510
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,080
There is a space screen in the room.

511
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,720
But so it's not there's not a story to this hotel.

512
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,600
I don't know that.

513
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,560
Yeah, there's a story.

514
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,440
It's under $200 a night.

515
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,560
Wow. Yeah, I'd do it.

516
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,520
But Jason's back to the joke Jason was making.

517
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,800
Somebody said, you don't want to you shouldn't come in that hotel room.

518
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,360
Well, that's like there's a passages in the Bible about not spilling.

519
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
That's what that meant.

520
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,440
Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,520
It's about not shooting onto a wall.

522
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,760
Is that what you're saying?

523
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,480
That's in the Bible. Yeah.

524
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,760
Though thou shalt not fire onto thou's own ear,

525
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,720
thus creating a comical situation where your date thinks that it's hair gel

526
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,480
and puts it in her own hair.

527
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,920
They're telling you like, well, don't be sinful.

528
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,680
But also, people have to clean these rooms.

529
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,800
You know, what does the what are the Bible's thoughts on cleaning up your jizz?

530
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,760
That really religious people like don't know masturbating.

531
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,600
You know, right. OK.

532
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
No premarital sex.

533
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,960
You know, it's in the what does spilt seed mean?

534
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,880
So if you go to the arc, it just says to ejaculate.

535
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,080
If you. Nice.

536
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,920
So what is I was right.

537
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,000
I said, come with us. Yeah.

538
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760
So if you go to the arc encounter, you don't get to see the elephants.

539
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,040
I don't even want to finish that.

540
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,520
I'm sorry.

541
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm too dirty.

542
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,160
An elephant and a dinosaur.

543
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,080
This is one of the dirtier episodes and it's the religious.

544
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,160
It's the religious.

545
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,680
Extremely like

546
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,920
staid traditional thing.

547
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,480
But what else are we going to get?

548
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,440
My one cut this one comment, I feel like I get once or twice a year

549
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,600
where it's like Michael is so uptight, but he's saying dirty words.

550
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,800
Like somebody who like is like, oh, what is going on here?

551
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,040
I'm in a mood. I'm punchy today.

552
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,080
I don't know what to tell you.

553
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,480
Oh, you are that well, Mike,

554
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,880
totally on the drive over that he had a two thirds caffeine free

555
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,480
caffeinated coffee.

556
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
So there was a little bit of caffeine.

557
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,200
Huh? I didn't know you could do this in the Starbucks app.

558
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,840
You can select your caffeine level.

559
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,920
The shit you make people do with these fucking apps.

560
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,840
Well, it was in there.

561
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,320
I wasn't like a special order where I had to write it in a drop down.

562
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
One third caffeine.

563
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,960
What's the option?

564
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,280
What do you have to do?

565
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,480
It just says what do you want?

566
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,880
And you can put choose two thirds decaf and one third.

567
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,080
I actually just wanted half and half, which is you can do that at Dunkin.

568
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
All the all the places do it for you.

569
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
You don't want all the caffeine.

570
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,760
But you did it in thirds.

571
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Well, one of the options was two thirds decaffeinated coffee.

572
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,120
And I chose that one.

573
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,960
So it means I had a third of this cup, which I also added extra ice to

574
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,800
to get even less just because I wanted a little bit of a pick me up,

575
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,320
but not a not an extreme one.

576
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,920
You want to get picked all the way up?

577
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,680
I do not.

578
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Not up to the right hand of God.

579
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,320
Exactly.

580
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,240
But yeah, certainly that one third made me a little bit

581
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,040
work blue today.

582
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,440
That's you blame it on that.

583
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,120
Well, that's what it is.

584
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,760
Was blaming it on.

585
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,680
Uh huh. Uh huh.

586
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,040
Oh, well, it always comes back to Jason.

587
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,160
Well, that is what you were doing.

588
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,280
You brought up the coffee.

589
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm drinking a sugar free Red Bull.

590
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,520
So I'm like, you're really all the way up.

591
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:36,920
Yeah.

592
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,080
You're really turned up.

593
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,640
Yeah. Me and DJ Khaled were all the way up.

594
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,680
That's right.

595
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,840
They see part of the Disney family, the Disney Parks family.

596
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,560
That's correct.

597
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,200
Mm hmm.

598
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,600
Yeah, I watched the special that we were all of us were next to the tapings of

599
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,480
the weird thing they do now where you like the film to specials

600
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,880
and what you do a night special.

601
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,120
Oh, yeah. Special.

602
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,600
And they have to say to Billy Corrigan, all right, we'll see you in a month.

603
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,400
We'll see you back here in a month dressed the same way, decorated the same.

604
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,480
What is your turquoise and W.A.

605
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,200
hoodie? Your National Wrestling Company.

606
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,720
Did he play so what did he play like silver bells?

607
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,640
Yeah. Yeah.

608
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,040
Silver.

609
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,840
It was nuts.

610
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,520
It was crazy. I got to hear that.

611
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
I haven't heard it yet.

612
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,120
Billy Corrigan.

613
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,600
They have their own Christmas song, the original Christmas song too.

614
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,240
Has not done the Christmas or the candlelight processional.

615
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,120
No, no, no, no, no.

616
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,360
Not in that deep.

617
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,600
Yeah, but I think he would.

618
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,720
He's testing the waters.

619
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,760
Yeah, he'll get there.

620
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,720
Well, let's talk about.

621
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,480
I mean, I think I kind of said dry history.

622
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,600
I think there were carolers like Dickensian carolers

623
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,800
in Disneyland from the first Christmas at Disneyland.

624
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,520
But and it was but it was more of a sporadic, you know, they pop around

625
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,560
this 12 of them and then it grew and grew and became a bigger thing.

626
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,040
Charles Hurt from the USC School of Music.

627
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,240
See, we're saying facts.

628
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,000
Charles Hurt. H I R T.

629
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,240
H I R T. Yeah. Yes. Mr. Hurt.

630
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,880
The Hurt Walker, they called him.

631
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,120
Yeah, that's a really that's a good gym teacher name.

632
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,880
It's also a Batman villain, a Batman villain named Dr.

633
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,320
Hurt, which I made me think of that.

634
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,760
But is there really one of those?

635
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,880
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

636
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,840
Dr. Hurt in 1959.

637
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,240
I think this thing officially gels.

638
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,160
There was a version in 58 I read, but it was the full like big

639
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,600
like a couple hundred people in the 1950s.

640
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
OK. Or am I confusing?

641
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,640
Might have years wrong.

642
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,240
Who cares? At some point, it used to be in front of the castle

643
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,280
where you would expect a big major celebration to happen.

644
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,640
But like sight lines, there was something awkward about doing it

645
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,800
in front of the castle.

646
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,240
So it moved the other way.

647
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,760
Now there's a big processional from up towards the castle down Main Street.

648
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,920
And the event happens on the kind of terraced

649
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,200
steps of the Main Street train station.

650
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,040
Did you see the wall line about?

651
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,960
No. Why moving?

652
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,960
He wanted to be able to hear Christmas carols from his apartment over the firehouse.

653
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,520
Wow. Which I think is if you own the place, that's a reasonable request.

654
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
So he was he didn't even go out and watch the show.

655
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,080
He just wanted to hear it.

656
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,640
I guess so. I feel like he will watch some.

657
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
I mean, Dick Van Dyke.

658
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,520
I think the last one he attended was 65

659
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,400
and Dick Van Dyke, I think.

660
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,120
If you if you had five grilled cheeses on that hot plate,

661
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,480
you probably can't move so good.

662
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,640
You cannot leave a hot plate plugged in.

663
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,080
Oh, OK. Yeah. So five is pushing it.

664
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,480
So first of all, you can't leave because the apartment might burn down.

665
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,320
Like it's above the fire station.

666
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,040
So that helps. But then I don't think it's a working fire station.

667
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,000
So you're in trouble there.

668
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,360
But anyway, your five grilled cheese is in deep.

669
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,520
You just got to like, I'm just going to lie on my separate bed from my wife

670
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,320
in here in this little apartment that's full of doilies.

671
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,880
Oh, just all right through the window.

672
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,200
Oh, just I don't need to see.

673
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,080
I know what it looks like. I saw it.

674
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,600
You got to move the whole thing, though, because I can't hear it.

675
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,880
It's too soft.

676
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,840
I've been drinking Evan Williams since three p.m.

677
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,200
I'm going to get one or two songs before I doze off.

678
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,520
My the the work on my polo injury is going long today,

679
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,120
and I'm going to have to be in here for a longer amount of time.

680
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,640
And I need to hear the sweet sound of carolers.

681
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,040
I want to hear Jack Frost nipping at my nose as I sip

682
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,800
cutty sark in my old and comfortable armchair.

683
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,120
What was that reference?

684
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,320
Cutty sark scotch. Oh, OK.

685
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,560
It's like well scotch.

686
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,440
OK. Yeah. Cheap. Cheap.

687
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,600
Got it. Is cutty sark not good?

688
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,920
Is that right? I my memory, I feel like that was what people drank in college.

689
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,240
That's what people bought in college to try scotch.

690
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,320
OK. Oh, that's not you don't like just like a frat party is a rat.

691
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,520
No, no. Cutty sark, cutty sark pong.

692
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,440
That's if you're like pretending to be I'm like I'm becoming kind of a scotch guy.

693
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,040
I got this. It's called cutty sark.

694
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,800
I'm going to try some of it.

695
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,040
Anybody want me to crack open this cutty sark?

696
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,640
I think one of my roommates in college got a flask.

697
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,720
He bought a bottle of cutty sark and I was like, oh, this is this is vile.

698
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,560
Yeah, that's it.

699
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,120
And then all of these people kind of do their little fake swirl and their little show.

700
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,600
I'll put my pipe tobacco down and I'll try my cutty sark.

701
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,080
And then like, hmm, hmm.

702
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,440
The cutty sark, it's like a sark encounter, you would call it.

703
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,040
You know, oh, yeah, because of the ARK.

704
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,320
You understand that's how it's spelled.

705
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,160
It's a ship I learned just now.

706
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,240
That's where that's from. It's got a ship on the label.

707
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,240
Yeah, a sark encounter.

708
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,720
Yeah, it is there.

709
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,520
It sticks in my mind because in the movie Gone Baby Gone,

710
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,600
when the like uncle like breaks down and gives a lot of secrets away,

711
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,280
he like ambles up to the bar for the first time in years and goes like,

712
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,280
told boy on a shot of cutty.

713
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,400
And that line reading has stuck with me for years.

714
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,120
I've never seen that movie, actually.

715
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,400
So maybe that's why. Do that order somewhere.

716
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,960
See if they see if the bartender says, hey, gone baby gone.

717
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,360
Oh, yeah. Boilermaker. Oh, yeah, sure.

718
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,680
OK, so it's it's this big performance on the steps of the Main Street

719
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,360
train station. There's so many people involved in this to this day.

720
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,240
It is I discovered many, many choirs

721
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,120
that come from there, some of which are high schools and maybe younger than that.

722
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,320
And adult choir, it's like they bus in 50 choirs, I feel.

723
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,960
I can line them all up, mix them all together and an orchestra, too.

724
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,160
This is I'm watching a video.

725
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,960
They filmed one for the Disney Channel in the late 80s, and I'm watching it like,

726
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
are there one thousand participants in the show?

727
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,240
So many crazy. But the luckiest of all, the true the stars of the show,

728
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,160
it feels like, are the people in green robes who get to go on to

729
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,400
kind of a terrorist set of steps and form a human Christmas tree.

730
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,320
That's that's what is the centerpiece of the whole thing.

731
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,200
To be you get to be a tree.

732
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,040
Yes, that did not. I had to read that.

733
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,040
I did not know that that's what was happening when I saw the video.

734
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,480
Or at least I watched that one. What do you think it was?

735
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,040
I just thought they were being showcased and they were wearing green.

736
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,920
I didn't realize. Obviously, it makes a lot of sense.

737
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,600
You thought it was like the Olympics where you said the best ones

738
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,280
stand on the top step. Yeah, they were the top singers.

739
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,040
They were the top 20 of the year. Exactly.

740
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,440
So in the special green,

741
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,280
I watched almost a full John Stamos recent one of these.

742
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,000
Ah, a regular him and Neil Patrick Harris.

743
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,840
I feel like for a lot of years. Yeah.

744
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,560
Yeah. Well, let's talk narrators a little bit,

745
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,680
because that's I think what brings this thing.

746
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's certainly one of the things I knew about it.

747
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,440
And the list is definitely full of luminaries.

748
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,520
And it's got like big stars from the beginning.

749
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,680
Sometimes certainly a lot of years, it's like somebody you got to look up.

750
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,880
Were they on a soap opera or what were they?

751
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,080
But mixed in are some of the greatest actors of all time.

752
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,600
It's an unbelievable list if you start getting into them.

753
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,520
It was a guy named Dennis Morgan for the first four years at Disneyland.

754
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,880
Once they started doing the celebrity narrator. Right.

755
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,480
I don't know much about Dennis Morgan, but in sixty five, as Jason said,

756
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,200
Dick Van Dyke promoted promoting Mary Poppins.

757
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,400
I think it's almost crazy that he is still with us and that he was like

758
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,520
promoting the new movie Mary Poppins in nineteen sixty five.

759
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,640
And then he did it again like 40 years later or 50 years, like 2005.

760
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,120
I think he did it again and they've done it recently. Wow. Wow.

761
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,760
But then you start going through, you know, you got your Disney classics,

762
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,080
you get your Dean Jones. Yeah.

763
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,840
But then like Gregory Peck, Henry Fonda,

764
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,760
Cary Grant, John Wayne,

765
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,240
Charlton Heston did it.

766
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,200
There's a story about Charlton Heston where he did it in 1970.

767
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,320
And there it was storming a lot.

768
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,800
It might rain this whole thing out.

769
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,200
And somebody from Disneyland was, oh, this is from Charles Hurt.

770
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,080
Charles Hurt said Charlton Heston looked at me and said,

771
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,080
if I could part the Red Sea, then I could keep it from raining.

772
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,720
Oh, hell yes.

773
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,760
If I can do a fake thing in the movie,

774
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,920
then I can control weather right now.

775
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,800
We should note that a lot of these people were insane.

776
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,360
Oh, yeah. It was a great way to get insane old actors out of the house

777
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,280
for at least half an hour.

778
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,080
Let their wives get some time to themselves.

779
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,320
Jimmy Stewart did it.

780
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,080
Seventy five. A lot of Rock Hudson, a ton of Rock Hudson.

781
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,640
I was shocked that my mom had never heard of this event

782
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,800
until I was getting ready to do this,

783
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,280
because my my mom, very devout Catholic and at the time, very devout

784
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,440
Rock Hudson fan. Really? Yeah.

785
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,640
I loved Rock Hudson very much.

786
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,800
Looked up where he lived, I believe, when that information was.

787
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,360
Had a conversation with him as a young girl in his front yard.

788
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:39,680
And he was very nice and not bothered by the fact that two girls came to say hi.

789
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,080
Oh, wow. Yeah, fine.

790
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,000
I was I grew up with a lot of fond feelings for Rock Hudson in my house.

791
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,800
I can't have I ever watched a full Rock Hudson movie. Not necessarily.

792
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,600
I also know that the one that they filmed for the Disney Channel

793
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,760
had a guy, Howard Kiel.

794
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,880
Howard Kiel was on Dallas, which is why I knew him.

795
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,440
Like when I'm three years old, I feel like I knew who Howard Kiel was.

796
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,160
Less so now.

797
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,480
My dad played in a Howard Kiel Celebrity Golf Tournament.

798
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,480
And there's a picture of that that's been on

799
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,600
the wall of my childhood home ever since.

800
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,840
So Howard Kiel, I see his name a ton, but I don't know the full.

801
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,560
Howard Kiel, I believe in like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,

802
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,200
probably a lot of movie musicals that you like, Jason.

803
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,280
But you know, no Kiel feelings.

804
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,120
I don't have any Kiel feelings.

805
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,720
Obviously, Anne Margaret,

806
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,040
like I said, she didn't one this year

807
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,080
and then dropped out the second day.

808
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,000
She was replaced by a Florida

809
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,720
resident, I believe, Ashley Eckstein, the voice of Ahsoka.

810
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,600
But yeah, Anne Margaret, I of course, was reminded of the Bye Bye Birdie bookends.

811
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,560
I OK, I looked up, I was like, speaking Bye Bye Birdie, did Paul Lind ever do this?

812
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,600
I don't think so. OK.

813
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,240
I looked up Paul in Disneyland. I couldn't find anything.

814
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,480
I was just hoping, but I feel like he wasn't big, a big enough star.

815
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,200
To do this. But a lot of these things are not there's not like

816
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,800
you can't just find like look up, you know,

817
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,000
Carrie Grant. Hang on.

818
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,320
I don't think Paul in wasn't a big enough star.

819
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,080
Dean Jones is in it.

820
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,200
Well, but Dean was no Dean Jones.

821
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,760
I'm not saying quality wise.

822
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I'm just saying like Dean Jones starred in those Disney movies.

823
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,080
Movies for Disney and Paul and he, you know,

824
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,360
but Paul was also in Disney movies, was he not like what?

825
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,600
I don't think it's a level of star issue.

826
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,200
It might have been a conflict.

827
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,920
Might have. There's a there's a thousand reasons why Paul

828
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,800
went could have Grandpa Al Lewis wasn't in here either.

829
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
No, no.

830
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,200
I in my mind, he's a big enough star, but he I just think this is a

831
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,560
this is a big this is a big mountain to climb as far as like credits.

832
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,000
Can I jump to 2023 Disneyland?

833
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,600
Kind of a very funny choice with the context of 2023.

834
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,320
The narrator was Brie Larson,

835
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,040
who for days I had been completing that my head is Blake Lively.

836
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,280
And I was like, oh, Blake Lively, she has a bit.

837
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,640
I haven't seen her in a while.

838
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,720
Confusing the two, you mean? Confusing that too.

839
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,600
OK. And then I saw it was Brie Larson.

840
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,680
And I was like, oh, that.

841
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,760
So you just the name you were just imagining another blonde girl.

842
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,080
Yes, I was imagining another blonde white.

843
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,520
Blake is at the games with Taylor and watching Travis Kelsey.

844
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,640
And I'm sure she's got, you know, maybe helping out Brian.

845
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,840
She's married to Deadpool.

846
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
She's married to Mr.

847
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,640
Menmobile himself. That's your was your argument.

848
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,200
Just then Jason should know who Blake is because she's at the game.

849
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,520
And he said he she didn't know what she's been up to.

850
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,040
So I said that she's been at the games, the big game.

851
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,280
I've all seen the pictures from the games.

852
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,360
We all the three of us, we pay attention to the games.

853
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,480
We watched the games.

854
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,640
I mean, I look at the tap lights a little.

855
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,240
But Brie Larson, it's like, oh, OK, yeah, she was just in a big movie

856
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,720
that kind of flopped for Disney in a year.

857
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,040
But that's not saying much because a lot of the movies have flopped this year.

858
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,200
Yeah, there were more people in the choir and the orchestra

859
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
than who saw the marvels.

860
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,080
Hey, well, this ties some Marvel into in 84.

861
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,000
Joseph Campanella did it.

862
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
He's the voice of the lizard on Spider-Man, the animated series.

863
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,440
Well, I like that. Pretty good.

864
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,400
Yeah, that's pretty good.

865
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,680
Was Paul, I guess, Paul was a bigger was he a bigger star than I'm saying?

866
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,800
It's like Darren McGavin is he I would say they are exactly equivalent.

867
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,200
OK, what was his best?

868
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,160
We got to really see you trying to like position Paul in this like,

869
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,840
you know, it's kind of like a cult thing like me.

870
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,000
You know, you got to like, I don't know.

871
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,960
And know about your reference.

872
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,040
He was everywhere.

873
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,720
He was on Hollywood Squares.

874
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,200
Everyone watched that at the time.

875
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,720
John Forsythe did it.

876
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,800
I would say I would say, yeah, more famous than Paul.

877
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,880
I don't this is strange to me.

878
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,400
I think Paul and was absolutely equal, if not bigger than many of these stars.

879
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,160
He applied to do it.

880
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,200
And Walt said, who are you?

881
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,360
And then shut the door on his face.

882
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,160
And he fell all the way down the stairs from Walt's apartment.

883
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,040
And he wanted.

884
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,520
He did.

885
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,280
Wow.

886
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,920
William, why, Walt, why anybody else who was William Frawley dead

887
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,960
by the time this started?

888
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,840
What year did William Frawley die?

889
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,240
Bill Frawley, as you know, he was alive for some of it.

890
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,480
But maybe the, you know, so fucked up on Sark.

891
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,040
He couldn't get through the full narration.

892
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,040
Yeah.

893
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,720
Anyone from I Love Lucy?

894
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,600
I don't think so.

895
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
I never saw Lucio Ball listed anywhere here.

896
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,240
Or Desi Arnaz.

897
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,040
I don't believe so.

898
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,000
But you got big franchises represented.

899
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,880
Dallas with Howard Keele.

900
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,320
Yeah.

901
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,680
Charlie's Angels with John Forsythe.

902
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,800
Coach with Craig T.

903
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,520
Nelson. Big star.

904
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,880
Elliot Gould did it.

905
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,240
At Esnur.

906
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
I'm very excited about it.

907
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,280
At Esnur doing it.

908
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,200
Yeah.

909
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,320
I assume that's the only Mary Tyler Moore show cast member.

910
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,240
Yeah, I didn't see Mary on the list.

911
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,800
Ted Knight doing the Candlelight processional would be awesome.

912
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,480
Yeah.

913
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,440
But didn't happen.

914
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,480
Wasn't a big enough star.

915
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,560
Wasn't it?

916
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,600
He was in Caddyshack.

917
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,920
Mary Tyler Moore.

918
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,200
Don Knotts never did it, I don't think.

919
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,200
That's too silly.

920
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,240
Yeah, too ridiculous.

921
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,440
Yeah, now I had to make a mockery of it.

922
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,720
Knotts and Rittkos, no way.

923
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,200
What?

924
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Don't say a big old star up in the sky.

925
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,280
It would have been so good though.

926
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,160
He puts a twist on it.

927
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,040
He would have focused it.

928
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,480
He would have taken the whole manger thing

929
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,960
and made it about just the mule.

930
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,800
Yeah.

931
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,640
Was it?

932
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,520
He was in Disney.

933
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,160
Kicked Joseph right in the face, right in the noggin.

934
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,280
He was a Disney guy too though.

935
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,520
He was in those Disney movies.

936
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,360
So that is kind of surprising.

937
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,480
Oh, the Apple Dumpling Gang.

938
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,080
Yeah.

939
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,320
Who are you arguing to?

940
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,440
None of us set up the event.

941
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,760
I'm mad.

942
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,600
I'm upset.

943
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,440
You don't put Knotts in there.

944
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,080
Knotts might have been, he was vacationing

945
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,880
in Weeki Wachee Springs.

946
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,720
Oh yeah, you're right.

947
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,120
All winter.

948
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,880
None of these people got paid.

949
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,720
You know what?

950
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,480
I bet Paul Lin and Don Knotts were doing paid work.

951
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,040
Yeah, well Don Knotts certainly worked

952
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,680
like he was in Three's Company.

953
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,080
He was in there and must have been busy.

954
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,280
He just must have been shooting over the Christmas tree.

955
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,080
You're just saying names of shows.

956
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,240
I think it just makes you happy to,

957
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,080
you know, you're married to a horror.

958
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,480
Of course it makes me happy to say these names.

959
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,600
Just blitz of filmography.

960
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,120
Here's where the problem is.

961
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,760
I came into this hoping that there was

962
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,120
such a list that I hadn't even unearthed yet

963
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,240
of all these people I like,

964
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,280
but I like that aren't just Cary Grant

965
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,120
or the biggest stars.

966
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,480
I like Cary Grant fine,

967
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,320
but then it was mostly,

968
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,680
it was bigger stars than I expected.

969
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,600
So you wait, so you, well first of all,

970
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,480
you're hopped up on one third caffeine.

971
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,760
And second of all, you're upset that we aren't,

972
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,400
as this list goes on, encountering all your favorite

973
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,240
sitcom pukes. Yeah.

974
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,200
I know, all my character actors

975
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,680
are nowhere to be found.

976
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,160
Gail Gordon isn't anywhere in the list.

977
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,920
I am out on this episode.

978
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,760
Think about how much better we're doing.

979
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,680
Other than now let me list all the shows

980
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,400
Gail Gordon was ever on.

981
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,480
One Lucy show.

982
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,320
Here's Lucy.

983
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,160
Here's Lucy.

984
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,680
Batman 66.

985
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,000
No, he was not on Batman.

986
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,840
What, never?

987
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,080
Gail Gordon was never on Batman.

988
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,760
We're just gonna list every,

989
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,960
you know who else never did it?

990
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,120
Caesar Romero.

991
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,520
Frank Gorshin.

992
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,640
Julie Newmar.

993
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,480
Keep him coming.

994
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,320
I think Eartha Kitt maybe did.

995
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,160
Eartha Kitt did do it.

996
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,000
Eartha Kitt did it.

997
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,080
Yes, I saw her.

998
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,920
I saw her.

999
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,760
We can all agree Eartha Kitt's name was on the list.

1000
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,720
We do all agree.

1001
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,320
We saw it written.

1002
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,520
All right, let's all calm down.

1003
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,200
She sang Santa Baby also.

1004
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,120
So that's like another Christmas connection.

1005
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,720
She did not sing about it when she was explaining

1006
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
the birth of the Christ child though.

1007
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,360
That would be a poor taste.

1008
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,200
Maybe.

1009
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,600
Heavenly baby.

1010
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,360
You were immaculately conceived.

1011
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Now you'll die on the cross.

1012
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,040
Marie Osmond.

1013
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,240
Mickey Rooney, the mixer did it.

1014
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,640
In 2002, James Earl Jones did it.

1015
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,040
I believe the last Magic Kingdom narrator, is that right?

1016
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,920
Before it moved to Epcot.

1017
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,760
Oh yeah, maybe.

1018
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,800
Like it got too popular.

1019
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,640
94 was moved.

1020
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,840
So that was all Disneyland list.

1021
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,520
Magic Kingdom, there's a lot of the same folks though.

1022
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,280
Hudson, Grant, Campanella.

1023
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,280
Perry Como is a Magic Kingdom exclusive.

1024
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,280
Lucky you in the year 1979 to get to see Perry Como perform.

1025
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,480
Nice.

1026
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,760
Pat Boone did both coasts.

1027
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,960
Did you see, was Walter Cronkite on both coasts?

1028
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,600
I saw him in Disney World listed.

1029
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,120
I don't know, 88 I see.

1030
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,520
Okay yeah, he was Disney,

1031
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,160
maybe Disney World exclusive was Cronkite.

1032
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,000
That would be good.

1033
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,920
That would be good voice.

1034
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,640
Yeah, perfect voice.

1035
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,640
Well in all of, Howard Kiel is a very like,

1036
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,880
just deep, I don't wanna go through,

1037
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,880
there's a word that's in my head,

1038
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,360
is it like stentorian, is that a wrong word?

1039
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,080
Authoritative.

1040
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,160
I mean yeah, but.

1041
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,480
You're like talking about the actual quality of his voice.

1042
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,320
Oh I see.

1043
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,140
Not just the.

1044
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,600
Yeah, stentorian is a word meaning loud and powerful.

1045
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,440
Yeah.

1046
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,240
It was I think a very good slot

1047
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,080
for the people with this authority.

1048
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:13,920
Right, right.

1049
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,760
So I guess yeah, there's some of the actors I'm talking about.

1050
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,160
People who sound like they could be the voice of God.

1051
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,000
Right. Yeah.

1052
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,520
Not Grandpa Al Lewis.

1053
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,280
Not Grandpa Al Lewis.

1054
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,560
And I say unto thee.

1055
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,400
Yeah.

1056
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,960
And it was child born.

1057
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,800
Christ.

1058
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,120
Can I break from reading lists of names and mention,

1059
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,280
I'm gonna, this is a little story

1060
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,720
that is gonna bridge two people who have both done

1061
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,000
the Candlelight Processional narration.

1062
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,400
Somebody who's done this event many times,

1063
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,400
did it this year, as Jason mentioned, John Stamos.

1064
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,320
I picked up John Stamos' book, not picked up like bought,

1065
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,040
I mean I picked it up at Barnes and Noble

1066
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,680
and leafed through it, just like skimmed through,

1067
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,240
just like beach ways, beach ways, beach ways,

1068
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,200
there we go, okay, Disneyland, Disneyland, Disneyland,

1069
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,720
there we go.

1070
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,960
And there's funny stories throughout,

1071
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,720
but the one that really stuck with me was about how,

1072
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,800
it was about like cracks that were forming

1073
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,800
in a relationship that Mr. Stamos was in in the late 80s.

1074
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Like a wedge was opened up due to Stamos'

1075
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,920
increasingly close friendship with Mike Love

1076
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,400
and the Beach Boys.

1077
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,520
Like genuinely it started to impact the relationship.

1078
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,720
There was a night where he ended up partying too hard.

1079
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,520
With Mike.

1080
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,720
Well no, not with Mike,

1081
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,520
because Mike's been sober for a long time.

1082
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,560
He's been angrily sober for a long time.

1083
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,040
But he just, he partied too hard with the Bikini Babes

1084
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,960
after shooting the Kokomo video.

1085
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,640
That's its own story, I might actually save that for later.

1086
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,680
But you know, now he's, he was dating a woman named Chelsea

1087
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,680
and Chelsea was upset about that.

1088
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,880
You mean, you went and got drunk with all these women.

1089
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,280
And then Stamos starts learning about

1090
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,760
and getting involved with something

1091
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,840
that's a big part of Mike Love's life,

1092
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,400
which is Transcendental Meditation.

1093
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,040
This is how, it's Transcendental Meditation

1094
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,720
that allows Mike Love to be the well-adjusted,

1095
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,800
normal man that he is.

1096
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,920
And this woman Chelsea he's dating

1097
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,960
kind of flew off the handle.

1098
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,200
I'm like, I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

1099
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,000
She's very Christian.

1100
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,360
So she said, this is almost borderline culty to me.

1101
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,920
It doesn't really square with my values.

1102
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,720
I just, I don't have a good feeling.

1103
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,200
So relationship not going anywhere good.

1104
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,120
And, but she's still around John

1105
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,760
and she's hanging out on the set of Full House.

1106
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,200
And then one day there is a visit

1107
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,480
from Full House cast member,

1108
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,160
Candice Cameron's brother, Kirk Cameron.

1109
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,160
And he arrives with all that Kirk Cameron charisma.

1110
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,680
She is smitten.

1111
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,960
She breaks up with John, gets with Kirk Cameron

1112
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,480
and she has been with him ever since.

1113
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,600
That is his wife, Chelsea Noble.

1114
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Been together since 1991.

1115
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,600
So were it not for Mike Love and Transcendental Meditation,

1116
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,400
that relationship could have gone.

1117
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,600
But she found her appropriate,

1118
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,640
extremely Christian partner, Kirk Cameron,

1119
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,040
who also did narration for the Candlelight Precessional.

1120
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,960
I didn't know about Mike Love

1121
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,760
and Transcendental Meditation

1122
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,240
because I've read about Transcendental Meditation

1123
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,360
a good amount too.

1124
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,720
And David Lynch talks about it a ton.

1125
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,520
Like I feel like it really chills David Lynch out

1126
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,480
and appears to not be working.

1127
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,320
Oh, Mike Love.

1128
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,640
Well, Mike Love hasn't had an outburst

1129
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,240
like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

1130
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,720
that publicly I guess since.

1131
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,560
That's true, yes.

1132
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,400
Yeah, well, yeah.

1133
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,200
And at that point he'd only been doing

1134
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,960
Transcendental Meditation for close to 20 years.

1135
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,800
20 years, yeah.

1136
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,400
It takes 30 to fully kick in.

1137
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,240
For it to really kick in.

1138
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,360
Yeah, yeah.

1139
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,320
There's a newer, new to me at least,

1140
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,960
Michael Cera talks about going,

1141
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,760
doing the TM classes and then going,

1142
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,320
being invited to meditate at David Lynch's house.

1143
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,800
And like he was very nervous,

1144
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,000
but then it was a very chill experience

1145
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,720
and David was very cool.

1146
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,200
Well, good for that.

1147
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,680
If Mike Love was, I'm not interested

1148
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,080
unless Mike Love's there.

1149
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,920
That's what I was thinking.

1150
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,240
Michael Cera, you've always been too chicken shit

1151
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,040
to get on stage with the Beach Boys.

1152
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,080
I challenge you to do Help Me Rhonda

1153
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,960
versus George Michael Bluth any day of the week.

1154
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,320
You wanna see the stinky hats.

1155
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,000
You wanna see the stinky bald hats.

1156
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You think it's stinky.

1157
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,960
You think Michael's hats are stinky?

1158
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,440
No, I think he's bald skinned.

1159
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,000
Yeah, well, he might have enough that he can rotate

1160
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,200
or like very rarely he wears them.

1161
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,120
I think it goes the other way.

1162
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,960
I think Mike Love, like somebody shows him a clip

1163
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,520
from Scott Pilgrim of Michael Cera playing a song,

1164
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,360
a sex bomb bomb song or whatever

1165
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,920
and he goes, this guy's gotta be in the band.

1166
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,080
Stamos is out.

1167
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,400
You think he's, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1168
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,800
Cera's in now.

1169
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,600
And then he wants to get Cera on the road.

1170
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,600
You see how the girls freak out for sex bomb.

1171
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,560
The girls freak out for Scott Pilgrim.

1172
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,200
He calls him Scott too, probably.

1173
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,120
He never learns his name.

1174
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,400
Scott.

1175
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,240
Michael, yeah, I love him.

1176
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,320
Joining us for fun, fun, fun.

1177
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,560
You know him, you love him.

1178
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,000
Scott Pilgrim is here. Scott Pilgrim.

1179
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I know Metric did a lot of the actual music,

1180
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,440
but he doesn't know that Metric did a lot of the music.

1181
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,280
No, no, Mike Love knows all of the Metric.

1182
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,840
In Jason's premise, he does know.

1183
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,680
Albums.

1184
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,640
He thinks the movie's real,

1185
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,720
but he is also aware of the band Metric.

1186
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

1187
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,400
Yeah, he doesn't know like Nirvana.

1188
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,880
He doesn't know the band Nirvana.

1189
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,000
No, he loves Metric.

1190
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,800
He loves Canada's fucked up, you know?

1191
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,400
He loves that band.

1192
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Okay, so it moves from Magic Kingdom to Epcot,

1193
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,680
to the Eat of the Beat stage.

1194
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,800
A place of worship.

1195
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,800
The place where we go to worship the song Fly

1196
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,240
and the song Who Let the Dogs Out,

1197
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,600
which is played by the Ba men,

1198
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,080
but I bet also Mark McGrath.

1199
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,200
I bet they do it too, yeah.

1200
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,480
Yeah, yeah.

1201
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,320
I bet.

1202
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,840
Everyone thinks we did this song.

1203
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,360
Mark McGrath looks at the setlist for everyone else

1204
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,560
who plays it, Eat of the Beat,

1205
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,680
and he takes their top song and they cover it, I bet.

1206
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,440
That's his method of doing.

1207
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,760
We're gonna knock them all out.

1208
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,960
Yeah.

1209
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,600
We'll be the only band by the time my plan plays out.

1210
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,080
We built this city by Sugar Ray.

1211
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,400
Everyone thinks we did, we built this city.

1212
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,840
And he'll do that, he's never done this narration,

1213
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,680
but he'll do that.

1214
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,400
Everyone thinks Sugar Ray wrote,

1215
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,200
it came upon a midnight clear.

1216
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,560
I mean, you know who you're getting, obviously.

1217
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,600
Epcot in the 2000s, you better bet Gary Sinise

1218
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,440
is around for this.

1219
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,280
Oh yeah.

1220
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,560
Oh, you wouldn't miss it for the world.

1221
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,960
Oh yeah.

1222
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,880
What other names are we seeing?

1223
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,920
Brian Dennehy popped in there.

1224
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,760
That's good, yeah.

1225
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,720
Andy McDowell.

1226
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,240
Dennis Franz.

1227
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,600
Dennis Franz, I really, that one,

1228
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,200
the idea of it really amuses me.

1229
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,760
I really like the idea.

1230
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,240
I don't know if he's in full NYPD Blue voice,

1231
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,680
but I picture that.

1232
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,040
He's dressed like Sopowitz.

1233
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,680
Well, he's British, you forget.

1234
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,840
He doesn't even, that's fully a character.

1235
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,840
But in character.

1236
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,160
Maybe Australian, I forget one of them.

1237
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,680
I've never seen a full NYPD Blue,

1238
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,360
but the joke on like what,

1239
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,720
The Simpsons or other shows was always that he was like,

1240
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,760
you could see his butt.

1241
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,160
They would show people's butt.

1242
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,120
I believe it affected both like when they could air

1243
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,480
the episode and maybe influence television ratings.

1244
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,920
But you could see Dennis Franz's butt on NYPD Blue.

1245
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,760
There's a shot of his ass.

1246
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,280
Yeah, his ass was visible on ABC at a certain point.

1247
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,440
That was a big joke that maybe people would make.

1248
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,600
Well, you guys want to see it?

1249
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
He's taking a shower.

1250
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,440
There it is.

1251
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,120
No one down, what's the point of it even?

1252
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:00,960
I kind of don't understand.

1253
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,160
It's a shower scene is what we're looking at.

1254
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,760
And then it just kind of goes down his body.

1255
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,600
There's his butt.

1256
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,440
It's a real, I mean, it's pretty, it's good,

1257
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,160
but it's like, it almost seems superfluous.

1258
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,000
Yeah.

1259
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,800
I don't really know why they had to.

1260
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,560
It's like almost a titillating shot.

1261
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,840
It's like, hey, look what we got.

1262
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,200
We got Franz's butt.

1263
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,400
Like take a look at it.

1264
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,720
I think there were the use of profanity on this show

1265
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,720
and like on broadcast TV.

1266
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,920
And that was ABC, right?

1267
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,920
That was on ABC.

1268
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,720
So Michael Eisner had to approve Dennis Franz's butt.

1269
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,040
And Eiger.

1270
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,880
Oh yeah.

1271
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,720
Oh and Eiger was working at ABC.

1272
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,560
Yeah.

1273
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,400
You're right, you're right.

1274
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,560
This was what, these were the flames they were forged in.

1275
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,080
It's why they're such powerful leaders.

1276
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,520
They dealt with butt gate.

1277
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,400
Dad, I noticed that you, I was looking at your history

1278
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,160
and you were looking at, you looked up the GIF

1279
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,840
of Dennis Franz's butt.

1280
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,760
Oh, JPEGs, but yeah, they were JPEGs of Dennis Franz's butt.

1281
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,640
The gateway does not handle GIFs well.

1282
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,480
Okay, actually, well that's good.

1283
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,760
I was concerned that it was a GIF because in motion.

1284
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah, right, right, right.

1285
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,160
It's a little more scandalous.

1286
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,000
But nevermind, look at all the JPEGs you want.

1287
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,720
There were 100 JPEGs that would make up a GIF

1288
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,040
of the camera pan down to Dennis Franz's butt.

1289
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,880
Yeah, you're right.

1290
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,440
Mike Johnson just flips through them himself.

1291
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,480
Thank you son for keeping me honest.

1292
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,520
And that's, you have to take away my computer

1293
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,560
for a couple of weeks now.

1294
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,560
Thank you for, yeah.

1295
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,480
How's the election overturning going?

1296
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,880
It's going well, it's going well.

1297
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,720
Oh great, so it's gonna work out?

1298
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,480
Yes, it's gonna be good, it's gonna work.

1299
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,680
You're gonna make it so Trump can do five terms?

1300
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,880
I am going to do that, yes.

1301
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,480
Okay, well don't let this Franz butt distract you

1302
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,480
from the greater mission.

1303
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,760
Okay, thank you, thank you son.

1304
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,600
What else?

1305
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,720
Sigourney Weaver.

1306
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,160
That's cool, yeah.

1307
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,240
That's a huge get, I feel like.

1308
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,720
Sure, yeah.

1309
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,120
That's an authoritative voice.

1310
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,560
A bigger star than Paul and no doubt.

1311
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,480
In that, yeah, I mean I was telling you not to put him down

1312
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,880
but in this case I would say Sigourney's a bigger.

1313
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,440
I feel like there weren't a lot of women for a long time.

1314
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,400
Yeah, I mean certainly it's white guy heavy

1315
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,720
for the first 40 years or whatever.

1316
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,920
Yeah, as I look at it, I think the first woman

1317
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,880
was Pat Boone's wife.

1318
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,240
And she's accompanied by Pat Boone.

1319
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,560
The first solo woman, actually this is kind of interesting,

1320
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,280
the first solo woman ever at Disneyland.

1321
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,800
Okay, wait, Felicia Rashad had done it in Disney World

1322
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,160
but first solo woman in Disneyland, 96, Mary Hart.

1323
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,000
Wow.

1324
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,040
Women as pioneer, Mary Hart.

1325
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,720
Hey, 2009 Epcot Isabella Rossellini,

1326
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,480
former partner of David Lynch.

1327
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,880
Oh, okay.

1328
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,800
I forgot that.

1329
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,320
That's a good get too.

1330
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,160
Oh actually, and you know what,

1331
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,720
actually first woman maybe ever to do it solo,

1332
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,960
Paula Zahn.

1333
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,240
Why no Annette Funichella,

1334
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,000
was Annette Funichella ever in there?

1335
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,960
I didn't see that at first glance or third glance.

1336
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,960
Too sweet and bubbly to be the scary voice of God.

1337
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,800
Who decides now?

1338
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,400
Who do you think, there's a board that decides

1339
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,360
who has the gravitas to do it maybe.

1340
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,920
I don't know if it's a board but maybe.

1341
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,960
Maybe one person.

1342
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,560
But I feel like we've also gotten off,

1343
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,680
I think Annette could do it now.

1344
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,600
Right, right, now it's a little bit more diverse

1345
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,840
in all areas.

1346
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:23,000
At the, before the qualification,

1347
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,600
it was just like a Disney, Charles Hurt went

1348
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,600
and drank Cuddy Sark at the bar at Sportsman's Lodge

1349
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,680
and he waited to see what character actor

1350
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,640
was there until closing.

1351
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,440
Which one had to be shaken awake.

1352
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,120
That's a bit of a drive,

1353
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,440
Sportsman's Lodge in Disneyland.

1354
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,640
Yeah, I wonder, I wonder who,

1355
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,080
yeah back then what was the,

1356
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,800
it was probably Walt himself at the time

1357
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,080
but now I wonder who's making the call.

1358
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,400
Maybe drinking, but yeah.

1359
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,240
Here's another question.

1360
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,240
You don't think Sterling K. Brown is getting

1361
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,760
shaken out of a stupor at the boardwalk

1362
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,440
at African Dab Bar, like.

1363
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,400
No, leave that to us.

1364
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,240
That's our job.

1365
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,480
Oh, okay.

1366
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,520
Is this one of those where you get a free trip?

1367
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes. Is that what happens?

1368
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,880
I know. It's like,

1369
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,800
you come down Walter Cronkite, you bring your family,

1370
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,000
we put you up a Grand Floridian,

1371
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,760
or when was that, 88, so before,

1372
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,520
whatever the top place was.

1373
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,680
Probably that's like,

1374
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,600
I don't, cause there's no payment I assume,

1375
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,720
but it's like, this is prestigious

1376
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,960
and your family gets a free trip.

1377
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,520
I would assume that's what's going on.

1378
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,680
I just wonder like how many days.

1379
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,760
I'm always interested in the details of that.

1380
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,960
Has it changed over the years?

1381
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,440
This is not something that's public.

1382
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,320
I don't know that we ever will have access to this,

1383
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,600
but this has to still happen.

1384
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,240
You should be able to be there

1385
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,240
for the full 25 days of Christmas.

1386
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,080
I agree with that.

1387
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,200
That would be in my contract.

1388
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,640
25 days.

1389
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,080
The full, the start of the processional

1390
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,320
to the end of the processional,

1391
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,200
like they all stay in one hotel building.

1392
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,760
It's like a big dorm.

1393
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,080
Oh, and everybody's doing it.

1394
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,360
All the wires.

1395
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,960
Ann Margaret is next to Sterling K. Brown,

1396
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,480
and then Brendan Fraser is a few doors down,

1397
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,320
and Chrissy Metz is, you know.

1398
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,600
I'm heading to Fatone's room.

1399
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,000
He's got the lagoon view.

1400
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I like the idea that it's like a bottle of Cuddy's.

1401
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,840
Sorry.

1402
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,360
It's like a big brother house maybe

1403
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,800
where they all live in one house together.

1404
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,880
All the narrators.

1405
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,120
What is his name?

1406
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,040
Bart Millard, is that his name?

1407
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,840
The Christian rocker has done it a few times.

1408
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
I don't think.

1409
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,920
He's a problem.

1410
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,040
He's the party boy. Bart Millard.

1411
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,880
I've never heard that name.

1412
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,680
From the band Mercy Me, the Christian rock band.

1413
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,760
Oh, I've heard of Mercy Me.

1414
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,200
Okay.

1415
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,760
Bart Millard, wow.

1416
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,800
Bart Millard.

1417
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,720
That sounds fake.

1418
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,240
Keep your eyes on Millard.

1419
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,520
Bart Millard.

1420
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,480
He's gonna trash his hotel room,

1421
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,040
and then plead, no Mercy Me, please.

1422
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,600
Don't charge me extra incidentals.

1423
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,600
Uh, Meredith Vieira, America Ferrera.

1424
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,840
That was almost rhyming.

1425
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,200
I was gonna say, that sounds, yeah.

1426
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,440
Meredith Vieira, America Ferrera.

1427
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,760
It's like an Oprah Uma.

1428
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,640
That's the new Oprah Uma.

1429
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,120
Cal Ripken Jr.

1430
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:16,960
Gotta have some Sam.

1431
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,280
That would be awesome.

1432
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,760
Yeah, that's good.

1433
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,720
I mean, I know you're there to like respectfully

1434
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,520
tell the story of the birth of the Christ child,

1435
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,840
but I'd like to like see him slug a few

1436
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,680
while he's up there too.

1437
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,520
Yeah, whatever they do, they should.

1438
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,360
Knock a few into the stands.

1439
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,720
Hear some stories about him hitting dingers, you know?

1440
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,800
Everyone should be like,

1441
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,080
Stamos should play the drums when he does his too.

1442
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,600
He should play the drums with it.

1443
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,520
If you have a talent or an ability,

1444
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,840
you should do it while you're doing the narration

1445
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,520
or in between.

1446
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,120
Pat Sajak did it.

1447
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,280
He should be allowed to spin a big wheel.

1448
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,080
Yeah, the wheel should be on there on the stage with him.

1449
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,480
Tell you about important tax cuts for the very wealthy.

1450
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1451
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,880
That is very, like you said, Scott,

1452
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,520
about like people maybe not knowing this is going on.

1453
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,920
Just imagining walking through World Showcase

1454
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,000
a little buzzed and looking to your right

1455
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,400
and seeing a stage and you're like,

1456
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,320
is that Cal Ripken Jr.?

1457
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,720
Like, what is going on?

1458
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,120
Would you even recognize Cal Ripken Jr.

1459
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,480
not in a uniform and a hat?

1460
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,320
Yeah.

1461
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,880
If he was dressed like Bob Cratchit,

1462
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,920
you wouldn't even know who you were looking at.

1463
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,200
Do you guys have a dream lineup for this?

1464
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,040
Because I've never seen this.

1465
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,280
Every year up until a couple years ago,

1466
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,960
I would be like, you know what?

1467
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,520
Just try to see if I could see this one of these years.

1468
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,360
You've thought about that, right?

1469
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,200
I've thought about it.

1470
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,160
And then it's just like always like,

1471
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,800
it's not as long as it is out here as it is at Epcot.

1472
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,880
You only got two nights in Disneyland, but yeah.

1473
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,000
And it just has never worked out

1474
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,120
where we've been down there.

1475
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,280
And I know like you can get dining packages

1476
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,600
that like guarantee that you have a seat.

1477
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,560
Guarantee you seats, yeah.

1478
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,040
But you can still like kind of hang around, obviously.

1479
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,160
The park's not closed for it.

1480
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,760
But it's just never lined up.

1481
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,680
It's just one of those things

1482
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,400
where after you've gone to Disneyland,

1483
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,000
when you're childless, you go to Disneyland so much,

1484
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,520
you go, well, what else have we done here?

1485
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,360
And this was the top one.

1486
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,680
We've done everything but the story of our Christ.

1487
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,240
Right, and it never happened.

1488
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,560
But I'm trying to think like, yeah,

1489
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,560
truly who would I want to do it if I was the decision maker?

1490
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,600
Well, there is a name that joined the narrator family

1491
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,920
in 2022 that I think leads to the other ones that I want.

1492
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,880
And that name is Damon John.

1493
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,320
That is of course Damon from Shark Tank.

1494
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,560
Oh, right.

1495
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,960
Mr. Fubu.

1496
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,920
I don't think I've ever seen Damon

1497
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,880
in any other forum than Shark Tank.

1498
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,240
And he wore a big Dickensian hat.

1499
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,880
Oh, wow. It was pretty exciting.

1500
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,120
Okay.

1501
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,240
And I found video of that one.

1502
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,360
And it's really weird to hear him talking,

1503
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,760
saying things that aren't, you know,

1504
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,440
I will do 300,000 for a 15% stake in your company.

1505
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,440
Right.

1506
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,240
You're gonna have to say other things.

1507
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,400
But anyway, that just makes me want every shark.

1508
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,560
I want all sharks.

1509
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,000
I want there to be a theme year where it is entirely sharks.

1510
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,720
Because the sharks can be somewhat greedy.

1511
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,440
Their lives are all about making money.

1512
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,280
And don't you, aren't those the peep,

1513
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,080
the Scrooges who most need to reflect

1514
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,800
on the reason for the season?

1515
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,600
So I want to see Cuban do it.

1516
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,600
I want to see Kevin O'Leary do it.

1517
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,240
Kevin O'Leary might leave a changed man.

1518
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,840
He might shed a single tear and give up all his possessions

1519
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:49,280
right then and there to the Walt Disney World

1520
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,800
volunteer choir.

1521
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,640
Oh, yeah.

1522
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:56,000
He'll just write a bunch of checks and take off his clothes.

1523
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,840
Here, my garments.

1524
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,280
And just go wander into the lake.

1525
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,240
He learned.

1526
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,800
He's a fisherman now.

1527
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,960
He learned that more likely a camel

1528
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,640
get through the eye of a needle.

1529
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,480
Yeah.

1530
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,280
Than Kevin O'Leary get in heaven.

1531
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1532
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,400
You know, I called myself Mr. Wonderful,

1533
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,440
but the way I acted was never wonderful until tonight.

1534
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,760
Wow, that's beautiful.

1535
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,840
Especially if it plays out like that.

1536
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,840
Cuban, Laurie, Mr. Wonderful, they're all.

1537
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,240
And also, if there's some way for them to all remove

1538
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,600
a vast amount of work they've all had done on their faces

1539
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,600
in the last five to seven years.

1540
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,440
That's gonna be tougher.

1541
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,360
If that counts as possessions,

1542
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,360
they have to somehow peel the botox out of their skin.

1543
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,200
I don't know.

1544
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,000
That's gonna be a miracle from God, I think.

1545
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,840
It's a tall order.

1546
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1547
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,200
Robert's got a lot going on in his face right now.

1548
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,120
I don't know if that's all coming out.

1549
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,160
Fillers, if you can get the fillers out.

1550
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,400
Jason, what do you think?

1551
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,840
Who's your dream narrator or narrators?

1552
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,920
Would you think maybe like Amiya Khalifa?

1553
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,840
I don't believe that's the faith that she would

1554
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,520
most likely to gravitate towards.

1555
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,920
You're right.

1556
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,240
The Golden Bachelor, obviously.

1557
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,920
You wanna go back to that, like, that's, you know.

1558
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,440
Well, he's very handsome. Stentorian, yeah.

1559
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,200
What about Eisner doing it?

1560
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,840
He never did it.

1561
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,320
Cardwalkers passed.

1562
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,280
Cardwalkers dead, yes.

1563
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,760
But I would like Cardwalkers to do it.

1564
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,440
But yeah, Eisner obviously I think would be my number one.

1565
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,040
All the hits, Eisner, Katzenberg.

1566
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,520
Katzenberg ain't going back there.

1567
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,960
Who was the other, the Disney son-in-law

1568
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,040
who was a football player, what was his name?

1569
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,400
Oh, oh, Ron Miller.

1570
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,840
Ron Miller, thank you, Scott.

1571
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,680
Ron Miller.

1572
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,920
Get all the gang back together.

1573
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,000
I would say like, I'm like,

1574
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,840
like a Rivers Cuomo maybe doing it would be good.

1575
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,480
He's got a gentle voice.

1576
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,000
He doesn't have the gravitas,

1577
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,520
but since they're doing sort of different types of voices

1578
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,360
now, I think that would be good.

1579
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,200
Maybe like a whole Lollapalooza run of like,

1580
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:07,560
Rivers Cuomo, Billy Corrigan.

1581
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,400
Anthony Kiedis.

1582
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,240
Anthony Kiedis.

1583
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,600
Yeah, well Billy Corrigan could do it

1584
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,120
and Billy Corrigan could do it.

1585
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,480
Okay, excuse me.

1586
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,000
Perry Farrell, Dexter Holland from The Offspring.

1587
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,600
Yeah, a whole lineup of K-Rock bands.

1588
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,920
DJ Lethal.

1589
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,760
DJ Lethal.

1590
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,040
He'll do it all with drops.

1591
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,600
Yeah, yeah.

1592
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,480
That would be good.

1593
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,040
Yeah, any music star at Eat the Beat,

1594
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,160
they should just move them over and do the Candlelight.

1595
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,000
I mean, a lot of these people,

1596
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,280
if you aren't already living in Orlando,

1597
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,120
what do you do?

1598
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,480
You know, this is where your market is.

1599
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,160
Yeah, and there's been no pro wrestler

1600
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,680
that's ever done this, I don't think.

1601
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,520
No.

1602
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,240
That's an entire untapped genre.

1603
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,560
Oh, Nash, Kevin Nash.

1604
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,960
Podcaster Kevin Nash.

1605
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,360
If you could get a wrestler to cut a promo style Nativity,

1606
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,520
that would really be good.

1607
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,120
A very intense Nativity where it's being yelled at you.

1608
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,960
I would like to see another level as far as intensity.

1609
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,080
Well, you wanna see shirtlessness at this event.

1610
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,640
I would love a narrator that was shirtless, yes.

1611
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,840
Or Chippendale's style, like just the bow tie.

1612
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,680
Let's get Dennis Franz naked with a little bow tie.

1613
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,440
Like Chippendale.

1614
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,520
And then he does it, and he does it with his voice.

1615
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,920
Well, Matt, a friend of the show,

1616
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,960
Matt Cardona would appreciate it.

1617
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
You know, he is Big Parks guy down in Florida.

1618
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,240
You'd appreciate Dennis Franz being nude?

1619
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,760
No, no, he'd appreciate doing the Candlelight.

1620
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,440
Oh, I'd love for it, Matt, to do it.

1621
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,520
I think he'd appreciate that, though, too.

1622
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,680
I feel comfortable suggesting that on microphone.

1623
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,520
Yeah, no, I think he would like both things,

1624
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,680
for him to do it and to see Dennis Franz nude.

1625
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,520
I was just trying to think of- I was impressed

1626
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,400
by Franz's bow, and just seeing it,

1627
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,000
it was a more attractive butt than I anticipated.

1628
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,160
I was expecting a Hank Hill ass.

1629
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1630
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,320
But it was actually- Flat or flabby?

1631
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,600
It is not really flat, yeah.

1632
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1633
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,080
I saw Dennis Franz in a Vans,

1634
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,600
in a small seaside town in California one time.

1635
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,440
Oh, right.

1636
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,160
Yeah, I just ran it, he was just shopping.

1637
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,160
Wow, was he in the meat section,

1638
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,040
was he next to two big hams,

1639
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,840
and it reminded you of his naked rear?

1640
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,920
Yeah, he was.

1641
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,760
It was like Austin Powers 2 gag, kind of a thing.

1642
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,600
The two hams were covered in-

1643
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,800
You couldn't tell if he was naked behind the ham.

1644
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,480
The ham was in the way.

1645
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1646
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,140
Suggestive.

1647
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,360
I'm lucky because my favorite actor

1648
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,920
has already done it a number of times,

1649
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,120
so I'm spoken for.

1650
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,600
I'm of course referring to Jim Caviezel.

1651
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,600
You love Caviezel, I love Cary Grant, you know.

1652
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,560
The greats.

1653
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,400
All our favorites.

1654
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,520
Uh-huh, I consider him the modern Cary Grant.

1655
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,320
I also just, in discovering that,

1656
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,480
then YouTube is telling me what other great

1657
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:51,080
Jim Caviezel live performances I should check out,

1658
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,480
and I discovered, I don't know how I didn't know,

1659
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,960
that in 2012, he went on stage with the band Chicago

1660
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,120
and performed If You Leave Me Now.

1661
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:00,960
Really?

1662
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,640
And I'll tell you what, he had the voice of an angel.

1663
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,600
Wow.

1664
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,320
He had the voice of the Christ that he played.

1665
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,600
Really?

1666
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,440
That's crazy.

1667
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,080
Jesus had a beautiful singing voice.

1668
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:11,920
Mm-hmm.

1669
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,360
When was the last time Caviezel did it?

1670
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,200
Has it been recent?

1671
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,280
I feel like it was like 10 years ago.

1672
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,560
Caviezel did it in 2016.

1673
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,800
Oh, that is recent, okay.

1674
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,760
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1675
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,080
Now it's before the great awakening that he's had,

1676
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,880
the realization that where we go one, we go all.

1677
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,440
That's person of interest, Caviezel, you know?

1678
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,400
It's just a television star.

1679
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,520
The ultimate person of interest is and should be

1680
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,760
Jesus our Lord.

1681
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,600
Yeah.

1682
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,200
It also reminded me how it is funny

1683
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,240
that I totally forgot all this.

1684
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:50,280
Five years ago, Disney, having bought Fox,

1685
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,320
found themselves the owners of a fully produced

1686
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,040
feature film called Sound of Freedom.

1687
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:59,880
And then years passed, they didn't know what to do with it.

1688
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,800
The pandemic delayed all of it.

1689
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,960
They're like, we gotta get rid of this thing.

1690
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,560
The people who made the movie wanted to get it back.

1691
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,520
They did.

1692
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,080
They, him having been to Disney World and done this,

1693
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,720
like it's amazing to be here for the holidays

1694
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,920
and this time of year.

1695
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,480
Then he had to shift course and say,

1696
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,560
I think Disney didn't want this movie getting out there.

1697
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,240
They were trying to hide it from you

1698
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,120
because it maybe reveals some of the things that they do.

1699
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,440
He literally implied.

1700
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,280
Yeah.

1701
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,840
And then, but they got it back.

1702
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,920
Disney did not release Sound of Freedom.

1703
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,160
Sound of Freedom went on to trounce most of

1704
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:39,160
Walt Disney Company's feature films in 2023.

1705
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,360
By far, by far.

1706
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,360
This was the number 10 domestic film of the year.

1707
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,680
Disney probably.

1708
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,640
I don't think Dark Money is going to bat

1709
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,640
for Dial of Destiny, you know?

1710
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,360
They're not like.

1711
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,600
There wasn't the pay it forward ticket scheme

1712
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,400
either for Dial of Destiny.

1713
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,840
I know, cause they were dumb.

1714
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,160
They didn't do the best scheme in the world.

1715
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,120
Right.

1716
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,480
This is how Jim Caviezel's movies succeed.

1717
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,440
They all, the church groups go by in droves.

1718
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,360
They go in buses and they easily trounce

1719
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,840
Haunted Mansion and the Marvels.

1720
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,080
Yeah, yes.

1721
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,200
So they, next year, that'll be the trick maybe.

1722
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,440
You know, Deadpool 3, pay it forward tickets.

1723
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,040
And then it'll be the biggest movie of all time.

1724
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,880
Yeah.

1725
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,280
And, but, you know, will that be enough?

1726
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,720
I think they just, they gotta go all the way

1727
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,320
and make Deadpool religious.

1728
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,520
Oh, sure.

1729
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,040
Show that Deadpool is snarky.

1730
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,880
But.

1731
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,440
But not so snarky that he doesn't know what's important.

1732
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,800
Of course.

1733
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,600
You know, you could put it towards the end.

1734
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,880
Just say, and now a reading from the book of Luke.

1735
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,880
Well, that sort of does it.

1736
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:54,360
I feel like I think you survived Podcast The Ride,

1737
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,080
the beginning of our holiday overlay.

1738
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:57,920
What about us?

1739
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,760
Couldn't we do it?

1740
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,000
I also thought we should be doing this.

1741
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,280
I thought that would be a good idea.

1742
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,120
Three, they've never done three at once.

1743
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,400
Yeah, we take turns.

1744
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,120
But yeah, I think that that would make a lot of sense.

1745
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:14,160
And we will promise them, I swear to you,

1746
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,120
Disney Company, for this religious event,

1747
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,600
we will not talk about cum and jizz and seeds

1748
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,200
as we have done in, I would say,

1749
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,600
a high volume of episodes.

1750
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,240
You get punchy doing this sometimes.

1751
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,080
Here's what we'll do.

1752
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,680
We'll make sure that there will be no talk

1753
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,640
of any of that untoward stuff because we will all

1754
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,680
get on an app that monitors each other's intake

1755
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,960
of official materials on the web.

1756
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:38,800
Accountability.

1757
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,640
I will say, though, if we were to do

1758
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,760
the Candlelight Processional, I will dress up

1759
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,080
as a little drummer boy.

1760
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,520
I don't know the first thing about playing drums,

1761
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,920
but it will be very clean and very Christmassy.

1762
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,960
The clean the suit, like the suit you're wearing?

1763
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,800
So I'm gonna be clean.

1764
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,640
Oh, clean, you mean the material, sorry.

1765
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,080
Yeah, clean in terms, yeah.

1766
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,120
Yeah, okay, well that's great.

1767
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,400
I think that I would also dress up as a drummer boy

1768
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,520
or a different character, one of the three wise men, perhaps.

1769
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,640
So Scott, I don't know what you're dressed up as.

1770
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,040
I wanna be on top of that big tree.

1771
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,800
I'm gonna be a star head.

1772
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,600
You'll be like Maggie's kind of Christmas coat.

1773
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,440
Yeah.

1774
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,000
It's kind of a big star.

1775
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,360
Give me a big solo.

1776
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,200
Yeah.

1777
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,120
I'll get the falsetto.

1778
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,960
Go!

1779
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,320
Did you ever have to do that when you were little?

1780
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,160
I was a boy choir.

1781
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,120
Yeah, so you had to.

1782
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,800
Yeah, yeah, I still got it.

1783
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,840
Okay, do you know all the songs pretty well still?

1784
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,080
I mean, these are Christmas songs.

1785
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,960
It's not like, I know kind of like

1786
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,760
a way in the manger and stuff.

1787
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,680
Oh yeah, how far could I get through like?

1788
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,040
Could you do the whole, if called upon like tonight,

1789
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,280
they go, we need one person to fill in.

1790
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:50,080
Give me one of these types of songs.

1791
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,240
A way in the manger.

1792
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,600
A way in the manger, no sleep for a,

1793
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,800
no wait, no, no crib for a,

1794
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,120
fuck shit, fuck it up, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1795
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,520
The star is saying fuck in a high pitched voice

1796
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,920
over and over. Oh no, the wish star

1797
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,640
has started cursing. Shut it down.

1798
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,480
They're not gonna let us do it now.

1799
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,560
Event canceled, never again.

1800
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,400
Damn it.
