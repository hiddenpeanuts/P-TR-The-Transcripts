1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,660
Merry Christmas from Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,920
This is Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
Ho, ho, ho, it's me, Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
And ho, ho, ho, Jason Sheridan also here as per usual.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
That's correct.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,840
Hey, this is a little special Christmas treat

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,760
for all you Patreon subscribers.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,260
We're opening Santa's mail sack

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,260
to address some of your burning holiday

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,940
and or Christmas questions.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,220
Thanks for sending them in on the Twitter

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,920
and the Instagram and Facebook.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,080
There's so many sources of questions

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,200
and we'll try to get through as many of them as we can.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,060
If you're not following any of those things,

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,320
then follow them and then you can, you know,

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,480
throw your questions into episodes just like this

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,540
among many other treats.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,920
And also if you're listening to this,

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,600
you may have heard the live show that we put out

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,120
that we did at Lyric Hyperion,

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,580
this little Christmas special that was a lot of fun.

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,280
If you were there in person, thank you so much.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,160
It was good to see everybody.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,440
People brought us presents, which is insane.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,640
Thank you for.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,440
Yes, thank you so much.

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
Yeah, thank you.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,100
It's bonkers.

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,200
We're not setting the base of expectations

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,840
that people have to give us presents,

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,080
but it's all wonderful.

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,720
We don't deserve presents.

35
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,560
Well, look, we're good boys, but are we that good of boys?

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,400
I don't know.

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,740
Only Santa can truly determine.

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,280
But I just wanted to, I wanted to follow up on something

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,800
that happened in that show

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,440
and take it a little bit further

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,280
because I was digging backwards into our year,

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,760
into an earlier topic, which was Dogpatch USA,

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,800
this dilapidated Arkansas park

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,280
that we did a very long episode about.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,360
Because I was trying to see if there was any

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,940
good Christmas connection to Dogpatch USA,

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,940
I was going back into the Facebook group of Heritage USA,

48
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,820
which is the weird company that took over Dogpatch

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,700
run by this guy, David Hare, who was this right wing guy.

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,620
It was like, had this agenda

51
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,380
and then the whole thing fell apart and he skipped down.

52
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,900
And this Facebook group was like a fan page for it?

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,740
No, no, no.

54
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,580
This is their official.

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,780
Yeah, this was David Hare's way of getting information out

56
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,020
to the public about how the building was going.

57
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,900
Is this how you tell us you're a QAnon guy now?

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,220
I saw a lot of cool ideas there

59
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,100
and I kept going down another rabbit hole,

60
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,460
a hair hole if you were.

61
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,420
Did you guys know JFK Jr. still alive?

62
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,300
It was his sex plane.

63
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,760
It's been wrongly attributed this whole time.

64
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,100
It is a very fun Facebook page in general

65
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,380
because he'll be posting about,

66
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,940
I got a new song on the way

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,140
and then there'll be a comment that's like, cool,

68
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,940
hey, could you follow up on something you talked about

69
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,460
in your last video, which is paying off all those debts?

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,460
People use this Facebook page to come after David Hare.

71
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,540
Is it active?

72
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,860
Is it like, is he posted recently?

73
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,700
No, not anymore.

74
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,740
Because David Hare, I don't know that he's like.

75
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,580
The lamb maybe.

76
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,400
I think he's on the lamb.

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,700
I don't know that he's officially in hiding,

78
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,660
but he certainly is not going anywhere near Dogpatch USA,

79
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,920
which there was recent stuff that the current owner,

80
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,340
who is this guy who makes dog bowls,

81
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,680
he's letting the property go.

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,420
So who knows what's gonna happen to Dogpatch USA?

83
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,220
This story keeps going and going

84
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,660
and we'll keep updating you.

85
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,740
But now let me get to why I'm bringing any of this up.

86
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,540
This came up in our live show, the song Down in Dogpatch,

87
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,340
which you talked about and your sister is fond of,

88
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,900
apparently, who was at the show.

89
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,940
Down in Dogpatch is a song sung

90
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,540
by the character Foxworthy, who's an animal puppet.

91
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,500
And he's driving kind of an old Model T car, I think.

92
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,100
A very Mr. Toad kind of car.

93
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,820
And it's a really catchy song.

94
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,980
And that is from a video that was meant to be part

95
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,060
of the beginning of a lot of Dogpatch,

96
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,460
Down in Dogpatch episodes.

97
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,140
I think he says one of three

98
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,420
and then the rest we've never gotten to see.

99
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,620
And you're left to wonder, what was this gonna be?

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,380
We met Foxworthy, we met Hubbell Hare,

101
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,660
the main mascot of Dogpatch USA,

102
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,460
but you didn't meet any more characters.

103
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,820
And when I was digging back

104
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,180
into the Heritage USA Facebook page.

105
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,020
What do you find?

106
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,260
Okay, sorry, I don't wanna get ahead of myself.

107
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,180
There is a character who would have been

108
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,940
in a subsequent episode that we didn't get to see.

109
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,620
And it is a dog.

110
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,180
This is from the Heritage USA Facebook page,

111
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,660
May 17th, 2018.

112
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,540
And just take a deep breath and get ready for this

113
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,660
because here is the post.

114
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,060
Heritage USA Studios, a new character joins the cast

115
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,700
of Down in Dogpatch, meet.

116
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,020
Sorry, I sneezed in the middle of this grand thing.

117
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,820
Sorry, so sorry.

118
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,500
A new character joins the cast of Down in Dogpatch,

119
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,980
meet Puppy Carlson.

120
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,300
What the fuck?

121
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,140
What the fuck?

122
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,700
I thought about bringing this up in the live show,

123
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,220
but it was like too much to talk about.

124
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,580
Puppy Carlson, you are now both looking at a puppy.

125
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,940
There was a character, an original theme park IP character

126
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,700
who we never got to meet whose name is Carlson.

127
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,500
What the hell?

128
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,220
Puppy Carlson.

129
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,460
First off, I gotta say Puppy Carlson is very cute.

130
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,260
Yes, probably more so than Fox or the Huffle hair.

131
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,540
The cutest of the Dogpatch characters.

132
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,740
Puppy Carlson, if I Google Puppy Carlson,

133
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,220
would it even come up or is it just?

134
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,660
No, I tried it.

135
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,900
It's nothing.

136
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,380
This is the only source.

137
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,020
May 17th, 2018, just if anybody wants to check that date

138
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,740
and we'll post it too.

139
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,700
Michael, you've always been the caretaker of Heritage USA.

140
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,940
You've always been here at the Overlook.

141
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,140
Puppy Carlson, wow.

142
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,820
And it doesn't have any other explanation

143
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,380
for why he's called that.

144
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,860
No, it's so weird.

145
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,900
It's very weird.

146
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,060
Like of all the names and that it's a last name.

147
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,860
Yeah, right, like why?

148
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,700
Why?

149
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,220
I mean, obviously it would imply

150
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,700
that his owners had that name.

151
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,820
Yeah, maybe.

152
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,260
I mean, if it's the format of Hubble hair

153
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,860
and hair is he's a rabbit,

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,020
but he's also kind of named after David Hare,

155
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,900
the guy who invented him.

156
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,420
Did he know somebody named Carlson

157
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,860
and it's an attribute to him?

158
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,140
Maybe, maybe one of his right wing friends

159
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,420
is named Carlson.

160
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,260
Could be.

161
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,340
And he was like, I'm gonna name a dog after him

162
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,980
in honor of this great man

163
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,100
who believes the things that I believe.

164
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,780
We'll all learn of who this other Carlson is soon.

165
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,500
He'll like, you know, attempts to assassinate

166
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,980
Adam Schiff or something.

167
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,940
Then your last name will be associated with insanity.

168
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,060
But puppy Carlson isn't ready for this Christmas,

169
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,860
but puppy Carlson will be ready.

170
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,380
Hopefully by next Christmas,

171
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,260
guys, we're still digging out the poop.

172
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,420
Puppy Carlson, wow.

173
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,460
Somebody took puppy Carlson and buried him in the pool.

174
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,060
Okay, are we gonna fish him out?

175
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,100
Yes, when?

176
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,420
I don't know.

177
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,260
Do we currently know David Hare?

178
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,500
David Hare?

179
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,340
David Hare.

180
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,020
David Hare, do we currently know his whereabouts?

181
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,860
No, no.

182
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,700
There's no update in a long time.

183
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,100
Will we be the first to find out

184
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,020
when he comes after us for attacking him?

185
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,420
Possibly.

186
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,260
Scott, you helped me last night.

187
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,580
I was trying to find the Lou Pearlman document,

188
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,820
which is on YouTube.

189
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,180
They found him in Bali in a very funny way.

190
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,020
Oh, that's insane.

191
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,940
That guy is just like, isn't that, hey, FBI,

192
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,620
isn't that that guy, that boy band guy?

193
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,300
I think I'm looking at him in a hotel.

194
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,220
The tourist sent a picture,

195
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,820
and the FBI agents sent to arrest him

196
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,380
are also in the other side of the picture,

197
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,220
because they were eating breakfast at the same place.

198
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,140
Do you remember that?

199
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,660
They're just in the photo?

200
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,260
They got there too early, they're like, oh, he's not home.

201
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,500
You wanna go get breakfast?

202
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,460
And they know if they hang out long enough,

203
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,500
Pearlman will come down for one of his several breakfasts

204
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,340
for the day.

205
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,340
So I don't know what the more cost-effective version

206
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,420
of Bali is, but maybe check there.

207
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,180
Maybe check Branson for David Hare.

208
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Oh, man, he should, yeah, he, was he ever in Branson?

210
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,420
That seems like such an easy-

211
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,260
Given, yeah.

212
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,900
Or does he have it out for Branson,

213
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,580
because he's trying to be a competitor of Branson almost.

214
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,140
Or yeah, or they wouldn't allow him

215
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,340
to have a Hubble Hare show.

216
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,060
They rejected his bid for a theater show

217
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,540
for Hubble Hare or something.

218
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,460
Maybe he, maybe the next place he'll show up

219
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,620
is trying to peddle these characters to Trump.

220
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,180
Puppy Carlson could just very soon be named Puppy Pence.

221
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,020
Yeah.

222
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,780
He's trying to sell this lineup

223
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,620
to be the official mascots of the Trump administration.

224
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
We may need to buy the characters

225
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,940
to make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands.

226
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,860
I feel like he would sell them, and maybe for not a lot.

227
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,100
And it's your right, there's a dog named after you.

228
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,980
There's a dog named after me.

229
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,140
You're fond of- Dogs, yeah.

230
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,900
Of Gelatoni, wait, Gelatoni, no, Gelatoni was a cat.

231
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,580
Who's the dog? He's an Italian painter cat.

232
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,460
The cook is the, the cookie is.

233
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,100
Cookie Anne. Cookie Anne, yeah.

234
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,740
Cookie Anne, yes, of course.

235
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,140
So yeah, interesting, very interesting.

236
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,980
Very busy.

237
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,260
It asks, honestly, more questions than answers here.

238
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,580
Yeah, I'd have to say.

239
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,340
This is another opening up a box

240
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,020
to try to figure, like a mystery box,

241
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,940
JJ's mystery box here.

242
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,780
Sure.

243
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,220
Yeah, I don't know what to-

244
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,340
So we'll have to, I bet there's no answers, honestly.

245
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,180
I bet he just has a friend named Carlson.

246
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,940
But I'd like to think there's some sort of grand mystery

247
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,260
or something strange afoot here.

248
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,100
Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,060
But if, well, if also, if anyone's just like

250
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,860
looking at this doll, if anyone went and like

251
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,060
pilfered through what was left of Dogpatch USA

252
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,460
and like found this dog line around,

253
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,620
then please send it to us.

254
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,060
Let us know. Yeah, send it.

255
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
We'll pay top dollar.

256
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,940
Puppy Carlson.

257
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,820
Let's just, whatever, he's a, he's a mascot of ours now.

258
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,060
They're not doing anything with him.

259
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,900
Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,300
We'll make a shirt.

261
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,260
Sure. Yeah.

262
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,860
We are asking for a lawsuit.

263
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,660
Probably. Which would be funny.

264
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,580
Can we change it just a little?

265
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,340
Like pupper Carlson.

266
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,340
Can it just a puppy I-E-B instead of Y?

267
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,180
I see.

268
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Yeah, maybe that's enough.

269
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,780
Could you just maybe a lowercase P?

270
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,620
Is that enough?

271
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,700
Could be. Lowercase.

272
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,540
Maybe.

273
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,820
We gotta consult with an attorney.

274
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,980
But either way, Puppy Carlson.

275
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,140
Edwin is Puppy Carlson too.

276
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,620
So, he's a real dog.

277
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,700
You think he'd be jealous of Puppy Carlson

278
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,860
if they were to meet?

279
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,700
Yes.

280
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,620
Or he would do what he does with other dogs

281
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,580
and humps them.

282
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,500
He would hump them.

283
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,540
Most likely.

284
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,300
Because that's what he does when he meets a dog he likes.

285
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,020
That's just him.

286
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,340
So that's that.

287
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,940
That's my whole present to you is awareness of Puppy Carlson.

288
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,660
Thank you for that Christmas present.

289
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,540
Your personal theme park IP.

290
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,700
Geez.

291
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,220
Now let's crack open Santa's Mail Sack

292
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,460
and see what you guys are wanting to know

293
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,380
about how we do the holidays and our holiday opinions.

294
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,340
Jason is ready to go.

295
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,820
So I think we should let Jason,

296
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,060
we're gonna each take a different form of social media.

297
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,900
Sure.

298
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,140
On Facebook.

299
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,980
Jason Sheridan.

300
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,700
Jason's reading the Facebook group.

301
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,140
I'm coming Facebook.

302
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,980
I, the very first question on Facebook,

303
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,180
I will get to because it's the big one.

304
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,300
We've been asked it a lot on all forms of social media.

305
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,980
But I'm gonna start off with Gavin O'Mara asked,

306
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,340
since Life Day is now canon,

307
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,620
when are we getting a Batuu overlay

308
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,300
complete with grandpa Wookiees?

309
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,060
Life Day of course is the holiday celebrated

310
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,020
in the much maligned Star Wars holiday special.

311
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,580
From the 1970s, kind of a 70s variety hour special,

312
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,460
which I have never sat down and watched all the way through,

313
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,140
but I've heard is like, oh, will this be so good?

314
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,980
It's bad.

315
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,180
But I think I were talking about on the Night Call podcast

316
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,420
of like, no, it's not what you want it to be.

317
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,260
It's not that.

318
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,340
Parts of it are.

319
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,180
Yes.

320
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,020
I can narrate you through how to watch it

321
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,140
as the way people do it.

322
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,940
Like once the Star Wars in this order.

323
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,860
I think you gotta watch, it's the opening is really exciting

324
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
just to hear the names of like,

325
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,620
of Chewbacca's family and Lumpy.

326
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,500
Just like watch that opening is great.

327
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,340
Yeah.

328
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,580
And then watch the scene that's just various Chewbacca's

329
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,580
going, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr, rrrr.

330
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,580
It feels like 10 minutes of pure Chewbacca noises,

331
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,220
not subtitled.

332
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,580
And then the Jefferson Starship performance is fantastic.

333
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,260
And then anything where Harrison Ford is on screen,

334
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,620
because he's like the most gunpoint.

335
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,660
And then there's a thing when he was on late night

336
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,660
with Conan O'Brien and Conan like kind of devilishly implies

337
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,460
like, what if I were to tell you that I have a clip

338
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,580
of the holiday and then he fake strangles him

339
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,820
and then settles down and says a quote that I love,

340
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,380
which is, I don't know, I've never seen it.

341
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,820
Maybe it'll be nice.

342
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,580
I love that line.

343
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,340
That's actually my attitude too.

344
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,180
Yeah.

345
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,820
I think the mystery is better to have.

346
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,140
Oh, I also like Leia singing this inane life day song.

347
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,220
But yeah, I think it's good for a skip around.

348
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,140
I think if you sat and watched it, it's pretty miserable.

349
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,420
But.

350
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,260
But in reference to like, it's now canon

351
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,540
because it is mentioned, like I believe

352
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,420
in the first episode of the Mandalorian.

353
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,340
Yes, Horatio Sans mentions it.

354
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,420
And I think pretty quickly once Galaxy's Edge was open,

355
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,540
a lot of people are going like, when Christmas is coming,

356
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,220
are they gonna do life day?

357
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,860
And I kind of think it would be fun.

358
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,900
You know, there's a saying in improv

359
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,500
that there's no mistakes, only gifts.

360
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,460
And clearly they utilized it.

361
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,500
Like they mentioned it in the Mandalorian.

362
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
And honestly, I think if they did it in Batuu,

363
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,140
they could make it really fun.

364
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,780
Honestly, if Disney made a really good,

365
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,980
they could probably save,

366
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,900
they could probably do a new Star Wars holiday special

367
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,220
if they really made it good.

368
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
But I'd worry it would just be Megan Trainor

369
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,540
and Sting and Shaggy.

370
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,380
But I think there's probably like a fun version.

371
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,460
Like why not do it?

372
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,900
I mean, pass gas Mary Holland is in a crazy

373
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,580
Star Wars children's game show coming out.

374
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,220
Oh, that's right, yeah, that's coming out soon.

375
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,060
That sounds amazing.

376
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,380
She's a droid and Ahmed Best is the host.

377
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,220
Is the host like this?

378
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,620
It's kind of a Legends of the Hidden Temple

379
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,460
sounding show.

380
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,860
Which sounds like a blast.

381
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,140
Like that sounds wild. It really does.

382
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,860
Maybe we're, as we've expressed,

383
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,140
we just were in this hyperspace Hoopla episode.

384
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,500
We'd want Star Wars to be fun again.

385
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,620
And we do have pretty specific opinions

386
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
about what is acceptable Star Wars fun.

387
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,940
But I think some version of Life Day.

388
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,780
What is it though?

389
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,940
I mean, I don't think it would be like goofy.

390
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,820
I don't think it's gonna be like how they do

391
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,740
Halloween in Cars Land.

392
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,180
It would have to be,

393
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,460
I don't even want them to do something super silly.

394
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,340
I'm just even trying to picture like how do you,

395
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,860
I mean the fireworks look so good back there.

396
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,180
We're just, I mean, just doing some holiday lighting

397
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,340
and some tinsel around the Falcon.

398
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,060
Yeah, well Star Wars-y kind of tinsel and hanging stuff.

399
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,780
Right as we were done with the ordeal,

400
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,420
they put up some lights at Downtown Disney.

401
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,260
Have you seen these?

402
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,080
Yeah.

403
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,900
The circular lights around trees.

404
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,720
Oh yeah.

405
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,560
Neon and stuff.

406
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,620
I mean like just stuff like that even would give it

407
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,180
a little bit of a festive-y feeling.

408
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,020
Yeah.

409
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,260
Just changing the lighting as you're saying.

410
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,580
The marketplace seems ripe for some kind

411
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,100
of Christmas lighting.

412
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,780
And I have thought before how,

413
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,660
we've expressed this thing of like does,

414
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,380
I mean that initial Star Wars Galaxy's Edge visit

415
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,620
is so overwhelming but can you just do it again

416
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,820
and again and again and again?

417
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,220
And even like Rex, I have thought like,

418
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,020
well I love this loop and everything but at some point,

419
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,700
I'm gonna kinda want more loop.

420
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,540
Yeah.

421
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,740
So Rex's Christmas show would be.

422
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,180
Yeah, oh the Christmas Star Wars music for sure.

423
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,020
Yes.

424
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,840
Yeah.

425
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,080
And I would request that he play

426
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,320
the Jefferson Starship song, Light the Sky on Fire,

427
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,040
which is not Christmas related at all

428
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,760
but I consider it an official Life Day song.

429
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600
Sure.

430
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
And Leia's pretty horrible.

431
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,080
It is just, if you guys seen that part,

432
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,400
it is just the Star Wars theme but like,

433
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,880
and we will come together now.

434
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
And I.

435
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

436
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,520
So they own the rights to that already.

437
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,080
I honestly, my opinion is you could get away

438
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,960
with making it a little goofy.

439
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,720
You could like, at night you could just like,

440
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,380
unfurl a big like weird Wookie banner

441
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,200
over those First Order banners and like decorate.

442
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,120
Like in the way that they've,

443
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,000
like in the way that Avatar land,

444
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,040
they've taken all the human bases

445
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,600
and like reclaimed them for the Navi.

446
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,080
You could just like put stuff on the First Order

447
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,520
Kylo Ren ship, like you could put lights,

448
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,020
string lights up on it.

449
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,560
You could put banners down and you could have like

450
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,360
a weird band, just like a Starship style band playing.

451
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,640
And I think people would love it.

452
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,480
I don't think.

453
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,300
Like non-violent resistant,

454
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,140
like the rebellion is doing this for fun.

455
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,080
Rebellion is one in this and it's Life Day

456
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,600
and like that's the narrative of it.

457
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,080
And I don't think anyone's gonna go in there and go,

458
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,680
well, this doesn't make sense between episodes eight and nine.

459
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,400
Like everyone's just gonna be like, oh, this is fun.

460
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,680
The lights are cool.

461
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,960
I like being here.

462
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,780
Yeah.

463
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,040
And is that Mickey Thomas?

464
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,160
Did they get him?

465
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,840
He frequently plays Epcot.

466
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,240
I mean, I do think it is like a fun way

467
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,140
to keep it fresh and interesting.

468
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,160
When we did the live show in LA the other night,

469
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,120
I met a guy who had just flown in from New Jersey

470
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,280
and it just went for the first time

471
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
and was like blown away by.

472
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
And I have to say, I was jealous of like,

473
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,120
oh, that's so cool.

474
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,280
You got to experience it for the first time.

475
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,860
And the more I thought about it, it's like,

476
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,120
well, the reason we can be critical of stuff.

477
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,320
And I try to have a reason when I'm being critical

478
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,480
is like, well, if you keep upkeep, you do a lot of it,

479
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,880
you keep it up well, it does feel like,

480
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,440
it gets you close to that feeling

481
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,880
of feeling it for the first time.

482
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,720
Sure, sure, sure, yeah.

483
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,920
I think they did a great job in Galaxy's Edge,

484
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,760
especially like the art direction and set decoration,

485
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,120
which is why I think they could do a really cool,

486
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,440
fun, tasteful version of the life day thing.

487
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,760
But the big thing that pretty much everyone is saying,

488
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,200
it's like the metaphor I have been using

489
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,940
is it's almost as if they built a beautiful theater,

490
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,920
like a Pantages or a Nederland,

491
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,840
they build a beautiful theater.

492
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,560
And for the play, most of the sets are there

493
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,440
and half of the actors.

494
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,440
You need the rest of the cast to do a full production.

495
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,660
We haven't acknowledged that thing

496
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,840
that at the Rise of the Resistance opening in Florida,

497
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,200
that there was this amazing lightsaber battle

498
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
up on the catwalks where we were promised

499
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,120
lightsaber battles all the time.

500
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,000
And there was a lot of reaction on Twitter,

501
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,400
like, well, imagine if this was happening all the time.

502
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,360
That's what they said it was gonna be.

503
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,520
And the X-wing drones.

504
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,360
That's very cool.

505
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,880
Which I think I saw somebody said they're on a truck,

506
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,840
they saw them on a truck to here for the opening.

507
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,680
So that's exciting.

508
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,800
We gotta try to get in that opening, that's a side note.

509
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,360
I gotta remind me to send an email.

510
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah.

511
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,020
I don't think that's gonna happen.

512
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,860
They're gonna ignore it, but I'd like to try.

513
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,700
You could try.

514
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,580
I would like to propose an original holiday character

515
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,660
that is a, you just have to,

516
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,380
it'd be like the same type of droid as BB-8,

517
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,140
but maybe with one more circle on the bottom.

518
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,780
And that's like a snowman.

519
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Oh my God, that's so good.

520
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,620
That'd be great.

521
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,580
A triple layer BB-8 rolling around.

522
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,940
That's a, for sure.

523
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,780
Frost-E.

524
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,220
Frost-3, the snow droid.

525
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,100
I think once, well, Rise of Skywalker is out.

526
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
I have seen it at this point,

527
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,940
but I think once the dust is settled.

528
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,780
No complaints, right?

529
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,620
Zero complaints?

530
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,980
I think that I have, it's possible,

531
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,820
honestly, all kidding aside, it's possible I loved it.

532
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
I don't know.

533
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,880
It's possible.

534
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,040
Anything is possible.

535
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,180
But I think once-

536
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,620
It's a ambiguous silence from Jason and Scott.

537
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,340
It's too long for me to get into the,

538
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,460
my opinions on all this stuff is very nuanced.

539
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,420
I'm not some sort of hardline hater,

540
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,500
so I'm just saying there's no way for us to,

541
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,340
it's too long.

542
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,160
We have Christmas questions.

543
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,000
It's too long.

544
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm just saying once nine is done,

545
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,900
I think the reigns will be loosened up

546
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
on the narrative of this area.

547
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,680
I think they're very much in the sense of like,

548
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,420
well, the movies are still going on,

549
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,420
we must preserve the tone of the movies at this point.

550
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,860
Mandalorian is implying maybe what the next era can be,

551
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,140
or it's a little, if there was,

552
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,540
if all of these movies have suffered under the weight of,

553
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,020
we have to bring it back and we have to do it right,

554
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,380
and it's gotta be, maybe now, yeah, you brought it back,

555
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,220
so can we chill?

556
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,060
Right, yes.

557
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,020
Let's just have Star Wars and be a little,

558
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,860
let's crazy about it.

559
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,580
So, Snowman BB-8, yeah, what about a Christmas tree droid?

560
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,420
Also.

561
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,260
Sure, yeah.

562
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,100
Yeah, that's fun.

563
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,340
We may as well do that, yeah.

564
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,100
I was thinking this morning of,

565
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,220
I was like, when did Force Awakens came out?

566
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,900
Force Awakens came out 2015, is that right?

567
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,740
Yes.

568
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,840
In five years, we got three main story Star Wars movies

569
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,660
and two spin-offs.

570
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,500
That's just so much.

571
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,340
Sure.

572
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,180
It's so much, I was just like,

573
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,140
man, that sure was a lot of Star Wars.

574
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,540
Even Eiger is saying it's too much.

575
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,380
And a TV show.

576
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,860
Eiger is like, I think maybe we hit the throttle too hard.

577
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,220
And I am more of a Marvel fan since I was a kid

578
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
than a Star Wars fan.

579
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,760
And maybe it's just because it's new characters,

580
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,140
every movie that then meet the old characters.

581
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,380
I don't know, I don't know.

582
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,060
But I think people in general might just be,

583
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,700
it just might have been too much.

584
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,540
Well, that's a whole-

585
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,360
And also, there's so much of everything.

586
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,780
People's attention is so precious,

587
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,820
so divided nowadays and so valuable.

588
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,980
That's a whole nother podcast.

589
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,100
It's a whole nother podcast.

590
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,540
Let's get to something about cookies.

591
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,380
We should holiday it up.

592
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,740
Yes, but I think, to answer your question,

593
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,420
yes, there can definitely be a fun version of Life Day.

594
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,900
You know that special that you showed a clip of

595
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,820
with Sting and Shaggy did have Portugal the Man

596
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,900
performing at the Millennium Falcon?

597
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,820
I saw that, scrubbing through it.

598
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,580
That was a full hour and a half special.

599
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,260
I barely got through it.

600
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,940
It was, I mean, it's a cool place for a band to play.

601
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,200
I don't know if I liked that so much, but...

602
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,820
Yeah.

603
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,420
I don't know why I even brought it up.

604
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,220
I'm just saying, a band performed holiday songs.

605
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,200
That might've been the first real holiday thing

606
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,420
at Galaxy's Edge.

607
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,260
Yeah, that's true.

608
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,100
Also, Portugal and the Man, a little more timely.

609
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,860
Portugal the Man, right?

610
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,700
Yeah.

611
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,520
Okay.

612
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,360
Yes.

613
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,180
All right, on to more questions.

614
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,020
Yes.

615
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,260
Okay, do you have anything, Mike, or are you gonna?

616
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,780
Oh, I mean, I can, yeah.

617
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,980
Let me see.

618
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,860
This year we learned about Sheridan Easter traditions,

619
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,260
Jelly Bean Trail.

620
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,580
Are there any fun, which I, you know,

621
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,260
I brought that up to Erin and she was like,

622
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,860
oh yeah, we did Jelly Bean Trail.

623
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,700
Wow, really?

624
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think Jelly Bean Trail

625
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,180
was not so bizarre of a thing.

626
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,900
I brought it up to a lot of people and no one else has.

627
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,340
I thought Erin's the second one I've heard

628
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,220
of a Jelly Bean Trail.

629
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,460
I mean, it makes sense.

630
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,100
Yeah, it's a good idea.

631
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,820
But are there any fun Sheridan Christmas traditions

632
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,780
is the question.

633
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,620
I wrote this one down too.

634
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,100
That was from BD on Twitter who we met the other night.

635
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,180
It was at our show the other night.

636
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
I was right.

637
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,860
She was crazy.

638
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,340
The main one that stuck to me,

639
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,580
we do hang stockings at the fireplace.

640
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,420
With care?

641
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,260
With care.

642
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,940
Because the stocking holders we have

643
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,980
don't stand well on this fireplace.

644
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,200
So if you fill them, they will fall off.

645
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,260
But the big one that I insist on doing

646
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,500
is leaving two cookies and a glass of milk out for Santa.

647
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,780
I've kept the faith.

648
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,620
Still?

649
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,460
Still.

650
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,620
Let me ask you this.

651
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,060
Do you sneak out in the middle of the night

652
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,380
and eat those cookies?

653
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,060
I don't, but someone does.

654
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,340
Oh, fun.

655
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,180
That's nice.

656
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,500
I don't insist on having to buy a bag of carrots

657
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,820
to have something for the reindeer.

658
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,380
They'll just have to wait for another house.

659
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,220
We used to do that when we were real little.

660
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,820
I think we may have done a carrot one year,

661
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,660
but I don't know that.

662
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,340
My mom probably forgot.

663
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,460
Maybe we did it more, maybe I'm forgetting.

664
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,140
Yeah, we would leave the cookies and milk out.

665
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Also, we insist, Christmas day snacks,

666
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,420
you gotta have the little smokeys rolled up

667
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,420
in like Pillsbury dough, like crescent rolls or biscuit roll.

668
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,620
With the little sausages?

669
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,380
The little sausage hot dog things.

670
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,100
For Christmas morning?

671
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,900
No, for like Christmas afternoon snacks before dinner.

672
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,500
Okay, so like as appetizers for Christmas dinner.

673
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,940
What is your Christmas dinner?

674
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,780
Back East outside of Philly,

675
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,820
everyone kind of does the same sort of thing

676
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,700
of like meatballs in the crock pot, honey glazed ham.

677
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,500
Excuse me, green bean casserole.

678
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,860
You're salivating just thinking about it.

679
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,420
Kind of a buffet, like a little,

680
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,460
you make a little buffet, you make a plate.

681
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,300
What else?

682
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,180
I'm trying to think of, yeah, we do stockings.

683
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
We've talked about it before.

684
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,980
You would get a citrus in your stocking or no?

685
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,900
That was like my grandfather's thing.

686
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,100
He would give us all orange,

687
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,540
like the citrus in the stocking.

688
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,420
That was a real treat.

689
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,580
Or a tangerine.

690
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,340
We would get a tangerine once in a while.

691
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,900
Now, also very easy to forget

692
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,860
if you don't immediately empty your stocking.

693
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,980
If you leave your stuff in your stocking for a little bit,

694
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,860
you will get a second gift of a moldy.

695
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,940
Use the citrus.

696
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,300
I don't know that that ever happened to us.

697
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,340
Did you forget an orange in a stocking when you were here?

698
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,180
Yes, yes.

699
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,020
Really?

700
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,860
You're referring to.

701
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,020
Yeah, absolutely.

702
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,580
Yeah, yeah, I usually do Christmas Day at my mom's

703
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,980
and then 26 go down to my dad's

704
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,340
and do Christmas there too.

705
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,740
So, divorced kid, you get two Christmases.

706
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,580
Double presents?

707
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,420
Double presents, maybe.

708
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,700
Was it truly double presents?

709
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,540
Yes.

710
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,380
It was.

711
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,180
So was the same amount you would have gotten.

712
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,700
So the same amount you would have gotten at once

713
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,860
and then literally doubled.

714
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,700
It wasn't that they.

715
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,580
Yeah, but I didn't have like champagne.

716
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,300
I just wanted books and comics and stuff.

717
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,860
You would say you didn't have champagne taste for Christmas?

718
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,780
Yeah, I didn't have champagne taste.

719
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,740
I feel like a lot of kids I went to high school with

720
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,820
were getting like computers and cars and shit for Christmas.

721
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,140
Cars?

722
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,620
Yeah, I know like, I remember kids in high school.

723
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,580
It's like, yeah, he like totaled that Honda Civic

724
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,060
but his parents just got him a new one.

725
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,700
And it's like, in what world did that family live in?

726
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,620
I mean, I would once in a while get a video game system.

727
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,020
Honestly, maybe that happened once.

728
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,460
Maybe I got Nintendo.

729
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,420
Every few years we'd upgrade the systems.

730
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,060
My grandmother bought Super Nintendo

731
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,820
and then I saved up money for Nintendo 64.

732
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,300
So maybe I got a Game Boy as well one year.

733
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,700
Well, you know what I got twice was

734
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,460
we're going to Disney World in a couple days.

735
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,260
I got that when I was seven and nine.

736
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,100
A quick turnaround.

737
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,140
Those were my first two trips.

738
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,940
They were both like surprise

739
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,340
and it's in a few days, so get ready.

740
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,180
Wow.

741
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,260
Surprise and holiday season Disney World.

742
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,100
Twice.

743
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,940
That's pretty good.

744
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,860
That's great.

745
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,780
The first one I was just so caught off guard.

746
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,060
I didn't even know how to process.

747
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,580
And the second I wanted to weep, I'm like again?

748
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,220
Like how can I be seven and nine?

749
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,060
And then my sister who liked it a lot less

750
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,940
who was like much more overwhelmed.

751
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,660
She, I think the second year I was like, oh my God.

752
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,780
And she was like, no.

753
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,260
She cried because she had to go.

754
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,100
Oh no.

755
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,920
Oh wow.

756
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,540
So she needed consoling.

757
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,740
But I loved Disney World as much as like four kids

758
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,500
would.

759
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,660
My love was times four, any other child.

760
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,020
So that made up for that they were like terrifying

761
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,180
their daughter to have to go back.

762
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,020
Geez.

763
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,780
She made it through.

764
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,600
We all had fun.

765
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,440
Sure.

766
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,500
One more Sheridan tradition that I just do

767
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,180
to see how quickly my mom will notice it.

768
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,660
My one aunt got very into ceramics for a few years

769
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,900
and gave us ceramics like with like gift cards

770
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,740
a lot for years.

771
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,060
And one of them is what I call the Christmas seal.

772
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,180
And it's a seal that's painted all white

773
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,940
and it's got a little Santa hat on.

774
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,140
And a few times during the holiday season

775
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,260
I will swap that out with baby Jesus in the manger.

776
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,100
And Christmas seal will be in the nativity scene

777
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,540
until someone notices.

778
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,700
I do something similar to this in the last couple years

779
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,940
in the manger scene in my house.

780
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,820
I will find the beanie baby Hope that is praying.

781
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,020
It's the beanie baby that has its paws together

782
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,860
and its eyes closed.

783
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,420
And I will put Hope into the manger scene

784
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,780
next to Mary and Joseph and the wise men.

785
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,620
That's nice.

786
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,380
And I don't think it's that sacrilegious,

787
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,820
but I enjoy seeing a giant beanie baby

788
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,460
towering over everyone in the nativity.

789
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,300
That's fun.

790
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,500
I think as a kid I might've put Batman in there

791
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,380
and they were like, Scott, that's not funny.

792
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,040
That was scolded.

793
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,400
It's very cute that you like to do these kinds of things,

794
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,740
but not in this case.

795
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,860
Well, in a way Thomas and Martha Wayne died for our sins.

796
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,420
So Batman would protect us.

797
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,820
It's a good way to think about it.

798
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,420
I have one here.

799
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,100
I have a question from Rich McCarthy.

800
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,580
First question on the Facebook post.

801
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,740
And this came from a lot of people too,

802
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,180
but this is the first one I saw.

803
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,940
What other rides need a holiday overlay?

804
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,860
Well, we talked a little bit about this,

805
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,460
I think two years ago.

806
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,460
I think we were talking about doing the flight of passage

807
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,140
overlay where you would throw presents.

808
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,340
And I think we didn't come up with that.

809
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,980
I think our listeners said it should be called

810
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,860
like Feliz Navidad, which I think we were not clever enough

811
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,700
to think of.

812
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,740
So that one, I think the recap of that was that you would be

813
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,320
on the back of the mighty Akron,

814
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,760
but like there would be a VR component

815
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,540
where you'd throw presents as you were flying.

816
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,040
Oh, to distribute them to other.

817
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,520
So like Santa needed help and you were enlisted

818
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,320
on the back of the Akron.

819
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,920
So we got that one covered.

820
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,480
That's all I wanna say before.

821
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,880
Also on Twitter, somebody brought up,

822
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,180
Rich Uncle Skull and brought up King Kong

823
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,720
having a psanahat.

824
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,080
And he asked what would be the best goofy over the top.

825
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,880
I'm trying to think even like realistically,

826
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,360
cause there's like, what would they actually do?

827
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,560
Cause some of them, like I just mentioned,

828
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,240
I think that Halloween Cars Land thing is really adorable.

829
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,320
They do Christmas stuff too, right?

830
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,480
I believe so.

831
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,400
In the land, yeah.

832
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,080
Oh, they really deck out the land.

833
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,480
Not in the ride really.

834
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,060
There's been rumors of stuff on the ride,

835
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,240
but I don't think it's happened yet.

836
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,160
Well, in Credit Coaster and the baby Christ is lost.

837
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,400
Oh, that's good.

838
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
That's good.

839
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,880
So, Edna is watching Christ.

840
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,720
And his baby's sitting.

841
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,760
Yeah, I'm not sure why Christ is in this,

842
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,240
or you just change all,

843
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,480
they're all like doing like an activity story essentially.

844
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,320
Yeah.

845
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,160
So Edna is like the innkeeper.

846
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,120
And so Bob and Helen are married Joseph.

847
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,240
So, does Christ just have Jack Jack's powers then

848
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,200
essentially and he is Christ giant at the end?

849
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,020
Yes.

850
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,860
Yeah.

851
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,700
Okay.

852
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,400
Cause Christ does, he has powers.

853
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,540
Jesus had powers.

854
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,080
And so maybe similar as a baby,

855
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,160
he didn't know how to harness them exactly.

856
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
And he was a mess and they're all coming out

857
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,360
in unexpected ways.

858
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,680
And I was not raised particularly religious,

859
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,200
but is one of Christ's powers a giant growing?

860
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
Is that, is he like giant man?

861
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,320
If you keep him in your heart and he grows big enough.

862
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,160
Yeah.

863
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
Oh, okay.

864
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,240
So that's good.

865
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,320
The faith grows big enough.

866
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,000
Scott, I do have to say that is not funny.

867
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,840
I know.

868
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,960
I can never escape it.

869
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,280
Now that I'm thinking about it.

870
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,120
I'm sorry.

871
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,960
I do still have to watch the ride through

872
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,840
of this base mountain overlay they did with the,

873
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
the gridding with the green lights in Florida.

874
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,280
Oh yeah.

875
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,080
And they do tomorrow land speedway down there

876
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,640
and they get the jingle cruise.

877
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,200
I like the jingle cruise.

878
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,920
I'm sad they don't do it.

879
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,160
But the first year they did it out here was nothing.

880
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah.

881
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And then the second year was just Santa hats on everybody.

882
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,840
Yeah.

883
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,760
But I think they went a little bigger.

884
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,320
What's the, did you know what the difference is?

885
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,160
I don't really know.

886
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,840
I mean, they do different jokes.

887
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,960
Everyone's got Santa hat.

888
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,800
There's pleasant presence floating in the water.

889
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,640
I don't dislike it.

890
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,520
I was just a little underwhelmed the first time

891
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,360
I went on it.

892
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,840
But maybe they're really doing it up in Florida.

893
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,360
You can work backwards from the name

894
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
cause jingle cruises.

895
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,640
So that's almost the main reason to do it is jingle cruise

896
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,480
is so good.

897
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,320
So like, forgive me.

898
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
I don't have this sorted out yet,

899
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,280
but it's like the rock,

900
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,360
the rocking around the Christmas tree coaster.

901
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,680
Oh yeah. That's good.

902
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,520
It's gotta be an Aerosmith version of it.

903
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,560
They would have to, did Aerosmith do any Christmas?

904
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,920
I think they must have at some point.

905
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,880
You would think.

906
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,440
Yeah. So that, that, and then you just make all the lights.

907
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,080
He's got a new hat, a Santa hat.

908
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,040
A Santa hat.

909
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,080
Check out Steven Tyler's Santa hat.

910
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,160
Yeah. And then you could change the radio station

911
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,440
to like Christmas radio.

912
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,400
That seems easy.

913
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,600
Yeah.

914
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,120
Anything where it's mainly music.

915
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,960
Oh, guardians.

916
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,840
Guardians I feel like, yeah.

917
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,440
The holiday overlay for that is one of my favorites.

918
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,280
Yeah. You just need to change the lighting scheme

919
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
on the outside to red and green,

920
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,960
which they change it for the Halloween,

921
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,880
which I think looks very cool when it's just purpley.

922
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,920
There's a lot of colors going on at night

923
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,680
for the regular version.

924
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,840
There's kind of like four color.

925
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,440
It's like green, blue, maybe orange.

926
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,560
I forget, but then it's mostly like dark purple,

927
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,600
which is real cool.

928
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,720
So make it red and green.

929
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,720
And then we just need a new narrative reason

930
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,240
to go back in, I guess.

931
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,000
Like there's maybe a Christmas tree monster

932
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,720
the collector has.

933
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,000
Teaching the collector about Christmas.

934
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,720
Like a grinch sort of angle.

935
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,680
Yeah, but you don't want, we can't get Benicio for that

936
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,880
to shoot more video.

937
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
So we need it to be just like a monster

938
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,400
like in the Monsters After Dark, I feel like.

939
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,960
So you can make Groot and Rocket CGI,

940
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,160
cause the actors, they're busy.

941
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,000
They can't.

942
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,480
Oh, like, yeah, they can just use those.

943
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,280
Well, is Groot a Christmas tree?

944
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,120
Very good.

945
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,280
Do you know how to stop a Christmas tree?

946
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,680
Oh yeah, maybe it's, yeah.

947
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,640
Should, okay.

948
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,400
Yeah, so Groot, maybe a rogue Groot

949
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,520
is like kind of overgrown

950
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,040
and looks like an evil Christmas tree.

951
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,960
And they have to get, they have to stop him.

952
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,840
Yeah.

953
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,520
And it's Rocket and Groot

954
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,680
fighting with a Christmas tree monster.

955
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,520
That's pretty cool.

956
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,680
Now, how about this?

957
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,680
The Guardians of the Galaxy holiday special.

958
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
And you go to a planet full of Rockets,

959
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,480
a planet full of.

960
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,880
Are you just pitching a TV show?

961
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm trying, I think I can meld it into the ride.

962
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,360
I think like if you had to get Rocket

963
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,960
back to his family to celebrate,

964
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,600
like they're like kind of,

965
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
cause they're a little irreverent.

966
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,280
Sure, but you will pitch this as a show.

967
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
I mean, it could be a show,

968
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
but I think you can meld it into the ride.

969
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,040
I think there's a version of it in the,

970
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,520
like if the ride is making fun of the holiday special.

971
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,560
It's a little less exciting.

972
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,760
It's a little less exciting.

973
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,680
So you're just saying like,

974
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,800
instead of like exciting action,

975
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,400
we open up and then there's just a family reunion of Rockets

976
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,600
and then we drop.

977
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,200
You go to one floor only and then like,

978
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,440
Ma, I missed you Ma.

979
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,040
I'm sorry, I ain't always been the son that I wanna be.

980
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,400
Special on Disney plus seems like the,

981
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,080
yeah, the easier version of it, I guess.

982
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,920
I don't know.

983
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,680
I like your version where you go up in the elevator

984
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,280
and you just watch a special for 30 minutes

985
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,000
and then the elevator slowly goes back down.

986
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,320
And then to us, the child is born.

987
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,560
Yeah, and he like gives the-

988
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,080
Raccoon child, don't call me a raccoon.

989
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,160
Rocket Raccoon gives the Linus speech

990
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,080
in the Charlie Brown special.

991
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
Lights, please.

992
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Yeah, and then you just watch it up there

993
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,040
and there's just no, it's not exciting at all.

994
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
It's just watching a nice little movie.

995
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,920
But they drop you once at the end,

996
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,200
like, oh, we're late, we're late for the friends Christmas.

997
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,080
We're late for the potluck on the spaceship.

998
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,680
They just drop you.

999
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,920
Well, I think it's different plots in every,

1000
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,160
that's what's- That's good.

1001
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,600
In one, it's still like an up and down.

1002
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,880
It's inviting a tree monster.

1003
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,080
And then the other, you slowly ascend

1004
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,880
and essentially go to mass.

1005
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,440
Let's take it all the way that it's like,

1006
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,080
you with Rocket and his family attend an hour long mass

1007
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,800
at the top of the tower.

1008
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,280
And then slowly come back down.

1009
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,800
That one has to be slow, just out of respect.

1010
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,160
Because that's a ride that elderly people can go on

1011
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,440
till you want all ages to be able to.

1012
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,600
It's our first, like picturing roadie in front of something.

1013
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,640
It's like, and this is our first attraction in Latin.

1014
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,480
This is-

1015
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,320
This is-

1016
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,520
We all, the team of Imagineers all had to learn,

1017
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,600
we all studied for three years

1018
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,400
so that we could accurately write dialogue in Latin.

1019
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,240
Yeah.

1020
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,280
I like that we're putting a lot more religion

1021
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,120
into the park with these two overlays.

1022
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,320
That's the main thing we want, clearly.

1023
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,160
Yeah.

1024
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,080
Well, that's good.

1025
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,280
What do we, hmm, what mall in Glendale

1026
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,920
should you do your Christmas shopping?

1027
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,520
Says Americana at brand memes.

1028
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,360
Oh, come on.

1029
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,600
Oh, very gay, you know, let's give the Galleria some love.

1030
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,440
Yeah, the Galleria.

1031
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,280
How about that?

1032
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,120
I say Galleria, yeah.

1033
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,720
How about that other, how about like the,

1034
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,800
it's like the marketplace or something

1035
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,200
that has like the Rubio's and the Michaels

1036
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,880
and the Cost Plus, how about that?

1037
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,000
How about we don't even go anywhere near your Americana

1038
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,960
and your Galleria, take that Americana brand memes.

1039
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,680
The Galleria's enclosed and we have rainy spells

1040
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,920
and cold snaps and the winter here in LA, so.

1041
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,600
Plus they've got a big old Dunkin' Donuts

1042
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,720
in the Galleria now.

1043
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,280
They've, they've, yeah, very good, yes.

1044
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,760
Desserts and treats, I'm sure there's nowhere

1045
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,480
to get those at the Americana.

1046
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,320
And-

1047
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,720
We won this argument, great.

1048
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,080
Mike, what do you have on Instagram?

1049
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,920
Anything over there?

1050
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,360
I'm looking, a lot of people asking about the overlay.

1051
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,800
This is not, well, this is not a holiday question.

1052
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,680
Have you ever tried to sneak alcohol into the park?

1053
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,240
This person, Frank Potts, 81, did on Halloween.

1054
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,160
Answer, no, I've never tried it.

1055
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,080
A friend of ours tried, brought it in

1056
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,120
and a couple months ago when we were there,

1057
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,640
I won't out-hood it was.

1058
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,680
What?

1059
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,280
We were with a friend of ours.

1060
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,120
Was I there?

1061
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,520
I believe you were there.

1062
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,720
And he had like a soda bottle.

1063
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,440
And you're not gonna out him even though this is a thing

1064
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,880
that no one could possibly get in trouble for.

1065
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,720
I mean, I will.

1066
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,680
It's not bad to do.

1067
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,520
I will, it's Andrew Grissom.

1068
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,360
It's Andrew Grissom, yeah, yeah, I thought so, yeah.

1069
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,200
Yeah, yeah.

1070
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,020
I was like, oh wow.

1071
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,040
I think Kyle brought it up when he was here.

1072
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
I think they'll still sneak bottles in.

1073
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,640
I don't think it's that crazy.

1074
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,120
I only haven't done it because I look forward

1075
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,160
to Disney's beer and wine selections so much.

1076
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,000
That's right, me too.

1077
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,280
McCarthy Manhattan.

1078
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,840
We figured out how to make McCarthy Manhattans.

1079
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,600
Could I just take a thermos of them around the park?

1080
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,320
Sure, would that be disgusting?

1081
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,160
Probably.

1082
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,040
That honestly, that is the dorkiest reason, but it is true.

1083
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,240
Why sneak in alcohol when I could enjoy what they have?

1084
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,820
I don't think since I've been handed my undergraduate degree,

1085
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,320
I've snuck alcohol into anything.

1086
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,340
Not like a movie theater.

1087
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,240
Sometimes I'll like, if it's a theater

1088
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,600
that doesn't offer booze,

1089
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,000
because movie theaters will always give you

1090
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,200
just a cup of ice and then you can,

1091
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
then you're not paying some $19.

1092
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,840
Oh, I suppose, yeah, maybe.

1093
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,760
But honestly, I hate fiddling in the dark at movies.

1094
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,600
I like to get everything,

1095
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,520
I would rather have a drink beforehand

1096
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,800
or something beforehand and then go sit down.

1097
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,800
I like to be, I like to sit very still and watch a movie.

1098
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,340
So I like to drape my coat over, like myself,

1099
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,520
like a little blanket and then if I have a drink.

1100
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,160
You drape a coat over yourself?

1101
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,600
I get cold very easily at movies.

1102
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,260
Yeah, I turn my coat around and I have a little blanket.

1103
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,520
I've been to many movies with you.

1104
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,520
I don't recall seeing you snuggled up in your own coat.

1105
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,800
Well, it's usually more mild out here.

1106
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,680
Why not wear the coat?

1107
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,600
It's not the same effect.

1108
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,080
It's not the same, I like to be cozy.

1109
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
It's cozier.

1110
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,040
If you go backwards with it,

1111
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,200
it's more like a snuggie or something.

1112
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,040
Yeah, kind of, I think I feel.

1113
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,360
But if you zip the jacket up,

1114
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,240
wouldn't it be the same as far as keeping in heat?

1115
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,640
I suppose, but I think it's a psychological thing

1116
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,800
more than it's. It is, like, yeah,

1117
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,240
no, I'm not disputing that.

1118
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,220
Yeah, but if I have candy or,

1119
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,240
I like to get that set and not really,

1120
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,860
I turn my phone all the way off.

1121
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,880
I don't like to fiddle around in the movies.

1122
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,240
But do you ever have,

1123
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,080
but do you ever just have a drink with you?

1124
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,560
Yeah, I have a drink.

1125
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,320
Like movie, popcorn or soda or candy is,

1126
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,520
I'm okay with that.

1127
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,560
Or if I'm passing something back and forth,

1128
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,800
that is the maximum amount of fiddling.

1129
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,200
But when you're in a movie and you were to sneak alcohol

1130
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,240
in which I'm trying to even think of,

1131
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,320
I've done it maybe, maybe,

1132
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,120
you wouldn't be sneaking a flask in and out of your coat.

1133
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,920
You can just put it in the drink.

1134
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,840
No one's coming by to sniff your drink.

1135
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,880
I guess so.

1136
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,920
Yeah, and you can, and if you're just,

1137
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,400
if you bring just a beer can in,

1138
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,600
that's just a quick pop.

1139
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,440
That's not like a.

1140
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,760
It's like drink, like in the middle of the movie.

1141
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,520
All right, drink inspector here.

1142
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,840
Some guy goes up and down the aisle,

1143
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,160
like sniffing every drink.

1144
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
When we went to go.

1145
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,320
You with the blanket jacket, you're busted.

1146
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,640
Get out of here.

1147
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,400
Honestly, I think when we went to go see like end game,

1148
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,240
when we went to go see a slightly out of focus end game.

1149
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,720
Yeah, oh yeah, that was out of focus, yeah.

1150
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,320
The projector bulb needed to be changed end game.

1151
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,600
And we went to McGuffin's and I got like a Jameson

1152
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,440
and ginger ale.

1153
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,520
I think that was the first time I had a drink in the movies.

1154
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,360
At McGuffin's, yeah.

1155
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Really, they have it wait anywhere?

1156
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,840
Yeah, I've been to like an Alamo draft house style one

1157
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,800
and I think I just got food.

1158
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,160
I just need to drink, at least have some water

1159
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,000
during the movie.

1160
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,880
Like I drink a lot of water during the day

1161
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,480
or else I get a headache.

1162
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,760
So you aren't movie drinkers.

1163
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,600
No.

1164
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,520
I mean, I go to McGuffin's,

1165
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,760
I know I've had a drink from McGuffin's I'll bring in.

1166
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,840
I don't recall if I've snuck.

1167
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,200
I don't think so.

1168
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I did sneak alcohol into a wrestling show.

1169
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Although now that I think about it,

1170
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,640
I just sort of drank it quickly on the street, like a bum.

1171
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Oh boy.

1172
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,480
Because I didn't wanna get caught.

1173
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,160
The prices were.

1174
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,000
You're a little too worried about getting caught.

1175
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,600
Well, they pat you down sometimes at the show.

1176
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,280
So I just didn't wanna have,

1177
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,040
that might've been an issue.

1178
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,800
So this one was just mostly like,

1179
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
it's so expensive there.

1180
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,440
If you're, I think it was a battle of Los Angeles

1181
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,200
where it was like three days in a row.

1182
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,120
And I'm like, if I add up like beers,

1183
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,240
I'm just like one of these days,

1184
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,400
I'm just gonna be a scumbag one of these days.

1185
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,640
A scumbag.

1186
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,080
It's your scumbag if you sneak alcohol in

1187
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,840
and you didn't wanna out our friend

1188
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,360
for having a water bottle with two sips of rum in it.

1189
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,760
I think I was being nice to him.

1190
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Too nice maybe.

1191
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,040
You can argue that, fair.

1192
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,240
But no, he's a scumbag.

1193
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,640
He's fucking scumbag.

1194
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,840
He's a scumbag like me.

1195
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,440
He makes a point of not listening to the podcast

1196
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,160
even though it's in the Facebook group.

1197
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,200
So hey, somebody listening to this who knows him,

1198
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,040
pass along you and your alcohol water bottle.

1199
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,200
You're a scumbag.

1200
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,480
Yeah, yeah, let him know.

1201
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,360
Let him know.

1202
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,720
Let him know.

1203
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,000
I have a general hotly question I told you.

1204
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,120
Question for you guys and also for the listeners.

1205
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,880
Something that I got on, I've always wondered,

1206
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,960
but especially yesterday,

1207
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,080
I tried it at Trader Joe's.

1208
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,280
Do your guys' family, do you know what panettone is?

1209
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,760
It's that sort of, it's Italian Christmas bread

1210
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,000
and it's the one that comes in a little box.

1211
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,840
No.

1212
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,680
Have you ever seen this?

1213
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,480
It sounds familiar but I haven't done it.

1214
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,560
So every Italian deli back east

1215
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,320
has boxes and boxes and boxes of this stuff

1216
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,800
for the holidays and Trader Joe's

1217
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,040
has giant displays of it nowadays.

1218
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,760
And I have some here.

1219
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,560
I got a mini one yesterday.

1220
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,040
If anyone wants to try any,

1221
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,120
but it's literally just like kind of a sweet bread.

1222
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,520
Like I cut a chunk off.

1223
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,920
You just have a little tin foil.

1224
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,760
I have a little tin foil.

1225
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,000
A tiny amount of bread.

1226
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,080
And it's got like candyed raisins,

1227
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,160
like raisins and like dried oranges in it

1228
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,680
if anyone wants to try any.

1229
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,640
It's not the most appealing display.

1230
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,480
No, it looks gross.

1231
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,320
It does look great.

1232
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,160
It looks gross.

1233
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,000
But it's like-

1234
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,840
If you really want us to do it, I will do it.

1235
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,560
It's kind of nothing.

1236
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,160
And I think it's like a holdover.

1237
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,680
I think it's a tradition that's like a holdover

1238
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,440
before people figured out how to make like sweets.

1239
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,680
Like it's fine.

1240
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,520
Try it.

1241
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,560
Just rip off a piece.

1242
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,400
All right, fine.

1243
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,080
It's like, this isn't amazing.

1244
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,920
But if any listeners like was a panettone-

1245
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,600
Has this been in your car or was this in-

1246
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,120
It was just on like a kitchen counter.

1247
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,840
And then I put it in my bag.

1248
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,440
It kind of reminds me a little of Pan de Muertos,

1249
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,280
the bread of the dead from day of the dead,

1250
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,120
but without the liquorice kind of flavor.

1251
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,400
Oh, wait, I forgot you had wax paper like an idiot.

1252
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,240
I don't know.

1253
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,440
Do what you will, Scott.

1254
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,800
Oh, I made something similar to this.

1255
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,360
Yeah, I guess it's the Italian equivalent of fruitcake.

1256
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,200
All right.

1257
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,280
That's fine.

1258
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,120
But it's just so-

1259
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,940
Why are we eating this?

1260
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,960
It's so ubiquitous back East.

1261
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,640
I was just wondering like if you guys had done it,

1262
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,240
cause I was just like, it's, again,

1263
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,640
the Trader Joe's display was huge at the Burbank one.

1264
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,480
Okay.

1265
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,320
And multiple flavors.

1266
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,680
I mean, I think they had like,

1267
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,080
this was just the individual sized one

1268
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,360
and I didn't want to get a giant like,

1269
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,020
I'm sure the caramel one or chocolate one

1270
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,680
is a little more fun.

1271
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,520
Uh-huh.

1272
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,240
Scott, any thoughts?

1273
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,280
This was all your attempt to make that

1274
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,640
a panettone of the business expense.

1275
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,240
You can write it off.

1276
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,080
This one-

1277
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:10,900
Talked about it on the show.

1278
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,740
199.

1279
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,580
Yeah, it's out of it.

1280
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,420
You said that.

1281
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,600
You like made, you sent a special email to an accountant.

1282
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,440
Every two dollars.

1283
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,800
So just so you know, when you see that $2 charge,

1284
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,120
that is, we did talk about,

1285
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,680
and here's a file and I'll also give you a free month

1286
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,160
on the Patreon so you hear it.

1287
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,720
All right, are we done with the bread?

1288
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,560
Yeah, that's fine.

1289
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,040
But listeners, tweet at me, like, if you're like,

1290
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,000
no, this was a big thing for us.

1291
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,840
This is a big,

1292
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,440
clearly it's called Italian Christmas bread.

1293
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,920
So clearly it's a thing that some Italian families,

1294
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,400
but it just seems so odd.

1295
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,280
It's like, here is a cake in like a box,

1296
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,480
like a cardboard paper box.

1297
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,880
There's somebody on Instagram, Mel Schneff,

1298
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,800
who is asking us to review something called

1299
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,940
Text Me Merry Christmas,

1300
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,840
which is a Mickey and Minnie friends show,

1301
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,260
maybe at Disney World that I don't know about,

1302
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,840
which I think we should just put a pin in to look into.

1303
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,320
Text Me, yeah, that's the way, that's a live show.

1304
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,680
I believe that she's, she's been costuming the show

1305
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,240
four times a night since rehearsal in mid October.

1306
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,080
Okay.

1307
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,920
So we'll have to look into that.

1308
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,720
Yeah, yeah, well that requires some research.

1309
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
You have something?

1310
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,240
Not, not especially.

1311
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,080
I mean, I have another thing.

1312
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,080
It's not holiday.

1313
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,920
Sure.

1314
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,320
Rate Hall of Presidents, Carousel of Progress,

1315
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,680
and Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln

1316
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,600
based only on animatronic hotness,

1317
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,680
asked by Coward, Coward Lantis.

1318
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,680
Wait, wait, what were they again?

1319
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,760
Hall of Presidents, Carousel of Progress,

1320
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,240
and Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln

1321
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,400
based only on animatronic hotness.

1322
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,840
That's weird because there's so many for the occasional.

1323
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,320
You know, you wouldn't, okay,

1324
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,860
Hall of Presidents has to go down there

1325
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,640
because like, while I, while maybe Lincoln himself

1326
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,940
is a little handsome, Lincoln is,

1327
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,240
obviously we all agree Lincoln is very handsome.

1328
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,360
Yeah, of course.

1329
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,240
But Lincoln has his own thing, which is in the list.

1330
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,680
And then like, when you think about

1331
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,800
who is like kind of a handsome president,

1332
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,680
if you consider Obama a handsome president,

1333
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,240
the animatronic is not.

1334
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,120
That's a really, that's a particularly inaccurate.

1335
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,400
And would I be the first ever to point out

1336
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,120
that the Trump animatronic is creepy?

1337
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,200
I'm not sure anyone's made that observation,

1338
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,800
but I will. I have noticed.

1339
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,480
So you got to dock your points for that.

1340
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,520
And then like hotness, I got to include Carousel of Progress,

1341
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,640
which has like miners in it.

1342
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,800
Well, you don't have to rate the miners, I guess.

1343
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,640
Let's take them out of the equation.

1344
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,960
Take the miners out of the equation.

1345
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,120
Are we just mainly talking John?

1346
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,960
I mean, we're talking John.

1347
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,960
John and his wife.

1348
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,480
And his wife is very fetching.

1349
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,320
Uncle.

1350
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,160
Uncle Orville.

1351
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,640
Uncle Orville.

1352
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,840
The drunk who's drying out in a bathtub.

1353
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,800
Hot.

1354
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,480
Is he, is Orville hot?

1355
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,320
I don't know.

1356
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,580
I don't know.

1357
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,420
I think John is maybe era appropriate hot.

1358
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,300
I think he's the least hot in the last scene,

1359
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,460
in the 90s scene.

1360
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,300
He looks creepy.

1361
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,340
The daughter's in college in one scene.

1362
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,180
She gets to college.

1363
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,460
Well, I still don't need to talk about

1364
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,700
a college girl's hotness on this show.

1365
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,660
Yeah, it's probably that.

1366
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,340
Well, and that whole attraction is full of the dad

1367
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,180
kind of like offering her up to be ogled.

1368
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,700
So. That's true.

1369
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,940
We got to stay away from that.

1370
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,780
So.

1371
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,940
Let's just, what era of John is the hottest?

1372
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,740
Jason, you should have an opinion about this.

1373
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,940
Yeah.

1374
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,180
I mean, he's kind of a little more of a,

1375
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,180
a little more distinguished in the last one,

1376
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,140
a little older.

1377
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,900
You like him in the 90s.

1378
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,820
I think he's the least hot in the 90s.

1379
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,180
I was going to say, I think he's too clean cut in the 90s.

1380
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,380
I think kind of like the 50s,

1381
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,420
there might be a little bit of a Don Draper kind of

1382
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,580
more vibe to him then, you know?

1383
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,860
I don't know.

1384
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860
They seem pretty identical to me,

1385
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,860
but maybe if style supports hotness,

1386
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,180
then probably more fifth,

1387
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,860
it's not in the 50s, it's more like 40s, right?

1388
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,220
Whatever era he's not like waving himself with a paper fan,

1389
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,060
because I don't think you could be considered,

1390
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,140
well, you're literally hot.

1391
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:56,980
He's literally, yeah.

1392
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,220
When I think about what is a hot man,

1393
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,900
I don't think of like, oh my, the vapors.

1394
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,940
I don't associate that with hotness.

1395
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,940
90s Sarah in like her business casual glasses.

1396
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:11,980
Sure.

1397
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,820
I gotta say.

1398
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,660
Wait, is Sarah his wife?

1399
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,340
Yeah.

1400
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,540
Jason loves John's wife on the carousel of progress.

1401
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,260
He called her fetching a minute ago.

1402
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,100
Fetching.

1403
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,940
She's fetching?

1404
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,620
We're trying to just write John and he keeps calling,

1405
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,060
but yeah, but Sarah, have you seen Sarah?

1406
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,380
I think the two of them together.

1407
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,420
Oh, you want to do a three thing.

1408
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,100
I might be the unicorn.

1409
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,300
You have these things threesome, snail.

1410
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,340
Have you heard about her work?

1411
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,580
Sarah and I are thinking of joining a polycule.

1412
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,380
It's a triad.

1413
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,900
We're looking for what they call a third.

1414
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,620
Anyone out there?

1415
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,580
Sarah and I are on this thing, bumble.

1416
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,580
Yeah, you can put in your specifications

1417
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,020
of what you're looking for.

1418
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,220
One of these things, key parties.

1419
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,580
Usually use that bowl to make a jello mold,

1420
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,620
but I guess you put all your keys in it

1421
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,060
and that's how you figure out

1422
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,380
how you're going to have sex with someone.

1423
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,380
Sure.

1424
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,020
Say to my lady friend, this is John and Sarah

1425
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,340
and we'd all go out to dinner and have some drinks.

1426
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,780
And what do you guys do?

1427
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,420
Oh, we're animatronics from a revolving robot show.

1428
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,740
I thought you looked familiar.

1429
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,580
Yeah, that's me.

1430
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're a senior.

1431
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,420
Do you know the song?

1432
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,380
I'll just do the song.

1433
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,660
There's a great big.

1434
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,500
Oh, yeah, of course.

1435
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,780
You don't have to do the song.

1436
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,700
We don't want to put you on the spot.

1437
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,420
I'm looking through John's looks

1438
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,340
and a lot of the closeups are a bit harrowing,

1439
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,580
a bit terrifying.

1440
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,980
But as far as his look that maybe now makes

1441
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,780
is like the most modern is definitely what I think the 50s.

1442
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,900
He's got the sweater, the dress shirt

1443
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,420
and then he's kind of got kind of a neckerchief thing

1444
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,540
going on it looks like, which I appreciate.

1445
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,260
But yeah, this one, that's kind of too old timey for me.

1446
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,660
That's the fan, a Niagara Falls fan.

1447
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,500
Yeah.

1448
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,740
I'm gonna say no on that.

1449
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,940
I do like this look.

1450
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,620
I think that's the worst look, honestly,

1451
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,500
is the, and then this look is the first one,

1452
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,540
which I like, but maybe not that hot.

1453
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,660
A green sweater.

1454
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,420
It's a smoking jacket.

1455
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,700
Yeah, smoking jacket.

1456
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,060
So I do like that look.

1457
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,700
And then the 50s is this basic sweater combo

1458
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,900
with his neckerchief.

1459
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,620
Anyway.

1460
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,020
Let's, we don't have too much more time.

1461
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,860
I think we should do some quick hits.

1462
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,700
I think there's a couple of questions

1463
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,980
or Jason R Gallagher is one,

1464
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,580
but there's a few variations of just favorite song

1465
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,860
from Country Bear Christmas.

1466
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,060
Country Bear Christmas.

1467
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,940
Here's honest, the truth about Country Bear Christmas.

1468
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,420
I haven't watched it all the way through

1469
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,660
because I wanna be fresh when I see it one day.

1470
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,020
I have not watched all of it.

1471
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,380
So I cannot give you a good assessment.

1472
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,380
I may have to watch it if we do the full,

1473
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,220
no, we don't have to.

1474
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,220
We don't have to do all the Country Bears.

1475
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,900
So I will try, I'm gonna try to see it in Japan

1476
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,580
at some point, which I know is crazy

1477
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,020
because how often am I gonna get to Japan?

1478
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,060
You have to go to Japan during Christmas.

1479
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,340
That's true now that I'm thinking about it.

1480
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,180
So maybe it's dumb

1481
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,580
that I haven't watched it all the way through,

1482
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,020
but I could not answer that question.

1483
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,340
I can answer the, yeah.

1484
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,180
Saving it.

1485
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,180
Let me see.

1486
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,980
Anybody saying anything you like?

1487
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,820
A couple of questions of favorite Christmas treats.

1488
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,100
I'm a big chocolate chip cookie guy

1489
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,620
and I like pecan pie.

1490
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,460
Oh, and eggnog.

1491
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,580
Kind of just eggnog.

1492
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,620
We always had eggnog growing up without the liquor.

1493
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,980
I really drank it with the liquor,

1494
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,700
but I am an eggnog fan.

1495
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,420
Chocolate chip cookies, yeah, I like them.

1496
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,420
My mom makes like, she makes usually four cookies,

1497
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,540
chocolate chip, snickerdoodle,

1498
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,260
which I've never been a huge fan of,

1499
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,580
though maybe I need to get into,

1500
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,700
maybe I need to try again this year.

1501
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,260
Then she makes something called melting moments,

1502
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:57,260
which are very good and I've always liked.

1503
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,100
And I should.

1504
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,580
What are we talking?

1505
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,580
I honestly, I'm trying to think they're,

1506
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,260
let's see what the recipe is.

1507
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,860
I'll just read that on the air.

1508
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,260
They look like this basically.

1509
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,980
They're like kind of butter cookies essentially.

1510
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,620
They look like these.

1511
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,940
Oh, sure, yeah.

1512
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,780
Which I've always been.

1513
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,820
They're a little rich, so maybe you can't have too many,

1514
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,260
but those have always been my favorites

1515
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,820
in addition to the chocolate chip cookies.

1516
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,660
But I'm not, I don't have a ton.

1517
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,900
If people are having eggnog,

1518
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,540
but it's not like a thing I need.

1519
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,700
I don't need it.

1520
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,500
Beth Strutz asks, best Disney Christmas special?

1521
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,380
Movie, TV show, episode or whatever.

1522
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:39,100
I, every Christmas Eve watch Muppets Christmas Carol

1523
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,020
and skip around because the video cassette

1524
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:48,020
has a song in it that is literally called The Love Is Gone

1525
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,140
that Ebeneezer's young fiance,

1526
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,740
when she breaks off their engagement, they sing.

1527
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,580
Oh, that's right.

1528
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,420
And it's brutal.

1529
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,340
It was left out of the theatrical release,

1530
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,140
but then put on the home video one.

1531
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,420
And the Ghost of Christmas Future sequence is terrifying.

1532
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,820
So you skip those?

1533
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,860
I usually skip the song,

1534
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,140
but I will watch the Ghost of Christmas Future

1535
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,380
unless it's getting late.

1536
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,220
I wanna go to bed.

1537
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,060
Sometimes you get tuckered out.

1538
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,460
Sometimes you get tuckered out.

1539
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,460
I don't know if you'd have called this

1540
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,620
an official Disney Christmas special,

1541
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,820
but they probably own it to some extent.

1542
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,420
And you know when it was aired, I think,

1543
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,620
in magical world of Disney kind of slot.

1544
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,860
Muppet Family Christmas, my favorite thing ever.

1545
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,940
That's my favorite Muppet thing literally

1546
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,260
where Sesame Street comes and Fraggle Rock

1547
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,540
and they're all part of it.

1548
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,620
And especially we're recording this

1549
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,540
just in the wake of Carol Spinney's passing,

1550
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,620
the person who played Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch,

1551
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,540
and that's very sad.

1552
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,060
And just like every once in a while, I will remember,

1553
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,460
and I was recalling this right before he passed,

1554
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,460
how the part of the special where the Swedish chef

1555
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,300
is trying to cook Big Bird,

1556
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:05,300
but then Big Bird gives him a bird seed

1557
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,420
that's like a gift because your family's

1558
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,140
all the way back in Sweden.

1559
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,660
When Big Bird is actually taking the time to think,

1560
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,720
Swedish chef is here alone in his Swedish family,

1561
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,380
he doesn't get to be with them.

1562
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,140
I've never considered the family

1563
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,900
of this very broad, silly character.

1564
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,340
And then they sing, have yourself a Merry Christmas,

1565
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,620
but he sings it in blurgy, blurgy.

1566
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,140
But it is such a sweet, wonderful,

1567
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,020
great Carol Spinney performance,

1568
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,940
the reveal when the turkey goes like,

1569
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:38,700
get a load of this, and then there's a lightning strike

1570
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,800
and he sees a giant bird and salivates.

1571
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,900
That whole scene is written very funny,

1572
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,660
performed very funny in RIP Carol Spinney.

1573
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,320
Yeah, honestly, that was my answer,

1574
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,660
even though it might not officially be Disney.

1575
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,860
But just that, the meeting, and that's the only saddest,

1576
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,440
I mean, there's been little crossovers here and there,

1577
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,320
but that's the big, that's the end game crossover

1578
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,160
that you want.

1579
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,680
Like I've said it before, no movie where people

1580
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,920
from multiple worlds meet is as fun and as satisfying as,

1581
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,720
and something like that, what an unexpected character team up.

1582
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,820
Why would you, you don't need to service,

1583
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,440
Big Bird has to meet the Swedish chef,

1584
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,680
but it is so funny that it happens.

1585
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,400
And that's the fun of any of these things,

1586
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,080
these crossovers, you know?

1587
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,320
Like, so yeah, early on, I think Flintstones

1588
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,880
meet the Jetsons I really like too,

1589
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,000
but I think this one was even more impactful to me.

1590
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,120
When somebody asked Muppet Christmas,

1591
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,440
Paul Reagan said Muppet Christmas Carol,

1592
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,200
Muppet Family Christmas or other.

1593
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,000
I watch and love both every year, us too, apparently, Paul.

1594
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,440
I thought, I remember laughing so hard,

1595
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,160
my stomach hurt once when I first saw the Swedish chef.

1596
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,400
I thought that was, he, as a character,

1597
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,080
him like crazy cooking, trying to get a bird,

1598
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,880
like I thought he was so funny.

1599
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,800
And honestly, it is still very funny to me.

1600
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,120
Like it still holds up.

1601
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,760
We're probably gonna wind down here.

1602
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,200
Anybody seeing anything you're dying to get out?

1603
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,000
Let me see.

1604
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,080
A few questions about the fake snow in Disney parks.

1605
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,160
What about it?

1606
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,600
And other play with fans, I like it.

1607
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,560
I think it's fun.

1608
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,400
Fake snow?

1609
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,000
Like the fake snow coming down on Main Street.

1610
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,280
Is it soap?

1611
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,120
What is it?

1612
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:22,960
Do we know?

1613
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,040
It's kind of a soapy.

1614
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,920
I think Disney's is fine,

1615
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,480
but I feel like I've been amidst other fake snow

1616
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,760
that is unpleasant.

1617
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,760
So you just gotta be careful

1618
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,320
what you're making it out of.

1619
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,080
Oh, here's a quick one from Jeff Stewart.

1620
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,400
Is Christmas shoes the worst Christmas song of all time?

1621
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,840
Yeah, it's a little grim.

1622
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,480
Yeah, I don't know.

1623
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,480
There's no way it's the worst, though.

1624
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,600
Yeah.

1625
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,000
It's entertaining.

1626
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,200
It's a journey.

1627
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,320
It's something.

1628
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,040
Yeah, I don't know.

1629
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,120
You have a favorite Christmas song, maybe?

1630
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,240
That's a good question.

1631
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,960
As a kid, it was always like

1632
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,440
rocking around the Christmas tree, I think.

1633
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,920
I always liked the ones that felt more modern.

1634
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,000
Yes, yeah.

1635
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,800
I had a little playlist going at the live show

1636
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,320
the other night, and I think my current answer

1637
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,720
has to be Ray Parker Jr.'s Christmas Time Is Here.

1638
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,560
Oh, I don't even know.

1639
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,520
I don't think I've heard that.

1640
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,080
It was such a delight.

1641
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,480
It's one of the only legit, good, smooth R&B.

1642
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,480
There's also this new edition Christmas album

1643
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,640
that's fantastic.

1644
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,640
Six original songs all done like super Casio synth.

1645
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,520
I gotta hear that.

1646
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,320
So, Elb 6 are a delight.

1647
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,840
Christmas rapping by the waitresses I've always liked.

1648
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,560
I like the McCartney.

1649
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,400
Me, too.

1650
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,240
Yeah.

1651
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,080
It's nice.

1652
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,400
I think some people don't like that.

1653
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,240
I can't believe it's an argument.

1654
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,600
Why am I blanking on it?

1655
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,440
Wonderful Christmas Time.

1656
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,280
Wonderful Christmas Time.

1657
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,160
It's so nice.

1658
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,000
What?

1659
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,840
What?

1660
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,760
There's a big, she likes just the 20 songs

1661
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,920
that play at Christmas, and I'm always trying

1662
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,920
to find other stuff for, I found Back Door Santa.

1663
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,880
Have you heard this song?

1664
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,960
No.

1665
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,320
It's, hold on, let me find it.

1666
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,160
It's really not much of a Christmas song.

1667
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,120
It's really about Back Door Santa coming in

1668
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,560
and having an affair with all the mothers in town,

1669
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,560
but it is on the Christmas compilation.

1670
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,720
This is by Clarence Carter, who did the song Stroken,

1671
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,560
and it's great, and I love it.

1672
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,400
What?

1673
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,560
What?

1674
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,560
It's here, you'll hear a little of it.

1675
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,120
The way I described it makes it sound worse

1676
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:32,960
than it really is.

1677
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,440
You know, I think, oh.

1678
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:39,360
Oh, this song, wait, this sample is famous.

1679
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,200
Yeah.

1680
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,760
Is this the sample in the Ren DMC?

1681
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,600
Oh, maybe.

1682
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,200
Oh, this song, okay.

1683
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,960
I mean, it is.

1684
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,560
I thought it was a novelty song,

1685
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,600
like a redneck comedian singing,

1686
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,960
like Back Door Santa, get to the outhouse.

1687
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,840
Like I was worried that's what it was gonna be.

1688
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,960
No, no, this is a soul.

1689
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,880
This is soul, baby, this is funk and soul.

1690
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,400
I have an oddball.

1691
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,280
I always, at the church I grew up going to,

1692
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,760
an older guy every Christmas would sing a solo

1693
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,920
of Oh Holy Night and would just belt it,

1694
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,560
and it was always like very moving.

1695
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:25,000
And most versions of that are not like belt it,

1696
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,520
but this guy like had the deepest voice.

1697
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,840
And it was, yeah.

1698
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,240
Oh, Johnny.

1699
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,600
And was not a professional singer,

1700
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,280
but was just naturally very gifted.

1701
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,960
And yeah, that was always nice.

1702
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,600
There's a Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton album

1703
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,400
that I like, Christmas album that I like.

1704
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,240
Full album?

1705
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,360
Yeah.

1706
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,360
There's a Bare Naked Ladies Christmas album that I like.

1707
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,960
You gotta respect the whole album.

1708
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,160
The whole album.

1709
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,400
A big song.

1710
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,480
They have their song from the Grinch,

1711
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,480
it's called Green Christmas,

1712
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,440
which is a pretty good original Christmas song.

1713
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,520
Some of them are covers and a few are original.

1714
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,920
This has not aged well.

1715
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,240
I think people have covered this

1716
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,120
and fixed the one word in it,

1717
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,480
cause it's so brutal,

1718
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,480
but Fairy Tale of New York by the Pogues is a great song,

1719
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,760
but there's one moment that is just so awful.

1720
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,160
Like that is aged.

1721
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,760
But I think when people do covers of it now,

1722
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,840
they take that out.

1723
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,320
They slide something out,

1724
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,680
but a very complicated song.

1725
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,200
I wanna give some love to the in sync,

1726
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,640
Merry Christmas,

1727
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,080
happy holiday.

1728
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,400
Yeah, that's kinda nice.

1729
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,680
That reminds me of Christmas at the mall.

1730
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1731
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,440
Having a nice time shopping.

1732
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,160
I just found a music video for it

1733
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,280
that is the cheapest shit.

1734
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,160
In sync was spending a lot of money on music videos

1735
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,000
at the time,

1736
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,080
and for this one it was just like,

1737
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,560
oh God, we got three hours, crap.

1738
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,160
There's a Gary Coleman cameo,

1739
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,000
he's like an elf,

1740
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,520
and then it's all them flying on a green screen.

1741
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,720
It is such a green screen closet.

1742
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,040
I don't know why they couldn't have done this better.

1743
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,880
Video's terrible, song's wonderful.

1744
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,160
They did a whole Disney Christmas special,

1745
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,240
they performed that in front of the Chinese theater.

1746
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,400
I think the newest song,

1747
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,400
I was listening to Country Christmas,

1748
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,440
and there's a George Strait song.

1749
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,920
Probably, maybe it's a cover called Christmas Cookies,

1750
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,360
that sounds a lot like Red Solo Cup,

1751
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,960
which is a song I legitimately think is good.

1752
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,760
A very fun song.

1753
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,560
And maybe he just ripped it off, I don't know,

1754
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,520
or it was the opposite,

1755
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,080
maybe Red Solo Cup ripped this off,

1756
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,920
I have to look into it,

1757
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,960
but Christmas Cookies by George Strait.

1758
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,640
It's good, it's fine.

1759
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,920
I'm quite familiar.

1760
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,640
I feel like I wanna go out with one more audience,

1761
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,760
has anybody seen one?

1762
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,920
Yeah, so many people asked,

1763
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,840
thanks, sorry we didn't get to everything.

1764
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah, thank you for asking.

1765
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,920
Country Bear questions.

1766
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,240
Let's see here.

1767
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,520
Oh, oh, you're in.

1768
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,400
Blair Kuhnsmith, sorry I'm butchering your name,

1769
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,560
do you all put out any parks related Christmas decorations?

1770
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,640
If so, what is your favorite?

1771
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,280
Don't I have a lot of,

1772
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,680
my Christmas tree ornaments are a lot of key chains

1773
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,080
that come from theme parks.

1774
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,600
Oh, that's cute.

1775
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,360
Yeah, actually I think I got a key chain

1776
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,680
from Galaxy's Edge on opening day that's up on the tree now.

1777
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,800
Oh, that's fun.

1778
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,720
My mom gave me a, it's like Christmas,

1779
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,240
Disney World 1989 that she found at an antique store.

1780
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,040
And that's good.

1781
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,320
My dad has a Lucy the Elephant Christmas ball.

1782
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,480
Man, we should do a quick second gate on Lucy the Elephant.

1783
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,200
It's a giant novelty elephant,

1784
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,480
like three story elephant built on the beach

1785
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,880
in Atlantic City that has been at multiple times,

1786
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,760
like an eccentric rich person's house,

1787
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,560
it's been a hotel, now it's a tourist attraction.

1788
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,880
If you see picture of like Atlantic City

1789
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,600
as like a quick mention that's often the image

1790
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,200
even though it's right outside of the city

1791
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,520
and it's a big elephant with the thing you ride in on top

1792
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,120
and you go inside of it, there's different rooms in it.

1793
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:14,960
Weird, I don't know about this.

1794
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,960
It goes back to the novelty,

1795
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,880
when novelty architecture was very big.

1796
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,880
But it survived multiple hurricanes and ocean surges

1797
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,880
and that sort of thing.

1798
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,840
Wow. Yeah.

1799
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,280
Yeah.

1800
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,240
Holiday ornaments?

1801
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,360
Yeah, I'm trying to think.

1802
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,840
It's usually just stuff I already had displayed

1803
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,160
in a different way.

1804
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,800
Last year I put Swing and Teddy Bear

1805
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,240
at the top of the tree.

1806
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,640
Oh, that's right.

1807
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,720
But Lindsay was like, it's too big.

1808
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,000
So now she's just at the bottom of the tree.

1809
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,480
But it's usually just repurposing stuff

1810
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,480
I'm already displaying in the Christmas presentation.

1811
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,120
A friend from college once sent me,

1812
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,840
this isn't theme parky, but it's kind of adjacent.

1813
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,880
It's one of our adjacent ones.

1814
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,600
I think it was bought at the Cracker Barrel gift shop

1815
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,240
and it is Santa in a bright orange hunting vest

1816
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,120
and a woodland camo.

1817
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,320
And that's insane.

1818
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,160
That's a very American Christmas sort of it.

1819
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,120
How about this?

1820
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,320
This is, if I want to go ahead on, from Ryan Ritter.

1821
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,480
If the Universal Studios stairway, Starway,

1822
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,680
had a Christmas overlay,

1823
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,760
much like when it becomes the haunted stairway,

1824
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,920
what do you imagine it would be like?

1825
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:32,840
Like, hey, you know, like, hey, you know,

1826
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,280
tinsel and Christmas trees allowed,

1827
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,080
but other kinds of green, keep it in your pocket.

1828
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,560
That includes me.

1829
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,600
I was going, I'm gonna go the traditional Christmas route

1830
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,440
and it tells you the story of-

1831
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,360
Back door Santa just started playing.

1832
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,680
Back door Santa's sneaking back into the podcast.

1833
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,360
Because it is a little long,

1834
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,960
it tells you the story of Joseph and Mary

1835
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,920
returning to Bethlehem for the Roman census.

1836
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,880
He tells his story.

1837
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,880
And then the ride back up is them trying to check in

1838
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,040
to the inn and there is no room at the inn

1839
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,200
and then the wise men arrive.

1840
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,240
So instead of the regular Billy Bush,

1841
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,920
it's like, but please, my wife is with child.

1842
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,680
Every room is full, but you can go to the barn.

1843
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,280
And then you arrive and like,

1844
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,760
You arrive.

1845
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,440
And don't forget to check out the Simpsons ride

1846
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,000
and Cletus's fried chicken.

1847
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,240
Try the crazy milkshakes on the lower lawn.

1848
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,640
So that is another, we want to put more religion

1849
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,480
in the park.

1850
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,320
Yeah, there were some questions

1851
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,400
about how you can relate to the park.

1852
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,520
Yeah.

1853
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,200
So mainly that it's the, yeah,

1854
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,160
the starway should be a place of prayer.

1855
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,160
Can't it be both?

1856
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,400
Can't it be that voice with jokes

1857
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,120
while he's telling the nativity?

1858
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,960
Oh, there you go.

1859
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,520
But he's also being like, a savior was born.

1860
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,600
Isn't that crazy or whatever?

1861
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,720
Gold frankincense and can't smoke that shit.

1862
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,800
I am totally forget.

1863
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,960
I fucked this up.

1864
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,800
Okay, on the way down, it's the entire,

1865
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,160
the greatest story ever told.

1866
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,480
It's the story about the birth of the Christ child

1867
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,600
on the way back up.

1868
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,040
It's the Maccabees keeping the candle lit

1869
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,440
for eight days and nights.

1870
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,280
It's the Hanukkah story.

1871
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,640
We have represented Hanukkah very poorly.

1872
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,840
So yes, great.

1873
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,360
So there's some like very small representation

1874
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,280
of Hanukkah in the parks.

1875
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,280
Somebody was asking on Instagram and I can't find it.

1876
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,600
So I apologize where I can't see, I can't find your name.

1877
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,240
But he was saying that he was wondering

1878
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,600
if there's a better chance they'll see life day

1879
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,880
in the parks than an actual like Hanukkah celebration

1880
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,720
or true representation.

1881
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,040
Because that's our generation's religion,

1882
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:50,880
Star Wars.

1883
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,720
Star Wars, yeah.

1884
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,560
Good point.

1885
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,600
Guaranteed.

1886
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,200
It would be nice to get more Hanukkah,

1887
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,720
more blue and white in the parks.

1888
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,560
Like that would be very fun.

1889
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,600
Although I believe in the Jewish tradition

1890
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,680
is not one of the major holidays,

1891
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,360
a second more secondary holiday,

1892
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,040
but it's kind of replaced Christmas.

1893
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,400
So why is it only Grinchmas?

1894
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,320
Why can't we also celebrate Grinchica?

1895
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,880
Grinchica should happen.

1896
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,720
Yeah, both.

1897
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,560
Why not?

1898
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,640
There's plenty of time in December, do both.

1899
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,480
Yeah.

1900
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,600
That's, yeah.

1901
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,000
Is that, would they?

1902
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,840
That's crazy.

1903
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,680
Would people be happy about that?

1904
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,520
I don't know.

1905
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,680
The Jewish church be upset?

1906
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,640
I'm not sure.

1907
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,120
I mean, if it's the same deal

1908
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,360
and he's like trying to steal Hanukkah

1909
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,720
and then who teaches him why Hanukkah is nice,

1910
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,560
then that's good.

1911
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,000
That encourages more participation in Hanukkah.

1912
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:40,920
Okay, you're right.

1913
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,760
Yeah.

1914
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,840
All right, so get on it, I guess.

1915
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,160
Grinchica.

1916
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,000
Yeah.

1917
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,960
I'm going to loot all those temples.

1918
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,880
Yeah, you cannot.

1919
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,840
He's stealing the candles on the menorah one by one

1920
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,920
as the song plays.

1921
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,280
Chocolate coins.

1922
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:56,960
I'm going to flush them down the toilet

1923
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,640
and not enjoy them myself.

1924
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,800
If it's them teaching, yes,

1925
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,840
it has to be them teaching him the importance

1926
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,600
and the wonderful story of Hanukkah.

1927
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,600
He cannot be, he cannot be Jewish trying to stop Christmas

1928
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,040
because that gets very problematic.

1929
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,360
Just so we're clear, he is learning that Hanukkah,

1930
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,920
like the story of Hanukkah,

1931
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,440
just as he learned the story of Christmas.

1932
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,200
This isn't a sequel where they say at the beginning,

1933
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,920
oh, so something we forgot to tell you last time,

1934
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,200
the Grinch is Jewish.

1935
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,360
Yeah.

1936
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,560
No, none of that.

1937
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,480
I haven't, unless they're not doing it this year.

1938
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,960
Last year, of course, everyone remembers

1939
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,920
I did a heart-stopping interview with the Grinch

1940
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,600
around Christmas time at Universal.

1941
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,880
I know I haven't been invited to another one,

1942
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,600
but if for some reason I get an invite last second here,

1943
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,760
maybe I will ask him, what do you think about Grinchica?

1944
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,160
Propose the idea of Grinchica.

1945
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,000
Yeah.

1946
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,840
Absolutely.

1947
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,560
And that is when you are quickly ushered out

1948
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,760
because the parts did not take a firm stand on any

1949
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,600
world religions, political events, and it's,

1950
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,440
we're the best.

1951
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,280
I've been waiting.

1952
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,120
Grinchadon.

1953
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,880
I've been waiting to get kicked out of a theme park

1954
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,120
and that'll be the first time.

1955
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:58,960
That'll be why.

1956
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,320
God, see him.

1957
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,560
What is your opinion on God?

1958
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,200
Is God real, Mr. Grinch?

1959
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,160
Decide once and for all

1960
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,440
for the sake of the Universal Movie Company.

1961
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,080
Then they, if he could throw him down the char way.

1962
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,920
Well, you know, God is dead.

1963
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,320
Throw him down and don't even give him an ounce of weed.

1964
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,160
No weed.

1965
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,000
All right.

1966
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,160
Well, Merry Christmas, everybody.

1967
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,640
We'll be back to you soon in the new year,

1968
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,960
very soon in the new year to celebrate a little anniversary.

1969
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,800
We've got a fun thing.

1970
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,160
I think we're at the very beginning of 2020

1971
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,320
and it's going to be a great 2020.

1972
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:43,880
Enjoy some mediocre Italian box bread

1973
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,960
with your loved ones and-

1974
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,800
Take your jacket, snuggle up and see a nice movie.

1975
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,680
See Rise of Skywalker if you haven't.

1976
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,880
Turn your jacket around.

1977
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,720
Turn your jacket around.

1978
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,680
Snuggle up and thanks for surviving podcasts

1979
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,400
throughout all year with us.

1980
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,720
We'll see you soon.

1981
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,560
Happy holidays.

1982
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,400
Happy holidays.
