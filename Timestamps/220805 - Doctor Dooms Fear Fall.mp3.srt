1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Warning, the following podcast contains a dictator magician, an embassy inside a theme

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,600
park, leg danglies, and gallons of a precious natural resource, fear juice.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,000
We secrete some juice and break down Dr. Doom's Fearful on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,080
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, where today we're saying, all glory to Latveria, all hail Doom.

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,880
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm here, yes, and that's the thing you say every morning when you wake up.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,120
I show respect and out of fear.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And respect.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,440
Scott Garner, also here.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
That's right.

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,840
I know what those things mean after the last several days.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,000
Those are things from comics that I know now.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Great.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,080
Well, we'll get you even deeper in soon.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,720
We're talking about beloved attraction, by me at least.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,400
I was gonna say, your beloved attraction.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
By me, solely.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Dr. Doom's Fearful at Universal's Islands of Adventure.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,680
I want to start by asking, have either of you done this attraction?

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
No, no way.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,440
Nor will I ever.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,080
I will.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,280
Absolutely not.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,080
I've made a promise to you, I believe on this podcast, that I will do it next time we go.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,880
Oh, okay.

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
I believe on the show.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,400
Yeah, I think you did.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,200
I said that.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
But I know I have not done this because the legs are dangling.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,160
You know me, I don't like those dangling legs.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,240
So, it's scary.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,440
Even though I love Dr. Doom the man, his ride.

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,160
And you love, but what's the issue in terms of thrills and chills here?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
Is it too much thrill?

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,520
No, but you like thrills.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,240
No, I like thrills.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,440
It's the chill part because you're slowly going up and your legs are dangling.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,880
No, wrong, wrong.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
My, isn't this a-

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,960
That's right.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,680
This is a space shot where you are raised just a few feet to start and then you are launched upwards.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
But you do go a little bit, but that's what I'm saying.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
You do a little chill.

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
It's not completely just a rock and roller coaster or am I wrong?

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,840
That's the problem?

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,040
No, it's like you were talking like a couple feet and then you get the, that's just gearing it up.

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
That's just the engines turning on.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
I guess for some reason I thought that it was, I felt like I knew about the shot,

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,680
but I thought there was a longer section where they would dangle you.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
But I guess if you're saying it's actually seconds and I actually feel better about it.

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,760
Oh, no, sorry.

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,600
You're dangling for a while.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,120
Yeah, I just mean you're lowered off the ground as the ride starts to kick into gear as the Doom

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
narration starts.

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,120
Yes.

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,840
And then you're launched up and you bounce down.

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
So you're dangling for a good while as you bounce down.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
But it's not the kind of ride-

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,040
I guess you're right.

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,440
You're right.

63
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,240
I was just saying-

64
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,480
What kind of up and down this is.

65
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,920
I believe it is an up and then kind of an up and down, back and forth, up and down.

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,680
It is not a slow up and then fast down and that's the end,

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,880
which might involve a between up and down dangle.

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,400
Yeah.

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,360
Dangling is just a, it just happens between like-

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,080
I had the incorrect-

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
By virtue of that you're going up and down.

72
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,720
I had the incorrect impression that you were dangling early before the up.

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,880
So what you're saying, yes, it's seconds of dangle, up, dangle, dangle, dangle, dangle,

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,200
dangle.

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
That's the most significant dangle.

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,440
But a low, that first dangle, we got a downplay.

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,400
That's a low dangle.

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,880
Yeah.

79
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,280
Okay.

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,840
Yeah.

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,320
So it's a low dangle, up.

82
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,280
That's sort of like if your mom or dad, when you were a kid would do like upies,

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
you know, if they would pick you up and do upies.

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
I was wrong.

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
I guess I totally was messing up the order.

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,960
But then go upies that's 200 feet in the air after that.

87
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
That's very intense.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You feel a lot of downward.

89
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,320
That's a thrill.

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
The downward pressure you feel.

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,040
Okay.

92
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,640
So you go danglies, but not severe danglies, little danglies.

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,320
Little danglies.

94
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,840
Little low danglies.

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,040
Little low danglies.

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
Then you go upies.

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
You go way upies.

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:24,960
Yeah.

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
You want to put the Cs on it.

100
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,880
That's fine.

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,040
Yeah.

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,360
Okay.

103
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,680
Yeah.

104
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,080
Way upies.

105
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,840
You don't go to the very top.

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,920
You don't go to the spiky top.

107
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,080
That is not upies to the spikies.

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,560
Right.

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
I knew that.

110
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,840
So you go upies and then you danglies for, what would you say?

111
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
Well, this is about a 90 second experience.

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
So you don't do it for very long.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
But there's no point.

114
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
What I'm saying is there's no point mid-air where you were purely stuck.

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,560
You go upies, then back downies, upies, downies, upies, ping pong back and forth until you land.

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,120
Even though I was watching.

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
There's no still dangle.

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,040
Yeah.

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,200
Even though I was watching the video, I guess in my mind, in the same way that Splash Mountain

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,800
and your child brain, even though I didn't do this when I was a child,

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,960
you Splash Mountain, your child brain on that Jim Varney special, you were building it up.

122
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,040
I guess in my head when I was thinking about it, I was still thinking about it as if those

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
terror moments were bigger than they were.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,080
Because I think what you're saying makes a, I think here's what's going to happen.

125
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,120
The chill on the ride, which is the danglies for me, the chill is the scare part.

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,520
We didn't, you know what?

127
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,320
The part that I don't like.

128
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
Really quick, chills and thrills was a discussion from the second gate.

129
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,520
Yeah.

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
Would you like to bring the main feed audience in on the thrills and chills?

131
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,920
Yeah, you're right.

132
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,880
I completely forgot about that.

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
This is a big breakthrough recently made on the second gate of patreon.com.

134
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,400
Right.

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,200
So if you want to see the, hear the origin, go there.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,480
So basically we were figuring out that thrills and chills, thrills mean excitement, adrenaline,

137
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,560
and chills to me means scare, fear, anticipation, anxiety.

138
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
And the chills are the part that I've been trying to get over by going to haunts,

139
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
you know, for the last couple of years.

140
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,440
I love haunts, but I'm still, you know, trying to get over the fear of chills.

141
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
Thrills, you're on board.

142
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
Thrills I'm almost always on board for sometimes it may be a six flags.

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,920
It's a little too much thrill, but by and large thrills I'm very comfortable with.

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,080
This factor is in and off repeated.

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,160
Your situation with launching, with launch coasters that you prefer that.

146
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,480
Love it.

147
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,080
It's all thrill, no chill.

148
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,040
The chill is the anticipation of the slow climb up the hill, the chill on the hill.

149
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,520
That's right.

150
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,400
Before the thrill.

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,760
This attraction is that you're pretty much straight to thrills.

152
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,600
This is the launch of a drop towers.

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,320
Yes.

154
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,600
So I guess really is that since you're saying the chill isn't so severe,

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
it seems like it's a very mild chill that because the thrill happens,

156
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
it will put my mind in a different place.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So even though a chill comes after the initial thrill, I am now surging with adrenaline

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,760
and it will make it easier to deal with any leg danglies chill that I'm experiencing.

159
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,720
I think so.

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,560
So I guess really I should be so afraid of this.

161
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
The chills are never still.

162
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,720
Because the chills are never still.

163
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,840
You're on the go.

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,120
You're hopping up and down.

165
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,200
There's no still chills.

166
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,280
Dr. Doom has no still chills.

167
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,240
Dr. Doom, I think Dr. Seuss has been inspiring us for the first 10 minutes of this episode.

168
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,040
Did everyone track all of that language?

169
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,560
I hope they did, but yes.

170
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,360
No, you're right.

171
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
Yeah, I guess I shouldn't be so afraid of this ride.

172
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,800
Yeah.

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
So I was going to do it anyway.

174
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
But this is a ride that is about extracting fear.

175
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,640
That's true.

176
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:44,800
Yeah.

177
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
That actually you should be afraid.

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
That's what that's the point of the ride.

179
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,440
It's a good point.

180
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
To serve Doom.

181
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,880
Yeah, but I like Doom and I want to serve Doom.

182
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, I want to help.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
Jason and I love Dr. Doom.

184
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,440
That fiend, that rascal, Reed Richards.

185
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,560
Yeah, since we were little.

186
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
That intellectual lightweight.

187
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,720
Dr. Doom.

188
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
Yeah, Reed Richards.

189
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,360
Sick freak.

190
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,420
Yeah.

191
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,960
Doom is our ruler.

192
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:19,680
So this has come up a few times recently that I am a huge island of adventure stan.

193
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
A few times recently?

194
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,400
Yeah, but especially recently.

195
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
I've had an episode for five years.

196
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,620
Yeah.

197
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,040
Popeye getting his spinach.

198
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,280
Yeah.

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,080
It's come up recently that I likes me spinach.

200
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,080
There's some truth to this rumor.

201
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,600
So don't worry.

202
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,200
We'll get back to your guys's unlistening music soon enough.

203
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,080
Unlistenable?

204
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,200
Unlistenable.

205
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
What are you talking about?

206
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,000
Unbelievable.

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,520
The music is unlistening.

208
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,640
It's not that we talk about it.

209
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
It's that the music itself is unlistening.

210
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,080
Yeah.

211
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
You can't hear it.

212
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,520
Yeah.

213
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,560
Is that what you're saying?

214
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,440
Yeah, you just can't find Jaded anywhere.

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,760
It's Jaded now.

216
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,480
I like Jaded.

217
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Go ahead.

218
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,760
Go ahead.

219
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,520
This was the very first thing, the first time I went opening summer to Islands of Adventure.

220
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,000
This was the first thing I did because I think I was 13 years old and I looked at the Hulk

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
and I went, no.

222
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:26,160
And Spider-Man had a 90-minute wait, which it also had in this year of our Lord, 2022.

223
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
When I look today, it had a 90-minute wait.

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,640
Makes sense.

225
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
Hulk and Doctor Doom closed because there was a multi-hour thunderstorm going on.

226
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,640
So Doctor Doom was the first thing I rode and we waited in line.

227
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
The Express wasn't up and running in 1999.

228
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
It took a few years for that.

229
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,120
But it was very exciting, the buildup, because this has a pretty elaborate cue

230
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,000
for a 90-second bouncy, dangly space shot.

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,920
This is the thing that I didn't know because I've never gone and I won't go on it.

232
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,240
Fair enough.

233
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,080
So I did not realize that there was this.

234
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,280
This might be the only ride of this type.

235
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,280
It might be the only drop tower, not counting the Tower of Terror, of course, to have a story

236
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,360
and a little place-making kind of get you into the, to attempt a plot of one of these.

237
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:32,080
Yeah, and a fairly elaborate story for what is the cheapest of the three opening day Marvel

238
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,800
attractions.

239
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,800
I think Storm Force Accelerator down the line, much cheaper even than this.

240
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
Now you say that.

241
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,520
I don't have, I have zero familiarity with Storm Force Accelerator.

242
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,200
What is Storm Force Accelerator?

243
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,240
Well, it's sort of like a covered teacups and Storm and Magneto fight.

244
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,120
With dialogue.

245
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,640
It is solely a sound effect and dialogue-based fight sequence.

246
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
It's a carnival ride with dialogue, basically.

247
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
Like a dressed up carnival ride, barely dressed up.

248
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,360
When you're in a teacup in that, what is that supposed to represent?

249
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,840
Is it that you're part of the weather?

250
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,480
Tossed about in this battle of elements?

251
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,760
Are you either like magnetism itself or like a cumulus cloud?

252
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,720
It's kind of futurey.

253
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,440
I mean, it's kind of the yellow metal sort of like the Professor X's covered chair.

254
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
So I guess maybe you're in like an X-Men vehicle, I guess, and you're in the middle of the weather.

255
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
I guess that's probably what it is.

256
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,200
You're probably in like a generic X-Men flying contraption and then you're caught between the

257
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
two powers.

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,280
That's probably what it is.

259
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,600
Yeah.

260
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,840
That would make more sense than being a little cloud.

261
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,920
Well, that sounds like a complex story to me.

262
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,480
Yeah.

263
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,760
There's a lot going on, but not a cue with videos and this little journey that you're taking.

264
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,280
No, but yeah, very built up, kind of an imposing exterior.

265
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,360
Very imposing to me.

266
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,880
Imposing like big turning like turbines or fans or whatever.

267
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,400
A lot of paints like speckled paint.

268
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
I don't know how to describe the alleyway.

269
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,440
It's all blacks and silvers and greens and purple, like Dr. Doom colors.

270
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,360
Fun comic book art colors.

271
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,040
Pop party.

273
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
Yeah, pop art's a good way to do it.

274
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Yeah.

275
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,160
To describe it.

276
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,640
So this was like very exciting and then immediately very exciting to be shot up and be very high,

277
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,720
which a thing I've always been fond of.

278
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,600
The hype miser.

279
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:43,840
Yeah.

280
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
It must come from this more than anything.

281
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,120
And then.

282
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
When was the first time you were up high?

283
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,240
I don't know.

284
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
Ferris wheel or something probably.

285
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,360
Okay.

286
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,640
But like legs dangling?

287
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,960
Or something?

288
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,000
Legs dangling high?

289
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,520
Was it this?

290
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,080
I don't know.

291
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Well, no, terror would have been open before this.

292
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Legs dangling high though.

293
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
Legs dangling high.

294
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,600
Different.

295
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,320
More precarious.

296
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,040
More precarious.

297
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,640
More naked to the world and the elements.

298
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,360
That's right.

299
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
Space shots are pretty common.

300
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,040
These sorts of things are pretty common at Jersey Shore boardwalks.

301
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,280
So I'm sure I had done something like this before.

302
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,560
But not so high probably.

303
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:18,720
No.

304
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,840
This was the transformative height.

305
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
Misery experience.

306
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,800
Well.

307
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
This is your origin story.

308
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,200
Look, I was already just walking halfway through the land.

309
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
I was already like a pig and shit.

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,720
And then we got off this ride.

311
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,640
It exits into an arcade.

312
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,640
High marks for that.

313
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,840
And then halfway down the one block away.

314
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,320
What is there?

315
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,400
There is a giant comic book store.

316
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,880
And I'm like, now this is a theme park.

317
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,560
Yeah, it's called the artist Adam Kubert's Art Everywhere.

318
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,040
Yes.

319
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,680
It's insane.

320
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,840
If you were a kid and you read comics and you went to this place, holy shit.

321
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,560
OK, yeah.

322
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,080
It's not just the animated.

323
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,800
A lot of kids watched the animated cartoon.

324
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
That's not special or cool.

325
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,640
If you're listening and that's all you did, fucking stop.

326
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,200
Yeah.

327
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,520
Get your earbuds out.

328
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,560
Put them down.

329
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,840
You are garbage disposal.

330
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,680
Nowhere near as maladjusted as I am.

331
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,720
Thank you very much.

332
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
Let's gatekeep this fandom.

333
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,400
That's what I'm doing.

334
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,360
But if you walked in there and you had just like freshly read

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,760
the finale of the onslaught saga that Adam Kubert drew and you saw his art all over the place,

336
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,600
you go, oh my God, this is the greatest place ever.

337
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,400
Unbelievable.

338
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,920
And you can still see it untouched.

339
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
Maybe the bankruptcy isn't all bad news.

340
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,120
The bankruptcy is good.

341
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,840
Because you're also reading the comics traits to see like what,

342
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
I don't know what bankruptcy means.

343
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
Will these just go away at some point?

344
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,840
I hope Stan.

345
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
Will this just stop?

346
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,160
I hope Stan Lee sells Marvel to Michael Jackson.

347
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,520
Yeah, maybe that'll pan out.

348
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,640
Trustworthy place to put anything valuable to you.

349
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,120
Mm hmm.

350
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,080
A meeting, I think.

351
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,640
Business affairs very well in order.

352
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,400
That's right.

353
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,920
So yes, I hear you.

354
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,520
It was an exciting time.

355
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,600
And yeah, I will, if I'm giving it lots of credit, very big and comical and pop party.

356
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm sure if people are being critical of it,

357
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,840
a lot of elements that just looked like they were ripped from the mall.

358
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,360
Auntie Anne's, Sunglass Hut.

359
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,520
What was the first thing you said?

360
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,800
Auntie Anne's.

361
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
Oh, Auntie Anne's.

362
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,880
Okay, wow.

363
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,400
You know, in my head,

364
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,640
I was like, try to say this normal.

365
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,520
And I could not have been further off.

366
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,320
What was the issue?

367
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,520
The aunt part?

368
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,960
What was gonna, what was like?

369
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,960
I feel like I always say Auntie Anne's and I feel like everyone else always says something else.

370
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
Auntie Anne's.

371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,240
Yeah.

372
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,040
Auntie Anne's.

373
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,520
Depends.

374
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,360
I'm an aunt guy.

375
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm not an aunt guy.

376
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
This is America.

377
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
Yeah, I say Auntie Anne's.

378
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,280
You say aunt and that's it.

379
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,640
That was, wait, there's an Auntie Anne's in this area?

380
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
Kind of halfway through.

381
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,560
Okay.

382
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
Some dipping dots at some point in time, I think.

383
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,640
But that's the universal.

384
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,240
I think they've gotten more into here's custom food experiences,

385
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
but I don't know if Adventure remains there in that space a little bit of like,

386
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,200
what do you, boy, what do you eat in this place?

387
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,440
You know, if you don't go to one of the like two nice places.

388
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,040
Yeah, Mythos or Confisco.

389
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Or the Harry Potter thing, three broomsticks.

390
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,800
Yeah, the Fantastic Four Cafe is there, right?

391
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,080
Yeah, I mean, that's the solid.

392
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,520
That's like the same kind of.

393
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,480
Cafeteria.

394
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,640
Park pizza that they have at the.

395
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:46,880
Yeah.

396
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
Universal, Florida.

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,800
The New York section has like a real Italian pizzeria, New York style.

398
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah.

399
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,840
And it's the same as the real Fantastic Four pizza, New York style.

400
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,280
New Yorkers like it.

401
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Personal pan with the questionable pepperonis.

402
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,720
Is that what that is?

403
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,200
Wow.

404
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Could be.

405
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,680
It's like the human torchum shelf walked out of the Baxter building,

406
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:19,360
walked across to the dollar pizza slice place and is now reselling it for seven times markup.

407
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,960
That's smart.

408
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:21,920
Yeah.

409
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,960
He's a smart guy.

410
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,720
I didn't, you know, I didn't get to say the I didn't pull this up in the Transformers episode,

411
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,960
but there was a there was a still that I had that really encapsulates the universal experience to me.

412
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,160
It's universal Hollywood is the opening of Transformers universal Hollywood.

413
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,400
And it's in the general might have been the actor general more shower.

414
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,720
Of course.

415
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Self of course is kind of telling you the stakes and he's in front of these is at the

416
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,040
podium.

417
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,960
There's like soldiers flanking him and like, oh my God, this is very serious.

418
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
What's and there's a transmission from Megatron and oh my and it all happens in

419
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,920
front of just a big circular Panda Express logo.

420
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,000
We must fortify the Panda Express.

421
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,480
Yes.

422
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,800
And the really open lower lot Panda Express is serious.

423
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,200
And if this ever if we are ever to open it and it's a big if and there's something where

424
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,080
this is what the Decepticons are actually after.

425
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,760
Well, if you recall the Jurassic Park restaurant used to before the like they they, you know,

426
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,440
gussied up the food a little used to be half Pizza Hut and half pre-made Panda Express.

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Oh my combined like you dump the bowl on top of a I have personal pan.

428
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,520
I think it was like you went one side for one thing or one side or one heat lamp for one

429
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,800
and one heat lamp for the other.

430
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,760
And I think at one point in time, the Panda Express next door was open and you could also

431
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,560
get Panda Express at the Jurassic Park.

432
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,280
Is that right?

433
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,760
Wow.

434
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,720
That's I get two different Panda Expresses.

435
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,480
I think the first time I went in like 2006 in college, we ate at the Panda Express.

436
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,080
And then I think later we're walking through Jurassic Park Cafe.

437
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
It's like there's also Panda Express in here.

438
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,840
And City Walk.

439
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,640
So there were three possible ways to get.

440
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,240
And on Cooing Boulevard at not far from Universal Panda Express on Ventura.

441
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,400
Yeah.

442
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,640
Yeah.

443
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,280
Mm hmm.

444
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
Probably in a supermarket not too far.

445
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,720
Oh, yeah.

446
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,280
Sure.

447
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
Yeah, there used to be one in a Burbank supermarket.

448
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,680
That's right.

449
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,920
The area was littered and it was but it was important to fortify all

450
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,560
because if one goes down, maybe they all go down.

451
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:32,800
Yeah.

452
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,880
And that's what more shower was concerned about.

453
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
Yeah, he was right to be worried.

454
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,880
Yeah.

455
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,520
Luckily, not much has changed in the they've there's a fortified wall of mediocre to bad

456
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,960
food at Islands of Adventure.

457
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,280
Yeah.

458
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,920
Does not look like it'll tumble anytime soon.

459
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,960
That's never going to change.

460
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,200
I feel like I don't feel like that's even on the radar.

461
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,840
They're not going to we can hear rumors all day long about Lord of the Rings or whatever,

462
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,760
but that they're making sure that the restaurant in the Lord of the Rings land sucks.

463
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
They want to make sure that that doesn't change.

464
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,680
I think we can't blow them all out.

465
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,560
Look, just financially, some of this has to be shit.

466
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,200
Got to be the last time.

467
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,080
I don't think we really eat there besides when we went to mythos when we were down.

468
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,640
But the time before that, like a year or two before,

469
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,240
it seemed like they're big culinary innovations.

470
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,600
Were giving combo meals that had milkshakes instead of sodas.

471
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
And you're tearing up a little.

472
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm getting emotional.

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,040
And they seemed like they went all in on Brookies, the combination brownie and cookie.

474
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,600
Those are kind of everywhere.

475
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,880
Have they backed off that?

476
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,360
I don't know.

477
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,560
This is you do describe these things like 1969.

478
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,000
It was the summer of love.

479
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Why drugs were running rampant.

480
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,120
And that was just how we did it back then.

481
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,040
They were making some summer of 09.

482
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,800
Some called Brookies.

483
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,760
Cookies were getting freaky with brownies and boy, you were lapping up every last crumb.

484
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,360
I also had the worst sandwich of my life.

485
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
I think you have talked about this.

486
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,040
Okay. I have talked about the bad Dagwood sandwich.

487
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,520
The Dagwood team.

488
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,840
You have talked about the bad Jaguar.

489
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,960
Okay. Yeah.

490
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,480
Even at like 12 or 13, I was like, oh, God, what is this?

491
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,360
Just for the next.

492
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,280
You were just like, just opened.

493
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,000
How you went back to the room and you were like, pulled out your stack of Dagwood comics,

494
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,880
blondie comics, and you were like, why have you forsaken me?

495
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,800
Why did you do this to me?

496
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,920
For all the years I've given you the best relationships I have terrified to know what

497
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,840
the Cathy ice cream is like.

498
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,880
This is how he's been betrayed by the Dagwood sandwich.

499
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,760
She don't care.

500
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,080
She'll take what if it says ice cream on it.

501
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,960
She had a rough week.

502
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,240
Okay.

503
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,160
She'll eat whatever ice cream doesn't care.

504
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,000
But yeah.

505
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
So where were we?

506
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,680
I don't know.

507
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,600
So islands, Dr. Doom.

508
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,960
Yeah. So I love this ride when I first went on it.

509
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:10,720
And now as an adult, I went on it a couple times, I think, when we were down in 2019.

510
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,400
You fit it in multiple times?

511
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,960
Yeah. Because I went back the day before I flew.

512
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
I was staying at combatant base.

513
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,160
So I went back for like the morning.

514
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,400
And I rode it then and I rode it like as the park was closing.

515
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
It's a great ride to do at night.

516
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,040
Like you see the whole park lit up at night.

517
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,200
Well, if you're on the one side, because the thing about this ride is you don't have the

518
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
chance to see one view.

519
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,360
You have the chance to see four views, two of which are a lot of access roads.

520
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,400
But on the one side, you can see the full islands of adventure, like Lagoon and everything.

521
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,680
On the other side, you can see all of Orlando.

522
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,800
You can see I-4.

523
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,640
That's a thing we've talked about a little bit before.

524
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,120
I don't know if there's a good part of Disney that has this when you're in one of the theme

525
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
parks. I don't believe that it exists.

526
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,200
But Universal has a couple places where you can very easily see just outside into the real

527
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,520
world.

528
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,560
Like in Volcano Bay, if you're in the right water slide, just turn around and there's just

529
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,000
a bunch of houses and a street like right across the way.

530
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,120
Yeah.

531
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,480
Well, like in Hollywood, the Harry Potter land just backs right up to an office building.

532
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,720
Yes.

533
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,240
Also, it would take like 10 trees to cover it and they didn't.

534
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,480
Yes.

535
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,920
I would say it's arguably more magical driving down by the Warner Brothers lot and seeing

536
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,960
the Harry Potter castle because it doesn't quite break the illusion.

537
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,480
You just go, oh, there's Hogwarts versus seeing Hogwarts and then the Universal building

538
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,320
behind it to room.

539
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,440
Don't go in the park.

540
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,160
If you want the Hogwarts magic, just stay on the other side of town.

541
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,200
Look at it from afar.

542
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,880
Go to Dog House right across from the Universal, excuse me, the Warner Brothers lot.

543
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,760
Go to the hot dog restaurant near the Warner Brothers lot.

544
00:23:59,760 --> 00:23:59,920
Yeah.

545
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,280
And look at the castle in the distance.

546
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,760
And then sometimes you can see the Waterworld smoke, which I think is really fun.

547
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,960
Sometimes you'll be driving down Olive and you'll see like smoke.

548
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,120
Yeah.

549
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,360
You'll see smoke in the air and you go, oh my God, is something wrong?

550
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,040
And you go, no, no, the Mariners just won again.

551
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,880
It gets me all the time.

552
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,400
And I was just outside of the park recently and I heard all this hubbub, like a big fight.

553
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,920
And I was like, oh my God, because look, fights are in the air.

554
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,120
That's Berry Farm.

555
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,520
That's true.

556
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,880
The teens have run too rampant.

557
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,320
There is a curfew in order now, in effect now.

558
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,720
So I thought, oh, is all hell about to break loose.

559
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
And I realized I have been tricked.

560
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,520
This is the Mariner and the Deacon.

561
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,160
The Deacon.

562
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
And it's Helen.

563
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,720
Helen.

564
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,760
That's the Helen test.

565
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

566
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Yeah.

567
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,800
Okay.

568
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,320
So I can name all of the characters.

569
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,640
Yeah.

570
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:48,880
Yeah.

571
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,480
They've kept it in the public consciousness enough for me to barely with lots of hems and haws

572
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,600
produce the three names.

573
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,000
That's right.

574
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,040
And you can still see those if you are under the age of 18.

575
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,640
You can see those and any time of day that it's running, you do not need a chaperone over 21

576
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
to escort you to the water rock show.

577
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
No chaperone system.

578
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,840
Right.

579
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,160
Yeah.

580
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,400
Not very far as their chaperones now.

581
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,960
And I don't know.

582
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,480
Is this America?

583
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,680
We you start giving out, you give up one freedom and suddenly 100 are gone.

584
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,520
You know, yeah, I was liberal up until I heard that and now I'm upset and the freedom to go

585
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,800
into knots when you're under age.

586
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,440
Getting a big rowdy fight with some teenagers.

587
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,000
Here's an idea though, because could we offer ourselves a chaperones just because we care

588
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
about not so much that we want to make sure everything goes well.

589
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,800
So if there's a teen that's looking for a chaperone, we're willing to chaperone you.

590
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,160
Oh, this is somewhere on the commitment scale between buying an underage person,

591
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,120
a six pack of beer.

592
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,440
Right.

593
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,600
And marrying somebody for citizenship.

594
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,400
It's somewhere in between like the just to help you out.

595
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,760
It's only for the day.

596
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,240
Yeah.

597
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,520
I don't know.

599
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,960
You do end up with like, because if you don't click with your teen, I think you would need

600
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,560
some kind of like dating service.

601
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,520
Well, well, I was going to make sure you're matched with your ideal teen.

602
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,720
I was going to say a less weird thing.

603
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
I was going to like bigger brother program or something.

604
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
That's better dating service and teens.

605
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,160
This is the wrong way to think of it.

606
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,800
What knots very far needs is a teen dating service.

607
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,200
Yeah, no, no.

608
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,080
I've been saying it for years.

609
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,440
That's the wrong I think.

610
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,680
I think, yeah, I think my way is the right way to say it.

611
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,320
Yeah.

612
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Big brother, big sister program.

613
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,640
And then you match.

614
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,480
Yeah, because yeah, you want to make sure everything goes smoothly with your teen.

615
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
You keep them from getting too rowdy.

616
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,040
You tell them about Walter and Cordelia not and the wonders of free enterprise.

617
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,520
That's right.

618
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,800
I mean, basically what you're signing up for if you're a teen and you're going to be

619
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,440
chaperoned by us is you're going to hear about free enterprise, a freedom center,

620
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,920
and then you're going to make them go on all the easy rides, not the fast, scary ones.

621
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,040
With sad robots.

622
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,360
Yeah.

623
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,240
Saddest robot.

624
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Maybe there's like this checkboxes of like music interests.

625
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,040
OK, well, I'll put I'll put Everclear.

626
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Let's see.

627
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Everclear, Sugar Ray.

628
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,080
This should line up with the boy.

629
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
The teens will all be fighting for my attention.

630
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
What's your guys favorite bare naked ladies album?

631
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,840
Yeah, I don't listen to them after Stephen left either.

632
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,680
So just in case.

633
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,960
Yeah, cool.

634
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, dope, man.

635
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

636
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,920
I know that some of the newer stuff like the Big Bang theme.

637
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,800
I know you kids are into, but I sort of hang with the earlier stuff.

638
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,800
What's your favorite one to twerk to?

639
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
King of Bedside Manor from Gordon.

640
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
Is that because that's a pretty rowdy one, if you ask me.

641
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
A lot of sound effects on that track.

642
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,920
Well, and then they start beating the shit out of you because I think the Big Bang

643
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,720
theory is they might be giants, not fair naked ladies.

644
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,920
Oh, yeah.

645
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,640
Oh, yeah.

646
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,040
Oh, man, they're going to if fucking if a teen knows if a teen knows who they might be

647
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,560
giants are, they're hiding the fact that they're like, oh, so they beat the shit out of them.

648
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,040
They're a 50 year old in disguise.

649
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,200
Yeah.

650
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,960
Well, you pull the wig off.

651
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,760
You pull the wig off.

652
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,160
They're an older man, a man older than me.

653
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,120
Sadder than me.

654
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,600
What are you doing here?

655
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,360
There's someone to talk to.

656
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Well, this is a great service.

657
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,600
I can offer chaperone and exposing false teens.

658
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,000
That's right.

659
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We're just trying to go to not stuff fight.

660
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,480
I just wanted to feel something.

661
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,480
You didn't get your wish.

662
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,600
Music, unlisted.

663
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,720
Oh, no, that's fine.

664
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,480
That's all right.

665
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
I dropped a reference.

666
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,000
B&L's Gordon, huh?

667
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
How about that?

668
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,760
You snuck it in.

669
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,640
Yeah, I did.

670
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,000
But let's OK.

671
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,240
Well, still, what have we not gotten into here?

672
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,560
I mean, we should describe the queue.

673
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:40,800
Yes.

674
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,480
Let's talk about the story.

675
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,360
What elevates that?

676
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,960
This is not just an up and down.

677
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,160
This is more than an up and down.

678
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,480
Yeah.

679
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,680
You're in an invention.

680
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
You're sitting in an invention in this ride.

681
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,040
Doom is a genius.

682
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,200
Yes.

683
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,560
I want to, in case you don't know about Doom, he is a genius inventor.

684
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Smarter than Reed Richards, at least equal to Reed Richards.

685
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,120
They went to the same college.

686
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,640
College classmates.

687
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
It's still a college rivalry.

688
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,480
It's a college rivalry.

689
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,240
Imagine Austin Powers III, Austin and Dr. Evil.

690
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,680
Are they in college or they're younger than that?

691
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,360
They're like at Hogwarts or something, right?

692
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
They're at boarding school.

693
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,040
Boarding school.

694
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,320
But similar dynamic.

695
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,440
It's just in a different school.

696
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,560
But they're both super geniuses.

697
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,600
Is he already Doom, though?

698
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,440
Is he Victor Von Doom?

699
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,240
Well, there's multiple versions of the Doom origin.

700
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,080
But the traditional one is that he's not Doom yet.

701
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,320
His name is Victor Von Doom, legally.

702
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,480
Right.

703
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,320
But he's not Doom with the whole thing.

704
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,040
Doom, Doom.

705
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,760
Because he doesn't get to-

706
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,480
That's insane.

707
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,800
How is your name is Doom and then you become-

708
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Well, it seemed like it was maybe like a foregone conclusion that this would be your fate.

709
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
Were you supposed to pronounce it like Doam?

710
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
It's Doam?

711
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,600
Von Doam.

712
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,760
I don't think Stanley or they don't think they said in the comic-

713
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,120
In the 2000s, they tried calling, in the ultimate books, they called him Victor Van Dam.

714
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,080
Yes, that is correct.

715
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
And everyone knew, like, come on, man.

716
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
Which is really funny.

717
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,000
Does that pull you out of it?

718
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,240
Yes.

719
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,040
We know who this is going to be.

720
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,720
It's a Fantastic Four comic.

721
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,600
Because people are like, oh, is he going to be Dr. Dam?

722
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,560
Yeah.

723
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,520
It doesn't make any sense.

724
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,240
Doesn't sound good.

725
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,440
And then Doom loved Sue Storm, who would eventually marry Reed, Richard's Mr. Fantastic.

726
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,400
Yeah, a number of Marvel characters' motivation is that they're really in love with Sue Storm.

727
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,960
That's correct.

728
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,160
Something they had asked for.

729
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,520
Namor, soon to be seen in Black Panther, Wakanda forever.

730
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,360
Part man, part Atlantean fish man.

731
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,640
Okay.

732
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,320
He loves Sue Storm.

733
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,440
He loves Sue Storm.

734
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,120
Oh, that's not going to work.

735
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
She's not going to be in the ocean.

736
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,520
No.

737
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,880
She's not in the universe yet.

738
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,840
So Doom gets disfigured in an accident.

739
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,160
He makes a contraption that goes wrong, scars him, his face, and he blames Richard's for it.

740
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,640
And, yeah.

741
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,480
I like the more beloved character that the waterslide inventor from Raging Waters.

742
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,200
What's his name?

743
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

744
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,040
Experiments gone awry.

745
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,960
Von Dark?

746
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
Dr. Von Dark.

747
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,800
Yes, I thought it was very close.

748
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,320
It is very close.

749
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,820
Yeah.

750
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,960
When I'm just putting it together, then maybe Dr. Von Dark was partially inspired by Dr. Von Doom.

751
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,880
I think that might be right.

752
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,760
Wow.

753
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,560
For a second, I thought you were actually talking about the guy who made Action Park.

754
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,920
There is a real world evil waterslide experimenter.

755
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

756
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,920
No, that's a more colorful fictional one.

757
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,600
Who was also in love with another smart man's wife, I'm sure.

758
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,160
Sounds right.

759
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:50,080
And also, I thought you were referring to the Schlitterbond people who made the insane waterslide.

760
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
That is, yeah.

761
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,640
Those are, boy, we talked about Schlitterbond, but we didn't really get into that weird,

762
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,960
that's an episode maybe, is the arms race between the evil waterslide makers.

763
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,520
Yes.

764
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,200
And now one birthed, the second one conquered the first.

765
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,680
You're dead, old man.

766
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,160
What about the wild rivers?

767
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,680
No, maybe I'm getting the names wrong.

768
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,640
Oh, yeah, what was the name?

769
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,160
Early waterslide inventor was this tough military guy,

770
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,840
but then the crown got taken by the Schlitterbond guy who pushed it and pushed it and pushed it

771
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,560
and then built that slide that horribly killed that guy and that kid, right?

772
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,240
Yeah, there's a weird waterslide arms race episode, like some crazy, like you would think that.

773
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
That's a film, I think.

774
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,040
Yeah, maybe that story.

775
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,680
Realizing that one was like, oh, they had a relationship,

776
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,640
like the only two evil waterslide makers knew each other and hated each other.

777
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,600
It's incredible.

778
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,160
It's like a Stanley plot come to life.

779
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,480
Yeah.

780
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:50,960
Really is.

781
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,200
Jack Kirby, actually.

782
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,600
So other things about Doom, he's a genius scientist.

783
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,520
He's also a powerful sorcerer.

784
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,320
He's a magician.

785
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
He's a magician as well.

786
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,280
And an inventor.

787
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,640
Yeah, he's got a powerful suit of armor.

788
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,600
The mass height is kind of scarred face.

789
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,400
He's very vain.

790
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,640
He does not want to show his face, but the suit of armor is comparable to an Iron Man suit of armor,

791
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,960
except it also has a tiny little belt that has a gun on it.

792
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,740
Mm-hmm.

793
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,760
Even though he can shoot out of his hands.

794
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,560
Okay.

795
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,440
He's got like genuine, excuse me, like generic laser hands.

796
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,280
And then, sorry, so he is then also on top of all this, he owns a country.

797
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,320
Yeah, he's the ruler of a small Eastern European country.

798
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,200
And that's Latveria?

799
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,240
Latveria, yes.

800
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,740
Okay.

801
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,240
And how did he, were they like, he didn't found that.

802
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,760
That existed and he took it over?

803
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,160
Sheer might and will.

804
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,600
Yeah, but it existed before.

805
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,800
It existed before.

806
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,840
Yeah, and then, yeah, no, he didn't like create it.

807
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,240
All that, there's probably some origins like version where he did create it.

808
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,560
He's accomplished a lot with the help of Doom bots, which are often portrayed as identical to him.

809
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:12,800
Okay.

810
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,560
And oftentimes when Spider-Man or the Avengers think they're fighting Dr. Doom,

811
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
it turns out they're fighting a very good Doom bot.

812
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,600
It's like Saddam Hussein's decoys or something.

813
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,040
It's the same thing.

814
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,200
So yeah, you're not sure necessarily.

815
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,120
But then sometimes the Doom bots do look like sort of like goon robot versions of Doom.

816
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,440
In the queue, they look more like heavies.

817
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,040
Oh, they're big.

818
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,680
Yes, yeah, they're not intended to deceive.

819
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,080
Yeah.

820
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,320
Right.

821
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,480
There's a great 12 issue series by past guest Chris Cantwell wrote Dr. Doom for a year.

822
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,160
And that was really good.

823
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,680
Well, hold on to that thought.

824
00:34:53,680 --> 00:35:00,080
I will save because this person may have been consulted about some aspects of this attraction

825
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,560
and this topic.

826
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
I'll save that for when we've explained what's going on.

827
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,240
Right.

828
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,680
Iron Man right now just announced he's wrapping up his run in the fall.

829
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,960
His final Iron Man.

830
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,460
Yes.

831
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,160
All right.

832
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,520
Well, yeah, save that.

833
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,160
Some thoughts to come.

834
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,720
Sure.

835
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,220
Yeah.

836
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,160
So what else about Doom?

837
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,400
Oh, often portrayed as an anti-hero.

838
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,800
Like that sort of that old Marge line of like he's right, but you're not supposed to say it.

839
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,840
That situation's Doom finds himself in a lot.

840
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,480
Sometimes.

841
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:28,800
Sometimes.

842
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,000
Are you talking about the 9-11 Doom?

843
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
No, not crying 9-11 Doom.

844
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,160
Do you know what we're talking about?

845
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,880
Vaguely.

846
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,400
Look up crying 9-11 Doom and then react honestly to what you see.

847
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,280
Everyone at home, I implore you do the same thing.

848
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,780
Yeah.

849
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:51,780
All of the there's a Spider-Man commemorative 9-11 issue and everyone cries at 9-11,

850
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,180
including the Kingpin and Doom.

851
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,300
Before I clicked on the images tab, it's a big Reddit thread that asks the question,

852
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,020
why would Dr. Doom cry for 9-11?

853
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,220
I mean, it's a good question.

854
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,820
Yeah, he's probably killed a lot of people, you know.

855
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,820
Yeah, but I suppose he's stepping out of it and

856
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,420
we're enjoying him as not a full real serious character in that moment.

857
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,820
But so yeah, sometimes I mean, these characters have been around for 80 years,

858
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,060
what a hundred years at this point.

859
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,820
And yeah, Dr. Doom has been good.

860
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,860
Overwhelmingly, I think he's usually bad, but-

861
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,940
He's usually bad or there are times where it seems like he's doing good.

862
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,820
And then either his ego or he's got a secret evil master plan or his own hubris gets him.

863
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,180
His hubris gets him a lot.

864
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,100
In a recent storyline, I think it was the Secret Wars books,

865
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,740
and it's a sort of thing where they keep rewriting reality or things are collapsing in on itself.

866
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:53,460
He does rip Thanos' spine out of his body, spine and skull.

867
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,300
So yeah, Chris educated me on this fact.

868
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,220
Now I'm like, you know I don't pay attention to any of this, but I know that Thanos,

869
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,940
everybody's scared of Thanos, he's been the biggest deal in all these movies for years

870
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,300
I'm like, why?

871
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,540
His spine got pulled out by this other villain?

872
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,700
He seems a little worse to me.

873
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,860
Mortal Kombat fatality on him.

874
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,100
It's a pretty intense panel.

875
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:26,900
Every now and then Doom kind of becomes a god, gets god-like powers that he sort of vexes everything off.

876
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,940
Yeah, Chris also informed me that he at some point did battle with the devil.

877
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,980
He's fought the devil.

878
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:45,060
He's, yeah, there was a story, there was a book where he was very upset because his mother's soul,

879
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,340
one of his contraptions that went wrong was trying to talk to the dead because he wanted to talk to

880
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:56,820
his late mother and he found out his mother's soul was being tortured by Mephisto, the devil in hell.

881
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,940
His mother was in hell, Scott.

882
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,540
His mother was in hell.

883
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,980
He goes with Dr. Doom.

884
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:10,420
So this is a Christian world where he's upset about 9-11 happened, which was this religious fervor event.

885
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,100
Heaven and hell also exist.

886
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,300
It's all a religious tale.

887
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,180
I guess in a way.

888
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,140
He hasn't met Jesus as far as anyone knows.

889
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,260
Did he fight Jesus?

890
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,740
I don't think he did or even team up with Jesus.

891
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,020
Okay, so Thanos has tried to court death itself once.

892
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,660
Yes, Thanos has been a fuck boy for death.

893
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,740
The concept of death in a lady form.

894
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,300
Mike said and what Jason said, don't swear to me.

895
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Explain, sorry, fuck boy.

896
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,420
Well, Thanos has kind of been horny for death.

897
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,980
He's like, hey.

898
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
They didn't put this in the movies.

899
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,700
Yeah, they took it.

900
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,660
How so?

901
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,460
He loves death.

902
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,700
You know when we were younger and there'd be a girl, you'd be like,

903
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,660
if I hang around this girl long enough, she might give me a kiss.

904
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,340
That's sort of what Thanos is with death.

905
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,540
Yeah, for like a skeleton and a purple cloak.

906
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,620
Oh, you're saying for a manifestation.

907
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,580
For a manifestation.

908
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,180
Yeah, but it is death.

909
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,780
That is what he's going.

910
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,100
In the movies, I guess it's more of a figurative death he's sort of in love with.

911
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,580
Yeah, but they don't show it and it isn't in the same needy way that it is in Infinity Gauntlet.

912
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,940
Man, that's crazy.

913
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,900
I wouldn't want a skeleton sucking my dick.

914
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,940
Clattering teeth.

915
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,900
Thanos, you're crazy.

916
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,820
Look, he is a crazy guy.

917
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,380
He's a wild and crazy guy.

918
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,540
You're in his weird stuff, my man.

919
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,540
Maybe you should see his movies.

920
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,620
Does that happen?

921
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,220
I don't want to say.

922
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,820
I don't want to say.

923
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,460
But if I could definitively be told, if you told me that death gives a blow job to Thanos,

924
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,900
I would go watch, I'd stop recording and start watching the movies.

925
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,940
Here's what I'll say.

926
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,900
I'll say, you know what?

927
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,180
It doesn't happen in the movie, but stay through the credits.

928
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,420
That's what I'll say.

929
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,940
Oh, that's why everyone's so excited about those post credits.

930
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,500
We don't want to spoil whether Thanos gets top or not, but stay through the credits.

931
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,540
I am looking at this 9-11 now.

932
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,340
This is, yeah, close up of tears kind of coming through his mask,

933
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,140
because even the worst of us, however scarred, are still human,

934
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,660
still feel, still mourn the random death of innocence.

935
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,900
I would have just left him out of the book if I was, I would have just left him out.

936
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,020
Cause yeah, if it, I mean, you guys know more.

937
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,780
It seemed he's probably done something that's a little close to 9-11.

938
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,980
All of them have.

939
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,540
Yeah.

940
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,260
All of them.

941
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,500
Yeah.

942
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,460
Yes.

943
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,540
He belongs in hell, Dr. Doom.

944
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,060
Come on.

945
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,940
Dude, what's, what's he done that's worse than 9-11?

946
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,180
Well, in terms of people like, like body count,

947
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,540
people who didn't deserve it.

948
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,380
Cause Thanos deserves that skeleton ripped out for sure.

949
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:04,500
He did send Reed and Sue's son to hell in the 2000s.

950
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,300
That's not good, but.

951
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,140
And then he tortured them using each other's powers.

952
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,700
Like they were.

953
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,180
Not good, but one guy.

954
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,500
We're not up to 9-11 levels yet.

955
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,020
I'm looking through here.

956
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,620
Well, but that kid also created a pocket dimension that saved all their lives.

957
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,900
What an evil threat.

958
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,580
You know what?

959
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,220
We don't have time.

960
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,740
Number two on this list of worst things he's ever done is sent Franklin Richards to hell.

961
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,620
That's number two.

962
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,980
Number one is the secret war, the newer secret wars.

963
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,020
The newer secret wars.

964
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,220
And then there's an earlier story.

965
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,900
God of all the multiverse.

966
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:46,980
There's an earlier story called Emperor Doom where he kidnaps the purple man.

967
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,220
Yes.

968
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:54,660
From alias and uses his mind control powers to hypnotize the whole world and does turn

969
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,620
the world into a utopia, but no one asked for a will.

970
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,460
So that's the conundrums you get into with Doom a lot.

971
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,420
Whereas like, well, he did something right, but it's not quite right.

972
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,420
All everything I've learned about this actually is interesting to me.

973
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:16,660
Another thing Chris said is that there was a point in time where he's kind of this dictator

974
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:23,220
of his country, Ledveria, but it's in the 80s that the Fantastic Four reinstalled him

975
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,940
because the democratic leaders were fucking up.

976
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,300
And then it's like, that's better.

977
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,500
Maybe we said they, they did a coup to get Dr. Doom back in power,

978
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,660
which what more like Reagan era weird shady,

979
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,100
yeah, America, well, we're going to quit.

980
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,140
Let's just not tell anybody.

981
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,780
Yeah.

982
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,740
Who wrote that run?

983
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,300
That'd be fun.

984
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,820
That might've been the burn.

985
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,380
John Byrne.

986
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,100
John Byrne, maybe.

987
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:46,580
Yeah.

988
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,740
But that's a funny like topical thing.

989
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,780
My big thing was going to be like, plead,

990
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,340
minders for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, whatever you do,

991
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,660
inevitably we're going to get Dr. Doom.

992
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,340
Do not make him topical.

993
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,860
Do not make him topical.

994
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,700
Do not make him a stand in for stuff.

995
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,860
Don't have someone say like, Dr. Doom is gaslighting, but don't do that.

996
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:12,500
Make him like they said in Watchmen, I'm not a Republic serial villain.

997
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,540
Make him a cartoon.

998
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,460
Make him a crazy serial villain.

999
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:21,620
Tie him into a, don't say, oh, his real name is Dr. Deu-Santis.

1000
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,120
Yeah.

1001
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,340
Well, actually that's good.

1002
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,220
I actually like that.

1003
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:33,940
Apparently Cantwell pushed Doom's kill count up to the highest of any villain in the Marvel Universe.

1004
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,900
The Cantwell series?

1005
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,700
That's what it says here is that because he used the ultimate nullifier to destroy an entire reality.

1006
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,020
Yes, because he has the highest.

1007
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,140
Where Doom does everything right and gets what he wished for.

1008
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,100
So screen rant here in 2022 says Dr. Doom officially claims Marvel's highest kill count.

1009
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,660
And it's because of the Cantwell number 10.

1010
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,700
He was not the recipient, and that's counting all the comics.

1011
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,500
And he was, he didn't have the title and Chris Cantwell got him the title.

1012
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,020
That's what this article says.

1013
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,520
Wow.

1014
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,400
Geez.

1015
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,100
Look, a person I'm very impressed by on many levels and that just added that.

1016
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,140
That notched him even higher up in my book.

1017
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:19,220
But this is a fun, a thing that's nice about this ride that does hide into the comics where

1018
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:25,140
like Marvel does have a history of like, Dr. Doom gets his own comic.

1019
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,060
You know, let's say Junkernot gets his own comic.

1020
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,180
Junkernot?

1021
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:30,900
Juggernot?

1022
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,400
Oh, okay.

1023
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,180
Junkernot.

1024
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,900
Didn't he say Junkernot?

1025
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,700
That's kind of what I heard.

1026
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,200
Okay.

1027
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,500
Yeah, maybe.

1028
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,460
Let's make sure.

1029
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,580
Magneto gets his own comic.

1030
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,620
The bad guys have their own comics and you see their motivations.

1031
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,660
Joker gets his own movies.

1032
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,420
Joker gets his own movies.

1033
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,300
Can you believe it?

1034
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,540
Now you have that instructive thing about don't make him somebody current,

1035
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:53,620
but if Dr. Doom wants to steal an old movie and just do it again, but with Dr. Doom.

1036
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,380
That maybe we're, we could be fine with that.

1037
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,260
Now we're talking.

1038
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,180
Well, yeah, I think, yeah.

1039
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,580
What if Dr. Doom, okay, let's think, let's work with this.

1040
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,260
I would love that people started winning Oscars for playing Dr. Doom.

1041
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,460
Yeah.

1042
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,100
That count.

1043
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,420
Yeah.

1044
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,860
Joker count is high.

1045
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,660
Let's get some Doom.

1046
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,940
Zero in the Dr. Doom hasn't been portrayed by too many.

1047
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,300
I don't even recognize any of the names of who's played him.

1048
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,820
Oh, it's that guy from Nip Tuck.

1049
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,620
Yeah.

1050
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,700
I don't remember his name, but he's in Nip Tuck.

1051
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,540
Is he in the Michael B. Jordan one?

1052
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,900
In the Michael B. Jordan, but I don't remember who plays him.

1053
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,700
I'm pretty sure.

1054
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,460
But those are the two movie versions,

1055
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,420
but both of those not so warmly regarded.

1056
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:38,900
Yeah.

1057
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,740
This is probably, it's probably on my mind just because there was this excellent

1058
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,540
blank check episode with Lin-Manuel Miranda about the film All That Jazz.

1059
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:47,940
Yes.

1060
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,740
All That Jazz with Dr. Doom, I think would be pretty strong.

1061
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,740
Oh man, I like that.

1062
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:59,380
Dealing with the death of Dr. Doom and then the long musical number at the end.

1063
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,900
Fawzi, an equally complicated character is Dr. Doom.

1064
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,100
You can point to so much good, but also much like, oh, what an asshole.

1066
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,340
Yeah.

1067
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,540
I was gonna say like a Kramer versus Kramer Doom or something, you know, like an old,

1068
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,380
more of a custody thing or like, well, has there ever been a love interest or you want

1069
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,180
to pair him up with somebody?

1070
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,540
Yes, he killed his love interest.

1071
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,900
He killed the woman he loves.

1072
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,980
Yeah, there's numerous ones.

1073
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:30,900
Well, the detail of when Sue Storm is having her second child, Reed is like in another,

1074
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,620
he's not on earth or he's not available.

1075
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,420
Reed is a distant father.

1076
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,020
And there's complications.

1077
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,380
And so Johnny Storm, her brother, contacts Dr. Doom for help.

1078
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,620
Come on, Johnny.

1079
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,860
And yeah, you really could have called Tony Stark or the Beast or someone else.

1080
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:48,900
Yeah, call the Beast.

1081
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:56,340
And all Dr. Doom asked in return was that he got to name the baby and he named it Valeria,

1082
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,780
which is the name of his old long dead lover.

1083
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,660
So that's the second child of the Fantastic Four of Reed and Sue is Valeria named after Dr. Doom,

1084
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,620
named by Dr. Doom.

1085
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,860
And that's, he just wanted to like leave a weird imprint.

1086
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,820
Yeah, he's left a lot of weird imprints.

1087
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,260
Yeah, for sure.

1088
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,860
So yeah, so that ties into the Kramer versus Kramer story somehow.

1089
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:26,260
There's funny imprints, like there is an old Luke Cage comic, sort of when Luke Cage,

1090
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:33,220
first rolled out was very much in the line of the 70s blackploitation heroes of his time.

1091
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:39,780
And Doom hires Cage to track down some stray Doom bots and does not pay him.

1092
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,180
And so Luke Cage travels all the way to Latveria to get his $200.

1093
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,100
And Doom is like, you would do this for $200?

1094
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,700
I think I, you know, I saw Kramer versus Kramer so long ago that the only

1095
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:03,060
scene I remember is this right after the divorce that Dustin Hoffman is trying to make French

1096
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,620
toast and he doesn't know how to do, he hasn't been in this situation before and it's a disaster.

1097
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,100
And he has a meltdown making the French toast.

1098
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,260
So that would Dr. Doom, I would like to see.

1099
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,820
He can conquer entire nations, but he can't figure out the amount of egg batter.

1100
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,460
Oh, and he's got the big metal hands trying to use the skillet.

1101
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,820
Oh, damn things.

1102
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,780
It's like whatever.

1103
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,060
And he's, yeah, he's got his like science experiments that he's doing perfectly,

1104
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,460
but he can't figure out how to put like nutmeg or cinnamon on the toast.

1105
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,740
Oh, that's comedy.

1106
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:37,620
Can not there be a pan with a handle size to fit giant metal hands?

1107
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,140
I shall invent one.

1108
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,420
Dad, we're hungry.

1109
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,700
Oh, silence.

1110
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,260
Enough of your insolence.

1111
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,340
I will rush this.

1112
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,660
I'm putting it, this will be a rapid operation.

1113
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,860
I'll get, I will have this pan at least by the end of the week.

1114
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,740
Dad, it's not working.

1115
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,820
Well, we'd go to the French toast universe and steal the French toast.

1116
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,900
It pours from the ground, you know.

1117
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,300
Oh, dad, we don't, we're going to be late for school.

1118
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,500
That sounds right up.

1119
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,940
How could there be such a thing?

1120
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,020
Of course, universe, it's all French toast.

1121
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,660
You're making up shit.

1122
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,700
You cut to them like they're in the pan.

1123
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,500
Don't swear.

1124
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,820
They're in the pancake universe.

1125
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,140
Dad, this isn't the French toast universe.

1126
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,460
Close enough.

1127
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,900
Why be so picky?

1128
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,580
Richard's has fooled me again.

1129
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,020
They're stuck there.

1130
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,620
Eat their way out.

1131
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,300
Oh, perfect.

1132
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,220
That is an Academy Award ready to go for whoever.

1133
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,020
Who could that, you know, who's the guy in Buster Scruggs?

1134
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,020
Tim Blake Nelson.

1135
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,060
Yeah, Tim Blake Nelson.

1136
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,180
Okay, sure.

1137
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,580
Welcome to the MCU, Tim Blake Nelson.

1138
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,260
The most affecting, nuanced Dr. Doom.

1139
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:49,780
I would love a run of Oscar winners where it's like real big scene shooing performances.

1140
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:55,220
It's just like, well, they played a real person, so we got to give them the award.

1141
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,500
They got the walk down and they got the voice down.

1142
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,100
Yeah, yeah, you want Doom.

1143
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,860
You want Doom to win is really what you want.

1144
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,380
Yeah, it'll happen.

1145
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,860
Multiple comic book characters should win an Oscar.

1146
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,740
That's what I'm waiting for.

1147
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,460
Doom to win and then I don't know, whoever.

1148
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,740
Swear that it's only, yeah.

1149
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,620
Well, what's a favor?

1150
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,180
Who do you want?

1151
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,620
Who do you want to say, wow, they won an Oscar for playing this person?

1152
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,500
A Gambit of the X-Men.

1153
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,820
I'd like two Gambits to be nominated in one year.

1154
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,060
Who previously played Gambit?

1155
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,260
Taylor Kitsch has only played Gambit.

1156
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,740
And Channing Tatum developed it for years.

1157
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,620
But then it didn't go.

1158
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,500
And it didn't go.

1159
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,700
So yeah, I'd like there to be a situation where two different men are nominated for

1160
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,980
Gambit in one year and they're against each other because somehow.

1161
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,180
Gambit versus Gambit.

1162
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,740
It could be Gambit.

1163
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,060
Well, that's eventually, oh yeah, you're right.

1164
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,300
Maybe that's like the sequel to the two different Gambits.

1165
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,460
There's a Gambit versus Gambit.

1166
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,060
Gambits are getting divorced.

1167
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,860
You marry them and you divorce them.

1168
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,500
And then, yeah.

1169
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,380
Will there be, okay, here's a question.

1170
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:03,460
Will there be in our lifetime in Oscars where all the choices for best performance

1171
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,780
in one of the categories are superheroes?

1172
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,980
I think they're going to have to.

1173
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,860
There's no choice but to do that.

1174
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,740
They are just bleeding viewers.

1175
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:18,980
All of the extreme interest in the Oscars this year via Twitter clips stolen from

1176
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,020
Japanese television of the bizarre thing that happened.

1177
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,620
That doesn't help their ratings.

1178
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:23,940
Right.

1179
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,980
So they ban the guy if they want ratings.

1180
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,700
Will hosts next year.

1181
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:34,260
Yeah, I mean, it's going to be like punches everybody who all the nominated Gambits.

1182
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:35,940
All right.

1183
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,980
A whole best supporting Gambit will be a category.

1184
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,700
That's great.

1185
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,460
I'm loving this.

1186
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,060
Best supporting Gambit in like 2033.

1187
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,620
Yeah, we got closer with that.

1188
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,900
The time out of the telecast was taken to talk.

1189
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,460
It was like most epic scream worthy.

1190
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,540
Yes, it was the flash thing.

1191
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,020
Yeah.

1192
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,900
Speed Force.

1193
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,420
What was the category?

1194
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,860
Most screamable streamable.

1195
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,180
Yeah, what was it?

1196
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,340
Most stand up and yellable.

1197
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,800
Ezra.

1198
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,880
The most sure to not be canceled within six months of this.

1199
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,480
Ezra Miller used the Speed Force to run to Hawaii and beat the shit out of some residents.

1200
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,120
And that was on the Oscars.

1201
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,440
Less people stood up and clapped for that.

1202
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,440
But they're getting there is what I'm saying.

1203
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,720
Got a lot stupider.

1204
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,360
Flash will be on every Oscar telecast going forward.

1205
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,040
There will be flash.

1206
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,540
Yeah.

1207
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,940
Let's we got to talk about what happens in the ride.

1208
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:47,660
Like the story is this is what drew me to I was like what's like how complex could this thing be?

1209
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:52,140
But as I read the story, I'm like, wow, what an interesting justification.

1210
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,780
Of just an up and down ride.

1211
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:55,820
Yes.

1212
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:03,100
And it's yeah, it doesn't need to be this, especially because of the simplicity of the ride.

1213
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,660
So you know, one thing that grabbed my attention that I like a lot is that the place that you're

1214
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,580
in, it's not just some evil lab, you're in the Latvarian embassy.

1215
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:20,380
So he has taken, he is set up kind of a goodwill operation in Islands of Adventure as theme parks

1216
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:27,180
are a host to many different it's it's the things that it's a world's fair where labs are set up

1217
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,500
and open houses and all these companies are very inviting.

1218
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,020
Come in and see, we'll show you everything or we'll train you in something and then all these

1219
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:37,900
things go wrong.

1220
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,900
But in a way, this ride defies that because yeah, it's open house at the Latvarian embassy,

1221
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,420
but exactly what he wants to happen happens.

1222
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:47,980
Yes.

1223
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,660
Nothing goes horribly wrong.

1224
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:49,900
Right.

1225
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,140
It's what he says, come in, I want to extract fear from you.

1226
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,100
And he does it.

1227
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,820
Yeah, because Spider-Man and Hulk, things go wrong on both of them.

1228
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,100
Those were not supposed to be the experiences they promised you.

1229
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,540
This is kind of defying the trope, isn't it?

1230
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,540
You're told what's going to happen and then it happens.

1231
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:12,060
And then you hear it's a weird thing that he's so upfront about it, but it fits with this

1232
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,060
profile of Dr. Doom you guys are painting.

1233
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,820
We're like, well, well, he was honest with us.

1234
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,380
He told you when he was confident.

1235
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,300
Yeah, no, he told you the big picture.

1236
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,900
He told you all of the picture.

1237
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,860
He gave you the full rundown about the dynamo and about the fear fuel, you know?

1238
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,740
Well, so what let's condense this.

1239
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,900
What's the cliff notes of the way we know he's extracting fear fuel, but it is that

1240
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:42,860
this the the the lift, the ride is an invention of his that is designed to be very scary and

1241
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,540
make you very afraid.

1242
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:51,020
And then he's going to suck liquid fear out of the top of your head, it seems,

1243
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,700
from the diagrams shown in the custom videos.

1244
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,900
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1245
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,100
These are very impressive.

1246
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,900
They are.

1247
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,060
Yeah, it's like J Ward style.

1248
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:05,500
Goof is kind of a universal trademark of this time period because there's sort of the

1249
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,980
Goof is in gallon and the men in black you too.

1250
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,780
There is the bumbling back to the future test dummies are a little bit.

1251
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,280
Yes.

1252
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,540
Yeah, the Dudley do right videos.

1253
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,060
The whimsy of the time.

1254
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,780
Yeah, is here.

1255
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,900
More than any other sort of a 60s throwback and what's a little bit retro.

1256
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,340
It's a little film strips.

1257
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,740
But so all right, so machines can extract your fear.

1258
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,020
Hang on.

1259
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,700
I have some questions about this.

1260
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,820
The Latvarian Embassy clears up all of the questions with the video.

1261
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,300
They explain exactly how it works.

1262
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,740
I mean, you know, you know, I'm better.

1263
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,940
So there's one that's kind of a general.

1264
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,500
Here's what's up in Latveria.

1265
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,540
Yeah, it's kind of a it's a it's a pretty funny because

1266
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:54,060
it's like a very like bucolic narration, but everyone looks very sickly and fucked up.

1267
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:04,540
It's it's Latveria is often portrayed as very rural and agrarian to the point of.

1268
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:14,300
Like it's almost comedic how much it's like peasant people in the 1960s, you know, to today.

1269
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,460
But there's there's strong national pride, whether or not they are.

1270
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,660
Choosing whether or not you can have an opinion in this.

1271
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,940
Yeah, and it kind of goes back and forth between who's writing them

1272
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:31,980
because sometimes it is like a very poverty stricken country because doom has taken the whole GDP

1273
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:38,460
and put it towards conquering various things or coming up with whatever mischief.

1274
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,260
And then other times it's like, yeah, no, he's right.

1275
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,380
There's no crime here.

1276
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,700
Everyone has a job.

1277
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,820
Everyone has food.

1278
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,940
They put them back in.

1279
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,820
Yeah, they put it right.

1280
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,180
Democracy didn't work.

1281
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:54,380
We need the iron grip of an evil dictator magician.

1282
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:02,300
Kind of a reoccurring tool in the Marvel universe because in the late 90s, the UN just went fuck it.

1283
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,300
Just give Genosha to Magneto.

1284
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,060
This is easier than fighting him.

1285
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,340
That's true.

1286
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,660
Yeah, the comics have explored a lot of different solutions to world issues, I think, in their mind.

1287
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,060
Yeah.

1288
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,620
Yeah.

1289
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,500
And still to this day.

1290
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,420
So the answer we're all looking for in this tumultuous time might be in a comic.

1291
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,820
In the pages of a comic book.

1292
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,140
Yes.

1293
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,300
They say they shouldn't be studied in schools.

1294
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:26,620
No.

1295
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,100
Yeah.

1296
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,980
I say.

1297
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,180
Yeah, all those people saying they shouldn't be studied in schools, I see all of you.

1298
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:31,660
No way.

1299
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,700
They should be.

1300
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,580
That's what I say.

1301
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,220
Study them.

1302
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,340
I'm pulling that from a special feature about when the Batman movie was made.

1303
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:45,100
Yeah, in 1976, nobody wanted you to look at a comic book.

1304
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,900
I picture like 85-year-old Steve Allen being mad about it.

1305
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,460
Made me think of him when he was in the TV council.

1306
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,260
That's what I'm thinking of.

1307
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,860
Jack Benny thought it was filth.

1308
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,360
Yeah.

1309
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:59,020
So then there's some interesting kind of satire in these propaganda videos.

1310
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:04,860
The quote I wrote down was that, well, hang on.

1311
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,660
I guess we have to explain.

1312
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,740
The fear fall is the invention.

1313
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:17,420
But the fear is being extracted on the fear fall to power another invention.

1314
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:23,340
And that invention, which we don't see, we just hear about it, that's called the Fusion Dynamo.

1315
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,220
I think it's one of the gadgets in the line.

1316
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:30,060
I think it's one of the big kind of doodads in the line.

1317
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,940
OK, that makes sense.

1318
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,780
So you pass the Fusion Dynamo.

1319
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:38,780
The fear is going to fuel the Fusion Dynamo, a powerful super weapon created to destroy,

1320
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,740
by Doom, to destroy the Fantastic Four.

1321
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:48,860
So this system has been in use for a long time in Latveria.

1322
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,660
Yes.

1323
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,780
Citizens line up.

1324
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,820
They do their duty.

1325
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,100
He extracts their fear.

1326
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:59,740
Which leads to this quote that the Fusion Dynamo, this big gun basically,

1327
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:05,500
is a peacekeeping device so powerful it would destroy our country's enemies once and for all.

1328
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,900
That is a great joke.

1329
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,420
That is really funny.

1330
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:17,500
And which then would secure Doom's rightful place as supreme ruler of the formerly free world.

1331
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,420
This is fun stuff.

1332
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:23,180
I had no way to pass by this again because I'm never going to go on the ride.

1333
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,140
I had no idea these delightful little videos were playing in there.

1334
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:32,300
That really falls, like these videos and just sort of like my favorite versions of Fantastic Four,

1335
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,500
I guess like the original run of Fantastic Four or like Mark Wade's run on Fantastic Four.

1336
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:43,260
It has the spirit of fun, funny, pop art.

1337
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,300
Yeah, cosmic, super science.

1338
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,020
Not too heavy.

1339
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,980
It can get heavy if it wants, but like I would say probably because it's,

1340
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,940
people were doing like kind of sort of J Ward retro stuff at the time.

1341
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:00,060
But I also think this fits really well, like historically with Fantastic Four stuff.

1342
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,060
Like the, like I think, I forget who pitched it.

1343
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,340
Was it Peyton Reed or something?

1344
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:08,380
It was like 60s Fantastic Four movie, like doing a fun sort of retro style.

1345
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,740
Like this all just lends itself to that property in my mind.

1346
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,580
That's all the stuff I like about it.

1347
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,580
The Jack Kirby art that you have on your shirt.

1348
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,140
It's like very retro and fun.

1349
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,780
And these videos are like in that spirit.

1350
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,580
That's what I like.

1351
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,620
Even the Incredibles, you've seen the Incredibles.

1352
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,660
Like Incredibles has taken a lot from Fantastic Four.

1353
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,220
Oh, definitely.

1354
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:28,380
Yeah.

1355
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,140
Don't the powers essentially line up?

1356
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:30,780
They're very similar.

1357
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,580
Very similar.

1358
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,820
Family kind of.

1359
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:38,380
But there's a lot of mid-century modern architecture in the Incredibles.

1360
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,700
And like there's a little pop up, the music and stuff.

1361
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,780
Kind of forever 60s basically.

1362
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,420
Yeah.

1363
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:48,380
So yeah, that fits really nicely in my dream version of the Fantastic Four.

1364
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:48,940
Yeah.

1365
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,620
Another one where you meet an individual, a character named Leopold.

1366
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:57,260
And he's taught about the big picture because he's confused.

1367
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,980
Why is this fear extracting machine a good thing?

1368
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,300
But once you see the big picture, you know, that it's ultimately

1369
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:10,940
so that a big gun can be fired at anybody who opposes doom's rule in Liberia.

1370
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,300
So that's all fun.

1371
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,460
And then you, now you've been there.

1372
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:22,620
Are we missing anything in the story, in the queue?

1373
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:29,660
No, I mean, the videos are shown on, I think an interesting choice.

1374
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,420
And I don't know how they settled on, but it's like a big vertical screen.

1375
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:40,220
Like it's a long screen and it's kind of in between like banners or flags or stuff.

1376
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,820
It just fits in right.

1377
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,700
And it just looks, it's interesting in a way that a lot of the men in black stuff

1378
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,540
is still four by three TVs.

1379
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:53,260
But this is aged because it's kind of not really glued to any time period.

1380
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,540
Well, yeah, the long ways.

1381
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,260
It's what the kids want.

1382
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:55,420
Yeah.

1383
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,460
This is like, what's like Quidditch?

1384
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,580
So it's come back around.

1385
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,080
Yeah.

1386
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,180
This is before.

1387
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,100
Casimir got his idea.

1388
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,220
He was rewriting this ride and he saw the screen like that.

1389
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:05,420
Yeah.

1390
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,900
And he said, oh, this screen equals take over the world.

1391
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,060
And that's how the Quibi idea was born.

1392
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:12,380
Wow.

1393
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:17,660
The turnstile technology, a crazy invention like Dr. Doom himself would dream up.

1394
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,140
Yep.

1395
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:24,780
I'll say this kind of a negative about some of the operations of this ride is that if you

1396
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:29,900
do have an express pass, you go around the entrance, you go around the main entrance

1397
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,980
and upstairs outside.

1398
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,180
Here's the issue.

1399
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,940
And you go right to the loading.

1400
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:35,980
Here's the issue with this.

1401
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,620
Here's the issue.

1402
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:41,980
You do miss the queue, which is a big part of this because the ride is so short and not

1403
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,900
themed on the actual thrill part of it.

1404
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,700
Yeah, I see.

1405
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,180
That's kind of a part of the part of the experience.

1406
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,460
Well, how long does this line get?

1407
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:49,980
How long am I sitting in?

1408
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,260
It's not usually that long.

1409
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,820
Yeah, I don't think I don't think it can.

1410
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,780
You got two towers, so we're loading a lot.

1411
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,100
Yeah.

1412
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,940
They're fitting a lot of riders onto this thing.

1413
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:04,140
And I feel like this is not a super popular ride in the sense that I don't see people

1414
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:08,060
posting about it a lot in the way they might Hulk or Spider-Man.

1415
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,100
Well, I think it's hard to record footage on it.

1416
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:16,780
I mean, Universal has done some like the roots are going to ride it and they get very upset.

1417
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,020
Sure.

1418
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,580
And they had a video where like...

1419
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,260
Did Jimmy Fallon do it or just the roots?

1420
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,340
Jimmy Fallon sent the roots.

1421
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,900
Because Jimmy rode the Rock Coaster with Kevin Hart?

1422
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,620
Yes.

1423
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:28,940
Okay.

1424
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,380
And that was in the other park, but he sent the roots to Dr. Doom.

1425
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:32,940
Yeah.

1426
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:33,260
Okay.

1427
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,660
And then there's another video.

1428
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,460
Come on, Jimmy.

1429
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,420
I mean, I'm not I'm one to talk, I guess.

1430
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,820
Jimmy did the Rock Coaster though.

1431
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,260
He was that's pretty hardcore.

1432
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,620
He wasn't too afraid to rock.

1433
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,100
I'll say that.

1434
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:47,980
I like that about him.

1435
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:48,460
Yeah.

1436
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,580
Well, he's a music guy.

1437
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,060
That's true.

1438
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:59,020
So he there's a video too, when like Universal like had like a talking head kind of run of videos

1439
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,620
five or six years ago, like a Maria Menounos type.

1440
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,460
There's a guy and he's like, I've written the whole setup was he's like,

1441
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:10,380
I've written every ride in this park, but this one, because I don't like heights,

1442
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,660
but I'm going to do it.

1443
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:17,820
And then he starts to chicken out and then Doom is there, like prodding him and Doom.

1444
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,500
This is my dream is he gets it.

1445
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,900
Doom gets him in the safety heart.

1446
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,980
Doom checks his safety harness.

1447
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:26,460
Whoa.

1448
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,780
Your dream is Doom to check your safety harness?

1449
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,140
Well, for Doom to put me in the Doom ride.

1450
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:34,940
Okay.

1451
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,460
Pull that strap if you could.

1452
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,660
Do give that another turn.

1453
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:38,540
Yellow strap.

1454
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,660
Tug on it, please.

1455
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,580
I got to check my old laptop.

1456
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,380
I thought I had a picture on Instagram of me and Doom.

1457
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:44,780
Have you?

1458
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,060
Yeah, I was gonna say, have you met him?

1459
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:46,940
Like 10 years ago.

1460
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,860
I don't think I met Doom at Islands of Adventure.

1461
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,580
Yeah, I did.

1462
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,260
Yeah, I got a picture too with the walk around.

1463
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:51,740
Really?

1464
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,260
It looks pretty good.

1465
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,100
Is it metal or is it like plastic?

1466
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,260
I think it's like a split the different.

1467
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,860
It's not like glossy metal.

1468
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,460
I think it's it's plastic.

1469
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,740
I met Cyclops.

1470
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:05,020
I have a photo of Cyclops and some of the X-Men, but I don't think I met Doom.

1471
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,700
Yeah, I just happened to catch him.

1472
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,940
He was standing outside the alleyway to this ride.

1473
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,580
Okay.

1474
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,420
That's why I didn't go on the ride.

1475
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,220
Don't want to bother you.

1476
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:12,860
Just big fan.

1477
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:13,820
I'm sure you hear it all the time.

1478
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,180
I have given you so much fear juice, my man.

1479
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,940
He'll probably more than this water bottle, I would think.

1480
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:21,980
Probably like 10 of these things.

1481
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:29,580
This is maybe a big part why it doesn't have a big ride is it is set back from the main drag.

1482
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,060
Yes.

1483
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,660
Hulk you see when you walk in.

1484
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:35,820
Spider-Man has a queue right in the center of the land as an entryway and a marquee.

1485
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:37,900
It would be easy to miss this.

1486
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,140
Yeah.

1487
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,780
So yeah, that might be part of it too.

1488
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:47,020
But yeah, I just meant that it's not, I don't think it makes people's lists as much,

1489
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,860
but there's a lot here as we're talking about.

1490
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:51,180
This is infuriating to say to Jason.

1491
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,180
You've just said this is not pop people.

1492
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,460
Don't talk about it.

1493
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,300
His anger juice is rising.

1494
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,820
He's giving off so much anger juice.

1495
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,260
I think it deserves to be higher on the list.

1496
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,620
What's what we're doing here today?

1497
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:05,980
We're raising awareness.

1498
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:10,060
But also I benefit because then I don't have to wait for too long for it.

1499
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,460
So after this episode comes out, it's going to be the rush.

1500
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,020
We're going to give this thing.

1501
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,540
It's going to be like the gold rush.

1502
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,180
Second wave.

1503
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,620
The gold rush, whatever year that was 150 years ago.

1504
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,140
Gold rush right to Florida.

1505
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,100
Fear juice rush.

1506
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,100
To give, give, give doom the fear juice.

1507
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,140
So now you're next time we go, we're going to wait for like 90 minutes.

1508
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:28,380
Yeah.

1509
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:33,580
I mean, I walked through this, the embassy portion of this queue pretty quickly,

1510
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:39,660
except I was stopping to watch the videos and I took pictures and I was like,

1511
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,500
Mike, there's a whole doctor.

1512
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,460
There's so much I forgot about.

1513
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:44,700
Yeah.

1514
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,100
I didn't, I didn't remember that before you said anything.

1515
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:47,260
Yeah.

1516
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,860
Because obviously I was scared of the ride.

1517
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,980
I didn't want to do it, but I haven't seen any of the, yeah.

1518
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,540
Not a person.

1519
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,060
I'm like gone into the line.

1520
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,620
I should have.

1521
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:55,740
And yeah, but I should.

1522
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,060
Yeah.

1523
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:00,700
So, so I didn't, I didn't even realize it was all there, which I regret now.

1524
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,460
Not at least going and then chickening out.

1525
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,900
But then I guess I couldn't chicken out because I, I would be so embarrassed.

1526
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,340
Well, but if you do chicken out, the, the upstairs

1527
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:15,100
walkway, once you get out of the interior or the line and stuff, the, the spot where you load into

1528
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,580
the towers is really close to the X.

1529
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,420
Like you could just go like, you know what?

1530
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:24,060
I'm going to go and just kind of like go around.

1531
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:24,460
Yeah.

1532
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:30,220
But then like what if doom was there and he saw me, they might have them ready just for that.

1533
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,140
For like with this video they filmed.

1534
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:32,460
Yeah.

1535
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:32,700
Yeah.

1536
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,020
Yeah.

1537
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:33,740
And it's coward.

1538
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:38,460
And then I I'm just giving off all this coward juice, the cowardly juice that's coming out of my

1539
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,780
head, which he can't do anything with.

1540
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:44,620
He's got to like dispose of that somewhere else, like bacon grease.

1541
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:44,860
Yeah.

1542
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,380
That's like, that's a nuisance to him.

1543
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:49,340
I got to make a trip to a plant now.

1544
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:52,460
Well, he cooks for his daughter with that cowardly juice.

1545
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,060
He uses it.

1546
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:57,500
He just, I'll use it for something for the French toast.

1547
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:02,700
It actually, you know, coward, coward juice kind of gives it a certain little tinge.

1548
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:02,940
Yeah.

1549
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,700
So it really helped the relationship.

1550
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:05,500
Grilled cheese.

1551
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,700
It's an old diner trick.

1552
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:18,620
One aspect of this story also is that he has, okay, so he's been, he's been yanking fear juice

1553
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:24,620
out of people for a long time, but he's exhausted his Latvarian supply.

1554
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,980
He does like everybody who's going to do it there has done it.

1555
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:28,940
You got to go somewhere else.

1556
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:35,420
So he chooses Orlando, Florida as so many evil or good or just inventive businesses do.

1557
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,660
It all lands in Florida.

1558
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,220
It's a hub.

1559
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:39,820
It's a hub of fear.

1560
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,900
I've been thinking about relocating to Lake Nona.

1561
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,740
It's kind of an exciting area.

1562
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,980
It's on the road.

1563
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,740
Hustling and bustling they say.

1564
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:57,180
But he, but anyway, this, this premise that like I got to go to America.

1565
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:59,740
Well, let me, I'm going to get into here.

1566
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:04,700
What I, Mike, my text message conversation with Chris Cantwell, who joined us

1567
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:09,820
long ago to talk about dog patch USA, a very fun episode from a couple years ago.

1568
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:16,060
So him being a person who is, has been fully steeped in Dr. Doom,

1569
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,420
who spent a lot of time thinking about Dr. Doom, writing the character.

1570
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,540
I was, I was interested in a couple aspects of this.

1571
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:26,540
I just laid out, I gave him a paragraph of here's what the story is.

1572
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:30,780
And question one, does this, does this line up?

1573
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,260
Does this like logically make sense?

1574
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:38,300
Dr. Doom has a big contraption is going to extract fear just from people to power

1575
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,820
the fusion dynamo.

1576
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:46,620
And his, his first thought was, well, it seems like Dr. Doom has just seen Monsters Inc.

1577
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,620
And is rerouting the idea into something similar.

1578
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,780
I said, well, he did beat the fusion dynamo as it does beat Monsters Inc.

1579
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,740
So he did get there.

1580
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,700
It did get there first.

1581
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:00,060
But I just said, harnessing fear.

1582
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,940
Does that seem consistent with the characters?

1583
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,780
That seemed like something you would do because I don't understand.

1584
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,180
I don't know the history in the ins and outs.

1585
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:10,940
And he said 100% because Dr. Doom is not only a brilliant scientist,

1586
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:15,820
but also a gifted sorcerer as you laid out, noting that he once fought the devil.

1587
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:21,900
So he said, well, okay, so this either has to be a biometric psycho enzymatic energy system,

1588
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:26,540
never before fathomed, or he's using really potent dark arts to fuel his plans.

1589
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:30,140
I just really hope that the ride clarified because he is always very specific.

1590
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:34,060
Does this fall more on the science end of things or more on the God end of things?

1591
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:35,980
I think it's science.

1592
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,820
Yeah, that's my inclination.

1593
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:38,460
Yeah.

1594
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,140
Now, I don't quite understand how it works.

1595
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,180
I can't picture what liquid fear is.

1596
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,580
It feels like it's verging on sorcery, but he's probably mixing the two

1597
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:49,900
in everything he does.

1598
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:54,060
Well, right, because the way that they're showing it off is a very simplistic way,

1599
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:58,300
but it does feel like it's, yeah, juice that's flowing out of a head.

1600
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:03,820
But I guess it could be representing the idea that's leaving the head.

1601
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,740
Is it sweat in a way?

1602
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,180
I mean, you don't always sweat because you're afraid,

1603
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:11,020
but you might sweat a lot if you're afraid.

1604
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:11,820
Yeah.

1605
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:12,860
Is it aura?

1606
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:16,140
Is it like an energy field you're giving off?

1607
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:16,620
Maybe.

1608
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:17,740
Well, this is, you know what?

1609
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,780
It's unclear in Monsters Inc. in a way, too.

1610
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,660
You see those cans a lot, the scream can, and then it kind of comes out like a gas more often,

1611
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,580
but I don't really know what's going into those.

1612
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:33,500
Cans when you're when a kid screams, what, what are you bottling up?

1613
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,300
Maybe it is something you can't see.

1614
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,540
It's invisible like COVID-19 or something.

1615
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,980
I think it's well, what particles are smaller?

1616
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,820
Fear particles or COVID particles?

1617
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,820
Is it like a propane?

1618
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,780
Is propane a liquid sometimes and a gas other times?

1619
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,060
I don't fully understand.

1620
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,420
Uh, maybe that's right.

1621
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,100
I think you can have liquid propane.

1622
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,220
States like a lot of women's would have.

1623
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:00,300
But yeah, maybe it's like, uh, uh, it's smaller than a quark.

1624
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:00,780
I don't know.

1625
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,460
What are fear particles?

1626
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:08,140
If it manifests itself in sweat, Orlando, Florida is a great starting point for sure.

1627
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:08,540
Literal.

1628
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,380
Maybe it is truly just sweat.

1629
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,380
It's just sweat and it's got your fear in it.

1630
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:15,100
It's just collecting jugs of sweat.

1631
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:15,660
Yeah.

1632
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,300
Jugs of sweat out in the flora heat.

1633
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:18,940
Yeah.

1634
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,940
And if it's boiling and bubbling.

1635
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:24,780
And sweat has a different signature on it, depending on what emotion caused it or what

1636
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,740
feeling caused it.

1637
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:31,020
So if you're sweating, cause like, uh, a lady walked by on a beach that you found attractive,

1638
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:36,060
that would be a different signature in the sweat than if you were afraid of dropping

1639
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:36,940
a high distance.

1640
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,140
Yeah.

1641
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:42,700
If you're sweating because a character put their snoot against your face.

1642
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:47,740
If you were at, yeah, if you were at Mickey's kitchen and a snoot was rubbed on your head

1643
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:55,500
and, uh, you heard a noise through the snoot, then yeah, that sweat that you're pouring

1644
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,380
out of your pores is going to be different than the fear sweat.

1645
01:12:58,380 --> 01:12:58,780
So maybe that's what it is.

1646
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,740
He has no use for that.

1647
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,220
That's why he didn't station at Lake Pointa Vista.

1648
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,100
He did it over.

1649
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,820
Exactly.

1650
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,340
In the universal side of things.

1651
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:05,820
Exactly.

1652
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,900
Um, here's the other, so that was just, I was just like, does this logic make sense?

1653
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,340
Does this seemly said, yes, absolutely.

1654
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,180
That's viable adds up.

1655
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:18,380
And then I, then I had a follow up question, which is if you were handed this story, uh,

1656
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:22,060
this is, this is going to be the story arc for your next issue.

1657
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:22,860
It's this way.

1658
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,660
We figured out it's the fusion dynamo and the fear extracting.

1659
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,340
Does this add up?

1660
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,260
What would you say in a story meeting?

1661
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,700
Would you have any concerns?

1662
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:35,660
So he said, my one qualm would be that he would use the device on his own citizens.

1663
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,740
He famously loved Latvarians and makes it so they want for nothing.

1664
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,540
Although they aren't allowed to speak out against the state.

1665
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,420
They're mostly really happy, although there is resistance.

1666
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:50,060
So I'd make it that he was using the fear fall invention against people resisting him

1667
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:53,740
from inside the country, like captured underground members.

1668
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,580
Oh, what do you think of this?

1669
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:56,460
Is that a decent?

1670
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:56,940
That's great.

1671
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,660
No sense.

1672
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,220
Yeah.

1673
01:13:58,220 --> 01:13:58,540
Yeah.

1674
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,580
That makes some extra, some logic applied from somebody who's

1675
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,340
lived with a character for a long time.

1676
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:03,820
Right.

1677
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,900
Um, would he make the machine fun?

1678
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,660
That's question.

1679
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:09,500
Would it be, would you get a thrill ride?

1680
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,380
Would it be fun?

1681
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,740
Thrill out of it.

1682
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,420
Or does that, I don't know.

1683
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,380
I mean, you'd have to, I, I don't have the answer to that.

1684
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,980
Um, but if it, you know, maybe like a relative,

1685
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:24,300
a fear juice is like, uh, giggle juice.

1686
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:24,860
Okay.

1687
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,300
Maybe there's some shock.

1688
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,900
They switched to laughter.

1689
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:28,620
Oh yeah.

1690
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:33,740
Maybe he's figuring that out too, that actually it was more powerful because everyone was having

1691
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,620
so much fun.

1692
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,140
Come here.

1693
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,820
Let's doom tickle you.

1694
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:43,420
And yeah, then he dismantles the machine and he did, why build that when I could just have

1695
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,620
some feathers.

1696
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,100
Dooms tickle fast.

1697
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:50,780
Dr. Doom's that tickle fest new summer, 2022.

1698
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,900
If it's an Island's adventure, Jason's going to be so excited.

1699
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:54,700
Oh man.

1700
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,140
Whatever it is.

1701
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:58,780
Don't care.

1702
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,140
Anyway, I like that note.

1703
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:03,820
I mean, the videos kind of helped me explain, it helped me understand that like they are

1704
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,780
volunteering.

1705
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,980
They're also kind of brainwashed.

1706
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:11,420
Like, yes, I would love to give Dr. Doom my fear, but I see the point that, oh, is that

1707
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:16,380
yeah, maybe he wouldn't want to like torture, like, you know, like, you know, like, you

1708
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:19,420
know, torture, but then it is as we're discovering.

1709
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:19,980
I don't know.

1710
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:25,980
I think that's a good little, that's a smart character turn that justifies past mythology

1711
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:32,140
and I don't know, goes to show Chris could move Dr. Doom to any medium that he wished.

1712
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,780
I like this.

1713
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,980
I just like this theme park logic.

1714
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:38,620
I think you could apply, you could ask him to square the circle of any number of rides.

1715
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:39,580
Yeah.

1716
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:39,980
Yeah.

1717
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:44,300
Do we have like, are there, are there logic issues that were, I'm trying to think.

1718
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,260
We're pretty flawless.

1719
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:51,660
You know, pretty, yeah, we know all theme park rides are airtight, but who is evac?

1720
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:55,740
Why didn't Bumblebee, why isn't Bumblebee just the star of the ride?

1721
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,220
That's clear.

1722
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:56,780
No, it's clear.

1723
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,260
That's all clear.

1724
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,060
That's all clear.

1725
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,780
That's all clear.

1726
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,100
Okay.

1727
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,140
That was truly, that episode was such a flurry.

1728
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:05,180
I did not, my evac section just went out the door.

1729
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:07,900
I had a lot of questions about evac, but it's not the time.

1730
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,460
Not the time.

1731
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:09,420
Okay.

1732
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:10,220
We sewed it up.

1733
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:14,780
It's very clear now that, that Transformers is better than Residual System.

1734
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:15,500
We solved it.

1735
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:21,420
One week, Mike's going off, going off on Trans, going off about Transformers.

1736
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,900
Next week, I'm going buck wild on Doctor Doom.

1737
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:26,620
You know, just getting it out of our system.

1738
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,500
You say as you gingerly kick your leg.

1739
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,860
As I gingerly kick my leg.

1740
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,460
I'm going buck wild.

1741
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,180
Like a schoolboy.

1742
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:35,820
Like a little, like a young schoolboy.

1743
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,380
Like a schoolboy on a Thursday afternoon.

1744
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,460
Just talking about my buddy Victor.

1745
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:45,660
You know what was going buck wild was when you brought this up as an episode topic.

1746
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,140
And I said, I'm just going to ask a question.

1747
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:51,020
I'm nervous to ask the question, but I'm going to say the question.

1748
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,340
Are we sure this is a main feat?

1749
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,220
And I was not done with the question before the yes.

1750
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:56,620
Yes.

1751
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:56,860
Yes.

1752
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:57,500
Yeah.

1753
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,100
That was Jason's anger juice coming out.

1754
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:01,340
Yeah.

1755
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,100
But you know what?

1756
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,540
Like I said, I didn't know all this was there.

1757
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:06,860
Sure.

1758
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,140
I know we're getting fun little videos.

1759
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,660
I didn't know that we're, this has to be besides the tower of terrors.

1760
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,740
And I consider that kind of a different genre.

1761
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:17,900
Leg danglers with the, with the, the, the industry term leg danglers.

1762
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,060
Yeah.

1763
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,980
This is the only leg dangler with a story that involves a mythology that people are

1764
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:22,540
invested in.

1765
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:27,900
Like you guys, you got to show up and well, not you, Mike, but Jason got to partake in

1766
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:31,580
a proud legacy by going on this leg dangler.

1767
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:36,380
They're interesting story too of what wasn't built.

1768
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:44,620
There's a lot of cool concept art where this ride was going to use the, what is the

1769
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:44,860
phrase?

1770
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,100
The Intamin first generation free fall.

1771
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,180
And this might look familiar.

1772
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:51,500
This is at a lot of like Six Flags parks.

1773
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,940
Sometimes it's labeled like Superman or Superman the escape.

1774
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:55,180
Yeah.

1775
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:55,420
Cool.

1776
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,700
This is, it's the kind that's more of that like ramps down.

1777
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,940
So you end the ride on your back.

1778
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:01,260
Yes.

1779
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,140
It's L shape.

1780
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:03,420
So you're going to wear a little cage.

1781
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:11,580
It, it has an elevator and it kind of pushes you forward at the top and then you drop and

1782
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,980
you kind of drop on a curve.

1783
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:14,220
Yeah.

1784
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:15,580
And you end you on your back.

1785
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:22,860
It, a couple of websites said Disney did briefly consider this for tower of terror.

1786
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,460
And then they were like, oh, we'll just build our own system.

1787
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,860
You know, better than a cage where you're lying.

1788
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:29,980
It's better than a cage.

1789
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:32,060
But if you were a water slide in a box,

1790
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:39,100
that that parking metal water, that movie park in Italy, we talked about during the

1791
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:43,580
European vacation tower of terror, which is that style.

1792
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:44,860
Yeah.

1793
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:48,620
Where you go forward and then you drop and you end up on your back.

1794
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,380
You know, it's really rickety.

1795
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:50,620
Yeah.

1796
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,820
Really not safe.

1797
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,900
It ended up being with the kind of companies S and S.

1798
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,580
S and S worldwide is their current name.

1799
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,180
And this is a, oh, sorry.

1800
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:05,900
I was going to say that like most of these kinds of things, if there's a launch,

1801
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,780
probably that company built it.

1802
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:15,580
The expired defunct California adventure ride, the Malibu boomer was the same company.

1803
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,620
And the Santa slightly less high.

1804
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,860
It was a sure.

1805
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,540
And this is a ride that I did do that.

1806
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,940
I was like tricked into doing or not tricked.

1807
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:29,180
I knew what it did, but boy, was it more intense than I thought it was going to be very

1808
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:29,500
terrible.

1809
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,700
The most terrified I've ever been.

1810
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,740
What was the ride profile of the Malibu boomer again?

1811
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,060
Was it a slow dangle with dangling?

1812
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:38,860
Exactly the same.

1813
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:43,100
You lift up a tiny bit and then you're shot way up and then it's kind of back and forth,

1814
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:43,660
back and forth.

1815
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:44,220
Got it.

1816
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:49,660
I would love to read the internal documents of what is the story of the Malibu boomer.

1817
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,100
What is it?

1818
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,860
Well, isn't it?

1819
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,620
It's a big carnival game.

1820
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:58,780
You are the little, you're the ringing the bell.

1821
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:00,940
I don't know what it is that shoots up to ring the bell.

1822
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,140
The ball, you're the ball.

1823
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,340
It's ringing the bell.

1824
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,860
A disc, a puck.

1825
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,260
What hits the bell?

1826
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,380
We are carnival boys.

1827
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,340
We're theme park boys.

1828
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:09,900
So I don't know.

1829
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,660
Talking about the hammer that you try to hit and the prize.

1830
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:14,060
Okay.

1831
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,140
If you are the giant.

1832
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,060
That was the idea.

1833
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,260
Again, not so convey, but I think there were scores on the tower.

1834
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:23,660
Yeah.

1835
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,060
Now I can picture it as you're saying this.

1836
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:30,460
So that one got taken down.

1837
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,020
There are a bunch.

1838
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:36,220
You know what is the same type of ride is the ride at the very top of the stratosphere,

1839
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:41,740
which is it was at some point in time was the tallest ride, not the tallest ride,

1840
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,980
but the highest ride in the world.

1841
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,780
The ride that gets you the highest in the world.

1842
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,620
And that's what Jason's going to jump off of one day.

1843
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,260
One day.

1844
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,140
It's the stratosphere.

1845
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:50,700
Yeah.

1846
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,380
Those rides have changed so many times.

1847
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,140
The roller coaster, I believe it's long gone

1848
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:56,140
because it was a bit in the S.

1849
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:01,260
This I think is still there, but there's a change that I didn't know about.

1850
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,860
I missed the point in time where the stratosphere became the strat.

1851
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,820
Oh, it's the strat.

1852
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:06,140
Yeah.

1853
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:06,780
Strat.

1854
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:07,180
Yeah.

1855
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:07,820
It's our buddy.

1856
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:08,540
It's been around so long.

1857
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:09,900
I didn't know this at all.

1858
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,060
Yeah.

1859
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:10,540
I missed that.

1860
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,100
The strat.

1861
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,540
I was staring at the article for the strat.

1862
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,420
Is it on the building?

1863
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,140
Does it say that?

1864
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:17,100
I think so.

1865
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,580
Sign.

1866
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:17,900
Yeah.

1867
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,580
That's what you pull up to.

1868
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,980
You know, which is interesting.

1869
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,380
And my only note would be that it's stupid.

1870
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,940
All uppercase too.

1871
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,100
Oh, that's part of the change?

1872
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:29,980
The strat.

1873
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:30,700
Yeah.

1874
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,500
The strat.

1875
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,940
So it's meant to be shouted.

1876
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,220
Wow.

1877
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:34,700
Really?

1878
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:38,060
You're only allowed to say it with like a group of your rowdy friends.

1879
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:39,420
The strat.

1880
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,660
Oh my goodness.

1881
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:46,220
I mean, I think the rotating restaurant is probably the big selling point of the strat.

1882
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,900
Like at the top, the cocktail bar and restaurant up there.

1883
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,180
More than the rides?

1884
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,620
I, yeah, maybe more than the rides at this point.

1885
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,940
There's a drop still up there.

1886
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:03,260
Vegas, not known for aesthetic consistency, but I looked at the strat website a bit and been like,

1887
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,100
I don't know what this place is deal is.

1888
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:05,340
Yeah.

1889
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:05,900
Yeah.

1890
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,300
I'm shocked.

1891
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:15,020
So anyway, but the thing that those rides don't have is story.

1892
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:15,340
Right.

1893
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,540
Is placemaking.

1894
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:19,420
Well, and then, okay, then before we wrap it up,

1895
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:25,820
the ride itself, once you're on the vehicle, then you're looking at the doors that you enter through.

1896
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:27,660
They're just doors.

1897
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:30,700
You think when you're going through them one way, but when you get in position,

1898
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:35,900
big Dr. Doom head staring at you, eyes flashing.

1899
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:36,700
Yeah.

1900
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,780
They do play up the dictator angle of like images of him everywhere.

1901
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,420
Yeah.

1902
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,940
In the comics and in the ride.

1903
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,140
Jason's got him on a shirt.

1904
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,500
Or I got him on the shirt.

1905
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,620
I got this on Etsy.

1906
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,980
I forget the name of the account.

1907
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,020
I bought it from.

1908
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,540
But I look it up.

1909
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:57,340
There was Jason showed that promo art or the possible art with the water slide with the box,

1910
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,180
but it had a big green goblin head.

1911
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:03,020
And I always want to say, like I was going to mention earlier, like big heads.

1912
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,860
I like it.

1913
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,220
Big heads are awesome.

1914
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,140
That's a big green goblin head.

1915
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,140
I'm not exactly sure what that was going to be in that art.

1916
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:11,340
Jason, what do you think from there?

1917
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,020
Well, it says labyrinth.

1918
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,220
It almost looks like some sort of haunted house or something.

1919
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,820
Green goblin haunted house.

1920
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:18,620
Yes, please.

1921
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:25,900
This appears to be a Doctor Octopus spinner ride where each arm holds his tentacles.

1922
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,660
That looks so great.

1923
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,180
I don't know how it would have aged, but.

1924
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:31,420
Creepy and almost medieval a little bit.

1925
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:35,900
That's an interesting vibe that is not the vibe of Marvel and Islands of Adventure.

1926
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,260
One website credited this concept art to Neil Adams.

1927
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:42,140
The recently passed away comics legend.

1928
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:45,100
Actually, I could see that in the green goblin face.

1929
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,180
Now that you talk about it, it does look like his style.

1930
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,220
I don't know that it is, but it looks like it to me.

1931
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:57,580
There's a piece of art online that was credited to Neil Adams for Dudley Do-Rex Rips All Falls.

1932
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:01,340
They might have just had him doing concept sketches.

1933
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,180
That's big heads.

1934
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,460
Big heads in theme park worlds.

1935
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,020
Big heads in something like Krusty and Krustyland.

1936
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:10,380
Big heads.

1937
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:15,260
Maybe this goes back to my wanting to see Optimus Prime's giant head.

1938
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,540
Maybe that is.

1939
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:17,340
That's where the big head comes at.

1940
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:17,580
Yeah.

1941
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:22,060
Maybe it is a big, maybe it's wanting to see these things at the highest possible scale.

1942
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:27,100
But Doom, it's, Doom or a green goblin, obviously those,

1943
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,060
those are heads I have a lot of affection for already.

1944
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,740
Two of my favorite heads for sure.

1945
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:39,740
I've got a lot of, now I'm blanking on big heads in, I can't picture a lot in Disney.

1946
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,900
Like on the outside of a building.

1947
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,140
Kong Skull Island is a big head.

1948
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:45,260
It's kind of only his head.

1949
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,700
It's just like upper shoulders.

1950
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,900
I mean the robot at the end.

1951
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,940
Yeah, the robot at the end is a big head.

1952
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,180
This feels different than what I think you're describing.

1953
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:52,060
You're right.

1954
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:57,100
You're talking about an exterior head that is not even, it's not, Krusty's not Krusty.

1955
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,220
It's a representation of Krusty.

1956
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:00,380
Yeah, it's sort of right.

1957
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,460
Woody, Toy Story in Japan.

1958
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:03,180
Yes, thank you.

1959
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:03,980
That's perfect.

1960
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:06,620
Yeah, in Toy Story Land in Japan, a big Woody head.

1961
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:07,820
I like the big Woody head.

1962
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:11,500
Giant heads in general are really great.

1963
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:15,180
But yeah, big Doom head and big Green Goblin.

1964
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,180
Are there any on the Disneyland property?

1965
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,300
Is there a big head?

1966
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:23,340
Am I crazy for not conjuring what is a big, especially when you walk,

1967
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,420
do you like walking through the big head's mouth?

1968
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:29,900
It would be, I mean you go in Monstro on Storybook.

1969
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:30,940
That's a big head.

1970
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:31,580
No, I know.

1971
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,020
I'm just thinking through this here.

1972
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:33,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1973
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:35,180
Just picture in big stuff.

1974
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:40,140
It feels like a big head doesn't go, there's no big head room in most of the lands.

1975
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,700
Like that wouldn't thematically fit.

1976
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,620
I know, so I'm flashing a California adventure.

1977
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,420
Are we looking, whoa, big head.

1978
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:51,180
Are people yelling about, this is the big head.

1979
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:57,100
Do you go through the rock bear's mouth and the grizzly rapids ride?

1980
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:57,420
No.

1981
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,060
You do not.

1982
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:01,820
No, that'd be a thousand times better ride if you did.

1983
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:02,320
Yes.

1984
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,680
No, I don't think there's a big head in Disneyland.

1985
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,720
More big heads.

1986
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,800
Get big heads in Disneyland, clearly.

1987
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:09,280
Yeah.

1988
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,760
You would have loved that hotel where you were supposed to be,

1989
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,000
like the hotel is Mickey Mouse's body.

1990
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,520
One of Eisner's first ideas when he showed up.

1991
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,720
One of the brilliant ideas of that man that didn't get built.

1992
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,280
Yeah, the leg straddling Riverside Drive.

1993
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:24,640
Mickey's.

1994
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,120
No way.

1995
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:30,320
So many people would have gone by and just fired rifles into his crotch.

1996
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,160
Stay in Mickey's spleen.

1997
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,840
I'm in the Mickey's spleen suite.

1998
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,640
It's a great idea though, honestly.

1999
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,520
I'm in his right pinky toe where, yeah, it's kind of, I don't know,

2000
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,400
but at least it's close to the restaurant.

2001
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,280
Where are you at?

2002
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:45,780
It is.

2003
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,680
It is, no, it's good.

2004
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,680
We want that to be built though, right?

2005
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,320
Yeah, sure.

2006
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:55,520
Oh, I live over by the big Mecca Mickey in Verbeck.

2007
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,200
You can see it from space.

2008
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,360
Yeah, you know, the big Ultraman Mickey.

2009
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,420
Yeah.

2010
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,360
Other thing I learned about this that when Doom taught, there's a line in this ride

2011
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,360
that you, I believe this is said when you're on it, that he says,

2012
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,000
your terror sucked from the very marrow of your being.

2013
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,680
Love that.

2014
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:23,280
And the Doom voice in this, I believe, is a Doom voice in other stuff, in cartoons around that time.

2015
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,320
But then I'm looking through the, what has this voice actor done?

2016
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,600
Neil Ross is the name, the one that screamed at me,

2017
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:37,040
the announcer of the video that Marty watches about the Bif Tanan Museum.

2018
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:38,160
Yes.

2019
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:38,800
Wow.

2020
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,080
My favorite things.

2021
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:44,000
Probably had the most impact of any scene on me as a kid because it made me realize I don't want

2022
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:44,560
to make movies.

2023
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,600
I want to make things like that.

2024
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,760
I want to make the Bif Tanan video.

2025
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:53,680
That's funny because as a kid, I also want to be like, I want to write,

2026
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:59,920
uh, in Doom bots ignore safety warnings and set for maximum extraction.

2027
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,760
Ignore, he sells them to ignore the, yeah.

2028
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,960
Oh, so you don't realize, and then doesn't he say like, put your head against the headrest.

2029
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,560
I don't want to miss a drop.

2030
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,000
Prepare to be terrorized.

2031
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:12,880
Don't want to miss a drop.

2032
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:13,920
It's drops.

2033
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,240
Yeah.

2034
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:14,480
Yeah.

2035
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,440
So it is liquid.

2036
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,880
There is a juice element.

2037
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:17,120
Yeah.

2038
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,560
He is juicing you.

2039
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,360
Yeah, it is.

2040
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:19,760
I bet it's.

2041
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,160
Wow.

2042
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,280
I bet it's coming under sweat.

2043
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:21,760
Yeah.

2044
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,000
Yeah.

2045
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,600
Oh, that's gotta be what it is.

2046
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:24,400
Huh?

2047
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,200
So this is, it's a big sweat extracting machine.

2048
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:34,720
It's kind of like, it's a, it's really, it's the kind of thing that they like a kooky invention

2049
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,000
to make you skinny from 1910.

2050
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,880
It would just shake you.

2051
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,280
Yeah.

2052
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,880
Weird barrel that would, yeah.

2053
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:46,960
And they would, yeah, they would like sauna you until you lost weight or passed out and died.

2054
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,440
See, now this is, I wasn't, I didn't even realize you didn't know about the Q videos.

2055
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:51,840
No, no idea.

2056
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,120
The whole storyline.

2057
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:59,520
I was, when you said, you know, is there enough here, in my head, I was like, well,

2058
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,240
fear juice is going to be like 45 minutes just on it.

2059
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:03,360
Yes.

2060
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:03,920
Yeah.

2061
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:04,960
Fear juice.

2062
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,000
You knew it.

2063
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,920
You had it ready to go and you've, and you fought for doom.

2064
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,880
You defended doom and his honor.

2065
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,320
And I made, this has to be just a great moment for you, a victory for you.

2066
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:18,880
Sure.

2067
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,280
To have been able to profess your love of doom and be a soldier in his army.

2068
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:29,280
I just have lots of fond memories riding with my dad and, and, you know, just, yeah, it's,

2069
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,480
don't sleep on it folks.

2070
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:37,760
It's, it's fun, great views, whatever angle you get on, usually not a terribly long rate.

2071
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:43,040
And now that I am older and the Hulk hurts my brain, this is still pretty pleasant to ride.

2072
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:45,920
Well, we did go front row Hulk.

2073
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,360
I don't know how you didn't get me to drag me onto this.

2074
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,000
I don't know.

2075
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:50,960
What happened?

2076
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,160
You were, you were running off to.

2077
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,760
Is that why?

2078
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,320
You might've been going to NXT.

2079
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,880
Yeah.

2080
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,040
But I feel like you should be like, come on, you gotta do this.

2081
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,360
I, yeah, I don't know.

2082
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:03,760
You weren't pushing enough.

2083
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,280
That's more of a you thing.

2084
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:10,240
That's, I don't, I want to razz you too much because you were watching the clock and you were like, oh.

2085
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:10,880
It's your fault.

2086
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:11,760
Okay.

2087
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,400
That's fine.

2088
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,480
You should have done it.

2089
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,640
To me, help me out.

2090
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,840
I think I mentioned it earlier in the day and you started talking about like dangly.

2091
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,280
It said, I was like, yeah, it's great.

2092
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,880
You should have given me shit.

2093
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,800
Like your feet, I've been kicking my feet subconsciously most of this time.

2094
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,320
Cause I'm thinking about your imagining your, oh wow.

2095
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
Love the danglies.

2096
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,000
Yeah.

2097
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,360
You've been picturing yourself on this thing the whole time as if you've been losing drops of fear juice.

2098
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,040
Sure.

2099
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:41,520
Your brain.

2100
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,080
But nothing to fear.

2101
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,640
It's been a delight at this.

2102
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,240
And you know, I'm glad I know about all this.

2103
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,240
I like the, I like Latveria.

2104
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:55,280
I'd like to watch a big like game of Thrones about the politics of Latveria.

2105
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,600
Oh, just announced fantastic fours dates.

2106
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:57,920
What is it?

2107
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,760
The end of 2024?

2108
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,160
I don't know.

2109
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:00,720
Is that right?

2110
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,640
They announced so much at Comic-Con.

2111
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,360
My head was spinning.

2112
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:03,760
I lost track.

2113
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,680
And they stole D23 to announce more.

2114
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,000
Well, they clearly were saving a couple for that.

2115
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,280
So yeah, you'll see.

2116
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,000
King go.

2117
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,320
Maybe who knows?

2118
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,360
He may be around the corner.

2119
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:14,720
You never know.

2120
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,480
They didn't mention him though, but he'll be back.

2121
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:28,880
But they're never going to, they're not going to announce what I want with now, which is just the full, a full Latverian examination at this end to get into the, to bring the fear fall device to the big screen.

2122
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:29,520
Well, that's true.

2123
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,080
I mean, look, the pace of these things coming out are very fast, but there's so many of them.

2124
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,400
There's like five years between like sequels.

2125
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,400
So maybe if you're lucky, you could work on it in eight years.

2126
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:40,640
Yes.

2127
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:46,400
Bring fear fall to the, the Disney plus the Disney neural link, whatever it is at the time.

2128
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,400
So do you think they'll be okay with that?

2129
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,440
Mine is about that.

2130
01:31:49,440 --> 01:32:02,160
There's like a, there's high jinx at the fear juice storage facility and like some, some bumbling fear juice technicians, like the knock a bunch of barrels over and then slip and fall.

2131
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,120
I think what'll happen.

2132
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,400
And then there's fear juice.

2133
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:08,000
Like they accidentally drink it and then they're having people's dark memories.

2134
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,120
What's going to, okay.

2135
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,640
What's going to happen is it's Comic-Con 2041.

2136
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:18,560
Kevin Feige is 85 years old and he's announced old, 2067.

2137
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,760
Kevin Feige is 80 years old.

2138
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,480
He comes out on stage.

2139
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,960
He announces 50 movies, but then he says, we have a very special surprise.

2140
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,040
Who here is a fan of the fantastic four and people cheer.

2141
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,840
And he says, who here is a fan of Scott Garner and everyone cheers justice loudly.

2142
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,600
And you come out on stage.

2143
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:40,400
By then because the work will be 68, 69 years old.

2144
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,520
And then you, you just say, Hey, who knows what this is?

2145
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:49,040
And you hold up a glass of fear juice and then you drink it on stage and haul H at Comic-Con.

2146
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,160
The place goes nuts.

2147
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:55,520
And then you start hallucinating and explain that you are doing this project.

2148
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,280
Finally on Disney plus.

2149
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,480
I'm hallucinating.

2150
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:58,960
I don't know.

2151
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,640
I mean, in this world, okay, okay, hold on, hold on.

2152
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,320
I'm just, this is all blue sky on the top of my head.

2153
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:12,480
You know, rock just came out as black Adam in character with effects at hall H a couple days ago.

2154
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:17,600
So maybe it'll be sort of a presentation, a show busy presentation where you drink the fear juice

2155
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:22,720
and then you're like the fear fall, like the tower rises from the stage or something.

2156
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:29,920
And then I have too much for just a pass out and then the towers rise up out of the crack out of.

2157
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,520
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2158
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:31,760
Yeah.

2159
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:39,040
You could also adapt the comic where doom meets a kiss and they fight.

2160
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:39,680
Whoa.

2161
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:44,640
And this is from cbr.com.

2162
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,080
How was doom defeated?

2163
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:53,120
Well, Paul Stanley uses his magical black ninja star to have doom relive the memory of his father dying.

2164
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:00,240
So also they note about this and I did know this about this comic.

2165
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:05,280
I've never seen it, but I did know this actual blood was taken from the band members and mixed

2166
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,920
with the red ink in the comic book.

2167
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:08,160
Yeah.

2168
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,960
I remember reading that wizard magazine that that was happening.

2169
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,320
Did they ever do that for anything?

2170
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,440
Was that ever like a gimmick and on album covers or anything?

2171
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:15,840
Oh yeah.

2172
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,600
I think they may have done that.

2173
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,000
Yeah.

2174
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,200
For an album cover.

2175
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,080
I think so.

2176
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:22,160
Mark Grunwald.

2177
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:27,600
I was going to say Mark Grunwald's ashes were scattered in the Captain America print run.

2178
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,000
Yeah.

2179
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,160
There were sneakers recently with a drop of blood in them and everyone went crazy

2180
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,760
because they thought it was for Satan.

2181
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,960
And then Rob Liefeld hawked a loogie in the print run of Deadpool.

2182
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:47,120
He hawked a snot into the ink before it was printed.

2183
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:51,520
Well, but you know, that's okay because that's just something that the Merc with the Mouse would do.

2184
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,200
Something Wade would do.

2185
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:53,440
Yeah.

2186
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:54,640
Wow.

2187
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:59,120
This comic with these sticky white creatures taking over the city.

2188
01:34:59,120 --> 01:34:59,680
That's right.

2189
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:00,400
They look so real.

2190
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,640
They look so vibrant and luminescent.

2191
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:05,280
I wonder how they got they painted this so.

2192
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,200
We'll never know.

2193
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:14,240
That is maybe the second kiss thing is only the second most intriguing Marvel property.

2194
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,520
Well, that actually happened though.

2195
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,360
I just wanted to bring up again.

2196
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,720
I've said it on the show before in that Marvel comics book,

2197
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,240
the Secret History or whatever it's called.

2198
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:22,560
Yeah.

2199
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,880
Where they bring up the idea that they were going to

2200
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,880
or they had the idea to do a Silver Surfer movie starring Dennis Wilson.

2201
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,000
Oh yeah, baby.

2202
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:30,400
I know.

2203
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:31,520
Yeah.

2204
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,480
You know what?

2205
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,920
I'm going to confess something right now.

2206
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,600
I had a fear.

2207
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:44,480
I had fear juice flowing through my body about this episode because I was worried

2208
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,720
because there's this thing that happens when Marvel stuff is talked about.

2209
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:52,160
And the thing that happens is you guys say the names of characters

2210
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,720
and artists and I don't know what's going on.

2211
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:54,960
Right.

2212
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,760
I feel like I have nothing to contribute and bring to the table.

2213
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:02,800
But I've been so fascinated by all of the discussion today

2214
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,840
that I did not need to resort to my plan B.

2215
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,120
I wanted to cut a deal with you guys and the deal was this.

2216
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:09,840
Wow.

2217
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:16,400
That if there was a minute or more of discussion of characters and artists

2218
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,080
that I would pull out this physical piece of paper that I have.

2219
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,160
And the physical piece of paper is a bunch of facts about the Beach Boys.

2220
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,400
We would do a fact exchange.

2221
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:26,800
Sure.

2222
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,040
Right.

2223
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,160
It says fun, fun, fun facts.

2224
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:35,760
And so we would have done kind of a little bit of a ping pong.

2225
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,080
Yeah.

2226
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,160
Which I think would have been a good system, would have allowed you guys to have free rate,

2227
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:44,720
to discuss artists and specifics all you wanted.

2228
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:48,880
But I could have returned the volley with some of these.

2229
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:49,440
Give us a couple.

2230
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,240
Some of these facts.

2231
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:56,320
Oh, why, you know, the Beach Boys actually flirted with several early names,

2232
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,280
including the Pendle Tones and Carl and the Passions.

2233
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,560
By 1969, the band had outgrown their adolescent image.

2234
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,720
So Brian Wilson proposed dropping boys and going by just the beach.

2235
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:10,240
He even drafted up a five page legal agreement to make it official.

2236
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,240
But it was quickly vetoed by the rest of the band.

2237
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,840
So that sort of thing could have been peppered through the butt.

2238
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:16,880
I didn't have to do.

2239
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,120
I didn't have to break the emergency glad.

2240
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,200
Because to save those for later.

2241
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,080
That's what I'm thinking.

2242
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:28,480
Now, you know, and whether it be Marvel or whether it be just know that if we're in that

2243
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:33,360
kind of territory that I do have the fun, fun, fun facts ready to go.

2244
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,240
I will say them.

2245
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:37,920
I'd love to say I have to replace number two now because I just exhausted it.

2246
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,080
You'll you'll never know when you need like there might be an episode where Jason and I

2247
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:46,240
just spent 20 minutes recounting an old Herald that we did an old improv show.

2248
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:49,440
There could be an episode where we talk about our favorite fruity pebble flavor.

2249
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,680
Anything is possible.

2250
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:52,960
So yeah, you will need those.

2251
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,640
So yeah, don't burn them all.

2252
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,200
Yeah.

2253
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,920
And yes, I'd all back together at one point in time.

2254
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,480
Dr. Doom stole the Silver Surfer's powers.

2255
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:01,760
It took him.

2256
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,120
Okay, we could have stolen.

2257
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:07,600
That's what I realized that it was not random and arbitrary in a way.

2258
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,320
The fun, fun, fun facts that the ultimate fun, fun, fun fact is that Dennis Wilson

2259
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:15,280
was almost part of the fantastic for maybe.

2260
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,040
You were.

2261
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,680
Okay, yeah, it would have been Silver Surfer movie, not.

2262
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,760
Yeah, specific getting Silver Surfer movie.

2263
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:27,600
Yeah, so we're very associated with the fantasy for very popular Blacklight poster

2264
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,600
character, very psychedelic.

2265
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,880
Oh, very cool.

2266
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,800
Yeah, that makes sense.

2267
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,120
Yeah.

2268
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:38,160
When he acted in this weird movie called Tulane Blacktop directed by a Monty Hellman in 1971.

2269
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,560
Oh, here I am going into the fun, fun, fun facts.

2270
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,280
I'll save that.

2271
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,480
That's fair.

2272
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,480
I know about Tulane Blacktop a little, you know.

2273
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,080
Criteria.

2274
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:46,800
Strange movie.

2275
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,960
But you know what is to the credit of this attraction that the fun, fun, fun facts will

2276
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,960
be saved for another day.

2277
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,640
We'll save that.

2278
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,080
As you said, for when there'll be some of us that we're trying to remember like a

2279
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,480
party and whether Marissa Strickland was there or not.

2280
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:09,680
You get caught on that for seven minutes and then I have this ready to unsheath.

2281
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:15,440
The big revelation is that Scott has a full working full color printer.

2282
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,400
Oh, yeah.

2283
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,280
Oh, no, I made a point.

2284
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,240
I wanted to jazz it up.

2285
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,880
I'd love to show the audience, but I don't want to reveal the fun, fun, fun.

2286
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:28,960
I want it to be like a flyer you'd see in like a little marine life exhibit or something

2287
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,120
or like a cork board at the zoo.

2288
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,160
I think that's how it would be.

2289
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,000
It's fun, fun, fun.

2290
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:39,840
But that'll be saved for another day because we've arrived at the end here.

2291
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,080
You survived podcast, the ride.

2292
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:44,000
What a blast.

2293
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,800
I want to go to that very.

2294
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,240
Doom, I would say I bet what really what this is all about is that when you were

2295
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:56,880
researching doom, you felt like sort of the Ivan ooze of the doom.

2296
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,240
Doom is of that level of fun villain.

2297
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,200
He's silly.

2298
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,480
There's like there's so much.

2299
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,960
There's a theatricality to it.

2300
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:10,480
There's a scene chewing logic, weird stuff to to pick apart.

2301
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:15,520
I even pulled the I was intrigued by like, oh, what are the cities and towns in let's

2302
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,560
let very oh, I doomsburg do.

2303
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:19,920
Yes, yes.

2304
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:20,800
Dooms Vail.

2305
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,280
No, no, no.

2306
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:21,600
Dooms.

2307
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,080
No, meet me in Dooms Dale, not do Vail.

2308
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,560
That's on the other side of that very very specific.

2309
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,400
Dooms and Doom would do.

2310
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:32,080
Tennis very Stott German kind of thing.

2311
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:32,640
German town.

2312
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,140
Yeah.

2313
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,240
Anyway.

2314
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:34,720
Yeah.

2315
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:35,840
Hey, I'm intrigued.

2316
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,640

I've got secret returned with an Ikea bag.

2326
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:01,360
I can't remember.

2327
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:04,160
Is your birthday today or is it within days?

2328
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,640
Well, it passed by the time this airs, but it is this.

2329
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,360
It's this week.

2330
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:07,840
This week.

2331
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,320
Okay.

2332
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,880
I can remember the actual day present exchange.

2333
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:11,280
Okay.

2334
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,640
There's been happening a lot.

2335
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,920
And the only reason I'm doing this on the show is because we briefly mentioned this,

2336
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:22,160
but I have got you the entire Seinfeld apartment that I've mentioned on the contemporary.

2337
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,040
Oh, my God.

2338
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,040
How many pieces?

2339
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,240
This goes and goes.

2340
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:26,720
Six.

2341
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:29,280
I mean, it's a lot smaller than it looks.

2342
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,400
There's six boxes here.

2343
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:30,800
Oh, sure.

2344
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,280
Yeah.

2345
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,920
When they're when they're all together, that's just a very small little die

2346
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,560
Rama to take a picture of this stack.

2347
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:38,560
Wow.

2348
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,120
Wait, what are we?

2349
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:39,360
Okay.

2350
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,800
It's all Jerry's apartment pieces.

2351
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,480
Yeah, it makes up the entire characters.

2352
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,880
It makes up the entire apartment like that on the back.

2353
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,120
Oh, you put them all together and it looks great.

2354
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:52,160
It's a very it's a not expensive toy.

2355
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:53,360
Oh, it looks great.

2356
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:56,320
And you got little like peg people to do it.

2357
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,160
But here you go.

2358
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:58,960
Well, there's the shell.

2359
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,560
This is what I was asking about.

2360
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,040
Exactly.

2361
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:01,920
You got wait.

2362
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,680
This came up because of contemporary because this is like mundane and it's

2363
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:08,640
it's not fantastical places.

2364
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,320
It's very practical.

2365
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,640
So it's oh, it's I completely put it together after we talked about it.

2366
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:15,600
I was like, oh, this is cool.

2367
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,400
Oh, my God.

2368
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,200
So it's great.

2369
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,240
Thank you so much.

2370
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:19,920
Gee, I appreciate it.

2371
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,400
Of course.

2372
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,200
Happy birthday.

2373
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,800
Now, I didn't want to leave Jason in the cold even though it's not his birthday.

2374
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,240
So I got him a little thing.

2375
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,600
I hope he likes this.

2376
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,160
It's a Funko pop Hershey kiss.

2377
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:35,440
It's an anthropomorphic Hershey kiss.

2378
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,080
So there you go.

2379
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:42,080
They have are like kind of well, this one's actually pretty cute, but they're all like

2380
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,040
I was going to say grotesque food creatures.

2381
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,800
It's a moon pie.

2382
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,320
It's Mayor McCheese.

2383
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,160
And now it's this cute little Hershey kiss.

2384
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:53,920
So we're adding to the amount of buildings or rooms that we've collected.

2385
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:54,720
That's what I'm trying to do.

2386
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,760
Completely in my wheels.

2387
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:59,040
And I love that it's Elaine with the big puff hair.

2388
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,360
Yes, like the original Elaine Mach 1.

2389
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,840
There's an Uncle Leo.

2390
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,960
Uncle Leo.

2391
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,760
It's like all six.

2392
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,160
Oh, excuse me.

2393
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:12,160
Yeah, they have six different little sets that you buy or six different little pieces you buy.

2394
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:16,960
And it's Jerry Newman, Kramer, George, Elaine, and Uncle Leo, which is a great character,

2395
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:22,080
but it is funny because it feels like there were more used characters, but you know, whatever.

2396
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,480
Geez, I go, well, I got to get the kid playing with this.

2397
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,040
I got to get him practicing Kramer entrances.

2398
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,760
No, no, no, Wilder.

2399
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,600
You got to fly through that door.

2400
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,960
Yeah, more forethought.

2401
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:33,920
Season nine.

2402
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,680
We were playing season nine today.

2403
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,320
So it's not just walking through a little odd.

2404
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,440
It's a whole thing.

2405
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,560
Remember, it's three cameras, so you can go a little bigger.

2406
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,520
You can go a little bigger.

2407
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:50,080
So I mean, the figures themselves might be too small for him.

2408
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,440
I don't know if he's eating things.

2409
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,640
You know, he's not.

2410
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:53,360
That's a good thing.

2411
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,120
But that's the thing I'm proud of, of my boy.

2412
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:58,400
All right.

2413
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,400
Well, we'll take a picture of this and.

2414
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,280
Oh my God.

2415
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,840
Wow.

2416
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,520
Hey, really appreciate it.

2417
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:03,840
Of course.

2418
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,320
Thank you.

2419
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,600
Thanks for opening my eyes to this.

2420
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:12,000
Maybe I'll go with you guys through the line and then not get on the ride.

2421
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,040
Wave to you when you're at the top.

2422
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:15,360
We'll see.

2423
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,400
