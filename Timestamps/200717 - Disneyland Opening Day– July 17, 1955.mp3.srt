1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Morning, the following podcast is about the first operating day of Disneyland.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,160
A quaint day with nightmare mice, adultery, drug use, and a mysterious entrepreneur known

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,360
as The Ladder Man.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,520
It's Disneyland opening day 1955 on podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,640
To all who come to this happy podcast, welcome.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,040
Podcast The Ride is your podcast.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,480
Here Scott Gerdiner relives fond memories of the past.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,640
And here Mike Carlson may savor the challenge of the future.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040
You say say hi or so, yeah there you go.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm savoring.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,560
With the hope that it will be a source of Jason Sheridan to all the world.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,120
Sorry can you start from the top?

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
We didn't, we weren't ready.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Oh no shit.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Start it over?

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:18,400
To all the, I can't do, I need to have the religious leaders here with me.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,040
Every Republican politician is the religious leaders.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:35,680
We're referring to the opening day ceremony.

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,000
That was a little rendition of Walt Disney's opening speech on Disneyland's opening day

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,120
July 17th, 1955, which if you're listening to this episode, the day is released today

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,480
is July 17th, 2020.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Exactly 65 years ago was the opening day of our Mecca of Disneyland.

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,200
So we wanted to devote an episode to talking about the opening day, the televised ceremony

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,720
and all the other chaos that ensued.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,960
That's what we're doing here today.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:17,280
Of course, the idea was that Disneyland would be back up and running on this day.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,800
Like if you, maybe we think about July 17th more than anybody else, but when they announced

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,360
when it would be reopened post the pandemic, post the pandemic, now that the pandemic is

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,960
over, it's wrapping up.

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,560
Yeah, they were going to reopen the park on July 17th and they forgot that viruses do

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,680
not care about anniversaries.

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,960
So that is no longer the plan.

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,360
Very inconsiderate of the virus, not to imagine how nice it would have been to reopen on this

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,280
day. But the virus is a mean jerk.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,240
It should really stop to acknowledge all the anniversaries.

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,440
I think we're close to a what year would it be?

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,400
The 35th anniversary of Back to the Future.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,240
And they didn't give us the virus, give us no time to celebrate.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,360
We didn't get to go back into the theater.

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,040
They didn't pull up a DeLorean outside the theater.

44
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,240
Whatever shady guy owns the DeLoreans that go to screenings.

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,320
I don't want to sidetrack, but how many shady guys do own DeLoreans?

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah, I'm not sure. How big of a business is that?

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,640
Because I don't sense that the DeLorean is like an especially rare car on the full scale

48
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,320
of things. So they must be kind of easy to get them and to put all the doodads all over

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,760
it.

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,800
Well, that's time for eBay, I think.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,320
Take a look.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,680
eBay is you just get a full car on eBay right now.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
I think we could get it in a couple of days.

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,320
Not every shady guy owns a DeLorean, but every guy who owns a DeLorean is a shady guy.

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,920
That has never changed.

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,360
That was the case back when they were rolling them out.

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,960
OK, I have four top choices here on eBay for DeLoreans.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,800
They're all obviously pre-owned.

59
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
They're not making them new.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,760
What do you think the cheapest one is?

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,280
Let's do a quick souvenir smackdown.

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,640
The cheapest one and the most expensive one.

63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Jason, what do you think?

64
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,160
I'm going to go low.

65
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm going to say fifteen thousand.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,600
OK, is what is the most expensive at least?

67
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,600
No, it's the lowest.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,280
That's the lowest.

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,760
The cheapest.

70
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,040
OK, I'll just go.

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
We'll go lowest.

72
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,280
Maybe I take the lower tack then because maybe one of them's kind of in bad shape.

73
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,640
So maybe we're closer to like twelve.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,320
From what I'm seeing here, the lowest one is thirty two thousand five hundred.

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,200
The most expensive is seventy five thousand.

76
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,720
Wow. OK.

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Now, are these back to the future modded out?

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,920
It doesn't appear to be back to the future modded out.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,720
OK, that's for us to do and for us to make a good living,

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
go into cons and screenings in Hollywood forever's.

81
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,960
Right. Slicking your hair back and driving up in that DeLorean.

82
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, everyone admiring you.

83
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,560
You're the king of the world in that moment.

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Well, look at that guy.

85
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,320
He must be in his late thirties.

86
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,560
As you get out and shake hands with, you know, the back to the future royalty,

87
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,760
with Claudia Wells and Bob Gale and the.

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
You know, Bob Gale never comes to anything.

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,360
It's so rare that you get a visit from back to the future screenwriter,

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
Bob Gale, who seems to have a lot going on.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,280
I guess maybe I've been suppressing my just to clarify back to the future.

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,120
My favorite franchise, like the future to my favorite film.

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,960
I guess I've been pent up and feeling like back to the future events

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,400
are sort of shady.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,320
Have you guys have you?

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,520
Is this thought registered with you guys before?

97
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,840
Well, the reason I recognize what you're saying is true is because Jason and I,

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,640
I assume Jason, it feels the way I do, have been going to comic conventions

99
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,960
and fan events for our whole lives, basically.

100
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,440
So there's just a level of that with a lot of these things

101
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,600
where it's like there's something off about a lot of them.

102
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,720
Sure. Something really wrong.

103
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,800
Yeah, the only real changes I can denote since like the mid

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,240
90s is that you can't smoke inside anymore.

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,520
And places have square readers on their phones.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,520
Everything else is still the same level of shit.

107
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,360
Yeah, there's so there's a whole so I recognize what you're saying,

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,080
but I actually don't maybe know these ins and outs of the specific types

109
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,640
of back to the future events.

110
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,800
Maybe I just went to one.

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
I watched them all screened at the New Art or something,

112
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,000
and I was like, I got to get out of here.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,800
This is this is too many movies to watch in a row.

114
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,520
First of all, have you guys done that and enjoyed it?

115
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,600
Like it's all right.

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
All the Lord of the Rings. Here we go.

117
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,280
I've only done like two toy stories back to back

118
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
and those the first one is 90 minutes, I think.

119
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
And even that, I was like, oh, it's a little long,

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,160
but I've never done like, oh, watch all 22 Marvel movies

121
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
before the New Avengers comes out.

122
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,640
And you're like, no, thank you.

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,200
This was hazardous to your health, I think. Yeah.

124
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,160
Jason, any marathons in your your past?

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,920
Just double. I love double features, especially like not

126
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,600
like directly tied together, but like double features

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,360
where it's like this pairs well with this.

128
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,480
But I think after two movies that that's that's very good.

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,520
But then I think you really get to ministering

130
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,800
returns on that third movie. Yeah, sure. Sure.

131
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,200
Well, a stunning anti marathon stance coming in

132
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,560
on top of this episode.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,280
But we're you know, yeah, we're here to talk about a

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,280
a pretty crazy day, a chaotic day,

135
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,880
maybe the most chaotic day in Disney Parks history

136
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,320
until this week in 2020.

137
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,560
I think the only time that it's matched the literal opening of the park

138
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,000
was the the reopening of of the Magic Kingdom.

139
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
You feel like if you

140
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,400
heard stories about Disneyland opening day was crazy.

141
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,920
I mean, there were like there were people passing out and vomiting

142
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,400
and their heart rate rates were up really high.

143
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,960
And then they just still stayed in the park.

144
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,040
Like, it seems like stuff from 1955.

145
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,800
Yeah, I can see that.

146
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,360
I you'd imagine that people would be like, no, it's the opening day.

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm staying. Whatever, whatever I'm spreading around doesn't matter.

148
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm fine. Sure.

149
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,080
I want to see I want to see Bob Cummings.

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,720
I got to see Bob Cummings.

151
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,000
I came here to see Bob Cummings.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,520
Here's since we're talking about this, I'll share one of my favorite

153
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,280
anecdotes I came across.

154
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,000
I believe this is an L.A.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,640
Times article from 1999 about Roy Disney,

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,680
because Roy Disney had to cobble the money together for this insane endeavor.

157
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,320
And he was sitting outside in his catalog,

158
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,720
admiring the throngs that crashed the invitation only event with forged tickets.

159
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,280
Roy was told that kids who had been stuck in traffic jams

160
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,640
were relieving themselves in the parking lot.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,120
He just grand and said, God bless them. Let them.

162
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,200
Let that urine flow.

163
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,760
He got like somebody was like, yeah, there's kids peeing in the parking lot.

164
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,400
And he just got a twinkle in his eye and said, oh, that warms my heart.

165
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,400
He got that is one of the few moments of levity I have ever heard that Roy Disney.

166
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,240
I feel like Roy Disney was able to relax like once a year.

167
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,720
I feel like I felt like where you were going with that story is like

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,720
he got a gun from his glove compartment and he walked over to the team.

169
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,600
No, the guns, the guns are on camera.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,640
No, I guess you're right.

171
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,560
I shouldn't have. I should have saved the gun jokes for later.

172
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,760
You're right. You're teasing. There's so much.

173
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,880
There's so much good stuff.

174
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,760
I mean, there's so much good stuff on the operational end.

175
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,160
There is amazing things happening on what is a technological marvel,

176
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,880
this television broadcast.

177
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,840
Yeah. How do how do we sort through this?

178
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,280
I mean, yes, we're we're going to talk about just how chaotic the day was.

179
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,400
But you get a real sense of how chaotic the day was from the opening broadcast

180
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,680
Dateline Disneyland, which was a live

181
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,240
with 90 minute, two hour, a pretty lengthy broadcast on ABC.

182
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,080
In 90 minutes, Sunday night during the Disneyland slot,

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,560
which by this point, yeah, Disneyland, the show had been airing

184
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,560
since a year prior, since 1954.

185
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,000
And it was one of the ways that they built the funds to build the park

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,080
and also kind of trained everybody to know what's going to be up

187
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,520
with this park when it's open.

188
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,160
You'll see Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, Amaraland.

189
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,040
And that's how they grouped all of the programming within the show.

190
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,600
So by the time all of these themes have a genuine place to go to

191
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
and experience them, people are so curious.

192
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,160
What the hell is going on with it?

193
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
Yeah, I think we should start with the broadcast

194
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,760
and then like weave in or then get to the operational stuff

195
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,560
in the way that Walt was so focused on the broadcast,

196
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,160
did not know about much of the chaos.

197
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,800
Oh, really? Oh, it's a huge informed.

198
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,440
Yeah. After the fact,

199
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,120
because he's performed, he's on camera and he is not informed

200
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,640
about a lot of the stuff until later that day in the following day.

201
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,880
Which if you're if you've established the reputation is like America's uncle

202
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,120
and you have to be charmed, there's never a day in your life

203
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,320
that's more important. It's your name and the title.

204
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,320
You have to be a charming character on television.

205
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,040
You're probably going to be thinking about that and not operations

206
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,160
issues and things lighting on fire.

207
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
And not yeah, not kids peeing in the parking lot.

208
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,200
Oh, sure. It would be funny if like in the he was getting like briefs

209
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,440
briefing, like about everything that was happening in the middle of the broadcast.

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
He was like, and if I had another kid pisses in the parking lot,

211
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,720
I swear to God, we're shutting this whole thing down.

212
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,440
Take that gun out, Roy.

213
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,720
You fire it in the right spot. They'll never be again.

214
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,680
Roy, go get Betsy.

215
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,760
Get Betsy, Roy. Do what you know you have to do.

216
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,640
We don't talk a lot about Betsy, the Disneyland gun.

217
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,000
Famous part of the original lore.

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,040
Yeah, I think that's going to be the majority of this.

219
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,160
I guarantee you, I guarantee.

220
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,960
If you ask your parents or older relatives, who is Betsy?

221
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,440
When you were growing up, who did you know named Betsy on TV?

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
They would know. Davey Crockett's gun.

223
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
Oh, yeah. Oh, wait.

224
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh, wait. It is Betsy is because of the ballad of all Betsy is the.

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
Yeah. Oh, I forgot that there was a real Betsy.

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,920
There's a song about a gun in this in this opening day special.

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,120
Oh, yeah. It's performed in full.

228
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,000
That's one of the big.

229
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,280
Dance numbers. It's a.

230
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,400
Yeah. The biggest showstopping number, I think, in this whole special is about a gun.

231
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,960
It's about a rifle.

232
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,040
Just to say this at the top, a recurring theme or something I like to talk about

233
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,320
on the show is how because I grew up loving 70s, 80s, 90s

234
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,840
Disneyland specials, the kind that are cataloged by Doug Jones wonderfully

235
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,120
in the specials he's made that these clips that I devour.

236
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,640
I might let me coin a term and say, I think what I like about these a lot

237
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,080
is that it is a it is a window into chaos Disneyland.

238
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
Everything is so perfectly manicured now.

239
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,000
You don't get glimpses of chaos Disneyland, things going wrong,

240
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,000
people flubbing lines, people making inappropriate jokes.

241
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,040
And I I yearn for more chaos Disneyland.

242
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,600
And never was there more chaos Disneyland than on July 17th, 1955.

243
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,960
This is I think it's only chaos.

244
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,720
I think there's maybe what percentage of this broadcast goes

245
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,960
the way they wanted it to, like 20.

246
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,480
It seems like it. I I for the for the vibe.

247
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,040
Everyone seems like they're just so stressed out the whole time.

248
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,520
Yes. And I'm yeah, I would imagine that.

249
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,400
Yeah, 20 percent maybe feels like, yeah, we nailed that.

250
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,920
About that. But still, I feel like this possible like

251
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,040
every every single thing in their minds and every scene went wrong.

252
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,320
Everything they planned did not go to plan because some of this is famous

253
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
and some of its recapped a little bit.

254
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,600
I mean, Disney has certainly made it part of the lore

255
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,120
and they will do specials now that show you moments of chaos

256
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,280
and art link letter, the host not knowing where he was or where his microphone was.

257
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,200
Some of this stuff they have owned other parts of it they have not owned,

258
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,400
some of which are genuinely upsetting.

259
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,920
I had you guys ever done this.

260
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Did you ever sat down and watched the full I'm going to watch

261
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,280
Dateline Disneyland today?

262
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,040
I think I watched clips, but I guess I didn't watch the whole thing

263
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,800
through until we were prepping for this.

264
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,960
Just clips. Yeah, clips for me, too.

265
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,040
I mean, and I have to say the research on this one.

266
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,720
It there's a line in the special where Art Link letter says,

267
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
Walt, you've made a bomb out of Barnum today.

268
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,360
And I that stuck with me for a couple of reasons.

269
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,520
One, I was like, wow, even in 1955, we were whitewashing the cruelty of P.T. Barnum.

270
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,560
The other thing is that there's still a lot of urban legends.

271
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,480
I feel about this.

272
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,040
I could not find every article lists a different number.

273
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,040
There's a website that I found, an official Disney website

274
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,440
called like Public Affairs Disneyland Public Affairs

275
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,080
that has a timeline of big events at the park.

276
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,280
And they had different numbers than the history dot com article

277
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,320
or like the Atlantic, like a slideshow of pictures.

278
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,200
So there there's still a lot.

279
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,080
There's a lot of myth making around this day.

280
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,760
What number are you referring to specifically?

281
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,680
The number specifically of like they were expecting

282
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,920
like they were some numbers said they were expecting eleven thousand.

283
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
And then on the broadcast, they said there are fifteen thousand here

284
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,640
with the forged tickets and the people hopping the fence.

285
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,160
You see the number twenty eight thousand a lot.

286
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,360
And then Disney Disneyland clocks.

287
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,880
The number on their public affairs website is twenty eight thousand one hundred fifty four.

288
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,720
Geez. Expecting eleven, they got twenty eight.

289
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,440
And some of the manifestations of this were that

290
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,760
one, the tickets were apparently very easy to counterfeit.

291
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,920
It seems like they were just printed out.

292
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,080
There was no type of watermark and certainly not a hologram.

293
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,760
I found a story that there was a some of the tickets

294
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,840
had a blank space that said how many people are in your party.

295
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,880
So people would just fill in the blank space.

296
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,080
Seventy. All right.

297
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,480
All right, gang, come on in.

298
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,440
And then the other thing is that there was a man with a ladder

299
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,920
just letting people over a fence and charging them five dollars

300
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,600
in a very Homer Simpson, as Homerland, or when he charges that guy

301
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,680
by the axle for the parking for Wacking Day.

302
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,040
Does he charge for the pool or the trampoline?

303
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah, I think he charges for.

304
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,840
Yes. Well, and then it becomes the centerpiece of Homerland.

305
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,360
Oh, right. Yes, you're right.

306
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,920
I was a fort made out of dirt.

307
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,120
Right.

308
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,640
But like how but how long could this guy have been in business?

309
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,080
There's four sides to Disneyland.

310
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
There's only so many places he could be.

311
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,720
A man just had a ladder for long enough to like maybe gotten what?

312
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,160
A thousand people in.

313
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,440
We have to find we have to see if we can really dig deep and find out who the

314
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,720
ladder man was.

315
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,240
I also want to find we we need to reach out to the Searching for Sugar Man people

316
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
and see if they would like to collaborate on finding the Disneyland ladder man.

317
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,280
The Disneyland Ladder Man looking for ladder man up at the first podcast, the

318
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,440
right documentary.

319
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,280
If we could find, yeah, like I mean, Ladder Man could be alive, could have been

320
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,400
a very young man.

321
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Did he did he then make a little business out of it and cross the country like he

322
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,080
did the same thing for Woodstock?

323
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,920
He he like anybody who was not allowed into Altamont because they had a knife.

324
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,080
He found a weak spot and let only knife holders in.

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,680
He let Berlin Wall.

326
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,040
He let people over the Berlin Wall with his ladder.

327
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,800
He did some good. He actually it wasn't all bad with Ladder Man.

328
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,240
He reunited some families.

329
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,080
That's right.

330
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,440
Yeah, he's he traveled the world allowing people to climb his ladder.

331
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,240
He did not believe in walls and he would be so frustrated with the Trump

332
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,800
administration. Walls are what he hated the most, no matter where they were.

333
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,920
He was a true patriot in a lot of ways.

334
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,400
The Disneyland Ladder Man.

335
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,720
Things were different back then.

336
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,400
Disneyland was very sparsely landscaped.

337
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,880
Much of it barren and brown.

338
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,400
So there was a huge but there was a little baby berm.

339
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,480
I'm amazed they even had a wall all around it in that sense.

340
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,400
Like, it's impressive that they even had got one done because all of Disneyland was

341
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,280
built in a year and a day.

342
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,840
It was literally one year and one day.

343
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,960
And now kind of any project takes at least three.

344
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,400
They gun it.

345
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,240
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

346
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,920
Which is why it's it's funny to look at that opening day aerial map and go, well,

347
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,400
well, you know, a lot of it is just blank, like the fields that is where the

348
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,200
the Matterhorn ended up or utopia is kind of a lot.

349
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,120
They paved some of it and the rest is just undecorated and no trees.

350
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,160
I do that. Yeah, if you went to Disneyland after having gone to Disneyland now,

351
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,560
you'd be like, oh, this looks like shit in a lot of places.

352
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,840
Our standards are so high.

353
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,040
Signs that said to be open soon.

354
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,200
Yeah. So, yes, it is surprising that there wasn't just like a big section of fence

355
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,280
they forgot to put in and there was no need for the ladder man.

356
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,040
It does seem like that would be you would you would believe that you believe, oh,

357
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,960
yeah, we forgot to put like 20 feet of fence over in the back.

358
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,840
Hopefully just like hang a tarp over it.

359
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,040
No one will notice that like you can't you can just sneak under the tarp.

360
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,000
And they also guys go, sorry, they couldn't afford a security guard either to block

361
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,200
the 20 feet. Right. So Roy, just Roy wandering around back there

362
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,040
telling children, pee, pee, wherever you got to go.

363
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,800
I love it. Roy loves it.

364
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,520
Roy loves peeing wherever.

365
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Did you guys come across the weeds stories?

366
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,880
This is another thing where I'm like, wait, what should I?

367
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,400
I don't know which to believe, because there's a story about

368
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,440
because they had the canal boats, which we now are now the story land

369
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,720
storybook canal boats.

370
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,440
And now there's little dioramas and stuff.

371
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,560
At the time, there were just boats that went around a little canal

372
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,440
of brown, unwatered grass.

373
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,560
There was just nothing there. Wow.

374
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,760
There was well, the one story is that there were just weeds.

375
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,360
So Walt said, put the Latin names for these weeds on signs like it's an exhibit.

376
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,640
And then there was another story where they said, go out.

377
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,960
Like there was landscaping not done.

378
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,040
They said, go pull weeds from the parking lot and replan it in the park.

379
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,280
So, again, so much myth making, even the number of rides.

380
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,200
I could not find like the Disneyland Public Affairs website

381
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
says 18 attractions were open.

382
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,760
Touring Plans website lists 14 attractions and at least three

383
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,960
attractions were down on open.

384
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,720
Dumbo was not up and running.

385
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,760
Rocket to the moon wasn't working.

386
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,240
And Peter Pan wasn't really working either.

387
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,120
So I don't know where if the number is some places count

388
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,240
what's actually running and what's not.

389
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,040
And the Mark Twain was open, but flooded a little bit at some point.

390
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
It a little bit.

391
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,080
Toad had an electrical outlet

392
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,680
surge like Toad was down for some of the day

393
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,480
because it was just one outlet powering the entire ride.

394
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,120
There's just one outlet.

395
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,800
And then the best part, there was a gas leak that shut down

396
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,400
a lot of the park for part of the day.

397
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,880
Jesus, did it like smell of gas?

398
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,920
Were you walking around just a field of weeds that smelled like gas?

399
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,040
I presumably but like carnival smell like gas sometimes anyway.

400
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,360
So I think people were used to it.

401
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,640
You got to think like 10 years before there were rationing stuff

402
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,720
for on the front lines in Europe.

403
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,480
So they're probably like, hey, this is better than air raid drills.

404
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,720
And if you if they were in Tomorrowland by the Autopia, it's smell like gas anyway.

405
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,960
They're for sure. That's true.

406
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,360
They're for sure. Were people in the park, maybe a lot of them, who just like

407
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,320
killed men in within the like, not the decade, but like 10 years prior.

408
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,200
They're for they're for sure. People who like killed in war.

409
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh, yes. Not only are you correct on that, but we'll get to it a little later.

410
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,720
There's people who've killed on both sides who were in the park that day.

411
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,600
I don't know. I don't know to what you refer.

412
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,560
And I'm scared. Oh, there's some amazing.

413
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
There's some amazing historical characters in this broadcast.

414
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
And it's. Yeah.

415
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,400
It's wild. I like there are people that just show up for a two second cameo

416
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,680
in the special. Mm hmm.

417
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,640
Like it's like, oh, there's Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Junior.

418
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,160
And they like whiz by and that's it.

419
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,920
Yeah. Well, one Sammy Rams Frank on the Autopia.

420
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,960
That's what it is. He kind of like, yeah, it runs into him.

421
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,280
But I wonder, like, yeah, who else was there and maybe just wasn't even on camera.

422
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,360
Is it part of the lore that Tony Baxter was there?

423
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,880
Am I making that up?

424
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,760
Hmm. I don't know. Or is or am I thinking of Marty Sclar?

425
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,280
I feel like some major engineering person.

426
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,120
Sclar was working by that.

427
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,360
But I think he was working.

428
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,280
Oh, well, I had begun the career.

429
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,360
I could be wrong.

430
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Yeah, who knows?

431
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,920
Who knows who was conceived at this holiday hill?

432
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,880
Yeah. Yeah. Over on the classic original Disney makeout spot.

433
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,840
I if anyone came to this podcast, hoping we would clarify a lot,

434
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,960
I don't think it's going to happen.

435
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,680
And I would actually like to put new rumors out into the world about this day.

436
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,520
So just keep on your toes is what I'm saying.

437
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,440
Oh, yeah. Who would have been born around 1955?

438
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,000
Births in 1955.

439
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Can we spread a rumor?

440
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,600
This is too long of a list.

441
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,120
Wait, I saw a wrestler, Chris Adams.

442
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,680
I don't know who that is. I need a celebrity.

443
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,680
I want to think of a celebrity who we can say was conceived

444
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,920
in a wild fit of passion on top of a pile of weeds.

445
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,800
The Rowan Atkinson.

446
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:14,360
OK, Rowan Atkinson was conceived at Disneyland on opening day in 1955.

447
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,560
I think that is for sure.

448
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,280
If people want to isolate me saying that and clip it

449
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,560
and then send it around as of did you know like that would be good.

450
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,920
So wait, I guess, though,

451
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,880
shouldn't I be looking at who was born in like April 1956?

452
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,160
OK, you're right. Everyone scratched that.

453
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,000
We need to get exactly right so that it lines up.

454
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,200
Because we don't want people to poke holes in this thing all day. Right.

455
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,240
Now, I bet that said, I bet people were like a little bewildered and confused.

456
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,080
So like Mr. Bean, you can find people in the background of this broadcast

457
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,680
go like, oh, hmm. Oh, you know, probably.

458
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,560
All right. That's that's not a rumor.

459
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,160
That's for sure. That for sure happened.

460
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,920
You know, your OJ prosecutor, Chris Darden, was famously conceived.

461
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,480
Chris Darden was conceived opening day at Disneyland in 1955, July 17th.

462
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,480
It was wild. There it is.

463
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,960
The Darden's really went at it for sure. Had it on holiday.

464
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,200
So much legend.

465
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
I mean, we could talk about one of the, you know,

466
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,960
probably the most famous piece of the lore,

467
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,320
which is that the cement had been so recently poured

468
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,040
that it had not hardened.

469
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,040
And so throughout the day, it was so excruciatingly hot

470
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,120
that it was melting again and that women's heels were melting back into the

471
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,280
into the ground. Mm hmm. Yes.

472
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,760
I'm curious about how this played out.

473
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,360
Was it like two women or was it three hundred?

474
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,200
How many shoes were lost?

475
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,960
Did somebody take those and keep those and immortalize them

476
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,840
in sort of a Grammets Chinese manner?

477
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,960
Mm hmm. Was yeah, was there a full slate,

478
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,840
a block of cement with high heels stuck in it?

479
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,200
And Walt's like, take that to my office.

480
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Put that in there.

481
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,640
I don't want you to tell anybody, but I put it in there and leave it in there.

482
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,920
My shoes, this whole thing was just a big scam to try to get a collection of shoes.

483
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
Yeah. What was it?

484
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,800
No ladies shoes.

485
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
How else am I going to get a big pile of them?

486
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,400
He was a lot like a Quentin Tarantino.

487
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,440
He was like a lot like a Quentin Tarantino type.

488
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,200
Just like Tarantino's movies, go back and look for all those foot

489
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,360
shots in every Disney movie.

490
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,440
You'll find them.

491
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,960
Well, and leave the cement.

492
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,240
I want it to not be hardened by the time we open.

493
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,040
What are you talking about, Walt? Shut up.

494
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,960
Listen to what I'm saying.

495
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
Don't question me.

496
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,840
We're well on track, sir.

497
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,760
It's going to be it's going to be dry by May.

498
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,640
Ain't nothing to worry about.

499
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,960
You fool.

500
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,560
No, keep it wet.

501
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,080
Keep it so wet.

502
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,160
But sir, the ladies heels.

503
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,640
Yes, exactly.

504
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,280
The story I had always heard about the heels was then they were given moccasins

505
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,200
because they were only sold the only like shoes readily available.

506
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
They sold moccasins at Frontierland.

507
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,760
But then as they're narrating up and down Main Street,

508
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,040
I believe it's Art Linkletter who like looks at the Emporium

509
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,280
and goes like, you can buy any old fashioned thing you want.

510
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,040
And they're like buckle shoes.

511
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,640
And I'm like, wait, there's other shoes.

512
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,440
They did have other shoes.

513
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,000
That's good detective work.

514
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah. Yeah. You could get buckled shoes.

515
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,440
You could get like pilgrim shoes.

516
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,320
Well, I know, like because they said they pin Main Street as 1900,

517
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,960
like set in 1900.

518
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,760
So you could get, you know, this is 50 years later.

519
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,840
It's a little bit in the, you know, that's 50 years before.

520
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,400
They were already romanticizing the turn of that century.

521
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,120
I think they were like, you can get like

522
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,200
because you could buy all sorts of weird crap on Main Street.

523
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,440
We should we should make a definitive list at some point.

524
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,200
Yeah. All the other crap.

525
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,120
Yeah. Original few years. Main Street.

526
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,760
Yeah. I wonder if what's the best

527
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,560
because you don't see a lot of pictures of everything in those gift shops.

528
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,640
And I think it would blow everyone's mind.

529
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,880
What they sold in Disneyland.

530
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,160
Braziers. They sold ladies. Braziers.

531
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,720
Yeah. My ears are aflame.

532
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,080
Yes. I had Phil or I be pro souvenir glass bottles of aspirin,

533
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,240
I believe, Braziers, coffee, tobacco.

534
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,480
Pretty insane that it was the wizard of bras.

535
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,360
Yeah. That does it against like Walt's

536
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,680
like conservative puritanical vision.

537
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,600
Like, well, that is interesting that that was.

538
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,880
I mean, I guess it's just more of his.

539
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,200
I guess he had to approve it. He had to sign off on it.

540
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

541
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,040
We'll do a full.

542
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,600
It was run by I was going to with the Hollywood Maxwell

543
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,240
Brazier company. So strange.

544
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah. But who would like

545
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,880
why would you just need one all of a sudden?

546
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,120
And were they hoping to get the reputation of being a great place to buy bras?

547
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,840
Could you get men's underwear on Main Street?

548
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,280
Well, I think all stores were less like, you know, the browser

549
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,640
was probably less like Victoria's Secret and more like a hardware store.

550
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,920
I was in the past look like hardware stores.

551
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,040
I get that it was sort of a it was more functional store.

552
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,760
Still, could you get could you buy a pair of underwear on Main Street?

553
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,360
If you were a man.

554
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,760
Like briefs, white briefs, could you buy it on Main Street?

555
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,400
Hmm. I'm searching the Easterland article for I don't.

556
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,600
I don't think so, because at least not at this shop,

557
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,120
because it's saying this article saying how many men hesitate to enter the shop.

558
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Hmm.

559
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,320
They're they and they're very polite in doing so.

560
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,880
They remove their hats upon entering the store.

561
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
What a strange if I go into a Victoria's Secret, I remove my hat.

562
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,240
And show of respect.

563
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,880
Respect. You put it over your heart.

564
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,640
Yes, I I close I put it over my heart.

565
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,840
I close my eyes and then I wander around.

566
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,680
Just say ma'am to perhaps to know one in case there's a case.

567
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,280
There's a ma'am in front of you. Yeah.

568
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,720
But yeah, could you?

569
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Yeah, you would get like fit like you couldn't get a suit on Main Street.

570
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,720
You know, no, like like drills, hammers.

571
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,160
Right. You need to put up

572
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
you need to put up a picture frame.

573
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,680
You can get some equipment to do that on Main Street.

574
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,440
Like why? Well, you know, it's weird.

575
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,360
You had to wait for Jack Rather seen briefly in the special

576
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,880
to finish that old Disneyland hotel to get some man stores up and running. Right.

577
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,240
So we'll investigate that further.

578
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,160
Yeah. Yeah. Bizarre Main Street would definitely be a great one.

579
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,160
I oh, you know what I think about the heels?

580
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Just first of all, it's just a weird reminder that this is when the people

581
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,480
did wear heels to Disneyland at this time.

582
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,200
And now the only time you see that happen is on Dapper Day is like the dress up

583
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,080
day, the fancy dress up day that's sort of unofficial that they do.

584
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,000
But the Disney embraces a little bit.

585
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,400
And why this is a photo op that's waiting to happen.

586
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,160
They should for Dapper Day lay out a bunch of wet concrete

587
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,160
so that people can recreate that moment.

588
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,680
Yeah, that's true.

589
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,240
You know, it's probably you could go one step because this is always trying

590
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,520
to make some more money. You could go a step further and be like,

591
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,760
have your heels immortalized in concrete and then you have to pay like a hundred

592
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,240
dollars for it.

593
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,200
And you could get everyone to take that home as a little keepsake.

594
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,360
And then you could upcharge everybody.

595
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,360
And I think that would be, you know, I think that would be very successful.

596
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,640
Yeah. A tough thing to take home, a heavy thing to take home.

597
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,120
Sure. Sure.

598
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,640
I also think you need like a thing to wheel it out, like a dolly, essentially.

599
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,680
OK, there's some other things you have to think about as far as cost.

600
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,000
But I think you could make it a small little piece of concrete.

601
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,160
And then that would be really. They could contain it.

602
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,200
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

603
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,000
Merch ideas, though, you know, everybody's talking about if you're like

604
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,680
wearing heels there, you're thinking about it and you want the full experience.

605
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,160
Yeah, I and you they should all.

606
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,080
And so they should also like take water out of the park on those days, too.

607
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,920
That's that's kind of another famous one that the this is often gone over

608
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,880
how there was they had Walt had to choose between

609
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,840
having drinking water and in toilet.

610
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,840
Like, yeah, right.

611
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,200
And toilet water, I think so.

612
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,440
Yeah, I've read that.

613
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,840
I wonder if that's completely true across the board.

614
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,680
But that I did find consistent across most of the art.

615
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,360
We did. OK, there was a plumber strike going on

616
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,000
and they either need it.

617
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,760
The bathrooms finished or the water fountains finished.

618
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,760
And I think it went people can buy Pepsi and Coke.

619
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,760
But we need bathrooms.

620
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,120
Fat lot of good it did those fucking kids.

621
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,680
Yeah, they didn't take advantage of the only water in Disneyland

622
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,240
being toilet water. Yeah.

623
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,040
The only water in Disneyland was toilet water on opening day.

624
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
How soon was it?

625
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
They got the drinking fountains up and running.

626
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
People didn't drink that much water back then.

627
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,280
That's what cigarettes were for.

628
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,520
Good point. Yeah, that gives you energy.

629
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,280
Can't get you through the day.

630
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,680
I think they in Southern California just smoke as much as they can.

631
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,280
Yeah, they were like, Walt, we won't have drinking fountains.

632
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,960
And he was like, well, do we have whole milk and cigarettes?

633
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,800
And they're like, yeah, of course. He's like, great.

634
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
We're fine.

635
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,720
Now, that is not not in the broadcast.

636
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
There's probably people smoking in the broadcast,

637
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,040
but there's behind the scenes footage of them setting up for the broadcast.

638
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,280
And we saw some very funny shots where the guy first off,

639
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,320
he's drawing the frames on the ground in June.

640
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,200
First off, he's drawing the frames on the ground in chalk,

641
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,040
which was odd that he wasn't using a pencil and paper.

642
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,480
But he there's there's people like figuring out this camera needs to go here

643
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,880
and we need to be able to see this.

644
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,400
And they have not put out their cigarettes like they cannot even stop smoking

645
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,080
for 30 seconds of behind the scenes.

646
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,600
So do you think every cameraman, everybody holding a boom mic,

647
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,840
just everyone has a cigarette in hand?

648
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,920
I think everyone has a cigarette.

649
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,640
I think most of the on camera talent is probably a little lit from flasks.

650
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,400
It was just a different it was just a different time back then.

651
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,040
You can't have gum in the park, but you got to have a smoke.

652
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,600
You know, the only reason our link letter didn't have a cigarette is just

653
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,840
the reason they did all those cigarettes is just because they had conflicting

654
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,200
endorsement deals. Yeah.

655
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,640
Like, I can't be on camera with somebody smoking Marlboro

656
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,080
because I'm with, you know, Worthington.

657
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Yeah, I forgot the names of these cigarettes.

658
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,040
Yeah. Danny Thomas had a different cigarette brand than Bob Cummings.

659
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,800
So that was a big problem.

660
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,920
Yeah. Can you imagine if you were at Disneyland and it smelled like a casino?

661
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Which I mean, I know it's a while, I think for a while.

662
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,760
But yeah, you're on like Space Mountain and it's just a thick

663
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,440
cigarette cloud waiting in line.

664
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,560
And like that would be something.

665
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,280
And yes, it was it was probably the reality up until what?

666
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,040
20 years ago.

667
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,760
Um, what's well, people were smoking, I don't know, not maybe not in the line.

668
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,280
Could you smoke when?

669
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,400
When was the last time you could smoke in the line of like a ride?

670
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,680
That's a good question.

671
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,160
It's maybe been a while, I think.

672
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,800
I have no I have no idea.

673
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,560
Jason, good. Well, I can tell you I can't tell you an exact date,

674
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,560
but I can tell you.

675
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,560
So Jane found and got me a vintage Caribbean beach

676
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,480
resort baseball cap from the same seller.

677
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,760
Got a pair of Caribbean Beach matchbooks.

678
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,880
Like that would be in your hotel room or in the lobby of like,

679
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,440
here's your matches, you know, to light up your cigarettes.

680
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,680
How so like the fun, silly themed hotel for children?

681
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,120
Well, you want to relax at the beach, right?

682
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,160
You know, you need a Chester.

683
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,640
You needed a long LNM.

684
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,840
So that was eighty nine ninety about one year, I think.

685
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,760
And I could be mixing up hotels, but I believe we were going to the Polynesian.

686
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,080
And I'm sure my mom's going to be mad because I got this wrong.

687
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,400
We went into a room and it was supposed like it smell like smoke, like crazy.

688
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,280
And we went back down and we were like, it's like cigarette smoke.

689
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,160
And there's great. Like, could we get another room?

690
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,680
And they said, fine.

691
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,000
And we went to another room and we were walking around

692
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,920
and we opened up the closet and it smelled like piss.

693
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,520
It was so strong.

694
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,680
The pee was like somebody like a kid had peed in the closet,

695
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,160
like a child had peed in the closet.

696
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,480
And I can't remember if we if they just came and cleaned it or we moved.

697
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,080
I don't remember.

698
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,320
You sure it was a child?

699
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,160
A couple of you drink a couple of pineapples, you know,

700
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,400
you drink a couple of pongus, you know.

701
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,320
I am not sure it was a child.

702
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,400
Absolutely not sure.

703
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,840
That's how Mr. Toad smelled at this time, like, you know,

704
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,400
but like there were long lines everywhere, but people that pee real bad

705
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,160
and just as soon as we're indoors, it's a little dark, wet or rip.

706
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,040
Yes, the Disneyland.

707
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,360
This is a thing I've thought about before.

708
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,280
The Disneyland smells this day

709
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,720
because Disneyland is so obviously it's so specific.

710
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,000
And they've they've figured out how to put pump fake smells in and blah, blah, blah.

711
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,440
But what is everything smell like opening day?

712
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,400
Is it just like toxic paint,

713
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,160
cigarette smoke, drying cement and gas?

714
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,280
Yeah. And the and ever been people with cigarettes and cigars.

715
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,440
I can't imagine that the

716
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,760
the level of flatulence can't be great

717
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,560
from an audience of people who are only drinking Coca Cola.

718
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,440
What was public farting like back in 1955?

719
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,600
Was that more common, do you think?

720
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,680
We're just like unable to be helped.

721
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,640
You're everyone's diet was so bad.

722
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,160
There was no way to to excuse yourself.

723
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,520
It just would come out.

724
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,840
Or did you repress it so hard because that's,

725
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,440
you know, that's the devil's air.

726
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,000
So keep it inside.

727
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,840
Children would be

728
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,520
just would be given the belt mercilessly if they let out a public fart.

729
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,680
But no, no child farted in public until 1987.

730
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,760
That is a fact.

731
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,800
That's another rumor we're putting out that's true.

732
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,440
So isolate what Scott just said and attribute that to us as a fact.

733
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,120
There about no child farting.

734
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,800
Yeah. Yeah.

735
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,040
But they are encouraged to fire guns in.

736
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,600
Yes. I.

737
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,960
But by the way, and this will sound like a stat that we're making up,

738
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,840
according to Guest your land, Disneyland Park stopped selling cigarettes

739
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,040
anywhere on property in late 1999.

740
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,160
They sold them still in.

741
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,400
Yeah, I'm assuming they had sold stop selling them in park years earlier.

742
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,040
But I guess maybe you could get them at hotels still probably up until then.

743
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,480
Oh, yeah. That's my guess.

744
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,840
I don't think you could get a pack of cigarettes in 1999 in Disney Park.

745
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,280
But maybe I'm wrong.

746
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,400
Maybe there was one spot you could get cigarettes in.

747
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,840
They were singles.

748
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,720
They were just they were they were just one offs, you know, with a character on it.

749
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,680
There's there's Lumiere light up with Lumiere.

750
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,280
Was there a fan outrage when cigarettes were stopped?

751
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,280
They stopped selling cigarettes at a gift shop.

752
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,680
Was there a huge with their petitions?

753
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,720
The Geocities breaking Disney to stop selling cigarettes.

754
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,640
What's next? Kodak film.

755
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,520
Yes. The answer is yes.

756
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,680
Disney strips civil liberties.

757
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,680
I have the right to

758
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,320
at the last minute, hop on a Skyway car with a stranger and smoke the entire way.

759
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,400
Smoke a pack on the Skyway.

760
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,000
The old advertising campaign for the Skyway.

761
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,680
OK, next.

762
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,960
Ashing them on the people below kids getting ash in the eye.

763
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,760
How? Stop crying. Stop it.

764
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,760
The old like gallon milk, the like the old version of like the drinking

765
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,640
a gallon of milk challenges like can you smoke a pack of cigarettes on the Skyway?

766
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,240
Very impressive with you and your friends.

767
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,360
How many did Obama get through?

768
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,200
That's a good question.

769
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,920
I don't know if he completed the challenge.

770
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
Another degree of I don't know how fast he went.

771
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,120
Well, I always thought the Obama story,

772
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,200
I thought he was alluding to smoking reefer on on the Skyway.

773
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm not sure he leaves it ambiguous.

774
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,920
He looked it up and he clarified, at least with a joking way that it wasn't.

775
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,520
But who? Yeah, who knows?

776
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,280
He might have been cute.

777
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,480
I mean, well, maybe a good segue from presidents

778
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,760
at Disneyland way before they were presidents.

779
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,960
Oh, Ronnie Reagan, old Ronnie Reagan.

780
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,960
If you don't know, this 90 minute broadcast live from the opening

781
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,120
of Disneyland was hosted by Art Link Letter, still, you know,

782
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,800
around in our childhoods, what with kids say the darndest things,

783
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,800
whose latter day host we will not discuss.

784
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,920
You know, do you remember?

785
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,960
I do. I know what you're talking about.

786
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,120
Bob Cummings, a popular actor from the time and another popular actor, Ronnie Reagan.

787
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,600
Oh, Ronnie, which Ronnie Reagan,

788
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,080
Ronald Reagan was elected president 20 years after this aired.

789
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,480
Like nearly 20 years that right.

790
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,880
A little more. 25, a little more. 25.

791
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,040
Donald Trump was elected president 12 years after The Apprentice started airing.

792
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
What I'm saying is we as a people have always been very stupid.

793
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,120
Like Americans have always been dumb.

794
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,360
Also, in this special, I kind of made the connection last night.

795
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,120
I was like, you know, I think back then people in their entertainment

796
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,680
were a little more cavalier with their gunplay,

797
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,400
maybe partly because they had the reasonable expectation

798
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,960
they could go to public squares or schools and not be open fire on.

799
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,720
Anyway, shortly after taking presidency, Ronald Reagan

800
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,720
cut a bunch of federal funding for mental health programs.

801
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,680
And we don't have that expectation now.

802
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm sure those things are unrelated.

803
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,160
Hey, all I know is he is he is quite the charmer in this special.

804
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,000
That's all I know from Ronnie Reagan.

805
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
He's not politics, Jason.

806
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,080
He seems nice and cute.

807
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,880
At least he's not a philanderer like some of the other on screen talent.

808
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,800
It's really it's a matter of when you want me to pull the trigger on Bob Cummings,

809
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,760
because I'd say, you know, half of what I have is about Bob Cummings.

810
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,320
Oh, well, I say let's just get into it because I feel like Art Linklater

811
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,200
was Linklater the one on the monorail like he

812
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,400
hosts the opening of the monorail and all that stuff, too, I believe.

813
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't remember.

814
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,080
Like he was sort of he was sort of Disney's guy and kind of volunteered.

815
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,800
Volunteered is like hosting and producing talents for this.

816
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,600
Yeah. And

817
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,680
all I remember is that Nixon, of course, is at the opening of the monorail.

818
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,120
So Reagan is at the opening of Disneyland

819
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,320
and Nixon is at the opening of the monorail.

820
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,760
A lot of strange presidential interactions, except for Donald Trump.

821
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,040
I don't think Donald Trump has ever set foot on in a Disney park.

822
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,320
Hmm. Right.

823
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,360
And you've I assume you've searched.

824
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,440
Yeah, I believe that I've made that specific search.

825
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,560
But like, wouldn't wouldn't we know?

826
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,480
I think I mean, he's been and we know with universal photos.

827
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,080
He's a universal guy. Yes.

828
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,040
He's a universal guy is what we're saying.

829
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,680
He likes that more. He thinks Disney's too for kids.

830
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,200
He likes the more adult themes of universal.

831
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,760
Yeah. He loves horror nights.

832
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,760
Folks, we love it.

833
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,440
They've got Hop. They've got Hop's friend. Terrific.

834
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
Trump was very good.

835
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,880
Yes. The last thing I have about Art Linklater,

836
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,880
before we get into like a full dissertation about Bob Cummings,

837
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,240
because I am very curious about Bob Cummings deal.

838
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,960
Linklater apparently was offered the chance to invest in Disneyland, said no,

839
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,400
pretty clearly realized his mistake and like volunteered to help with the hosting

840
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,640
and the production of this sort of thing.

841
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,240
And when Disney wanted to thank him, because it seems to imply

842
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,760
that he was not paid for this.

843
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,400
Linklater asked for Disneyland's camera and film concession

844
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,960
for its first 10 years, a request that was quickly granted.

845
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,880
So he got a taste of anyone buying film and cameras

846
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,240
for the first 10 years of Disneyland.

847
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,800
Whoa. Wow.

848
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,800
It's a smart plan. That was a good call.

849
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,880
Yeah, geez. Wow.

850
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,720
That's a good little back end deal.

851
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,640
He sorted out there.

852
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Yeah. Geez. Very crafty.

853
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,920
I think he's like the most icon.

854
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,160
That's the part of the special that I knew the most, I think, was his opening.

855
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,640
He's up on the, you know, on the Main Street train station.

856
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,520
And when they say we're cutting to Art Linklater

857
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,520
and then it cuts to the big planner of Mickey in the first slide,

858
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,680
that's not Art Linklater, that's Mickey Mouse.

859
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,160
And then he's describing kind of what you're going to get into.

860
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,800
And the one that's always stuck in my head is, you know,

861
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,320
I forget the rest of the sentence, but, you know, a big with a big package

862
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:32,240
all wrapped in whimsy, the most pronounced W of whimsy.

863
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,360
This is like the only part that goes well is Art Linklater is kind of opening

864
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,800
a dress and he meets Waltz and describes what you're going to be seeing.

865
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,360
Twenty nine cameras.

866
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,120
And he describes the production of this live special.

867
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,200
And it's amazing they admit this.

868
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,720
He says what you're going to see is going to be like,

869
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,600
imagine if you were trying to cover three volcanoes erupting at the same time

870
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,040
and you didn't expect any of them.

871
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,320
Yeah, they also had to borrow cameras.

872
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,240
It was hard to get cameras back then.

873
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,200
They had to borrow cameras from everywhere.

874
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,720
From other networks.

875
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
Other networks and studios.

876
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,920
And like now you could probably find 20 cameras in southern California

877
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,080
at the Universal Studio between Universal Studios, the Film Division

878
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,280
and the local NBC affiliate.

879
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,160
You could come up with 20 cameras easy.

880
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,200
Yeah, but they yes, Art is makes it very clear.

881
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,640
This is probably going to be a shit show.

882
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,200
We apologize ahead of time.

883
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,320
This is what we're trying to do is insane for what our capabilities are.

884
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,240
Yeah, they've nothing like this had ever been attempted.

885
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,840
This is like by far the most complex thing ever televised at this point.

886
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,160
Yeah, boy, the ambition to open this park at all, even doing it.

887
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,800
And then like, should we just kind of like have someone talk about it?

888
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,000
No, no, no. Live special parades, live multiple movie stars, live dance numbers.

889
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,880
They're attempting like what, you know, Greece live ended up being

890
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,280
that they could pull off still with mistakes a little bit, you know, in 2016

891
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,120
or whatever. And they haven't done like a fully live special for something opening

892
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,440
like like this since.

893
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,560
I mean, even the stuff that might be kind of live, it's like there's a ton of pre tapes

894
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,720
and there's a ton of other things going on.

895
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,840
Light magic was partially live, partially.

896
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
That was partially chaos, though.

897
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,840
It was like, as we said, a lot more chaotic than they usually are.

898
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:38,160
And the special was padded full of just the Walt myth, the same making stuff.

899
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,280
Same shit.

900
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,640
Start with a mouse.

901
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,800
He went to the do we have to do an episode about do we ever have to address these things?

902
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,080
The he went to the carousel and he was mad at the car.

903
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,200
That's a funny aspect of that.

904
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,480
I actually saw a tweet about this that he was like, is that Griffith Park carousel?

905
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,840
It's still around.

906
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,280
And he's staring at this like this piece of shit.

907
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,040
I'll talk about this in my sleep.

908
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,640
I fucking hate this carousel.

909
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,600
This shitty carousel is for kids, not for kids and adults.

910
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,880
Step one, burn this to the ground.

911
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,440
These carnivals are trash.

912
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,560
I hate this.

913
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,440
Step two, build a park where the carousel is the worst ride.

914
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,440
I'll show you carousel.

915
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,720
Phase two after Disneyland was that he was going to blow up every carnival

916
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,000
and carousel in America.

917
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,480
Punish it for being bad.

918
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,680
Get secret agents, get his pal Ronnie Reagan to pull his government

919
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,680
strings to track each carny.

920
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,120
Get on the train cars, stab them in their sleep, dump their bodies on the road.

921
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,760
Yeah, it's definitely like a class.

922
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,320
It's definitely in hindsight, because that is always that story.

923
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,200
You always hear that and you go, oh, that is nice, because, yes,

924
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,520
some of those amusement parks are like a little bit low rent.

925
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,960
And that is nice for a family to go to.

926
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,640
But then if you think about it, it's like, well, they didn't have the money

927
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,400
you had, you maniac.

928
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,960
Like, yes, like people build a nice thing to try to get families to enjoy it.

929
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,880
And it's like they never as much money that you did because you were Walt Disney.

930
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,000
You idiot.

931
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,640
Like it wasn't some like they weren't like being it was an affront to families.

932
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,760
It was just they were making a nickel at a time.

933
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,640
They went, they had like made a bunch of movies and gotten, you know,

934
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,440
money from the war from the government.

935
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,440
Right. They couldn't some carny couldn't go to Bank of America

936
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,200
and get a 50 million dollar loan.

937
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,240
Borrow borrow against your other vacation house, borrow on your life insurance,

938
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,480
borrow against some movie bonds.

939
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,080
The other thing is, if you watch, there's a recent defunct land

940
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,280
that talks about the history of Coney Island.

941
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,440
You are reminded of the fact that back in the past,

942
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,680
everything was just constantly burning down all the time.

943
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,640
Is that what was Coney Island destroyed a lot?

944
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,640
Well, Coney Island was a lot of different attractions and like

945
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,840
different parks and many parks and side shows and all this stuff.

946
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,560
And a number of them just like went up in flames.

947
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,160
Either from just like a freak accident or like,

948
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,120
as we say, burn it down for the insurance money.

949
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,240
Or again, someone just flicked a cigarette, a loose cigarette,

950
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,320
at some wet paint.

951
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,160
And it's just like, oh, this is going to be a disaster.

952
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,920
Because they're using a kind of paint that is not used anymore.

953
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,960
That's extremely flammable.

954
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,520
Turpentine is loose, like puddles of turpentine on the ground.

955
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,280
Asbestos everywhere.

956
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,240
Just gasoline in their hair.

957
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,960
Everything is either made of gasoline or asbestos.

958
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,040
So Walt was out looking at that carousel and dream.

959
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,640
What if I want a place where I can go and take my daughters that isn't constantly on fire?

960
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,880
And past the opening day, he achieved his dream because

961
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,440
and I didn't see this is one of those also that seems in dispute to me.

962
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,200
I saw reports that said that at some point part of the castle caught on fire.

963
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,240
But are we sure? And was that opening day or is that just like,

964
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,920
how could that also have been even on top of everything else?

965
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,880
The castle caught on fire.

966
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,600
I feel like we have more concrete information about that.

967
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,040
Yeah, you'd have to imagine a bunch of weird,

968
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,200
crazy shit happened in the first six months.

969
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,240
And maybe some of that has all been folded into the opening day legend.

970
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,800
I think so. Yeah.

971
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,720
The opening months, I saw some crazy stuff of like a few.

972
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,160
Like most of the Autopia cars were destroyed

973
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,760
just from people crashing into each other or walls.

974
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,400
Here's something I had never heard of before.

975
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,840
This was not opening day, but this was in within the opening months.

976
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,080
A tiger and a panther in a circus parade broke loose and staged a,

977
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,360
quote, furious death struggle on Main Street USA.

978
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,480
What? What?

979
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,760
People need to be thinking of the opening of Disneyland more as Action Park.

980
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,040
Yeah. Like, oh, my.

981
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,920
Struggle. That's right.

982
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,560
Which animals again?

983
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,480
A tiger and a panther.

984
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,200
My God. So I just clawing, just ripping each other's throats out.

985
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,080
My God. Even the number of viewers of the broadcast

986
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,880
it was I saw some places cited as 90 million,

987
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,640
and that might have been worldwide.

988
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,760
But history dot com listed the domestic viewers as 70 million,

989
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,280
which is a big deal when you think that the population of America was 165 million.

990
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,600
Oh, my God.

991
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,760
Over. But according to some numbers, over half.

992
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,520
Yeah. Wow.

993
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,720
She's either even if it's only 70 million.

994
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,920
Oh, my God.

995
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,280
Here, can I do a quick calculation?

996
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:16,680
That is that means that the the current level of remaining subscribers of Quibi

997
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,800
is point zero one percent.

998
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,480
The opening the viewership of the opening day audience of the opening day of Disneyland.

999
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,440
And that's in the low number.

1000
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,720
Yeah. Maybe. But it'll get there.

1001
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,640
It'll go.

1002
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,640
I would just in terms of

1003
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,600
combining things and urban legends, you know, the special ends with, as you said,

1004
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,560
Jason, our link letter saying you made a bum out of Barnum and they art and Walt,

1005
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,400
you know, walk arm in arm over towards the castle.

1006
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,360
And if I wish that in that exact moment is when you wish upon a star starts playing.

1007
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,320
And that's the end of the broadcast.

1008
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,080
But then a tiger and a panther had tumbled out

1009
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,400
and

1010
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,080
mauling each other briefly.

1011
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,680
One throws the other off onto Walt Disney, who is pinned on the ground,

1012
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,760
slides into the moat.

1013
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,280
Art has to dive in.

1014
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,000
Art tears his shirt off.

1015
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,280
He's ripped, drags a wet Walt Disney.

1016
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,200
They're calling for Fess Parker to come over to try to help bring.

1017
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,200
Betsy.

1018
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
All right.

1019
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
Betsy Fess.

1020
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,600
Fess, is Betsy there?

1021
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,400
Well, that begs the question of the on camera talent.

1022
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,200
Some of the people mentioned Edie Fisher was there or Eddie Fisher.

1023
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,200
Excuse me.

1024
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,280
Eddie Fisher, the male.

1025
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,680
Not not cousin and not Edie from Grey Gardens.

1026
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,480
Eddie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis,

1027
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,120
Danny Thomas, and of course Aunt Jemima.

1028
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:03,000
Uh, so I have to think Frank Sinatra seems like the type who had a gun on him.

1029
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,360
So probably could have stopped the feral cats, you know?

1030
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,560
Yeah. Well, Sinatra, I would assume Sinatra had a guy at least with him that had a gun on him.

1031
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,040
At least had a guy. Yeah.

1032
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,400
Yeah. He just would have snapped, yes, and somebody would have.

1033
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,200
Yeah. Take care of him for him.

1034
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,680
Right. Exactly.

1035
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,560
He would have also done that if some kid looked at him the wrong way.

1036
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,520
Yes. From the stories I've heard.

1037
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,600
Yes. He brought the panther, I think.

1038
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,080
That was part of his security detail.

1039
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,880
Frank traveled with a panther.

1040
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,560
Hey, Charlie, keep me safe, buddy.

1041
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,200
Yeah, Frank. And there was probably Frank was probably walking around

1042
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,480
with a glass of whiskey all day at Disneyland.

1043
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,000
They probably look the other way for that.

1044
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,320
That was the original drinking.

1045
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,720
He's the only one who was allowed to drink liquor in Disneyland up until Galaxy's Edge.

1046
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,480
Oh, yeah. There's the rules and then there's the Frank rules.

1047
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,560
Yeah. The chairman was allowed to do what he wanted.

1048
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,000
The chairman could do what he wants.

1049
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,840
It's like since we talked about Atlantic City, there's that story about Frank Sinatra

1050
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,640
and Dean Martin when they were helping open Atlantic City casinos,

1051
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,520
went into the casino at like 3 a.m.

1052
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,000
or something and demanded the poker dealer deal cards by hand,

1053
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,800
which is incredibly illegal.

1054
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,120
And the pit boss had to go like, oh, OK, it's Frank's.

1055
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,920
Yeah, I guess so. It's Frank Sinatra.

1056
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,560
Again, incredibly illegal to deal

1057
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,760
deal as if you were playing at your home and not from like a card distributor.

1058
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,960
Oh, no weird. Huh.

1059
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,520
And Frank gave him a pack of all kings. Yeah.

1060
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,840
OK, we got to do what he says.

1061
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,920
You make freaky mad.

1062
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,160
That's that's another aspect of anybody as like a good

1063
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,480
record of what Frank did all day at Disneyland.

1064
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,760
Oh, yeah. Was anybody to know tracking him?

1065
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,680
Yeah, absolutely.

1066
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,200
He had a son with him.

1067
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,000
He had Frankie Jr. Frankie Jr.

1068
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,720
Yeah. Yes.

1069
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,760
Who used to make who used to make fun of when he would tour with him.

1070
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,560
Hmm. Yeah, that's a good thing.

1071
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,520
Release the panther.

1072
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,000
Bite his crotch.

1073
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,840
He made he made it's like the scene in Talladega Nights.

1074
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,200
He made when Gary Cole makes Will Ferrell get in the car with the panther.

1075
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,560
Yeah, whatever.

1076
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,960
You'll never make your man that a tiger.

1077
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,040
I'm mixing up the tiger and the sex panther from Anchorman, I guess.

1078
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,400
Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1079
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,760
I yeah, there's you know, there's another guy

1080
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,560
who was here.

1081
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,800
That's an odd little sidetrack that I found.

1082
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,720
There's there's a lot.

1083
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,840
There's Art Linklater several times gives him

1084
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,040
some audio real estate to pointing out Don DeFour.

1085
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,080
There's Don DeFour, who's one of those names who's sort of lost on you today.

1086
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,400
You know, clearly big in the in the 50s.

1087
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,560
And obviously, because then they say, I'm like, who's Don DeFour?

1088
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,360
And he says, my old friend Don DeFour, Ozzy and Harriet's next door neighbor,

1089
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,640
next door neighbor. I wrote this down, too.

1090
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,400
Yeah. Yeah.

1091
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,840
Not previously aware of Don DeFour.

1092
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,280
But then I like, I like, well, I got to find out some info about Don DeFour.

1093
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,000
And why was he here?

1094
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,280
And why did they make a point of because you see him on the Autopia

1095
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,600
and at the launch of Casey Junior, the circus train,

1096
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,680
which they called several times Casey Jones Jr.

1097
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,760
There's a lot of things wrong.

1098
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,000
They got things wrong all the time on this thing.

1099
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,080
They call it the Autopia.

1100
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,040
Ronnie Regan.

1101
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:38,280
Irene Dunn, the actress who christened the Mark Twain, calls Art Linklater Walt.

1102
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,200
So many mistakes in this.

1103
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,560
She was drinking from that bottle before she christened it, probably.

1104
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,760
Can I still smash it if it's open?

1105
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,360
And then, I mean, that's one of those standard things, too.

1106
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,600
Then she tries to break the bottle and the bottle didn't break.

1107
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,280
I mean, it was just that sort of granular everything going wrong.

1108
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,400
But anyway, Don DeFour,

1109
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,480
it's like, what is up with Don DeFour and what a delightful thing that I discovered.

1110
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,040
Let me do a quick screen share with you guys and tell you that Don DeFour

1111
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,440
not only was at the opening day in 1955, but in 1957, opened up in Disneyland.

1112
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,880
Don DeFour's silver banjo barbecue restaurant.

1113
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,280
He was the only person, the only real person

1114
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,680
to operate his own private establishment within Disneyland.

1115
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,600
And I'm showing you a Yesterland article where he's holding a big banjo.

1116
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:41,120
He's beaming. He's like he's in a barbershop quartet kind of hat.

1117
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,840
He's so proud. It's like the happiest guy I've ever seen.

1118
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,040
Silver banjo barbecue restaurant sounds great, honestly.

1119
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,200
Who's Verne DeFour?

1120
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,160
Friends. And I think his wife worked there, too.

1121
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,840
This was a legit family restaurant by this celebrity.

1122
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:04,120
It'd be like, you know, a popular sitcom star that if Eric Stone Street

1123
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,440
ran a ramen place in Disneyland.

1124
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,320
My pitch was like Richard Carnes pizza in Tomorrowland.

1125
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,320
Home improvements, Richard Carn.

1126
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,000
Nobody makes it like Al.

1127
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,720
Pretty, pretty great.

1128
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:24,560
It actually it shared a wall with the Aunt Jemima pancake house,

1129
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,000
as aforementioned by Jason.

1130
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,600
The this is the reason that they can never redistribute

1131
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,880
Dateline Disneyland officially.

1132
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,240
They did put out a DVD of it a long time ago.

1133
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,640
And now if they do, they will have to cut the reference to that

1134
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,800
that they had for a very long time.

1135
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,400
Jim and Lendis Jim and Lendis did a very interesting look back at that

1136
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,760
on their Disney dish.

1137
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,800
So I would recommend that, too.

1138
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,720
Well, and she let's just say she doesn't just like wave from a distance.

1139
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,800
She shows up in a musical number and dance.

1140
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1141
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,200
Oh, yeah. They say and here's Aunt Jemima.

1142
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,880
In already a very chaotic, chaotic musical number.

1143
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:10,000
All of them are because the cameras aren't equipped to film them correctly.

1144
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:15,120
And also now dance is filmed on television, you know, with a lot of angles

1145
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,960
and things to cut to.

1146
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,360
And it's just like blurry cameras that like if you move your leg too fast,

1147
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,800
the camera fuzzes out like you kill the lens.

1148
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,880
It's like this is no way to film a dance number.

1149
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,280
Yes, it's not like, oh, shoot, I'm forgetting the name of the band

1150
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,800
that Mickey dances with that I love on that last

1151
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,280
that Disneyland special we talked about a year ago or so.

1152
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,440
K-pop group. Yeah, yeah.

1153
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,480
What's that name of that band with the numbers?

1154
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,600
Yeah, shoot. Don't recall.

1155
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,720
Not as good as that. Yeah.

1156
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,080
NCIS 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9.

1157
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,040
That's correct. Yes.

1158
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,320
Um, where was I? Oh, well, here.

1159
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,680
Colorful characters.

1160
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:01,880
And this will also take us into, you know, one of one of the dance numbers.

1161
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,080
The best guy who appears on this special is one of the hosts,

1162
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,560
and that is Bob Cummings.

1163
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:13,440
It occurred to me that I've heard that name my whole life as a Disneyland nerd.

1164
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,480
And I think as soon as I found out about this, obvious, you know,

1165
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,400
when I was a kid and I heard about that special, I knew Ronald Reagan was

1166
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,040
our link letter was around in our childhoods.

1167
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,360
But who was Bob Cummings?

1168
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,320
I did not really know.

1169
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,760
He is an actor from the Bob Cummings show.

1170
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,720
He was in Dial M for Murder, you know, pretty good, respected actor.

1171
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,000
He won an Emmy four months prior to this special.

1172
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,960
So he was on top of the world.

1173
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,640
Bizarre facts about this guy.

1174
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:47,040
His godfather was Orville Wright, like the inventor of flight.

1175
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,440
Orville Wright. And he flew in the military.

1176
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,400
He was and also was a flight instructor for a long time.

1177
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,960
Very interested in piloting.

1178
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,760
And he in fact, when they started list giving out official

1179
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,440
flight instructor licenses, he was number one.

1180
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,440
He's the very first Bob Cummings flight instructor.

1181
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,080
Number one. That's wild.

1182
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,800
Very strange. And then the bizarre fact, I just can't wrap my head around this sentence.

1183
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,400
He was an avid pilot and owned a number of airplanes all named Spinach.

1184
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,000
Is that a mistake?

1185
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,840
Was that translated from another language?

1186
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,920
All the airplanes he owned were named Spinach?

1187
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,760
All named Spinach.

1188
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,960
Yeah, I tried to I Google it further a little bit.

1189
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,680
And yeah, it's like Spinach one and Spinach two.

1190
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,720
I don't really. How many did he have?

1191
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,480
I don't know, three, at least.

1192
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,680
You can watch some video of Spears.

1193
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,040
There's somebody flying Spinach around right now.

1194
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,120
Spinach is still around in good shape.

1195
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,640
Really? Does Harrison Ford own Spinach?

1196
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,400
He could. Not sure.

1197
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,120
Leno, perhaps. He's not in the planes.

1198
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,400
Does Leno have planes too?

1199
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,360
He hates planes. He despises planes.

1200
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,160
Yeah, it's like a car in the sky.

1201
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,520
Yeah, no, I think Scott's right. I think Leno hates planes.

1202
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,600
That's why the cars is to, you know, make sure he's trying to get flight ended

1203
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,000
altogether. Leno hates Leno hates planes, fire and rescue.

1204
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,600
He loves cars. He hates fire and rescue.

1205
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,640
Why did they do it?

1206
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,760
Why did they own the whole franchise?

1207
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,440
Anyway, I guess all of his planes were named Spinach

1208
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,920
because he was a staunch advocate of natural foods.

1209
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:39,360
And he was all about health in general.

1210
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,800
And I think as he started getting into this stretch of his career,

1211
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,120
where he's trying to do so much, he's trying to act on TV and film

1212
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,520
and host specials like this, he starts complaining about a lack of energy

1213
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,080
and him being a health food person.

1214
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,000
Like, how good what is it?

1215
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,800
What's just a good natural way that I can get my energy up?

1216
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,280
And this is in 1954, the year before this, this is starting.

1217
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,040
And he's complaining to to his friends, fellow celebrities,

1218
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,800
Rosemary Clooney and Jose Ferrer Ferrer,

1219
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,480
who recommended a doctor.

1220
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,920
I believe am I getting this right?

1221
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,640
The doctor is named Dr.

1222
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,280
Bryce Hutchins, a very

1223
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,960
Troy McClurey name.

1224
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,280
Maybe I'm getting the name wrong.

1225
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,240
Anyway, this is this doctor

1226
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,200
recommend that there's a lot of celebrities at the time

1227
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,480
were going to this doctor who were also complaining about a lack of energy.

1228
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,280
And he made a concoction that gave all the celebrities of the time

1229
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,360
all the energy that they could ever want.

1230
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,920
And over the course of the years, what has come out

1231
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,640
is that this concoction contained a substantial dose of methamphetamine.

1232
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,840
And let me make sure I have the right guy,

1233
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,600
Dr. Bob Cummings, because you can find a list of like everybody

1234
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,600
who was using this doctor.

1235
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,160
And it's like literally every celebrity of the time,

1236
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,720
you know, including like Judy Garland.

1237
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,720
It is OK. It is Bryce Hutchins.

1238
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,280
No, no, no. He changed his name to Bryce Hutchins.

1239
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,400
I'm all over the map. I'm sorry here.

1240
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,600
Trying to find this doctor.

1241
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,880
Who is that? Max Jacobson is the doctor.

1242
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,040
And if you look at his clients, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Leonard Bernstein,

1243
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,200
Bob Cummings, Rosemary Clooney, Judy Garland, Elvis Presley,

1244
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:33,040
Nelson Rockefeller, Elizabeth Taylor, everyone who was famous in this era

1245
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,560
was on meth.

1246
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,440
The same man was giving all 50 famous people

1247
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,920
just injecting meth straight into him. Wow.

1248
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,520
Including vitamin A, Vegemin, try vitamin A, Vegemin for all you need.

1249
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,160
Including JFK.

1250
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,560
JFK was on this same doctor's meth.

1251
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,440
He was quoted.

1252
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,120
This isn't even made up or urban legend.

1253
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,280
This is a quote that people, aides around JFK express concern about.

1254
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,040
Maybe you shouldn't be on whatever this weird thing is that gives you all the energy

1255
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,280
and makes you crazy.

1256
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,840
And he said, I don't care if it's horse piss.

1257
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,960
It works.

1258
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,280
It was it was later observed that JFK's leadership,

1259
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,680
especially during the Cuban Missile Crisis, improved greatly

1260
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,800
once the treatments were discontinued.

1261
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,360
So for the first two years of the presidency,

1262
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,720
Kennedy is out of his fucking mind on meth.

1263
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:32,520
And then the stuff that we remember him for was done without the assistance of meth.

1264
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:40,440
Wow. All this to say that undoubtedly, if Bob Cummings got on this concoction in 1954,

1265
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,200
he certainly was still on it for a big event like this.

1266
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,080
Was there a fight? You have to assume one of the hosts of the special

1267
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,840
during the special was high on meth.

1268
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,080
Wow. Bob Cummings is methed up.

1269
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,360
He was in this special. Super methed up.

1270
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,280
And let me go even a little further.

1271
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,040
Let me go backwards and say, you know, the story is like, well, the doctor

1272
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,400
insisted that it was only this and this, but it actually contained meth.

1273
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:11,000
But the shit that he admitted to is crazy, too, because he said, no, no, no.

1274
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,200
This is perfectly natural. My injections.

1275
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:19,880
It consists only of vitamins, sheep sperm and monkey gonads.

1276
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,680
Wait a minute. Go to hold on a second here.

1277
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,840
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. All right.

1278
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,600
All right. Vitamins. Got it.

1279
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,920
Yes. Yes. Makes sense.

1280
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,240
Fine. Sheep sperm.

1281
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,440
And now, do you mean how do you get sperm without semen?

1282
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,920
What is your method of extracting sperm without the substance that it

1283
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,200
are you like plucking?

1284
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,480
You have to be. Yes. Out.

1285
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,760
The instruments would be so tiny.

1286
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,560
It's just be I don't know.

1287
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,920
Exactly. How would that be the case?

1288
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,640
Yeah, I don't know.

1289
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,440
So you have to admit there has to be some semen in the sheep sperm.

1290
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,480
Has to be. You cannot get sheep sperm without getting full sheep.

1291
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:09,560
And also, how are you getting the sheep sperm in general?

1292
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,960
Well, there's only one way I know of.

1293
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,640
So something that that has to be what he's having.

1294
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,320
Maybe the doctor is hiring people to do it.

1295
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,280
But something that Tom Green would have done and Freddie Godfinger.

1296
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,520
Whatever the Tom Green of their day of the day was probably Bob Cummings

1297
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,280
extracting Bob Cummings.

1298
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,280
That's what I didn't say.

1299
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,800
It was kind of a gross out show.

1300
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,480
The Bob Cummings show was mainly him jerking off farm animals.

1301
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,440
Well, we know he's a little horned up this day.

1302
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,480
That's for he is. Yes. Yes.

1303
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,560
And we'll get Michael, are you done?

1304
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,800
Do you have any more questions?

1305
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,680
I wasn't done. Yes.

1306
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,840
OK, the last one you said is actually the most confusing

1307
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,520
because the other two are very I get I get the other two.

1308
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:57,000
Just in concept, how you would get like, yeah, she's got a monkey.

1309
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,480
Monkey gonads.

1310
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,600
How you said he gonads.

1311
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,720
OK, so gonads.

1312
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,400
That's the thing I hear that that means testicles.

1313
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,200
Am I correct? I think so.

1314
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,400
Which, like I feel like you only hear the word gonads.

1315
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,680
Very slangy colloquially, like doctors say gonads.

1316
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:21,360
Was that more common in the old days to use that instead of balls or testicles?

1317
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,080
And also, is he making some sort of concoction in a cauldron?

1318
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,040
What is like this sounds like he's casting a spell.

1319
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,240
Sperm of sheep and gonad of monkey.

1320
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,440
Yeah. A dash of meth will make you feel funky.

1321
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,880
So how much of a gonad is in?

1322
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:50,880
Is it how much like is it a piece of the ball in each in each serving?

1323
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,760
Do you do you grind it up and put the ball in a hole?

1324
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,400
Or is it something you steep it in?

1325
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,680
Is it like a bay leaf?

1326
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:02,240
Is it just add to the flavor or is it part of the actual recipe?

1327
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,240
Yeah. And how again?

1328
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,240
And then the question of how do you get it?

1329
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:11,600
How do you get is there was there a big push to neuter monkeys?

1330
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,040
And he was paying doctors to get.

1331
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,760
Bob Barker broadened it out, but his initial what he wanted you to do

1332
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,240
is spaying and neutering started with monkeys and monkey.

1333
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,960
And then as people stopped owning pet monkeys, he had to, you know,

1334
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,320
make it be for dogs, too.

1335
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,200
And if you even Bob Barker, if you slow it down, he would say

1336
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,840
if you could really listen and you turn the volume up and you say,

1337
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,200
spay and neuter your pet and then give them to a doctor and make money.

1338
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,920
You can hear that if you really slow it down and speed it up.

1339
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,840
Isn't so that's very strange.

1340
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,520
Red Bull.

1341
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,360
Well, is it still or was there at some point in time in which Red Bull involved

1342
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,160
testicle, the power of testicles?

1343
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,680
Bull, is that true testicles?

1344
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,720
Is there is that made is that like a weird

1345
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,640
urban legend?

1346
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,040
There's for sure results as I look up.

1347
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,120
Does Red Bull contain sperm from bull testicles?

1348
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,560
But I don't think that it does anymore.

1349
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,840
I think that might be or, you know, some energy drink

1350
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,280
did use testicles like years and years ago.

1351
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,400
That sounds like you are like a childhood room or you hear

1352
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,520
like Yellow Five. Yeah.

1353
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,200
What do people think?

1354
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,560
You mentioned that was a coloring and mountain dew

1355
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,280
that people thought like decreased your sperm count.

1356
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,040
Is that been there?

1357
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,480
It's not. I didn't say it's.

1358
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,600
I don't know. It's been proven either way.

1359
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,920
But I think it's a thing where you had to have like an insane amount of it.

1360
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,000
The since you mentioned a monkey, there is a really quick shot

1361
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
when the parade is going on of like a monkey and an organ grinder on Main Street.

1362
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,240
Yeah. Did you notice if the monkey has does it have balls still?

1363
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,080
No, the kinescope footage is so hard to tell.

1364
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,000
No, this poor monkey was the like

1365
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,680
with the old school, like the Italian guy, like is your big day.

1366
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,480
You're going to be on TV.

1367
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,440
You're going to grind to the organ on television.

1368
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,600
Oh, it's a big day for you.

1369
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,040
And then like, excuse me, Mr.

1370
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,600
Bob Cummings would like to meet you, sir.

1371
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,360
Oh, wonderful.

1372
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,440
No, he just wants to talk to the monkey.

1373
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,560
Oh, OK, as unusual.

1374
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,680
But and then he goes off.

1375
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,560
He needs his energy.

1376
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,760
Oh, you mean he needs him to clap around and dance to give him energy.

1377
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,600
That sounds fine.

1378
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,240
Yeah, something like that.

1379
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:42,320
Monkey leaves to go meet Bob Cummings returns 15 minutes later.

1380
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,840
What happened to his gonads?

1381
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,440
Oh, no.

1382
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,640
And Bob is like, you shut up.

1383
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,760
I'm full of energy and I'm ready to host.

1384
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,200
I didn't do shit. You can't prove nothing.

1385
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:59,040
I didn't freshly squeeze them like they were grapefruits.

1386
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,160
All right. Now put me on. Get me on air.

1387
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:07,240
I'm an entertainer, the greatest in the world.

1388
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,240
This isn't a Hitchhawk movie.

1389
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,400
I can get away with murder in real life.

1390
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,720
Wow. What?

1391
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,240
The past was crazy, right?

1392
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,160
Yeah, this is all what this all shines a light on.

1393
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:26,320
It's that the 50s were bonkers, which brings us to what Jason alluded to.

1394
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,680
And this is I think all this is crucial backstory for what is maybe the most

1395
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,000
memorable strange moment of the live broadcast.

1396
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,160
So Bob Cummings is around.

1397
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,520
He's introducing people. Nothing's going awry.

1398
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,960
He's just smiling big.

1399
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,760
Why, he's even in the parade with his wife and children.

1400
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,880
Let me repeat it.

1401
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,440
Bob Cummings and his wife are seen earlier in the broadcast.

1402
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:56,720
And then later in the broadcast, it cuts to another dance routine,

1403
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,680
the third or fourth in the thing.

1404
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:03,720
And this one's kind of like a cowgirl roundup type dance routine.

1405
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,240
And it's fun. It's a big hoedown.

1406
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,040
Everybody's having a blast.

1407
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:13,040
And then all of a sudden it cuts to a weird angle and somebody's back is turned

1408
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,040
and you can't quite see what's happening.

1409
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,000
And then that person turns around and it's Bob Cummings who makes a face

1410
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,800
like he was caught, as does the woman who he was clearly just making out with.

1411
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,080
She is one of the cowgirls in this dance number.

1412
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:37,040
And Bob looks a little like, oh, whoops, the girl looks terrified.

1413
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:42,120
She is so upset to be caught on camera and just runs out of frame

1414
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,840
as fast as she possibly can.

1415
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,080
Is this supposed to be like a bit?

1416
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:54,360
That's what I said. But then I found a news story from KPCC,

1417
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,440
one of the local public radio stations from 2012.

1418
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:02,800
And they are treating the Cummings incident as like, no, this is real.

1419
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,280
How did he not just get immediately fired?

1420
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,880
Or nowadays, that would be a career killer.

1421
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,920
And they're like, it just didn't have it in 1955.

1422
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:17,600
Like, what if they cut to ABC special and Regis was making out with Cinderella?

1423
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,240
It's what he always wanted.

1424
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,040
That was the dream.

1425
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,880
We know we know.

1426
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,000
But what if it actually was on camera during a live broadcast?

1427
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,120
And we know we know about his wife.

1428
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,960
We it's what Joy, right?

1429
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,800
Joy. Yeah, we know.

1430
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,520
We saw him with Joy.

1431
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,000
And then 45 minutes later, he's got his tongue on Cinderella.

1432
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,160
Well, I would love it is what is my answer.

1433
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,520
I don't want to cause any strife to the Philbins, but what a great show that would be

1434
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,880
purely conceptually, as far as TV moments,

1435
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,960
it would be one of the greatest TV moments of all time.

1436
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,480
It would be better than the moon landing

1437
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,880
by far better than the moon landing. Yeah.

1438
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:06,240
There's another there's another piece of context that we have not mentioned yet

1439
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,600
because we got the plumber strike.

1440
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,000
We got the counterfeit, the all the extra people.

1441
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,280
The water pipes aren't working.

1442
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,320
There was one other big thing going on.

1443
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,560
While all this is happening and Cummings is like gassed out of his mind

1444
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,880
on concoctions, oceans, there's a heat wave.

1445
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,480
There's a heat wave going on,

1446
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:37,560
the going over like 100 degrees or just an insane heat wave in Southern California,

1447
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,200
Southern California known for being hot.

1448
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,960
But like it only once or twice a summer does it usually get that hot.

1449
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,920
Honestly, right now it's in the high 90s in the San Fernando Valley.

1450
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,000
But there's a heat wave.

1451
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,840
Everyone's out of their minds.

1452
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,880
There's only three restaurants.

1453
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:58,920
There's like popcorn and cigarettes and Coca Cola, a chicken of the sea thing.

1454
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,160
Like, I don't know.

1455
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,480
So you're saying that there's scorching hot tuna.

1456
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah. Available food today.

1457
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,080
Yeah. With coffee and Pepsi Cola.

1458
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,680
Whole milk and cigarettes.

1459
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,960
Yeah. All right.

1460
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,560
I got my cigarettes.

1461
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,720
Got my flaming hot tuna.

1462
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,480
Got my coffee.

1463
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,520
Sizzling. The tuna is sizzling from the sun.

1464
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,160
You can hear it crackling while.

1465
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:35,960
I have I have freshly extracted these monkey gonads.

1466
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,160
Get me on TV. I'm ready to go.

1467
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,120
So this is what you're dealing with and you're dealing

1468
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,600
whether you're just a guest or a broadcaster with miles and miles of cable.

1469
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,600
And then you turn around and you see the site.

1470
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,240
I just sent you guys through text message.

1471
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:00,200
Just the scariest god damn Donald Duck you ever seen.

1472
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,960
I will describe this right now.

1473
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,480
So there's a Donald Duck that is in what I would call like a velour jumpsuit

1474
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,960
that would simulate like what Donald's shirt and bottom half where the seat is.

1475
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:18,960
And then orange leggings with sort of little duckbills sticking out.

1476
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,920
Then what I would like as if Donald had a tracheotomy,

1477
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,680
like his neck, something's wrong with his throat.

1478
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,160
And then a Donald Duck head on the top and the Donald Duck head

1479
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,600
actually looks OK in my mind.

1480
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,200
And then to the left, you see some other characters, including Mickey,

1481
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:43,880
who has his head off and a woman holding the head in the outfit.

1482
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,680
And woman, it's like any of our grandmas, but younger.

1483
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,440
Yeah, she has taken the head off.

1484
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,320
I assume this is in full view of all the guests.

1485
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,440
I yeah, or I think what this might I think the context of this might be

1486
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,800
before the fantasy land opening

1487
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,600
moment where, you know, all the characters do a little dancing

1488
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,880
and kids run out of the rides and stuff.

1489
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,520
This might be like right before the cameras cut to him.

1490
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,880
But still, even that, I don't think they would do.

1491
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,360
They would never have a head off out in the park. Right.

1492
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:20,080
And I'm realizing I miss like Chipper Dale's head is also off right here as well.

1493
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,280
Yeah. And that's another thing.

1494
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,440
Not only is the broadcast fully available on YouTube,

1495
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:31,640
the worldwide press was here, including Life magazine,

1496
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,400
who, if you need a good photo back in the day, Life magazine

1497
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,160
was like the source for photography and I believe is now owned by the Getty

1498
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,760
Photo Collection.

1499
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,080
So there is amazing quality photos of this opening day.

1500
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,760
Yeah, I have one actually to screen share with you guys.

1501
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:55,400
This is original Mickey and Minnie.

1502
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,240
And, you know, we could probably do an entire episode discussing

1503
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,960
the bizarre appearances of these early characters.

1504
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,760
But this the rumor that I heard on some pocket,

1505
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:11,280
maybe Jim and Len even, is that these were hastily borrowed from the Ice Capades.

1506
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,680
Like, yeah, I think we've talked about that before.

1507
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,360
Yeah, Ice Capades. Yeah.

1508
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,960
So that's what these are.

1509
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:22,160
The only that was the only place that suited characters had really existed.

1510
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:27,720
So they're just it's essentially just Mickey and Minnie are in black sweaters

1511
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,360
and pants with just, you know, shorts and a skirt.

1512
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,640
And then, you know, I think what the unifying thing with the bizarre Donald

1513
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:41,080
Throat and the characters we're looking at right now, I think Disney had not figured out

1514
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:45,920
how to gracefully make, you know, what do you call it, scrims

1515
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,480
for the people inside to see through.

1516
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,360
There is nothing graceful about what we're looking at, which it just looks like Mickey

1517
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,920
and Minnie both have just like crevices, like big scar,

1518
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,200
like chunks of their face carved out.

1519
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,680
Like, it looks like they had cancerous moles removed

1520
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:09,560
right before they started filming and a bunch of them like Mazlakes.

1521
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,120
Sir, this is this Mr. Mouse.

1522
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,040
This is the size of a golf ball and you will die before day's end

1523
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,280
if we don't tear it out right now.

1524
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,720
All right. But I got to get out there.

1525
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,040
Disneyland's opening.

1526
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,400
I know, sir. I'm so sorry, but we have to do this.

1527
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,680
All right. If you have to, you will die mid-dance routine

1528
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,640
if we don't take this saw to your face.

1529
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,560
I like that.

1530
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,680
Like, Minnie's ear is like it's like I think it's just peeled back here

1531
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,400
in this picture, too. Where is it?

1532
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,160
Yeah, there's kind of like a like our face kind of got pancakes.

1533
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,040
And then there's just like a loose hose around.

1534
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,800
There's a loose hose on the ground.

1535
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,240
We can't go one foot to the right of Mickey,

1536
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:57,520
who, as we've said, has extremely limited visibility.

1537
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,600
Yes.

1538
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,200
You would think that would be an easy one of like,

1539
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,520
get that hose out of the way.

1540
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,320
But maybe that hose was like giving water to a toilet.

1541
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,240
Maybe there was like a kind of a

1542
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,840
like a lo fi solution to a problem.

1543
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,960
There's there's urine coursing through it right now.

1544
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,200
Yeah, draining urine.

1545
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,680
If Mickey tripped and fell, it would make the hose

1546
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:28,800
it would make the hose just spray pee all over the cowgirls next to them.

1547
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,240
In this photo.

1548
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,480
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1549
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,360
Real quick to go back to Minnie's face.

1550
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,320
Does it appear that they quickly tried to draw on eyelashes to Minnie's face?

1551
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,120
Because that's what it looks like to me.

1552
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,640
They just like got a pencil and were like, both mouse heads are the same.

1553
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,520
Let's put a bow on Minnie and try to draw eyelashes.

1554
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,600
And they had like maybe a number two pencil.

1555
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,120
And that was the best they could do.

1556
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:01,240
Very asymmetrical eyelashes

1557
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:08,240
and just like massive lips, like beesting in your allergic lips.

1558
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,920
It's pretty crazy.

1559
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,560
Minnie, in general, looks like if your

1560
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,880
three year old who has just started to draw says,

1561
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,520
I drew a picture of you, mommy.

1562
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,720
And you look like a monster.

1563
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,360
It's like the most unflattering thing you could imagine.

1564
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,440
But you have to say it's perfect.

1565
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,920
You made me look so pretty. I love you.

1566
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:38,000
James Cameron handed this photo as reference to like the Avatar CGI artist.

1567
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,400
It's like, OK, when the Navi fight the big mech suits at the end,

1568
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,880
this is their battle paint.

1569
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:50,120
Make it look like this one right one between the eyes, a bunch above the lips.

1570
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,160
Well, yeah, yeah.

1571
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:58,720
I also there's also this weird photo, which is Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds

1572
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,320
like force feeding a soda to an astronaut.

1573
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,720
They don't know they're gacked out of their minds.

1574
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,160
They were both on the meth list.

1575
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,680
They are both on the meth list.

1576
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,720
This is these are Carrie Fisher's parents.

1577
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,560
Was Carrie or Carrie? Let's just say it.

1578
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:19,240
They Eddie and Debbie were hopped up on meth and sheep sperm

1579
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:23,000
and conceived Carrie in a field that day.

1580
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,960
Right after they force fed Coca-Cola

1581
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,080
to an astronaut to an astronaut, a space astronaut,

1582
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:37,520
a special future astronaut, Bob Cummings just tossed them a full monkey gonad.

1583
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,960
Have fun, guys.

1584
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,440
Again, I keep I keep drawing, tying it back to like,

1585
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,920
can you imagine if all the stars of TGIF were methed up on one of these specials?

1586
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,120
Like going through the park lawlessly,

1587
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,920
just like making making performers drink.

1588
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,120
I'm Ben Savage, but I recently just realized I'm the devil.

1589
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,120
He's new over there, a worker.

1590
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,000
I have a Fanta, I have an orange Fanta that I need you to drink.

1591
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,160
Glug it.

1592
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,440
Ben Savage is my name and also describes what I am.

1593
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,720
Have you seen that fanny pack?

1594
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,800
I need I left I left an Epcot fanny pack here.

1595
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,160
It's very important I get a pack.

1596
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,360
I'm a dead man if I don't get that back.

1597
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,720
Just celebrities opening of Animal Kingdom,

1598
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,560
driving by the monkeys in their lips, watering.

1599
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,240
They're all pulling the emergency stop.

1600
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,680
Let me out. Let me out.

1601
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,600
Let us out here.

1602
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,320
Well, the 80s specials like the circus and World Showcase or whatever that one is,

1603
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:53,680
the celebrities are all like really slow because they the drug of choice was a lewd.

1604
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,000
So everyone's just really.

1605
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,040
That's a good point.

1606
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,400
You can really you can tell the where what the most popular drug is by whatever

1607
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,280
Disney special is occurring.

1608
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:08,960
I also, by the way, just to like not only have crazy fun and laugh at this,

1609
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Bob Cummings like crazily struggle with this thing through his whole life.

1610
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And in fact, it got so bad that he had an intervention that was pulled together by Art Linkletter.

1611
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,440
So just that as context watching this special, the two of those one had to do a

1612
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:29,400
an intervention for the other and then the third became the president of the United States.

1613
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,560
It's so bizarre.

1614
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,160
So crazy.

1615
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:38,200
Another thing to point out about the Reagan thing, when Bob Cummings at some point says

1616
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:44,920
about Tomorrowland and we take you all the way to the future of 1986.

1617
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:51,360
Tomorrowland is a future where one of the hosts of the special is the president.

1618
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,120
Isn't that weird?

1619
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,240
Yes, it's very weird.

1620
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,640
I have to think, too.

1621
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:03,320
They went 1986 because 1985, that would be 30 years in the future.

1622
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,400
But that's too too close to 1984.

1623
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,120
So, yeah, 1986, whatever.

1624
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,360
All that stuff will be fixed by then.

1625
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,080
1986 will never come.

1626
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,560
That'll never happen. So, yeah, we're safe.

1627
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,440
So far away.

1628
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:19,720
And safe to say, Reagan did not usher in that Tomorrowland.

1629
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:26,640
No. I mean, I maintain that

1630
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,120
the perfect Tomorrowland is and always was 1986.

1631
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,480
They got it right the first time.

1632
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,760
Tomorrowland peaked in 86 with the current troubles of Disneyland.

1633
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,120
I don't think it's going to get better anytime soon.

1634
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:45,240
So it just always should have been 1986 land and never changed.

1635
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,240
Can I transition since we mentioned to Tomorrowland?

1636
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,920
I have two big things about Tomorrowland.

1637
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,880
One is kind of the obvious one.

1638
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:59,000
Walt, there's a Walt blooper in the broadcast

1639
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,000
where he is introducing the land of Tomorrowland.

1640
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,440
And he starts his introduction.

1641
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,760
He nails it.

1642
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,600
But the camera is like a hair late on him.

1643
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:15,240
So the camera guy is going like, start over, start over.

1644
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:20,160
And Walt kind of annoyed, hits it again to restart his introduction.

1645
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,880
Yeah. And that is live.

1646
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,280
This is a live broadcast.

1647
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,160
So that blooper is in there.

1648
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,960
You'll see Art Linkletter stumble on his words a few times,

1649
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,400
pretty much keep it together.

1650
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:37,840
But like Art, probably a little annoyed by being caught on camera, having to redo.

1651
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,840
Like, and he's a pro.

1652
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,200
He nails the words he's trying to say.

1653
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,680
I think that that might have been a chain reaction

1654
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:51,080
spurred by cutting to Bob Cummings making out with the random dancer,

1655
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:55,680
him getting caught because he recovers and go like, OK, well, whoops.

1656
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,720
We're having fun here.

1657
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:59,280
Hey, we're going to kick it over to Ronnie Regan.

1658
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,720
And I think that's when he says the name weird.

1659
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,040
And then I think it cuts to the wrong thing.

1660
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:08,600
I think that legitimately caused a chain reaction that led to this Walt fuck up.

1661
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,720
Yeah, because there's a weird, it cuts away from Tomorrowland

1662
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,960
for a color guard ceremony, and then it cuts back to Tomorrowland.

1663
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,720
And this is what I had.

1664
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:23,000
This is what I was alluding to earlier.

1665
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,760
One of the few seemingly filmed in advance things.

1666
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,920
I think it's filmed in advance.

1667
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,200
I could be wrong.

1668
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:31,720
But we meet Dr.

1669
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:38,200
Heinz Haber, Haber, and he tells us about nuclear energy.

1670
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,960
And Tomorrowland, again, the ride wasn't working on opening day.

1671
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:49,840
So but there are some science exhibits and Disney was doing a lot for NASA.

1672
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,440
Disney was doing a lot of informational things.

1673
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,200
So who is Dr. Heinz Haber?

1674
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,760
Well, he would go on to become the chief scientific consultant

1675
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:00,280
for Walt Disney Productions.

1676
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,440
But a few years before that, Dr.

1677
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:07,320
Heinz Haber was fighting with the German Luftwaffe during World War Two.

1678
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:10,280
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

1679
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:16,040
And was a scientist and was one of the I thought.

1680
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,320
Hmm. German scientist.

1681
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,880
1950s. Let me Google a certain phrase.

1682
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,320
Go ahead. Yes, indeed.

1683
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:28,640
Dr. Heinz Haber was one of the scientists gotten out of Europe

1684
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:34,160
as part of Operation Paperclip, the American intelligence program

1685
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:40,680
to poach scientists for our purposes and for the budding NASA program

1686
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:45,200
to get them out of Europe so the Soviet Union could not get them.

1687
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,880
You might also recognize Dr.

1688
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:51,160
Heinz Haber's friend in some other Disney specials.

1689
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,600
Dr. Werner von Braun.

1690
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,240
I actually don't know if he was a doctor. He probably was.

1691
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,080
He was a rocket scientist.

1692
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:03,240
He made the helped to make the V2 rockets that were used against the allies

1693
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:08,160
in World War Two, gotten out of Europe and helped start NASA.

1694
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,160
What helped propel NASA forward?

1695
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:17,440
A series of Walt Disney Productions documentaries about space and the atomic age.

1696
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:24,000
So just a few short years before this, a lot of the American personalities

1697
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,640
were fighting with the allies and some of the German on camera

1698
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,080
talent were fighting with the Nazis.

1699
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:32,080
Whoa. Wow.

1700
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,920
Yeah, that the past was weird.

1701
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,720
The past was weird.

1702
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:42,080
But you saw the optimism at the introduction of the special

1703
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,720
because there's a very like optimistic.

1704
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,640
We're all one the American way of life,

1705
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:52,520
which is they make sure to note is God loving and God fearing.

1706
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,240
Yes, they mention world peace.

1707
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,560
We're concerned about world peace. We're concerned about brotherhood.

1708
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,960
So everyone was just kind of cool of making television

1709
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,000
specials with former Nazis back then.

1710
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,080
That's just that's how we got to the moon.

1711
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,440
That's how we got to the space.

1712
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,560
So Nazi scientists,

1713
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,200
guys on camera cheating on their wives

1714
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:17,880
because they're so hopped up on monkey gonads and meth.

1715
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,600
Future land was born.

1716
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,920
Disneyland was born this way.

1717
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,040
Everyone's imagining, of course, it's just wholesome

1718
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:30,640
because everyone's myth making about Disneyland and the company.

1719
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:31,880
And walled is all it's so whole.

1720
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,320
Something's wholesome and pure.

1721
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,520
Everything's awesome.

1722
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,560
Wow. Wow. I.

1723
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,560
I.

1724
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,720
Geez, wild.

1725
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,880
Chaos Disneyland.

1726
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,120
It's a I don't know.

1727
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,160
Do we do we do we miss this?

1728
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,480
Do we pine for this when it was just?

1729
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:53,280
Well, I mean, I think we haven't even we've barely touched on.

1730
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:57,080
I think the most chaos Disneyland is the full frontier land sequence.

1731
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,160
Oh, sure. Yes. OK. Yeah.

1732
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,400
And I think we all want to talk about that.

1733
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,600
Well, you probably have more than me.

1734
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,400
I certainly have some quotes picked out, but if you want to take us through it.

1735
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,280
Well, I mean, this starts, they kind of go land by land in the special.

1736
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:14,520
But my favorite part of this is just when they transition into the frontier land

1737
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:18,720
segment and they cut to art link letter holding a gun.

1738
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,760
And then he turns to a kid.

1739
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,120
He turns to all these kids.

1740
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:28,880
This is clearly kind of loosely scripted because he's like, what do you want kids?

1741
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,120
And all the all the kids are like, we want Davey Crockett.

1742
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,960
And he goes, all right.

1743
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,760
I'm going to give you this gun, Robert.

1744
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,880
And he answered the kid the gun.

1745
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,400
The kid fires the gun in the air.

1746
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,040
And that causes Davey Crockett and friends to ride in on horses.

1747
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:51,040
And they talk about some trouble they had with Native Americans.

1748
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:55,400
And Davey Crockett's idiot friend got his gun powder wet.

1749
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,160
But still, they reached for old Betsy.

1750
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,840
OK. OK. So imagine Regis.

1751
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,280
A kid goes, I want to see this.

1752
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,800
Regis, a kid goes, I want to see Timon and Pumbaa.

1753
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,880
And Regis goes, I got a gun here for you.

1754
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,200
Here's the gun.

1755
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,240
Fired it in the air and the Timon and Pumbaa will come.

1756
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,880
Fire another round. They didn't hear you.

1757
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,120
Get your hole. Empty your clip.

1758
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:25,000
And when they're done and when they're done dancing, I'm going to take their gonads.

1759
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,840
Regis needs energy.

1760
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:33,440
Regis, did you think Regis was always on meth during his career?

1761
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,120
Or did he have that natural energy?

1762
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,400
Maybe he was the first.

1763
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:40,120
So people were like, like somewhere backstage.

1764
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,360
So he's like, so what kind of gonads do you use?

1765
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,960
Is it a hog or a gorilla?

1766
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,400
What do you actually know? No gonads.

1767
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,160
What? It's a miracle.

1768
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,120
How could somebody have this much energy without the help of gonads?

1769
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,040
Boy, you'll work forever, kid.

1770
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,240
Would you say your name again?

1771
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,880
Regis. Regis. Regis.

1772
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,200
Fes, get out there. Fes Parker.

1773
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:04,720
They called you five minutes ago.

1774
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:05,800
Oh, shit.

1775
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,360
So, yeah.

1776
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,240
So Fes, so David Crockett comes out at this point.

1777
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,720
Right. He like immediately.

1778
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,200
Who's with him again? I'm forgetting already.

1779
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,040
Is it Buddy Edson?

1780
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,160
Was that his partner on the show?

1781
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,960
I forget the character names.

1782
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,800
It's like comic relief. Right.

1783
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,640
And then basically, Jason, maybe you know this more specifically.

1784
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,320
I do. I'm just recapping from memory.

1785
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:38,480
But he basically tells a lighthearted story about how he just killed some Native Americans.

1786
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:44,440
Yeah. With some words that we don't like that are still the names of certain football teams.

1787
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:47,080
Yes. Yes.

1788
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:51,560
Which I guess I guess because of the show,

1789
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,680
everybody was just like, we know who's good and bad in this situation.

1790
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:56,680
Yay.

1791
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,720
I don't think there was much nuance to the character at this time.

1792
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,400
Yeah, probably not. Kind of not.

1793
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:07,040
I think it still took a few years for like spaghetti Western sort of like,

1794
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,200
you know, a little more thoughtful Westerns.

1795
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:15,040
There was very briefly, I told like telling Jane about like in Ithaca

1796
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,160
had the has the full Serling archives.

1797
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:23,200
He did do a one season Western that was like Twilight Zone kind of social commentary

1798
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,360
in a Western setting. Really?

1799
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:28,280
And America hated it.

1800
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,000
They did not want to think we want our myth.

1801
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,560
We want our fake stuff.

1802
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,040
They they want the myth.

1803
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:37,520
Cowboys and Indians were that was the Avengers.

1804
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:41,720
That was like the most popular entertainment of this time period.

1805
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:46,320
Right. Even though I mean, it was about like the the distance

1806
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:50,800
we are in time from the Disneyland special is the distance

1807
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,360
that Disneyland people were from the Wild West.

1808
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,000
Kind of give or take. Absolutely.

1809
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,440
Yeah. Weird. Yeah, that's true.

1810
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,680
Yeah, it's so yeah.

1811
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:06,960
So, I mean, they're they're pining for 55 years earlier on Main Street.

1812
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,800
Of course, they're going to be romanticizing like 60, 70,

1813
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,040
80 years earlier in the in the American West. Right.

1814
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,160
The ballad of Davy Crockett was the biggest song.

1815
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:22,680
That was that was the song of the summer back in 55.

1816
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:25,080
That was that was get lucky at this time.

1817
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,920
The list so of its era and I like that.

1818
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,880
I was just like, are there offensive lyrics in that?

1819
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:37,600
So yes. All right.

1820
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,240
Verse two almost immediately.

1821
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,520
They're like, boy, crazy.

1822
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,080
I was there anything else weird about that?

1823
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,400
That day or do they just kind of sing it?

1824
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,480
And what I mean is a song about a gun, as you said.

1825
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:54,720
So then they sing a song and a dance, have a dance number about the gun

1826
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:57,720
that he just about about killing

1827
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:03,120
which Americans with it, it heightened so much like they're.

1828
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,880
First off, it's very clumsily set up.

1829
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,680
Then dancers come out and dance around Frontierland.

1830
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,480
Then it kind of cuts around the corner, transition around the corner.

1831
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,880
The Disneyland Jazz Band comes out and then they.

1832
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,960
Yeah, then they introduce Aunt Jemima, who comes out and dances.

1833
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:26,720
So from a child, a child firing a gun starts a chain of events

1834
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,160
for a massive music number

1835
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:34,040
where there's probably people scream, like not screaming, but whisper,

1836
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:37,280
screaming like, get out of the way, get out, get move, move those cats.

1837
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,320
We need that. The dancers got to come.

1838
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,680
The jazz band's got to come.

1839
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,800
Like, it's just a lot going on.

1840
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,600
Wow. Wow. Yeah, it's it's insane.

1841
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:50,200
And it is, correct me if I'm wrong, the most ambitious thing

1842
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,240
they did in this special, seemingly.

1843
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,320
Seemingly, we're going to make it like Disney's been

1844
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:00,240
they've been prepping and remastering the they're going to do the like,

1845
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,160
you know, the ultimate anniversary re-release on Disney Plus

1846
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:07,160
of Dateline Disneyland, the opening day special.

1847
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,320
And someone will listen to this podcast and go, oh, wait, right.

1848
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:14,200
None of it is viewable anymore.

1849
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,880
None of us are going to release.

1850
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,400
The special was five minutes long.

1851
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:21,560
And we're going to show it to you on Disney Plus now.

1852
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,680
For we I guess that's just the way they did things back then.

1853
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,920
Specials were five minutes.

1854
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:28,960
They had to go unedited.

1855
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:36,240
There's so many disclaimers like may contain cigarette usage, outdated

1856
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,040
racial depictions.

1857
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,600
A man who shot down your great uncle.

1858
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:47,400
Off screen Matthews on screen wife cheating.

1859
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,440
I mean, there is funny or more wholesome.

1860
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,280
Like I think you guys some picture.

1861
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,160
There's pictures of the Golden Horseshoe.

1862
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:59,240
There's children being handed what looks like very heavy mugs of root beer.

1863
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:03,600
And in the lower portion of the frame, there is very clearly an ashtray

1864
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,320
because there's just ashtrays everywhere.

1865
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,320
No gum. Please smoke.

1866
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:12,040
I mean, Jason, can you you can you imagine you as an old timey boy

1867
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:16,200
having a big mug of root beer in the Golden Horseshoe opening day?

1868
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,120
Doesn't that look nice?

1869
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:22,400
I seemingly possibly possibly glass mugs may be plastic.

1870
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,320
They look like glass.

1871
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:27,800
Be glass. Yeah, there's Tomorrowland Tomorrowland, which with the ride

1872
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:30,800
not working is literally just the world of tomorrow is chairs

1873
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,800
outdoor in the shade and a worldwide clock.

1874
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,760
Yeah. Cool.

1875
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,400
A couple exhibits, but mostly chairs in the shade.

1876
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,160
There's one part of the special that they can show.

1877
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,360
In fact, it'll be just this.

1878
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,520
This part is perfectly wholesome.

1879
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:50,400
And you talk about painting for, you know, a time that feels very far away now,

1880
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,920
but wasn't at the time.

1881
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,960
Art Linklater is talking about turn of the century

1882
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:58,280
Missouri as portrayed in Main Street.

1883
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,520
And this one phrase is, boy, I couldn't relate to this.

1884
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,240
I guess I don't understand what life was like in the 1890s or whatever.

1885
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:09,720
Because what the hell does this mean?

1886
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,880
So there's a it's like a Wurlitzer stores,

1887
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,560
like a place where you could buy instruments.

1888
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:15,680
Another one of these bizarre.

1889
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,600
Could you just buy a full organ at Disneyland?

1890
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,960
Yeah. But I don't know if that's just for show or if they had instruments.

1891
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:26,360
But art is kind of recalling the era.

1892
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,520
And he says, if you were court and a gal,

1893
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:34,040
that's where you'd buy your mandolin or your banjo

1894
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:37,880
and start tuning it up for the Sunday canoe ride.

1895
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,560
Oh, you kid.

1896
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,200
Twenty three skidoo.

1897
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:45,720
It's Sunday. Yeah, you ride.

1898
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:48,160
So the to use, you know,

1899
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,000
slang of the 2020s, is that a thing?

1900
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:58,600
The is so like in that it's codified enough that we all know the sun.

1901
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,200
It's not a Sunday canoe ride.

1902
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:04,680
It's the Sunday canoe ride as if this is a thing you do every Sunday.

1903
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,720
That was just court it. You would court.

1904
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:08,600
That's how you court it.

1905
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:11,200
This was the card, the previous.

1906
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,760
This was Tinder of its era.

1907
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,200
You would go on a canoe ride.

1908
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,760
And if you were if the canoe flipped, if you were pushed out of it,

1909
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,360
that's a no. And the courting was not successful.

1910
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:26,040
But if you if your song is sweet enough.

1911
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,680
Oh, my little gal,

1912
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,800
that's the way you make my heart go.

1913
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,680
Twenty three is a good do.

1914
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,280
Then you're in perhaps you get a second date

1915
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,280
and then you'll get lucky.

1916
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:41,000
As the song from 50 years, 100 years later.

1917
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:43,680
That's a battle.

1918
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,960
That's what will be recalled in 100 years.

1919
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,400
And I mean, you get lucky to each other.

1920
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:51,160
Get lucky with a kiss on Holiday Hill.

1921
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,360
That's what I mean by parents.

1922
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,200
Parents were so overbearing at the turn of the century.

1923
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,920
Young people had to paddle to the middle of the lake

1924
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:04,800
to do hand stuff in a canoe.

1925
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,720
You had to get you got to get a mandolin as a smoke screen and like,

1926
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,000
oh, we're just going to play the mandolin in a canoe.

1927
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,800
Honey, where are you going today?

1928
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,320
I'm going to play a mandolin in a canoe.

1929
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,160
Oh, OK. All right.

1930
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:18,400
Have fun. Sounds quite.

1931
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,800
Oh, Lord. I'm not concerned in the least.

1932
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:24,120
The mandolin I bought on Main Street.

1933
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:28,760
But then but you would maybe have to contend with a jealous father

1934
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:33,040
scuba diving, wading in the middle of the lake and popping up.

1935
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:39,080
If they go with the gun with Betsy,

1936
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,360
with that fire in a hole, it's

1937
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:45,160
you better get swimming, boy.

1938
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:48,520
Betsy, the Disneyland gun, not with my daughter.

1939
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,680
But then if he said,

1940
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,840
will you marry me?

1941
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,520
If he made it right and proposed marriage while the canoe was sinking,

1942
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,720
then then that was OK.

1943
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:02,640
He would then he would have patched the canoe and steer them to shore

1944
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:05,760
so they could start having children

1945
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,600
immediately. Get to it.

1946
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,160
How old are you guys? 14 and 13.

1947
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,000
Sounds good.

1948
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
That gives you plenty of time to have like 11 kids.

1949
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,920
Oh, the past.

1950
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1951
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:23,480
Here's here's another past thing as alluded to at the beginning.

1952
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,400
Walt gives the speech, which is very famous.

1953
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,640
The plaque is on the flagpole at Disneyland.

1954
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,800
And as part of the ceremony,

1955
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:36,520
he is surrounded by leaders from the three major faiths,

1956
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:41,080
Catholicism, Judaism and Protestantism.

1957
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,360
All three, all three of them got it.

1958
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,720
Check, check, check.

1959
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,160
As far as I know, it's only three and there they are.

1960
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,640
Um, what else?

1961
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,960
I'm in kind of a grab bag mode at this point.

1962
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,440
I mean, so much fun.

1963
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:03,720
I art art at a certain well, the Autopia art goes, you know,

1964
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:07,000
on the Autopia, women drivers are given a little special space

1965
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:08,760
on the highway.

1966
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,200
Do you really think is a joke in there?

1967
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,040
It's in there.

1968
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,680
And he says it, though, in such a straight way as if to say like,

1969
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:20,160
oh, you know, like in real life, how women need more space.

1970
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:24,080
Like he says it almost to the point where it's just fact and not a joke.

1971
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,280
I really don't even know what he's talking about.

1972
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,560
Boy, yeah, no idea.

1973
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:34,320
The Autopia, which was chaos, obviously, got Sammy Hitt and Frank.

1974
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,400
There was no guide rail at that time.

1975
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,320
There's a lot of the Autopia cars were involved in the opening day

1976
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:45,080
parade and they all conked out like after they were running for 15 minutes

1977
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,800
and then like out all gone because it was so hot.

1978
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,080
So Bob Gurr had to run around and hand start each and every one of them

1979
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:56,840
before the live parade that 90 million people are watching.

1980
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:01,920
California Governor Goodwin Knight speaks

1981
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:07,880
who is a buddy of Richard Nixon, who is Republican governor of California.

1982
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:11,240
How soon after this was Reagan, the governor of California,

1983
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,920
how long did he have Goodwin Knight's job?

1984
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,080
Reagan governor 67.

1985
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,560
Jesus, he was governor.

1986
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,640
Oh, my God. The same the number of the Trump.

1987
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:29,760
Yeah. And I Goodwin really leans into like God fearing nation.

1988
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:33,320
We're a God fearing nation.

1989
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:36,720
All these figures of authority to talk the same way.

1990
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:43,000
The like minister, the governor, there was just like if you were a community figure,

1991
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:46,080
there was just one way to talk. Yeah.

1992
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:46,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1993
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,120
There was one that rings in my head a lot the way is it's used in a lot of clips

1994
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:54,760
is the round around Reagan saying all activity on Main Street as he's

1995
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:59,240
and now I just said that's like you could wake me up in the middle of the night

1996
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,880
and say, what did Robert Reagan say in the special?

1997
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,040
And I'd say all activity on Main Street as haste

1998
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,160
just firmly lodged in my head.

1999
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:10,240
As is another quote, here's a not everybody talk the same way

2000
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:13,960
because we haven't talked about I mean, God knows I've given plenty of time on the show to this,

2001
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,960
but let's acknowledge it.

2002
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:20,080
My favorite thing in the world, my favorite moment in Disney special history

2003
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:24,760
happens in this very special, which is that all of the children are lined up outside

2004
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:27,160
the castle and then a knight pulls up.

2005
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:30,720
Who I wonder, is it supposed to be that that is the knight's voice doing this?

2006
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,960
Like, is it coming from him? I'm not sure.

2007
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,240
But this is the opening of Fantasyland.

2008
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,840
My my very favorite thing, which I feel like now I'm going to fuck up if I don't.

2009
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:44,040
Open the Fantasyland Castle

2010
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:48,240
in the name of the children of the world.

2011
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:50,520
Perhaps blowing out the mic.

2012
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:51,880
I can't not do it.

2013
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:56,880
It makes me so happy to hear it's the greatest thing.

2014
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,960
That's the highlight. Yeah.

2015
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:03,760
I know I've since we mentioned that in the show, I've become very fond of it.

2016
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:06,360
And I've, you know, I shout it in many occasions.

2017
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:09,400
I said it when I went into Tokyo Disney the first time, when Galaxies Edge opened

2018
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,720
the first time.

2019
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:14,040
I shouted it as my son was arriving.

2020
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,840
Open the birth canal

2021
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:24,280
for that in the name of the children of me.

2022
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:29,280
It's a very, very touching moment.

2023
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,920
Every every all the doc, they had a tear in their eye, I assume.

2024
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,680
I got a round of applause from the doctors.

2025
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,320
They didn't know what you were talking about, but they loved it.

2026
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,400
They loved it.

2027
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,040
And then Aaron and Aaron kicked me in the face.

2028
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:49,360
No childbirth, mid childbirth, that enough was so annoyed.

2029
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,280
Bleeding from the nose.

2030
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:54,000
Bleeding through a mask.

2031
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,160
Yes, I did. Yes, you're right.

2032
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,760
I didn't have to do it through a mask.

2033
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:58,520
We did. What happened?

2034
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,880
Is this from the baby? No.

2035
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:02,160
You got kicked.

2036
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:05,080
Well, when Disneyland reopens,

2037
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:07,560
I think we know who should be first in line.

2038
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,800
Yes, yes. To do it.

2039
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:14,280
They not only is they should hire me, it's the only way to get the spirit back.

2040
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,640
They should hire you.

2041
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,400
Except I don't want to be there. Jesus.

2042
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,320
No, no, no, you have to be there first in line.

2043
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,560
Well, I'm going to be nervous to be there and I'm going to be nervous about my health.

2044
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,880
And there's only one work around to that.

2045
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,200
I need to make my own concoction of meth and monkey gonads.

2046
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,400
And sheep sperm, sheep sperm.

2047
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,120
Don't forget, don't forget the sheep and the vitamins.

2048
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:46,640
The last little dusting that makes it special.

2049
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:51,160
Anyway, after that happens, then not to overlook

2050
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,680
the rest of the opening of Fantasyland, which is Bedlam,

2051
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,160
it's madness, just like all these children just sprint

2052
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:05,240
into the castle with all of these bizarre, grotesque, rudimentary

2053
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:08,040
characters, just waving them in this furiously.

2054
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,360
Go, go, go, go, go.

2055
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:13,320
Kids just running all over the drawbridge and then just like,

2056
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,840
you know, like straight into the line, the Peter Pan line, they all just like pile up.

2057
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,680
They're like hitting each other's backs.

2058
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,120
They're so desperate to get into the thing.

2059
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:28,160
They all the kids jump on to the tea cups with, again, another bizarre character.

2060
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:33,720
The the the the what the March hair that the Azur Lane hair is so frightening.

2061
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:34,960
It's very Donnie Darko.

2062
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:40,320
It's this this rabbit that appears to you in your dreams is waving children on

2063
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,240
who just like pile in haphazard.

2064
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:44,040
Nobody's letting them in carefully.

2065
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:46,360
Nobody's opening the door, closing the door for him.

2066
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,920
And then like the rabbits are just spinning the teacups.

2067
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:54,400
The ride starts and there's still a technician out there.

2068
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,800
He's like hoping buckle in one of the kids and then it goes.

2069
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,920
And he kind of jumps. Jesus.

2070
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:06,520
They to 90 million to an audience of 90 million people

2071
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:10,080
presented the most chaotic ride safety scenario.

2072
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:12,040
There was. Yeah, there was.

2073
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:15,200
I mean, it was still probably safer than those trash carousels

2074
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:19,480
you'd find in a Griffith Park, probably much safer still things

2075
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:22,120
with their disgusting benches. Yeah.

2076
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:27,280
That Disney just has a million facsimiles of it's like August was Walt's bench.

2077
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,040
It's like, all right, man. Yeah.

2078
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,480
Yeah. This thing could collapse at any minute.

2079
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:35,120
Just like the wood just tears my leg open.

2080
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:39,200
Now I need now I need shots.

2081
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,640
OK, sure, Scott, the Fantasyland segment is bombastic.

2082
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:50,760
But what about the like full two minutes where they cut to Ronnie Reagan

2083
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:55,800
talking to Jack Rather and his wife and they seemingly just plug

2084
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:59,960
the coming Disneyland Hotel and then just have small talk for a while.

2085
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,960
God, I must stop paying attention if you can imagine that.

2086
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,400
Jack Rather, of course, owned the Disneyland Hotel, ran it for many years

2087
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:13,320
because Walt the story is that Walt ran out of money to build a hotel.

2088
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,200
So he asked his friend to add hotels.

2089
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:20,040
Jack Rather in the 50s was producing television shows

2090
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,960
and then just like in that weird sort of boardroom.

2091
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:25,120
It's like, oh, you're going to produce a television shows.

2092
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:26,960
You should just have a bunch of hotels, too.

2093
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,640
Oh, sounds good. I'll do that.

2094
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:33,720
Like this weird, weird thing where he just has a bunch of hotels

2095
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,400
and and they just talk about what the Disneyland Hotel is going to be.

2096
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,400
And he's like, oh, you should bring Nancy and the kids like, oh, we'll do that.

2097
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,400
When are you opening?

2098
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,760
Oh, September. We'll have more stuff in January.

2099
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:45,960
Oh, we'll be there in September.

2100
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:48,760
It's just like a cocktail party conversation

2101
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,880
that they're broadcasting to millions of people.

2102
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:53,240
It's not interesting.

2103
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,680
It's the original Jimmy Fallon and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

2104
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:57,640
Just shooting the shit.

2105
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:59,960
No, the friends in real life.

2106
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:00,960
The friends in real life.

2107
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:01,960
Whoa. Oh, my God.

2108
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:06,240
Jack Rather and Ronnie Reagan have the most epic bromance.

2109
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,920
Oh, my God.

2110
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:16,120
This is an incredible 90 minutes that took longer than 90 to go over.

2111
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:21,280
I think I for many years have been overlooking what a delightful thing

2112
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,440
this is to watch, which is on YouTube, by the way.

2113
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:27,800
And I imagine some of you listening are going to want to check it out after this.

2114
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:28,760
You get so much.

2115
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,240
It is. It is more jam packed than any Disney special could ever be.

2116
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:37,960
Yeah, it is. I again, I guess I've seen clips, but when you really sit and watch it,

2117
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:43,320
there are we probably only hit like a quarter of how funny it is.

2118
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:45,840
It is so fun.

2119
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,400
It's something that, yeah, yeah.

2120
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:51,960
I mean, the way the Bob Comings getting caught plays out is so funny.

2121
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:56,200
All that mixed with here's one more thing I forgot about, which is just that

2122
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,320
this is by no fault of their own.

2123
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,920
But when you know that it starts with it's a it's a black and white newsroom

2124
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:07,560
they cut to and it's a flurry and people, his phone's ringing and loud typewriters

2125
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:11,280
and people are handing papers off and this kind of like a stressed out guy in a

2126
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:15,440
white shirt. And we take you now to Disneyland where the immortal Mickey Mouse

2127
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,560
will be opening his dream park.

2128
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:22,200
And it's so severe and just like with the people running all around.

2129
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:25,440
I'm sure this is what all news broadcasts were like at the time.

2130
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:29,520
But just viewing it now in the 2020s, you're like, well, it feels exactly like the

2131
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,840
Kennedy assassination.

2132
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,400
It's just like the same vibe.

2133
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:38,880
It's it's like it's alarming that what you get after this then is just nice dance

2134
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:44,960
numbers because you expect to be told and it is official Mickey Mouse.

2135
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:46,280
Dead today.

2136
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:53,200
Donald Duck being sworn in, wipes a tear, gets his composure back.

2137
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,240
And then what would it sound like when he gets sworn in?

2138
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,040
I solemnly.

2139
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,320
Duty.

2140
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Jesus Christ.

2141
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,000
How can this be this bad?

2142
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:16,200
How we do voices on the show.

2143
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,040
Sometimes people are like, hey, that impression was kind of good.

2144
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:23,200
Donald Duck, just we all three of us just shit the bed.

2145
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,080
Still eluding us.

2146
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,720
But I had I could have improved.

2147
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,760
It was weeks ago whenever that happened.

2148
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:34,000
And I have. Yeah, I wanted to improve, but I have not.

2149
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,120
Yeah. So, yeah.

2150
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,200
Well, well, we all need to look within and better.

2151
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:44,960
So it's I well, our our impressions are the audio

2152
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:48,440
equivalence of that original Donald Duck costume.

2153
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,400
Yeah, that's a good point.

2154
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:54,440
Just as odd and unpleasant.

2155
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,480
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

2156
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,040
Well, have we missed anything?

2157
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:03,640
I mean, this was a great day 65 years ago.

2158
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:08,280
A day to honor a day that the only way a July 17th

2159
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:12,280
could have been more chaotic is if they opened the park mid pandemic.

2160
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:18,600
So 1955 title will remain as the most chaotic July 17th there ever was.

2161
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:23,640
I mean, again, as I as far as like my notes, yes, we're done.

2162
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:27,840
But again, if you really if you got some time, watch this special

2163
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:31,640
and you I'm sure you will find a hundred things we didn't even talk about.

2164
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:35,040
And and look up the life like there's a lot of good slideshows.

2165
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:38,840
Look, the Life magazine photos are really something.

2166
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:42,240
We'll post some of them on Twitter, but really something to see.

2167
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:45,440
I am I am wiped out from my blood sugar.

2168
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:48,440
Feels like it's at a very low, low level.

2169
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,640
I do need some sort of medicine or something.

2170
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:57,040
A little magic cocktail from a guy they call Dr.

2171
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,040
Feelgood.

2172
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:02,040
Yeah. Well, can you procure these things?

2173
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:07,040
I guess just Google Google Sheep Sperm.

2174
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:10,040
See if well, we know I mean, we know how you can get sheep.

2175
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:13,040
Yeah, it's not that complicated.

2176
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:16,040
It's just a matter of if you want to do it and if a farmer like you.

2177
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:20,040
Yeah. Yeah.

2178
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:22,040
So Monkey Gonad.

2179
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:23,040
Yeah. Yeah.

2180
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:24,040
Yeah. Yeah.

2181
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:27,040
So Monkey Gonad, you might have to know a guy.

2182
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:29,040
Yeah. Wouldn't recommend.

2183
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:32,040
No, we'll start making calls as as for now.

2184
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:37,040
You survived podcast, the ride, an episode that made a bomb out of Barnum.

We just did a very fun episode this week.

2189
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:57,040
You know, as us being a theme park podcast, you obviously all were waiting

2190
02:01:57,040 --> 02:02:01,040
for our episode about the villain of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie,

2191
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:03,040
Ivan Ooze.

2192
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,040

02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:11,040
But yeah, go check it out.

And what else?

2196
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:19,040
What's the what's the what's the sign off way to what's something from the

2197
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:23,040
special to question?

2198
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,040
Let's see here.

2199
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:32,040
We could. All right, Scott, I'm going to hand you this gun.

2200
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:39,040
Right. And as I when I fire the gun, that will signal the end of the episode

2201
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:45,040
and the start of all our listeners being unnerved.

2202
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,040
Being mad at us.

2203
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:49,040
All right. Goodbye, everybody.

2204
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,040
Goodbye.

02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:53,040
