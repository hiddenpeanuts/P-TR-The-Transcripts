1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,320
Warning, the following podcast is an exciting showcase

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,320
of many innovative products that will soon be available

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,720
in your home.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,400
From the Apple Newton to Earthworm Gym 2

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,880
to an Encyclopedia Britannica on your computer?

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,280
Yes, it's a great big world of interventions

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,640
made possible by Compaq Computers,

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,920
Kaiser Permanente, Marotta Electronic Components,

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,960
and presenting sponsor Jenny Nicholson,

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,480
only on Podcast The Ride.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,320
The Ride.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,160
The Ride.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,160
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,800
hosted by three men who are all corporately sponsored.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,840
My name is Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm sponsored by Sycamore Partners, owner of Hot Topic.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,720
I'm joined by Jason Sheridan.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,800
I'm sponsored by the Darden Restaurant Group,

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,160
who own fine establishments like Olive Garden

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,560
and Red Lobster.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,160
I'm also, of course, our co-host Scott Gierdner here.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,400
And I'm sponsored by the Fest Parker Winery,

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
of which I am a proud member.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm looking forward to receiving my first mail shipment,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,160
the first one I got, of course, when I went up there

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,360
in person to Santa Ana's, but I'm looking forward

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
to some nice summer varietals.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,840
That's great.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
And we're all wearing clothing that we

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,760
were given to, given by the corporation.

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Like Brock Lesnar wears Jimmy John shorts

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,720
when he's wrestling.

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,880
That's just how we do it.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm wearing wine is my favorite salad socks, of course,

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,880
as always.

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,280
I am wearing Jimmy John shorts.

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm also sponsored by Jimmy John.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,800
Fair enough.

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,640
Let's just bring the guest in.

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,480
Let's find out who she is sponsored by.

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,280
Folks, you know her from her YouTube channel

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
that has her name.

45
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
It's Jenny Nicholson, friend of podcast The Ride.

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,440
She's back.

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
Hello, I'm back.

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,320
And I'm sponsored by Rainforest Cafe.

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,000
We're going to make a comeback.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
It's going to be fun.

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,880
They can pull it out.

52
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,520
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,480
They got a couple of tent poles.

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,280
Do they come back at downtown Disney, though,

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
or is that ship sailed?

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
No, they haven't yet.

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,360
But do you think they could?

58
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,520
Do you think they'll pull in a roll up sandwich?

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,960
I mean, where else are they going to go?

60
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,600
I think carbon taxes.

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,040
Everyone's like, oh, carbon taxes,

62
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,400
that's going to help offset environmental damage.

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
I think the carbon taxes are going to help bring back

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
the Rainforest Cafe.

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,160
I don't know about the actual rainforest.

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,840
I think the time is right for T-Rex to come in there.

67
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,400
T-Rex Cafe.

68
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Take advantage of the closure and bring in T-Rex this time.

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,840
Oh, sure.

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,360
Yeah.

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
When has the West Coast had a T-Rex?

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,040
That is their other very similar restaurant?

73
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah, it's where it's dinosaurs instead.

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Have you been?

75
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,360
I have.

76
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh.

77
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,040
The one in Florida.

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
Most times I've been to Florida.

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,840
Really?

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,360
Oh, really?

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,120
You make a bone of it.

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
The menu is the same, but everything

83
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,800
has dinosaur pun names.

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
None of it's good.

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,000
But there are dinosaurs all throughout.

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,200
And they are owned by the Landry Restaurant Group, who

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,680
I have a very checkered history with.

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,240
Oh, yeah.

89
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080
Who also owns Bubba Gum Shrimp.

90
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Yeah, there was a Point Snafu and City Walk Saga.

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,280
When Jason, we were at Bubba Gum Shrimp,

92
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,080
and Jason wanted to collect points from our check

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,880
for his father's Landry's account.

94
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,440
And when the waiter came back, he brought it.

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,520
And he said, oh, you had a $25 credit on there.

96
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,880
I just applied it to the bill.

97
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,360
No.

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,080
And Jason's face went white.

99
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,840
They can't do that without your permission.

100
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,960
Well, it apparently happens automatically at Landry's.

101
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,720
Just like all the City Walk happy hours immediately

102
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,240
shut down at 6 o'clock because the computers make it do that.

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,440
His father worked hard year after year for those points.

104
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,560
And then he just took them out from under him.

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,760
They would have been worth more if you had saved them.

106
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,440
Yeah.

107
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,240
So what a nice way to give back to your father.

108
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,680
That's the millennial version of buying your parents a home

109
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,240
is paying them restaurant points.

110
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,760
Sure.

111
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,280
Yeah, that's the best we can do.

112
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,720
At the T-Rex restaurant, were the dinosaurs cool at least?

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,080
Did they have?

114
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,600
No?

115
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,120
OK.

116
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,040
In my opinion, a mediocre dinosaur animatronic

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,720
looks much better than a mediocre elephant animatronic

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,800
because I've never seen a dinosaur.

119
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,960
So to me, I'm like, oh, yeah, sure.

120
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,080
That's what it looks like.

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
So your recommendation is just go for the drinks at T-Rex,

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
maybe not the meal.

123
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,800
No, because then you're just in the bar section.

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
You want to be sitting among the dinosaurs.

125
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,880
Or maybe the ice caves, which is also a section.

126
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,520
That's cool.

127
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,800
My experience was always stick to the apps

128
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,480
because the entrees were never that great.

129
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,040
The apps were usually reliable.

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
Yeah, you can get like three apps

131
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
and share them with your one other friend,

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,800
and then you're good.

133
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
Perfect.

134
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,880
When Dick Van Dyke was in the parade at Disneyland

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,920
and I went down alone, to validate parking,

136
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,320
I got a cheeseburger to go at the bar.

137
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
At Rainforest Cafe.

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
At Rainforest Cafe at Downtown Disney.

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
I didn't know they offered to go.

140
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,680
That seems counter to their entire mission statement

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,280
of providing a rainforest experience.

142
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah, it doesn't make sense because why would you

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
go if you're not going to get to enjoy the sights?

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
No, certainly not for the food.

145
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,200
I ate the food on the five,

146
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,760
and it was maybe the worst cheeseburger I ever had

147
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,600
or had had in 10 years maybe.

148
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,640
How it was so bad.

149
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,280
No, you could even get like a French onion soup

150
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,000
and be like, oh, this is a bad French onion soup.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,720
I didn't know there was such a thing.

152
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,520
Right, they can screw up the easiest dish,

153
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
the most idiot proof dish.

154
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Bad bread.

155
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,320
My friends Tyler and Kia, listeners to the show,

156
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
just went to Disney World for the first time together

157
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
and their trip report that I got from them,

158
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,960
they brought up the T-Rex Cafe, which they went into,

159
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,440
smelled the smell, and turned around immediately.

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,760
I might be misquoting them,

161
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,120
but I believe what they said was that it smelled

162
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,680
like airplane Salisbury steak

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,560
and 100 children all at once.

164
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
That's fair.

165
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,320
You get your food and it's lukewarm,

166
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,240
but you waited 40 minutes for it.

167
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,160
It's like that vibe.

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Where food lands when it's not fresh.

170
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,200
You're looking at T-Rex.

171
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,520
You're looking at an Iguanodon.

172
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,320
Which they got to do all of that stuff.

173
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,280
So if that's what you're going, so maybe my,

174
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,400
I haven't been there myself,

175
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,040
but maybe my T-Rex Cafe tip is walk in, walk out immediately.

176
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,360
But then you don't see all the dinosaurs.

177
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,320
But maybe you go in, pretend that you're looking

178
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
for a family.

179
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,040
A family where you drop something.

180
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
My mistake, they're not eating at the place

181
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,120
with the dinosaurs.

182
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,360
I don't know how they communicated that wrong.

183
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,320
I'm sorry, they appear to be in the hot air balloon.

184
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Well, as you were.

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
Well, I don't know if you guys are Rainforest Cafe fans,

186
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,880
but they have a jungle storm that makes all the animals

187
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,360
go crazy every half hour or so.

188
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,800
At T-Rex, it's a little darker.

189
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,920
It's a meteor shower.

190
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,000
So all the dinosaurs start screaming for their lives

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,520
and you see little meteors on the ceiling.

192
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,360
It's great.

193
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,840
I mean, so they're reliving the extinction over and over

194
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,680
again?

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,500
Yeah, they're caught in a loop.

196
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,360
Oh my God, that's a hell for them.

197
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,600
It's the restaurant at the end of the Cretaceous period.

198
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Some future race will be doing that with us

199
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,120
at the Human Cafe.

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
Oh yeah.

201
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,920
They'll be fondly recalling our extinction.

202
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
The animatronics of Abraham Lincoln,

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,080
they don't understand how time works.

204
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
They think Abraham Lincoln was next to Genghis Khan,

205
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,400
was next to Christian Bale.

206
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
When the asteroids start falling, he goes,

207
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,720
four score and seven years ago.

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,480
And everyone just says their thing.

209
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,840
Everyone's famous phrase were their dying words

210
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,080
in the meteor shower.

211
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,640
Aerosmith is there.

212
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,300
They only know what they've gleaned from the parks

213
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,680
as far as his significance in history.

214
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,440
Nixon was the base player of Aerosmith.

215
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,680
Heavily stylized Tim Allen is there.

216
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,080
It does feel like they could, like how Pleasure Island

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,120
was like, you can ring in the new year every night.

218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,360
This should be called the Extinction Restaurant

219
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
and you can relive it.

220
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
I thought you were gonna say all of downtown Disney

221
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,440
should be the end of the world every night,

222
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,280
which would be great.

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,040
Honestly, that's not a bad idea either.

224
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,320
It's even better than New Year.

225
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,800
I think there's at least two,

226
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
two Quarry Doctorow sci-fi novels that take place,

227
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
like end of the world in the theme parks.

228
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,520
Okay.

229
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,280
Yeah, I feel like that is a real,

230
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,120
I read his one book, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom,

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,720
about people competing whether to plus up

232
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
or keep the haunted mansion as it is

233
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,200
a thousand years in the future or something.

234
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,040
Really?

235
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,880
Yeah, this is real.

236
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,360
That's some nerve shit. And you can read it for free

237
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,280
under creative comments license

238
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,200
because he puts out all this stuff for free.

239
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm just talking about a Joe Roady supervised experience

240
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,440
where we get to live the end of the world

241
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,800
over and over and over again.

242
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
That's what I'm looking for that would tie into C.

243
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,440
But it's sanitized, it's not like,

244
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,320
because in a real end of the world scenario,

245
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,800
people are robbing each other and hurting each other.

246
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,120
And this one, it brings people closer.

247
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,880
The improv actors are weeping and hugging each other

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,120
at the end of the night.

249
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
It might be like a-

250
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,200
The old women tucking their kids in like a Titanic.

251
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,360
They're all wearing different religious garbs

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,440
to demonstrate that they've come

253
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,680
from different walks of life,

254
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
but now they're brought together by this tragedy.

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
Oh yeah.

256
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,600
It would probably be cathartic, honestly.

257
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,480
Yeah, and the whole audience is just drunk off their minds.

258
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,760
They're like, yeah.

259
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,680
And then you get out and you're like, I'm alive.

260
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,640
And now I have the rest of my life in front of me.

261
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,320
All the bachelorette parties there are living it up.

262
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,600
And then they all feel good about getting married

263
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,240
and they're like, you know what, it's great.

264
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,400
Ryan's a great guy.

265
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
And they're like, everything's gonna be fine.

266
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
The perspective from that fake apocalypse

267
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
really taught me something.

268
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,280
Yeah, I mean, this is really a good-

269
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,880
The motto of T-Rex Cafe is Ryan is a great guy.

270
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,760
I mean, I guess you can tie that all together, yes?

271
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,600
Yeah.

272
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,600
So we're gonna talk eventually about Innoventions

273
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
if we have to, I guess.

274
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,360
Yeah.

275
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,200
Oh, let's get into it.

276
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,280
Let's talk Innoventions.

277
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,600
Let's just get right to it.

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,120
We all are just chomping at the bit.

279
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
Thrumping like T-Rexes.

280
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,480
Talking about it, everyone is.

281
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,880
I, like, if you're listening to this,

282
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,440
you probably know what Innoventions is,

283
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,840
but just the primer, you go into Epcot Center

284
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,160
before you get to, well, just past, I guess,

285
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
Spaceship Earth.

286
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,240
You go left or you go right, and either way,

287
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,920
there's Innoventions waiting for you,

288
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,560
and it's where you go experience all the products

289
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,200
that are coming down the pike.

290
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,200
And in Disneyland, it was the thing in the Circle Theater

291
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,240
that now is where you go meet Kylo Ren or whatever.

292
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
And I'm gonna be totally honest with you,

293
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,080
I didn't realize until I started researching this

294
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
that it had closed, that we don't consider

295
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,960
what's there now, Innoventions.

296
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,360
No, they took the sign down.

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
It's gone. Okay.

298
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
I didn't know that.

299
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,840
It has apparently been renamed at some point

300
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,280
the Tomorrowland Expo Center.

301
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,120
Yes. Didn't know that.

302
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,680
With Star Wars Launch Bay on the bottom.

303
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,480
As many names you can give any building.

304
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,080
As many names.

305
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,400
And shut down attractions without making it clear to me,

306
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,520
a theme park nerd podcast host, that it was closed at all.

307
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, kind of like the wonders of life

308
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,340
being called the Festival Center,

309
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,720
it's always a great sign when a building is named

310
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,720
a building first and then what's in it second.

311
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,120
You know you're gonna get a great attraction.

312
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,560
Like if Splash Mountain was in Pavilion Building West,

313
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,440
presents Splash Mountain, you'd be like, hmm, okay.

314
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
Featuring Splash Mountain,

315
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,480
presented by Fidelity Insurance.

316
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,200
Yeah.

317
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,280
I feel like we're getting a little ahead of ourselves

318
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,200
and if, because first off, we need to explain that

319
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Innoventions is the combination of inventions and innovation.

320
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
Yeah.

321
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,640
Yeah.

322
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
A robot told me that.

323
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,400
A robot told me his name was Michael Eisner,

324
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,620
he was the head of the company.

325
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,140
Look, you could see a whole making of,

326
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,140
preview of Innoventions in Epcot from like 94, 93.

327
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,680
That we, do you guys both watch this?

328
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
Jenny, have you ever seen this before?

329
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
No, I haven't seen that.

330
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,240
It's on YouTube and it is really something.

331
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,080
Oh my God.

332
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Everyone who speaks in it

333
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,800
seems like they're doing so at gunpoint.

334
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,000
Every vice president of marketing,

335
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
every senior vice president of executive outreach.

336
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,520
It is just dull person after dull person.

337
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,320
And which I guess, I don't know, like what happened?

338
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,480
Why did Michael Eisner think this was a good idea?

339
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,960
I think his idea was, we've gotta pimp up.

340
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,400
Either Epcot or New Tomorrowland.

341
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,680
We have that whole building and we ran out of money.

342
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,120
What can we do not only for free, but for negative dollars?

343
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
Where we will pay us to put things in our park.

344
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,160
So I think that was the driving innovation behind it.

345
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,840
Real innovation.

346
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,720
I mean, what was there before was called CommuniCorps.

347
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,520
And it was about communication stuff.

348
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,920
I don't understand the Epcot logic.

349
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,720
I understand the Disneyland logic where they had a building

350
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
and they had emptied out.

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
But at Epcot, why get rid of CommuniCorps?

352
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,920
Yeah, CommuniCorps looked, I watched the Bright Sun films

353
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,880
like walk through about CommuniCorps.

354
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,000
And the little smart one robot.

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,360
Love smart one to little robot.

356
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
Smart one, yeah.

357
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Smarty, smarty one.

358
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,840
They had, they seemed to start something called

359
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,480
the Person of the Century award

360
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,440
that I'm not sure if they ever finished it.

361
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,000
Like around 1990, CommuniCorps was where you could go

362
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,080
to vote for Person of the Century.

363
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,040
I don't know where or how or any details.

364
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,840
We'll get to it in the CommuniCorps episode.

365
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,040
But I don't know, I don't think they settled it.

366
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Because by 2000, it had long been in interventions.

367
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,400
And interventions no longer cared

368
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,240
who was the person of the century.

369
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,880
Maybe they just mailed a plaque to whoever won by that point.

370
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,680
They tallied up the existing votes.

371
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,400
They were like, okay.

372
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
A couple of coupons.

373
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,240
Marie Callender's gift certificate.

374
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,600
They had a contractual obligation to announce a winner.

375
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,480
They just had to put it in like a local newspaper

376
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,280
in a bottom corner.

377
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,240
Technically it was published.

378
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,080
No, no, no.

379
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,920
It's in the Sentinel.

380
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,080
It's in the Orlando Sentinel.

381
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,920
Yeah.

382
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,160
But you could, and there was a census.

383
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,960
There was a constantly updating census thing

384
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,840
of how many people lived in the country.

385
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,080
There was also, this looked really cool.

386
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,160
You could look into the behind the scenes room

387
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,600
with all the computers that controlled Epcot.

388
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,880
Ooh.

389
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,360
I think CommuniCorps was also where you had to go

390
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,760
to make lunch and dinner reservations.

391
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,600
You would pick up a phone there.

392
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,440
Wow.

393
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,280
I didn't know that.

394
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,120
I forget.

395
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,080
That's a whole thing.

396
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,520
I gotta look more into that.

397
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,880
When that was a novel,

398
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
I guess phone reservations weren't novel.

399
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,200
But there was something,

400
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,000
or was it like a computer touch screen or something?

401
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,360
I think it was kind of, yeah.

402
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,480
It was combining Future World and World Showcase.

403
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,560
Even though it is a dated concept now,

404
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,280
it would feel more futuristic

405
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,320
if you were told, proceed to the CommuniCorps

406
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,240
to book your dining reservation.

407
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,960
Even though you have to walk there,

408
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,360
it would feel more high tech.

409
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,200
Yeah.

410
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,400
And the aesthetic has aged a lot better.

411
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,280
The CommuniCorps aesthetic looks a lot better

412
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
than any of the Innoventions stuff.

413
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,120
Innoventions, I only got to go once

414
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,000
before they got rid of the rest of it.

415
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,640
It was already mostly gone.

416
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,160
But it looked very today.

417
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,440
I didn't even realize initially

418
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,200
that I was in Innoventions.

419
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,040
Oh.

420
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,880
You at Disneyland are speaking specifically?

421
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,720
No, at Epcot.

422
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,560
Oh, at Epcot.

423
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,440
Yeah, it was just a lot of modern stuff.

424
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,960
And I did experience two things that are now gone

425
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,520
also, so I'm glad I got to see

426
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,080
these Yesterworld attractions.

427
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,480
But I went on three things actually.

428
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,760
One of them was an experience

429
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,800
about how to tornado proof your home.

430
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,080
Yes, that was a weather simulator.

431
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,520
Yeah, but it was like a game show.

432
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,480
You would vote for which one you wanted to win

433
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,200
that you thought would withstand the storm.

434
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,040
Yeah.

435
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,480
We were only with two other families,

436
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,840
so we were trying to throw the vote

437
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,720
and make the house vulnerable.

438
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,560
And it worked.

439
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,120
We got to see the roof lift off, the simulation.

440
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,960
Oh, wow.

441
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,800
Wow.

442
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,800
And then we did something called Fitness Heroes

443
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
that I think was Marvel themed.

444
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,880
It might not have been.

445
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,440
And it was like a Kinect game.

446
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,480
And you had to do different exercise moves

447
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,680
to save a city from, I wanna save pollution.

448
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
Exercise moves?

449
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,960
And there was one other child in the room.

450
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,200
Just one very small child, their parents,

451
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,480
and me and my friend.

452
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,640
So that was good energy.

453
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,080
What did the competition consist of exactly?

454
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,760
You were just in place punching and raising your arms

455
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
and things or doing kicks.

456
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,640
And then it would detect that you were doing that

457
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,200
with PlayStation Connect type technology.

458
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,240
And then you would see a bar going, it's working.

459
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,200
And then you'd save the city.

460
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,240
And they would come in and they'd teach you some chants

461
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,280
about fitness and be like, no, you're all Fitness Heroes.

462
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,520
And the third thing was an actual good thing.

463
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,000
And it was called the Sum of All Thrills.

464
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,600
And it's where you programmed your own roller coaster.

465
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,560
And they would try to give you a physics lesson

466
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,560
about how not to build a dangerous roller coaster.

467
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,520
And we did the opposite of all their advice

468
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,200
because we wanted a thrilling simulation.

469
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,280
And it gives you a number score at the end

470
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,400
of how your simulation came out, a thrill level.

471
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,640
And I told it to the person that was putting our result

472
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,560
in the machine and they said, oh, that's 10 points away

473
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,360
from breaking the simulation.

474
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,120
We named it a wild snake and it was a masterpiece.

475
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,360
It was wild.

476
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,440
Was it fun to go on the simulation though?

477
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,280
It was.

478
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
And they would tell you as they're telling you

479
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
how to design your roller coaster,

480
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,280
they have a green zone of like,

481
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,840
don't make your hill steeper than this if you can.

482
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,160
And so we'd put it all the way up and they'd be like,

483
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,760
don't make your loop a perfect circle

484
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,600
because it's bad for the human body.

485
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Like the inertia from it is dangerous.

486
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,800
So we just made it as round as possible.

487
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,640
It's good.

488
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,560
It's not a real coaster.

489
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
It's gonna be fine.

490
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
Yeah.

491
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Okay, so this is very, that closed a few years ago.

492
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,680
And it was one of the newer things to open.

493
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,480
I have all the Sum of All Thrills stuff.

494
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
But I tried, okay.

495
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
So Sum of All Thrills, when I was there in 2014,

496
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,640
I tried to go on it.

497
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,000
I was very surprised.

498
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,880
I didn't really know it was there.

499
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,240
And I was like, this actually looks cool

500
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,560
because you've designed the coaster

501
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,400
and then you ride the coaster.

502
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,240
It was great.

503
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,080
The line was really long.

504
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,480
Yes, the line is really long

505
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,880
because there was only two capsules on

506
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,720
and they were on KUKA arms.

507
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,560
It takes forever to load you in

508
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,320
and strap you in and make it safe.

509
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes.

510
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah.

511
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,160
And it's only like two people per vehicle.

512
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,160
So yeah, when it had a weight, it was very long weight.

513
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,320
So I watched a video of the ride through.

514
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
And so here's the thing I didn't know

515
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
about the Sum of All Thrills.

516
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,440
I knew it had a long weight

517
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,520
because it didn't have very high per hour capacity.

518
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,440
Very quickly, you learned that the sponsor

519
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,680
of this attraction is Raytheon, the weapons company.

520
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,080
The company who makes-

521
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,920
Are you serious?

522
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,760
Yes.

523
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,240
And they say it in, they say like, the line is,

524
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,160
this is part of Raytheon's commitment

525
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,000
to help inspire a new generation

526
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,120
of technologists and innovators.

527
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,960
Oh no.

528
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,760
So it's all about STEM and mathematics, but is,

529
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,080
and I've made this joke on the show before

530
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,880
and I've heard it on other, of like, yeah,

531
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,280
it's sponsored by like North Rep Gunnum or Raytheon,

532
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,800
these companies that make missiles.

533
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,640
But I didn't know this actually happened.

534
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,480
This was sponsored by Raytheon as a way to like, also like,

535
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,800
and it's about STEM.

536
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,360
I think, I'm sure they got a massive tax write-off

537
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
or something for it because it's about-

538
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,240
Because it's for teaching children.

539
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,480
Because it's about teaching children.

540
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,320
It's a service.

541
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,120
And like, you can do this too.

542
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,760
And maybe one day you can work for Raytheon,

543
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,080
the missile company.

544
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,640
And like, maybe this is naive,

545
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,720
but it can't have cost that much as an attraction.

546
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,840
It didn't take up a lot of space.

547
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,480
They had to buy the two KUKA arms, but that's it.

548
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,960
Which KUKA arms are not made by,

549
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,720
they're made by the KUKA company,

550
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,240
KUKA Rebatter GmbH of Germany.

551
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,240
But yeah, Raytheon also most recently mentioned

552
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,000
when Donald Trump launched a bunch of missiles

553
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,840
at an empty Syrian airfield,

554
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,280
those were shown to be Raytheon missiles.

555
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,400
They came out of the good press

556
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,880
of still having their ride-in interventions in that case.

557
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,760
It's a shame they closed it before that.

558
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,720
Yeah, if you could program the arm to swing you around

559
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,240
to set the exact trajectory of the missiles

560
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
on the bottom of the warehouse.

561
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
That should have been the third option,

562
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,520
because you could choose coaster or plane

563
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,320
before you designed your thing.

564
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
They should have had missiles as a third one.

565
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,320
Drone.

566
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
Is that the same,

567
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,440
was it different than the Disney Quest

568
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,400
build your own coaster?

569
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,600
Yes, so that was called Cyberspace Mountain,

570
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,920
and that was just a thing.

571
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,160
But CommuniCorps also had a design your own coaster.

572
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
So there was a history of design your own coaster

573
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,080
in this space, and that was very wire-framy.

574
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,400
That looked cool, you only had a few selections.

575
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,240
It kind of looked like,

576
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,960
have you ever played the Tron video game?

577
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,720
Or like the old, old arcade one,

578
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,040
or the Empire Strikes Back old arcade game

579
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,560
when it was very like, oh cool, it's in 3D,

580
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,720
but everything is wire-framed.

581
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,680
Sure, sort of the virtual boy a little bit too.

582
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,480
Oh yeah, yeah, wire-framing.

583
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,840
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,440
So yeah, some of all thrills lasted from 2009 to 2016.

585
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,960
Wow.

586
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,880
The entire Obama administration.

587
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,920
Pretty much.

588
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,280
You could go to Disney World

589
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,680
and watch a weapons company demonstration.

590
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,800
We have been sponsored in company.

591
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,040
Luckily there was no tie-in comic

592
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,640
like there was with Exxon,

593
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,840
where Mickey and Donald and Goofy were,

594
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,280
like Mickey was telling them about how good the company is.

595
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,760
This is the Patreon too,

596
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,800
it's much more tactically advanced than the Patreon,

597
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
not Patreon, Patriot.

598
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,640
Patriot missiles.

599
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,880
Jason is our Patreon always on the brain.

600
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,880
They make the Patriot missile system.

601
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,960
I see.

602
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,040
Gorsh, who makes the drones, Nick?

603
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,400
Yeah, so they were gone,

604
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,920
and the last two holding on clients,

605
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,120
Innovations West closed in 2015,

606
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,200
and is mostly the Epcot character spot now.

607
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,040
Oh, that's where you, yeah, my friends are just there

608
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,440
and they said that's where you meet Bigger Asick.

609
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,880
That's where I met Minnie.

610
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
That's where I met Minnie.

611
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,800
I mean, ran into Minnie again.

612
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,640
Wow.

613
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,040
It was very fresh.

614
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,360
Minnie, yeah, well, every Minnie in Orlando kisses me.

615
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,440
And the performer inside the suit makes a mwah noise

616
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,240
when they press their big snout up

617
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,720
against the side of my face.

618
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,720
But what I, I think next time you get kissed by Minnie,

619
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,480
and it will be soon,

620
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,680
you need to survey the next 10 men in line

621
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,600
and ask if that happened to them too.

622
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,440
Okay.

623
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,960
Because if they didn't get a smooch,

624
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,040
then you know it's a thing.

625
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Then I know it's a thing.

626
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, it's a good point.

627
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,080
I did, we were at Disneyland like a week ago,

628
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,720
and Minnie walked by and she was on her way somewhere.

629
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,560
So she was busy, but she just waved at me, so she didn't.

630
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,040
I have like a couple pictures of it,

631
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,880
and they're great photos,

632
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,680
but she was clearly trying to get somewhere

633
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,360
and didn't need, she didn't have time to stop.

634
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,040
But you also, you have no idea,

635
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,640
you were far away from her,

636
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,720
not within the range where you could have heard

637
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,800
the smooch sound.

638
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
So you're very welcome to get one.

639
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,920
She blew me a kiss.

640
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
Oh, I see.

641
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,680
I was so impressed.

642
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,080
I met Goofy a couple weeks ago,

643
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,520
and I know they sometimes make kissing sounds,

644
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,040
they can't vocalize,

645
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,280
but this Goofy was making like guttural Goofy voice noises.

646
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,440
Like he would nod his head and go like,

647
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,760
ooh, ooh, ooh, like a Goofy voice.

648
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,360
And it sounded on the money,

649
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,880
and I was just like, this is incredible,

650
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,320
but it also was weird because they weren't words.

651
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,200
They were just like weird guttural vocalizations

652
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,600
that Goofy would make.

653
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
And you know that Goofy can speak.

654
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Goofy is not a minion.

655
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,160
They don't like him to speak when he's in Disneyland.

656
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh yes, sure, sure.

657
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
They don't know what he'll say.

658
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,040
Right.

659
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,320
He's not allowed to speak on behalf of the company.

660
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,360
It's a legality concern.

661
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
He'll talk about drones or something.

662
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,840
Yeah.

663
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,680
I think he might start expressing his political opinion.

664
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,800
Do like a Tim Allen or a James Wood.

665
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
They don't need that.

666
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,480
Yeah.

667
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,840
Don't drink the tap water.

668
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,880
There's fluoride in it, gush.

669
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah.

670
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
Where was Goofy talking?

671
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,800
Which part of the Disneyland?

672
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,120
It was Goofy's kitchen.

673
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
My family was visiting.

674
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,320
I had not visited Goofy's kitchen in probably like years.

675
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,560
In the Disneyland hotel?

676
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,960
Maybe they put their A Goofy at Goofy's kitchen.

677
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,200
Yeah, the one at the Disneyland hotel

678
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,000
in the little festival center.

679
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
That's a good question.

680
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,680
Convention center, I guess.

681
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,200
That's actually a good question

682
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
because you worked at Disneyland very famously.

683
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,680
Yes.

684
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,640
And I wanted to let people that knew that

685
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,880
feel like they knew it already,

686
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,280
but then let the new listeners know.

687
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,120
As if no one knows.

688
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,520
So famously seemed like it made the most sense to me.

689
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,560
Were there, was there a hierarchy of Disney performance?

690
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,880
Have we talked about this ever?

691
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,400
Was there an A Goofy, A Mickey,

692
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,680
and they would be brought out at the...

693
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,720
I feel like I didn't interact enough with characters.

694
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,200
There actually was kind of a rivalry

695
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,480
between guest relations and characters.

696
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,000
I think because they were the two departments

697
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
with the biggest egos.

698
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
So the characters want to be like,

699
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,120
everyone knows we have the coolest job

700
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,480
and then guest relations is the same way.

701
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,800
So if you would ever interact with characters department,

702
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,440
there would be kind of a tension there.

703
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,520
But I think with characters,

704
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
the main hierarchy was like face characters

705
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,240
versus fur characters.

706
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,200
So like the princesses versus Mickey and friends.

707
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,680
Faces be furs.

708
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,440
Yeah, so I think that's the main hierarchy.

709
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,840
But I do know that people would get scheduled more often

710
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,880
based on their performance.

711
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,280
Like there were princesses who were not there all the time.

712
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,520
And there were princesses who were always in the parades,

713
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,640
always doing everything.

714
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,760
Some would never get approved for parades.

715
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,920
So I would imagine there was some ego going on there.

716
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,640
But I don't know, with the fur characters,

717
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,120
I always felt like they were the chill ones.

718
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,520
Like I feel like the face characters are like the LA people

719
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,160
and the fur characters are the theater kids,

720
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,560
if that makes sense.

721
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
I get what you're saying.

722
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,080
Yeah, personality wise.

723
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,040
So I feel like maybe within the fur characters,

724
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,440
there's less rivalry.

725
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,880
They're all just there to have a good time.

726
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,720
Okay, interesting.

727
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,880
There's kind of a union.

728
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,440
They're more like good old boys.

729
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,520
Yeah, sure.

730
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

731
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,480
They don't have the egos from like the improv skills.

732
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,960
Although there's physical improv skills, certainly.

733
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,240
There's been many great improv moments.

734
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,200
I feel like when Robin Hood,

735
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,160
I had his target on my shirt, remember that?

736
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,760
And Robin Hood like pointed right at it

737
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,280
and they did a whole bit.

738
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,040
He shot an arrow into your chest.

739
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,840
Yeah, that was the bit they were pretending to kill me.

740
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,280
Yeah, good.

741
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,120
It was great.

742
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,440
They loved that.

743
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,280
And when Minnie improvised reaching down your pants.

744
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,120
Sure.

745
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,960
Oh, nice.

746
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
In front of all those children, yes.

747
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,360
Inappropriate, Minnie.

748
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,920
I actually do wonder also like who,

749
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,520
when there's a high profile Mickey appearance,

750
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,320
like when here Mickey is gonna cut the ribbon

751
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,560
of Euro Disneyland or is gonna like.

752
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,000
Or the princesses who do the televised coronation events

753
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,480
and things, I think it goes by seniority.

754
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,720
And I think it definitely is something they think about

755
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,920
of like who they consider their best one.

756
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,880
Yeah, okay.

757
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
Oh, that's interesting, huh?

758
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,080
You see, you already.

759
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,400
Probably the ones that are signed off on the most areas.

760
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,560
Like for Mickey's and stuff,

761
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,320
you would want a Mickey that does phantasmic

762
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,040
because I feel like that's the hardest Mickey role.

763
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,680
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

764
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

765
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,960
Cause you're like, I was watching a video

766
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,120
that phantasmic mishaps that explain all of the like.

767
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,600
Right. Stop gap.

768
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,440
Like if, and the Mickey has to know

769
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,560
if this thing didn't happen,

770
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,400
you have like a backup procedure and choreography.

771
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,520
Yeah, and he has a lot of precise marks.

772
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,880
There's a lot to remember.

773
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,120
Okay, so maybe a phantasmic Mickey is the one you want.

774
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,560
Or the one signed off in the most areas at least.

775
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
I see, okay, okay.

776
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,960
Cause every different show or location,

777
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,560
well not location for meet and greets,

778
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,680
but every different parade and show and everything

779
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,840
are different sign-offs.

780
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,040
And I think some people just know all of them.

781
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,320
Hmm, hmm, wow.

782
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,520
The Mickey that's gonna help open Galaxy's Edge,

783
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,520
they're going to let the ravenous first people in line

784
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,360
eat him.

785
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,200
Yeah.

786
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,960
Eat him to try and pacify.

787
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,240
So now I can send their top Mickey in that case.

788
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,680
That'll be the Mickey that started last weekend.

789
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,120
Right. Maybe, maybe.

790
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,800
Wow, what an honor, out of the gate.

791
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,600
They actually hold separate auditions

792
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,520
to see who the most vulnerable one is.

793
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,600
Right, the most expendable Mickey.

794
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,440
This is the way I want to go.

795
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,400
But the crowds might know, the crowds might know,

796
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,240
and get angrier.

797
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,160
They know it's a lesser Mickey.

798
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,840
That they're feasting on.

799
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,960
There's gonna be, yeah, they're gonna,

800
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,200
they'll find a lot of reasons, I think,

801
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,840
to be angry that day.

802
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,680
Sure.

803
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
This is close.

804
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,520
That's what people are saying.

805
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,120
That's the prediction I've heard.

806
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,720
But like, like a, almost like.

807
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,040
Like to get in, to the land.

808
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,640
Yeah, but like, they'll let you walk around,

809
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,360
like they'll give you a ticket or a,

810
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,200
I guess not a bus.

811
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,040
I don't know.

812
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,880
Will they?

813
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,720
I think that would make sense.

814
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Who knows?

815
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,400
It would make sense.

816
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,160
I mean, that's what they've done with the Harry Potter's

817
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
on both coats, I think.

818
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
You essentially get a reservation ticket.

819
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,960
Will people then be scalping those,

820
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,840
and fighting for those?

821
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,000
They can't if it's attached to a ticket,

822
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,080
which is probably what they would do.

823
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,920
That's true.

824
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,880
Is they would attach it to the app,

825
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,320
or like a fast pass type thing.

826
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,360
So QRs will save this historic landmark.

827
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,480
QR codes will save this park from being destroyed.

828
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
I mean, my hot take, and I hate when people say

829
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,680
they should do this with every ride,

830
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,480
because with the infrastructure of the park,

831
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,200
it literally wouldn't work to have no one wait in any lines,

832
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,080
and everyone says, oh, they should make it all digital,

833
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,120
and not wait in any lines.

834
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,920
But I think with a newly built land,

835
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,040
it would be really good if they just had the lines be virtual,

836
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,000
and they can do that, because they can factor that

837
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,680
into capacity when they're building the land.

838
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh, but you couldn't retroactively take Snow White.

839
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,680
Because Disneyland's fire code is set to assume

840
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,200
that a lot of the people in the park

841
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,880
are going to be standing in the queues,

842
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,240
and inside the buildings.

843
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,680
So if they're all suddenly on Main Street, it's chaos.

844
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,280
Oh, okay.

845
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,120
Interesting.

846
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,000
We're getting fire code info.

847
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,840
Yeah, this is the stuff.

848
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,480
That's why the listeners tune in.

849
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,280
This is why you're one of the most requested guests

850
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,760
to come back, is you would bring the fire code stuff.

851
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,960
But if Star Wars land is new, it's new land,

852
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,400
so if anything, the capacity will increase slightly,

853
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,800
but they could just keep that in mind

854
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,960
of people not in the lines.

855
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
We should get back to inventions, but real quick,

856
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,760
how long would you be willing to wait, like, first week?

857
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,160
I mean, how long am I willing to wait for anything?

858
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
Sure.

859
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,820
Two hours.

860
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,660
Two hours, okay.

861
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,920
Yeah, I don't like lines.

862
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,080
I'm just too keenly aware of wasting my time.

863
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,920
Yeah.

864
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,000
Because this will be the longest wait

865
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,720
probably anyone ever has to face in their life.

866
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,960
I just, I don't know, and it's too easy also

867
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,040
when you're local to just think that you can come back,

868
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,400
even if you really wanna do it,

869
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,840
you're like, I should just come back.

870
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
I could be in my home right now.

871
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,560
I mean, also, I think if I had a friend

872
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,720
who I knew was willing to do a really long wait with me,

873
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,040
I would be more willing to,

874
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,080
but most of my friends hate lines

875
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,400
and also don't like theme parks as much as me,

876
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,640
so I'm sure I could not convince them to wait

877
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,520
in even a three-hour line with me,

878
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,480
and I'm not doing it by myself, so.

879
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
Right.

880
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,040
Yeah, so that's usually the deal breaker.

881
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,280
Like, when I go to D23,

882
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,800
I never go in the store line and stuff

883
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,440
because I'm always with someone who's only kind of into it

884
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,560
and I don't wanna be like, hey,

885
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,880
wanna stand in this taped-out queue for three hours

886
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,920
for only me to buy stuff?

887
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,240
Mike, are your ears burning super hard right now?

888
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,000
Well, I understand that a lot of folks feel that way,

889
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,480
and that's okay, but I think that Jason and I

890
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,240
are prepared to wait upwards of six, seven, eight.

891
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
Are you guys gonna camp out?

892
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,560
Because even getting in is a great deal.

893
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,600
I won't camp out.

894
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,440
I would much rather get.

895
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,480
Would you wait like a full work shift

896
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,800
to meet Bruce Springsteen that one?

897
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,240
I mean, that's a different situation.

898
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,560
It's a different situation, but like.

899
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,600
This is, we're not like meeting

900
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,920
the real General Hux or something, you know?

901
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,200
No, but I.

902
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,040
Would you wait a long time for that?

903
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,080
Mm, no.

904
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,520
But think about it, if they transported a character

905
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,720
from the realm of fiction into our reality,

906
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,160
that'd be something to meet. But not Hux.

907
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,960
That'd be a better.

908
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,800
No, that's where you'd struggle a lot.

909
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,520
Constable Zuvio, perhaps?

910
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,360
Perhaps.

911
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Max Rebo?

912
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,080
Oh, yeah.

913
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Hell yeah.

914
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,920
Anytime.

915
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,320
You got me finally.

916
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,680
Oh yeah, I'll wait eight hours for Max Rebo.

917
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,880
I mean, meeting a robot I can haggle with

918
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
is kind of like a celebrity to me,

919
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,600
and I wanna do that before they turn it off.

920
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,440
You're haggled.

921
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,960
Oh, same, with all the droids that wander around

922
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,160
and the interactive ones and stuff.

923
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,680
Yeah, all that stuff that's gonna go away after two weeks.

924
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,280
That's the thing, that's the pressure to go right away.

925
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,960
That's why we're going.

926
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,880
Because you know they're gonna stop that,

927
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,920
and the improv training and stuff,

928
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,760
that's all gonna go away.

929
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,600
Yes, my feeling is that the situation should be

930
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,280
as soon as we hear when the dates are going,

931
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,400
we book the cheapest hotel and walking distance,

932
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,800
and then maybe the play is not wait overnight,

933
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
but the play is get there at four in the morning

934
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,240
from the hotel.

935
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,320
I don't wanna say this, I mean,

936
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,960
now I'm literally saying it on a podcast,

937
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,720
I was gonna say I don't wanna say this to too many people.

938
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,560
Oh, we can edit it out.

939
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,400
But.

940
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,720
What just happened was,

941
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,440
we just cracked how to do it.

942
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Yeah, right.

943
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,040
And we did edit it out, and you haven't heard it,

944
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,240
and I'm sorry, we just can't.

945
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,080
Yeah, don't tell them.

946
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,920
Yeah, yeah.

947
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,760
Jenny honestly had the best,

948
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
because I've tried to crack this too,

949
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,920
but this is.

950
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
I have the best idea.

951
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,560
You have the best idea I've ever heard.

952
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,400
Okay, so.

953
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,200
Oh, all three of us are in, yeah, yeah, yeah.

954
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,560
That's a clue a little.

955
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Oh no, cut that out too.

956
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,400
Good, okay.

957
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,080
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cut that.

958
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,920
Or we bleep.

959
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,880
Just bleep, you'll be part of my, and then.

960
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,720
Yeah.

961
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,600
That's gonna set, like people will wonder,

962
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,720
what the fuck was that?

963
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,560
Yeah.

964
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,240
We cracked it.

965
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,480
We cracked it, we got it.

966
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
Yeah.

967
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,160
What's happening?

968
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
Wow, all right.

969
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,840
Okay, so back to intervention.

970
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,680
So let's jump back.

971
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
You must we.

972
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,000
In time to 1994.

973
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,840
Yeah.

974
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,480
So CommuniCorps is not cutting edge,

975
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,320
but in this opening special,

976
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,680
the pitch they're giving you is that,

977
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,680
this is Epcot 94, and like we need something new for Epcot 94,

978
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,720
but Disney's history is rooted in World's Fairs,

979
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,000
and they show all these footage of amazing inventions,

980
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,440
dynamic footage, first ever show,

981
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,560
World's Fairs from the Chicago World's Fair,

982
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,000
the Philadelphia World's Fair, the New York World's Fair,

983
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,960
of course they show the Carousel of Progress,

984
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,040
and they're like,

985
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,560
Innoventions is gonna be like a World's Fair,

986
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,760
right in Epcot, and it's always changing,

987
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,920
it's always updating.

988
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,240
It already was like a World's Fair.

989
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,000
It already was, Epcot itself is supposed to be a World's Fair,

990
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,240
so I don't, so.

991
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,560
And the Carousel of Progress wasn't like selling you

992
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,520
like humidifiers, like.

993
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,440
Yeah, they weren't selling you things

994
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,720
that were currently out, it was all speculative.

995
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,240
Yeah, you couldn't buy the VR machine,

996
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,560
but now we, so we need a place where we can actually

997
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
sell you the VR machine.

998
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,520
I think you could buy some of the GE products

999
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,040
you saw on stage. Yeah, they had at least one thing

1000
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,920
that was current, I think they had the current

1001
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,640
GE dishwasher or something.

1002
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,480
Yeah.

1003
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,200
Jason wanted to buy John's clothes.

1004
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,720
I wanted to buy John's fashionable sweater.

1005
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,360
But. Big roomy bathtub.

1006
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,120
I think it was more subtle, and that's what I got

1007
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,360
from the quick glimpse of trying to remember CommuniCorps

1008
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,480
was like the corporate sponsorship was either

1009
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
a little more subtle, of course if it's phones

1010
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,080
it's gonna be Bell or AT&T.

1011
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,920
It was either subtle or agnostic, there was no sponsor

1012
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,200
for the virtual roller coaster, whatever, what have you.

1013
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,720
But we're gonna change that.

1014
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,560
We're gonna change that.

1015
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,840
Use the negative money.

1016
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Also isn't part of the story maybe that Eisner

1017
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,120
went to the consumer electronics fair or expo

1018
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,240
or whatever, or CES is the thing.

1019
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,360
CES is the one in Vegas.

1020
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,080
And he thought, well this is so active and visual

1021
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,360
and vibrant and you look out at, I mean it's like Comic Con,

1022
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,200
like you look out at a room where it's a big mess,

1023
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,400
there's 20 big signs and mismatchy displays,

1024
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,520
but isn't it exciting and what if we could bring

1025
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,720
that vibe to the parks.

1026
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,360
And let me tell you this, I'm talking about this

1027
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,080
sarcastically now, but when I was a kid,

1028
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,680
because I think the second time I went to Disney World

1029
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,480
was, yeah, Inventions was new, I bought it hook, line

1030
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
and sinker, I thought Inventions was great

1031
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,880
and I spent a lot of time in there.

1032
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,480
Yeah, well I, whatever, however this was sold to me

1033
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,800
as a kid, I was excited for our next trip to Florida.

1034
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,680
And it is primarily the character that's on Jenny's socks.

1035
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,520
Oh, oh.

1036
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,040
Sonic the Hedgehog.

1037
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,000
Wait, was he there?

1038
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,720
He was featured prominently in the advertising.

1039
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,000
Now I was a kid who only had Nintendo systems,

1040
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,080
my friend down the street had Sonic, had Sega,

1041
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,760
but I was obsessed with Sonic.

1042
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,720
So what was his relation to the Inventions?

1043
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,720
So there was a massive Sega area of free games.

1044
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,080
So Sega Genesis, Sega 32X, Sega CD, Game Gear representative.

1045
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
Sega Pico.

1046
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,160
So you use the logo.

1047
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,160
It's a little educational Sega for kids.

1048
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,000
Oh yeah.

1049
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,840
Oh, that was a thing?

1050
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,680
Apparently.

1051
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,520
Oh yeah.

1052
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,360
It was at Inventions.

1053
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,200
Wow.

1054
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,040
I thought you wore those on purpose.

1055
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,480
I was like, oh, what a great nod to Inventions.

1056
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,880
I just have my Sonic socks.

1057
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,720
That's pretty good.

1058
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,640
So kids, me and my brother loved it

1059
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,680
because it was a massive free arcade.

1060
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,360
I mean, all the hotel arcades at the time were pretty big

1061
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,040
and we spent a lot of time there,

1062
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,360
but these games were pretty good.

1063
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,440
It was pretty big and we spent a lot of time there,

1064
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
but these games were all free to play.

1065
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,960
And yeah, we were in Nintendo house too.

1066
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,240
So Sonic, the X-Men game.

1067
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,080
Was the X-Men game there?

1068
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,680
That was one of the big Sega.

1069
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,040
The two X-Men games were huge launches for them.

1070
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,440
Was that the X-Men game where to beat it,

1071
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,400
you would have had to hit the reset button at the end?

1072
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,240
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1073
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,080
Maybe.

1074
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,040
Was that the Days of Future Past game?

1075
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,880
Just a little X-Men humor.

1076
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,720
Sure.

1077
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,080
I mean, I got it.

1078
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,680
I'm actually just trying to remember the storyline

1079
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,280
if they actually borrowed from it.

1080
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,840
I think it was something with Apocalypse though.

1081
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,960
And I think at the very end of the game,

1082
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,400
in order to win, you had to hit reset on the actual console.

1083
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,240
That's insane.

1084
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,600
Because people were so confused

1085
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,640
because that doesn't make any sense to do that.

1086
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,320
But that was the only way you could truly beat the game.

1087
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,760
That might have been the second one.

1088
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,600
Okay.

1089
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,840
But the first one came pretty early in Sega.

1090
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,880
Some listener will yell it at us on Twitter,

1091
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,720
which I'm talking about.

1092
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,200
The big deal was you could pick which X-Men you played as.

1093
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,040
Right.

1094
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,000
Out of how many?

1095
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,760
Out of all of them?

1096
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,600
Four or five.

1097
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,440
Okay.

1098
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,520
Because the other X-Men game that I played

1099
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,280
at the Grand Floridian when I was a kid

1100
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,600
was the side scrolling arcade version

1101
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,360
where you could play Dazzler, Cyclops,

1102
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,840
and they were all in their 80s outfits.

1103
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,000
It was based off the pilot.

1104
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,320
Based off the pilot that they released on VHS,

1105
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,880
but they never made more than one of.

1106
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,280
I think I have that one on my phone.

1107
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,720
It's crazy now I used to spend so many quarters

1108
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,560
and now I have it on my phone.

1109
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,480
But I beat the game.

1110
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,840
The machine was broken at the Grand Floridian.

1111
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,520
And I beat it with six other kids.

1112
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,240
And it's one of the most triumphant moments

1113
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,640
of my young life.

1114
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,200
Because the games would be like,

1115
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,040
you have to die constantly.

1116
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,400
It would be like the Simpsons arcade game or those other,

1117
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,720
there's similar type games like that.

1118
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,920
Where to ever get to the end,

1119
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,480
you were having to just spend $10.

1120
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,640
Just putting in quarter after quarter.

1121
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,080
Right, unless you were incredible at it.

1122
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,360
And then this one was just busted.

1123
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,000
So like five allies and I one day

1124
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
in the soda shop of the Grand Floridian,

1125
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,680
whatever it was, beat it.

1126
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,120
And that's another great theme park memory

1127
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,840
that was just unearthed.

1128
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,720
Okay, anyway.

1129
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,560
Oh wow, you like that you buried that away?

1130
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,720
I hadn't thought about it in a while,

1131
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,000
but I was like, oh yeah, I played it at Disney World.

1132
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Also, now that I'm thinking about it,

1133
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,280
a Ghostbusters arcade game that I never played

1134
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,880
anywhere else other than the basement of the contemporary.

1135
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,520
I never saw it in any Chuck E. Cheese

1136
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,360
and any other place.

1137
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,880
And we had a lot of arcades around where I grew up.

1138
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,040
But there was a side scrolling Ghostbusters game

1139
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,880
and I was my mind just, I lost my mind.

1140
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,720
Like, cause I never.

1141
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,040
I have a lot of time on these trips in arcades.

1142
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,080
I guess, I guess now that I'm thinking about it.

1143
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,440
Did you go to the Starcade too?

1144
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,720
No, I've never been to the Disneyland Starcade

1145
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,200
cause it was gone. I do remember the Starcade

1146
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,520
and it was very lame.

1147
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,360
Yeah, oh sure.

1148
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,200
I think it may have had,

1149
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,160
cause it used to be double deckered.

1150
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, it was two stories initially.

1151
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,840
The area that they just turned into

1152
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,000
the Space Mountain Line.

1153
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,840
Yeah.

1154
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,360
I think I have vague memories of that.

1155
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,880
I do remember seeing the upstairs

1156
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,600
and downstairs of the Starcade.

1157
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,440
Uh huh. Yeah.

1158
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,920
But never spending significant time there.

1159
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,280
Sure, I mean it doesn't make sense to do that.

1160
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,120
I mean, I guess these were all,

1161
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,040
this was all after hours and I was little.

1162
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,640
So we were in a hotel. Yeah, that's true.

1163
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,960
It's like, what else are you going to do?

1164
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,040
Right, cause we weren't there til midnight.

1165
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,640
Most, only one park usually stays open late.

1166
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,040
I don't even remember if they did that 25 years ago.

1167
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,520
It depends on your parents willingness

1168
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,120
to stay until closing too.

1169
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,960
Yeah.

1170
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,800
Like they tire out more.

1171
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,480
Cause I feel like kids, they weigh a lot less

1172
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,240
so their legs don't get as tired.

1173
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,480
And they also get carried for a lot of the day.

1174
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,320
Yes.

1175
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,720
So usually it's the parents that need to call it.

1176
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,200
Yeah, kids aren't waking up to golf at five a.m.

1177
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,960
like my dad always was.

1178
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,920
On the Disney World trips?

1179
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,760
Yeah, yeah.

1180
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,000
I don't think I ever would have been to Disney World

1181
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,440
as a kid if there wasn't golf.

1182
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,280
That was a sell-out.

1183
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,400
I think it was a legitimately great golf resort.

1184
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,760
Did you really shout it out the golf?

1185
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,120
We gotta do an episode of the golf.

1186
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,960
Yeah.

1187
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,600
Would your dad do the episode on the golf?

1188
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,720
I've, I have thought about proposing that.

1189
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,160
It maybe is a can of worms, but,

1190
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,280
and it may be as a ticket to now on the 14th,

1191
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
you get kind of like, you know,

1192
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,920
it kind of bends off to the right there.

1193
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,760
Maybe a Patreon.

1194
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,400
But that's, I have, this thought has occurred to me.

1195
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,680
I've questioned, but now that we've said it out loud,

1196
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,440
unless we edit this out too,

1197
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,320
but I have thought about proposing that

1198
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,160
and maybe now we have to do it.

1199
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,040
Is that the Shades of Green resort now?

1200
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,360
That was one of the golf things.

1201
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,600
Shades of Green, yeah, that's,

1202
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
I forget how that's affiliated with,

1203
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,040
that was the Disney Inn before.

1204
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,080
Oh, the Disney, Shades of Green is now exclusively

1205
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,160
for military families.

1206
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,440
And it's supposed to be very nice accommodations,

1207
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,040
you know, lower prices for everyone.

1208
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,760
And you're right next to the Magic Kingdom.

1209
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,800
It is right next to the Polynesian.

1210
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,640
Oh, right.

1211
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,400
Well, and we can, and mainly,

1212
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,200
if you don't know about the Disney World Golf,

1213
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,920
there is a sand trap that is Mickey ears.

1214
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,160
So, get ready to hear about that for an hour and a half.

1215
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, oh, oh.

1216
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,640
Hi folks, it's Jason.

1217
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,680
And I just want to take a second to tell you about HelloFresh.

1218
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,440
HelloFresh is a meal kit delivery service that shops,

1219
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,920
plans, and delivers step-by-step recipes

1220
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,640
and pre-measured ingredients so you can just cook,

1221
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,120
eat, and enjoy.

1222
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,640
Each box is made up of fresh, responsibly obtained

1223
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,160
ingredients from carefully selected farms

1224
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,320
and high-rated, trusted sources.

1225
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Feel confident when cooking HelloFresh

1226
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,920

step-by-step instruction cards.

1228
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,040
And all the ingredients come pre-measured

1229
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,960
in handy labeled meal kits,

1230
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,920
so you know which ingredients go with which recipe.

1231
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Spend less time meal planning or grocery shopping each week

1232
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,760
and get that time back to do more of what you love.

1233
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,720
I recently cooked the Korean beef bimbab bowl

1234
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,480
with zucchini, mushrooms, and carrots,

1235
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,920
and it was really good.

1236
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,120
And I was happy I did it.

1237
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,960

Oh, oh, oh.

1245
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,680
My dad did one, I think he golfed once.

1246
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,720
But we were, did you golf with him or no?

1247
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,020
No, no, no, that was his free time

1248
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,860
where he didn't have to be at the theme parks.

1249
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,080
My dad did the same thing, I think.

1250
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,560
Once, I don't think it was every day.

1251
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,680
I think he did it once on like one of our trips.

1252
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,280
So maybe multiple trips.

1253
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,640
A golf at Disney Paris also.

1254
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,440
And I did take time while there

1255
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,360
to go to the Disney Paris pro shop.

1256
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,040
This was very locked in 1992

1257
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,320
when I bought Disney Paris golf balls

1258
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,080
that I proudly display at home.

1259
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,000
And so yeah, all right, get ready.

1260
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,320
Golf coming your way.

1261
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,760
We were a miniature golf family.

1262
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,600
Oh yeah, we played.

1263
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,240
But not really in Florida.

1264
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,920
We did enough of that at the Jersey Shore.

1265
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,000
We didn't need to do that on vacation vacation.

1266
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,680
Good mini golf courses down there though.

1267
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,080
And also this Pirates mini golf

1268
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,240
across the street from Disney World.

1269
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,080
Oh right.

1270
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,040
Whatever that center is, I forget.

1271
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,640
With the Perkins diner.

1272
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,360
Did you go there?

1273
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,440
No, I've done gator golfing out on International Drive.

1274
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,280
Oh.

1275
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,480
Which is pretty special.

1276
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,040
And then you get to see the man fight the alligators

1277
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,040
after you golf.

1278
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,880
What? Whoa.

1279
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,040
It's a separate ticket.

1280
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,160
He's like, if you want to see me wrestle the gators.

1281
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,680
And it was like late at night

1282
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,500
and there were maybe only like two other groups there.

1283
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,120
And it was an elaborate show

1284
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,920
that like culminated in him pretending

1285
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,280
to fall into the water and be in danger.

1286
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,120
And I was like, man, he got all his clothes wet just for us.

1287
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,880
Like I felt bad about it.

1288
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,120
Cause it was a really small audience.

1289
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,480
And then- Oh like he didn't get to perform for 30 people.

1290
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,320
Like was this really worth getting wet for?

1291
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,480
And there was a bar across the parking lot.

1292
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,160
My friend's dad, who's a local was visiting with us.

1293
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,360
And he was inebriated enough by that point

1294
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,880
that he's like, how much to let the girls in

1295
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,960
and see the gators?

1296
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,720
And the guy was like 10 bucks each.

1297
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,680
So we walked across a shaky plank

1298
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,480
and got to go near the gators and get pictures with them.

1299
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,320
It felt very like under the table and not safe.

1300
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,720
It seemed like that was negotiable, maybe the fee.

1301
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,040
I think it might've been, he could've haggled it down.

1302
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,320
It seemed like an attraction

1303
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,240
that was not a real thing that was offered.

1304
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,280
But just since the promise of more money was out there,

1305
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,360
he let us do it.

1306
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,560
It was like stripper tricks or whatever.

1307
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,040
Like, yeah, this can be bought.

1308
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,880
It's not written down on a menu anywhere.

1309
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,520
And he had a lot of gators, I guess they were all rescues.

1310
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,200
So he didn't have to feel guilty about it.

1311
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,560
So it's a good time.

1312
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,840
That's another, we haven't talked about golf

1313
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,400
and we haven't talked about weird I drive attraction.

1314
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,520
Yeah, I drive is depressing.

1315
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,840
Okay, sure.

1316
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,680
It's the Florida project.

1317
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,320
But since my friend and her dad were like locals,

1318
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,040
I think to them, it's like a nostalgic level of depressing.

1319
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,560
So through their eyes, I was enjoying it.

1320
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
But yeah, it's not,

1321
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,480
you kind of just want to stay on Disney property

1322
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,720
when you're in that area.

1323
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,680
Jenny, you mentioned Saratoga Springs Resort.

1324
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,520
Did you guys all know, I just learned this like last week,

1325
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,080
the tree house suites are still there.

1326
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,760
Yeah, I'd love to stay in those.

1327
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,720
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1328
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,640
The tree houses.

1329
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
You can see them on the river at certain hotels.

1330
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,600
You boat past them.

1331
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,280
Yeah, you can see it like Key West.

1332
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,400
We voted past them or something.

1333
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,560
Oh, I know what you're saying.

1334
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,000
But they were in all the promotional videos,

1335
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,520
like in the early 90s and stuff.

1336
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,360
They looked so cool.

1337
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,600
They looked so cool.

1338
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,600
And I guess now they are part of Saratoga Springs,

1339
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,080
but it is like you are almost staying like off the,

1340
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,720
as far off the grid within Disney property as you can get,

1341
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,840
because like you have to drive.

1342
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,760
There's a gate that closes

1343
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,840
and you have to use your room key to get to drive it.

1344
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,720
So you can't get like food delivered or anything.

1345
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,840
Wow.

1346
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,760
But like they restored them.

1347
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,120
They look really nice.

1348
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,240
But I just remember as a kid going like,

1349
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,960
God, I want to stay in those tree houses for a day.

1350
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,160
They're really cool.

1351
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,000
I don't know.

1352
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,520
I always feel like torn about the Disney hotels

1353
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,400
because there are so many really cool ones,

1354
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,480
but like for what they cost and how cool they are,

1355
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,880
you feel like you should be getting your money's worth

1356
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,400
by not leaving them.

1357
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,600
But then you want to leave them all day to be at the park.

1358
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,120
So it's like, how much is it worth it,

1359
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,240
staying at the really cool ones?

1360
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,520
Or should you just stay at a boring one that has more space?

1361
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,680
Oh, to like encourage you to get up and out.

1362
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,520
Yeah.

1363
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,760
Yeah, that's what, yeah, like Disney Paris,

1364
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,440
we maybe should have just sprung for one right there,

1365
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,240
but we stayed at just a Radisson that was the dullest,

1366
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,080
like let's get out of here ASAP.

1367
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,680
And you're kind of like, I'm not going to be at the hotel.

1368
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,360
And also my family's vacation club.

1369
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,960
So a lot of the vacation club rooms

1370
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,720
that are the actual like suites, like for more people,

1371
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,040
are at the most boring resorts.

1372
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,720
But usually the family vote outweighs the fact

1373
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,440
that we should like be in the spacious one

1374
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,080
instead of the cool one.

1375
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,080
Can I ask what your home resort is?

1376
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,200
Ah, it's a Lani, which I have no interest in going to.

1377
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,040
Really?

1378
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,880
Oh, interesting.

1379
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,800
I can't swim and I don't like the sun.

1380
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,000
So I don't see myself ever going to a Lani.

1381
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,840
Very fair.

1382
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,120
So we tried to ask if we could get a different home resort,

1383
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,960
but we couldn't.

1384
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
So we're thinking of trying to switch to a new one,

1385
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,000
like the train one or something.

1386
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,160
I think if you get more points,

1387
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,120
you can get an additional home resort.

1388
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,760
What is a home resort?

1389
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,600
I don't know about this.

1390
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,560
So that is where, like that is your base.

1391
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,400
Like that is where you have to.

1392
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,320
So the perk of it being your home resort

1393
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,200
is if you ever need a room there,

1394
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,360
they say that you can get a room there

1395
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,880
no matter when you're booking it.

1396
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,120
So like a Lani, if we wanted to try to book a room,

1397
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,240
like Christmas Eve and it's like the week before,

1398
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,920
I think in theory they have reserved rooms

1399
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,160
for people that are their home resort.

1400
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,280
And then they just, they give it to you?

1401
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,120
Will you?

1402
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,960
Or you choose it?

1403
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,800
You buy.

1404
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,400
No, it's just available for you to book.

1405
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah, it's available for you to book.

1406
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,880
And you have to like pick a home resort.

1407
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,720
Like some cost more than others.

1408
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,120
So your family picked it.

1409
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,920
It's, you don't get to pick.

1410
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,400
It's whenever you buy into the vacation club,

1411
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,680
it's usually whichever one they just built.

1412
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,920
And then they keep offering that one

1413
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,560
until they've run out of rooms

1414
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,040
for that to be someone's home resort.

1415
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,880
Interesting.

1416
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,440
And then they switched to whatever new,

1417
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,560
new one they're building.

1418
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,120
So I think in like next year,

1419
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,840
it's gonna be the train one.

1420
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,680
Yeah.

1421
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,640
Where is the train one?

1422
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,400
It's in Florida, but I kind of like it

1423
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,760
because it's train themed, which I'm all about.

1424
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,200
Sure, sure.

1425
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,040
Yeah.

1426
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,840
I tried to ask if they were ever going to have any

1427
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,520
for the Star Wars hotel and they were like,

1428
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,360
I don't think so.

1429
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,200
Yeah.

1430
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,600
It's gonna be like a cruise ship type package.

1431
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,440
So.

1432
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,280
Yeah.

1433
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,440
When we were in the nineties,

1434
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,800
we were at Old Key West was our home one.

1435
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,320
And that one's like, it's pretty good

1436
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,760
because at least it's huge rooms.

1437
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,600
Huge rooms.

1438
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,440
But it's very boring.

1439
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,760
That's the one my family usually likes to stay at.

1440
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,600
It's also really spread out.

1441
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,800
So it takes a while to like wait at a bus stop.

1442
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,600
Until they get to the bus and stuff.

1443
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,200
The next time I go, I'm just gonna Uber everywhere.

1444
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,040
Yes.

1445
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,200
I did it on my last trip and I was like,

1446
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,760
oh my God, I saved like six hours a day in my life.

1447
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,080
And now I can like park hop

1448
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,440
and it doesn't seem like a hassle.

1449
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,080
I was like, I'm never taking the buses again.

1450
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,680
It sounds easy and it sounds like a game changer.

1451
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,160
Yeah, and it's like $5 a ride

1452
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,840
because everything's like not that far.

1453
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,680
No.

1454
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,160
Yeah, we did that and it's great.

1455
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,520
And everyone's gonna catch on at a certain point.

1456
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,920
Maybe we should edit this part out too.

1457
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,760
Yeah, edit this.

1458
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,960
We can't be giving these tips away for free.

1459
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,920
No, I think some people are like,

1460
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,480
they have that forced frugality where they're like,

1461
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,640
you mean I can spend $5 or waste an hour?

1462
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,360
Well, I'm gonna take the free bus.

1463
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,480
And it's like, that's less than minimum wage

1464
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,560
if you're thinking about like the value of your time.

1465
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,400
I don't know, I don't get it.

1466
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,120
But I think especially like dads get in that mode

1467
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,680
where they're like, why would I pay extra

1468
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,480
when it can be free?

1469
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,160
Yeah, oh for sure.

1470
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,000
But yeah, there are certain times when like,

1471
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
you got two hours to get to Animal Kingdom

1472
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,880
because they're open a little later for the Avatar rides.

1473
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,880
Yeah, or you have like a food reservation

1474
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,600
and you didn't plan ahead.

1475
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,920
And especially if you're leaving a park

1476
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,160
that's like emptying out.

1477
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,000
Yeah.

1478
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,960
It's like, you can end up waiting like two hours

1479
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,040
to get a bus to your hotel.

1480
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,360
And then they don't always stop at your hotel first.

1481
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,400
It's a nightmare.

1482
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,000
It all depends.

1483
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,120
All right, interventions, right?

1484
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:38,960
Interventions.

1485
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,800
We gotta keep going back.

1486
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,240
I couldn't think of a segue back to it,

1487
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,840
but I forget that you could just say interventions.

1488
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,680
Yeah, that's the segue.

1489
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,160
Does anyone have fun anecdotes about interventions?

1490
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,240
Either coast.

1491
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,080
No.

1492
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,160
Uh, I as a child, I remember,

1493
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,960
so as a child I was like, oh yeah, this is Sonic's house.

1494
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,800
Sega.

1495
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,400
So I went in there.

1496
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,360
I was like so excited because all I saw,

1497
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,840
I didn't care about is new products.

1498
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,520
Yeah, no, because it would be like, I can play Sonic.

1499
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,440
And I think when I went, all the machines were taken.

1500
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,360
And then at a certain point,

1501
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,080
because this is also a phenomenon with arcades,

1502
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,280
I think as a kid is like waiting for older kids

1503
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,240
to stop playing the game.

1504
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,760
Cause the older kids are also a little bossier.

1505
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,720
And I was not very intimidating.

1506
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,240
I was not, I was not an assertive young man.

1507
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,360
So I think I just stood there for a while,

1508
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,320
maybe played for five minutes.

1509
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,120
And then my parents, I think were like,

1510
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,240
we should go on a ride.

1511
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,080
And that was it.

1512
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,400
I don't think I've done any other interventions.

1513
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,800
When I got to California, they had the house of tomorrow.

1514
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,640
Of course.

1515
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,800
And I was like, I'm not going to watch the presentation.

1516
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,640
I can't remember.

1517
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,200
I'm sure we bumped around there a little.

1518
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,120
You and I, I'm sure for a little bit,

1519
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,160
we played with the touch screens that were already

1520
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,400
way more outdated than the phones we had.

1521
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,960
Andurally weren't, maybe it was like first fourth

1522
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,520
or fourth generation iPhones.

1523
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,160
And you're like, our phones are way better

1524
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,480
than these touch screens.

1525
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,800
And that's it, I think.

1526
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,360
I think we did a little presentation.

1527
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,240
I think we saw some of a presentation,

1528
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,880
but I cannot tell you what it is.

1529
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,720
I think we did a real syndrome of this

1530
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,320
in any Disney arcade and Disney Quest sort of thing,

1531
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,120
which relates to something that I learned about also

1532
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,800
from my friends Tyler and Kia who were just there.

1533
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,520
They spent some time in something called Color-topia.

1534
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,840
Brought to you by Gildan, Gildan Paint Company.

1535
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,680
Or Glidden?

1536
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,520
Oh, sorry.

1537
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,360
What is Color-topia?

1538
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,200
I don't know.

1539
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,040
It sounds familiar.

1540
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,760
That is one of two things hanging on in interventions.

1541
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,080
Color-topia's still there?

1542
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:35,920
Yes.

1543
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,760
Color-topia's still there.

1544
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,560
My friends did it last week.

1545
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,720
Is it just surrounded by construction walls?

1546
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,440
I think so.

1547
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1548
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,960
You're trying to shout over people jackhammering and stuff.

1549
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,120
So they were explaining it to me.

1550
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,320
And yeah, so it's kind of this paint exhibit.

1551
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,000
And it's hosted by Ty Burrell from Modern Family.

1552
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,040
And they give you like a, ugh, what do you mean?

1553
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,080
It's very exciting.

1554
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,880
It's Mr. Dumpy.

1555
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,240
I love Ty Burrell, but I wouldn't call him an A-lister,

1556
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:02,760
is all.

1557
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,680
Whenever any Modern Family cast member cameos in anything,

1558
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,840
stop the presses.

1559
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,040
It's a huge deal.

1560
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,520
This never happens.

1561
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,120
So my pet peeves coming out of the show.

1562
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,240
So in this exhibit, Ty Burrell shows you how to take a fiber

1563
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,080
optics brush, and you dip it into fiber optics paint cans.

1564
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,840
This already sounds really fun, to be honest.

1565
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,680
Well, so they're describing it to me at this dinner and say,

1566
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,000
yeah, it's actually pretty neat.

1567
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,200
And you dip the brush, and you can combine colors,

1568
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,160
and you start with primary colors,

1569
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,600
and then mix them, and that shows

1570
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,440
you how to make secondary colors.

1571
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,120
And my friend's explaining details of this.

1572
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,760
And then all of a sudden, Tyler interrupts and says,

1573
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,800
I don't know why you're talking about this so much.

1574
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,040
This is the worst thing we did the entire vacation.

1575
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,240
This was so boring.

1576
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,520
He said that it reminded him of a flash experience

1577
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,920
that you'd find on Newgrounds circa 1999.

1578
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,680
But if you're physically walking around

1579
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,120
with a magical paintbrush, it would feel futuristic.

1580
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,320
It looks a little like the old image works.

1581
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,720
That journey into imagination.

1582
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,080
That's what it was reminding me of.

1583
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,560
And it sounds like a successor to it, technology-wise.

1584
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,360
Yeah, yeah.

1585
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,920
A successor to the thing where you pointed

1586
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,280
Fred Flintstone's head and turned him into Leopard Brent.

1587
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,720
It sounds like the thing they had at the Warner Brothers

1588
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,920
store in Woodfield Mall in Shawnee, Illinois.

1589
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,840
You know what I'm talking about?

1590
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,360
Yes.

1591
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,200
Aaron mentioned that too when this came up.

1592
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,400
Yeah, in the Warner Brothers stores,

1593
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,040
you could touch the screen and paint the little dude's

1594
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,200
character.

1595
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,480
It's like blue and stuff.

1596
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,240
And I loved it as a kid.

1597
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,640
Taz with green eyes?

1598
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:40,960
Yeah.

1599
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,440
Crazy?

1600
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,760
That's outrageous.

1601
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,480
But I would do it.

1602
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,400
I would be crazy and do that as a child.

1603
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,560
That's as crazy as I got.

1604
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,600
Saber stripes on foghorn leg horn?

1605
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,280
You need to go to an institution.

1606
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,480
You could spend at least a half hour doing that.

1607
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,400
That would be great.

1608
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,720
I love the Warner Brothers store.

1609
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,360
We'll get to some Warner Brothers store stuff.

1610
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,280
There's going to be a full episode on the Warner Brothers

1611
00:54:59,280 --> 00:54:59,880
store.

1612
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,760
Might have a rocket you could climb in,

1613
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,280
and you'd push buttons, and they'd make sounds.

1614
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1615
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,320
It's like a rocket tube.

1616
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,040
Yeah, there's like a, what is that?

1617
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,160
Was it Marvin the Martian?

1618
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,640
Yes.

1619
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,320
OK, yeah, yeah.

1620
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,680
You know what killed the Warner Brothers store?

1621
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,640
They never carried any Pokemon things at any point.

1622
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,600
That store still existed at the height of Pokemon.

1623
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,920
And they would play the trailer for the movie in the store.

1624
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,120
And you'd walk in like, oh my god, Pokemon.

1625
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,840
And they'd only have golf tees with Taz on them.

1626
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,880
You'd be like, where's the Pokemon?

1627
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,840
It essentially could have been the Sanrio store,

1628
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,080
but for Pokemon.

1629
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1630
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,920
Could have lost their lives.

1631
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,200
Every other store and the malls I went to growing up

1632
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,520
had Pokemon stuff.

1633
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,440
And it was scarce.

1634
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,640
Even a clothing store, they'd just

1635
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,040
have a box of the beanbags by the register.

1636
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,320
Yeah, there's a box of cars, there's a box of beanbags.

1637
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,120
And just be like, oh, we're wiped out.

1638
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,040
We don't have any.

1639
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,920
That could have saved the Warner Brothers store.

1640
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,040
It could have saved the Warner Brothers store.

1641
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,960
This is a documentary waiting to happen.

1642
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,760
Oh, yeah.

1643
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,120
Who killed the electric car type.

1644
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,920
Which, by the way, I swear that was not just

1645
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,800
a ham-fisted segue.

1646
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,040
There was stuff in Inventions about GM did

1647
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,800
an exhibit about zero emissions electric vehicles.

1648
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,880
And was it that it's impossible?

1649
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,400
Yeah, yeah.

1650
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,120
Like, university.

1651
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,760
It'll never happen.

1652
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,960
Garsh, that sounds too hard to even try.

1653
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,000
Yeah, it's too hard.

1654
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,520
They're never going to figure it out.

1655
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,560
But won't we run out of these finite fossil fuels?

1656
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,880
Yeah, but not for a really long time.

1657
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,680
Hey, don't worry about it, man.

1658
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,720
It's too complicated.

1659
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,480
We shouldn't think about it right now.

1660
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,760
The official mascot of Inventions was a gray sedan.

1661
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,120
That is the thing I remember as a kid.

1662
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,920
No, it was Tom Morrow.

1663
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,240
Well, it was Tom Morrow.

1664
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,280
But I also remember a lot of gray sedans.

1665
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,800
But also, it's OK.

1666
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,000
So it was Tom Morrow here on the West Coast.

1667
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,480
Maybe we'll do a full shift over to the West Coast.

1668
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,520
But on the East Coast, it was a different robot

1669
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,840
who you could see all the insides of.

1670
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,520
I saw you send me a video clip of him rapping.

1671
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,160
You saw it.

1672
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,840
OK, wonderful.

1673
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,720
We're talking about Alec Tronic, who

1674
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,000
was a clear robot.

1675
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,480
And this was really cool to me as a kid,

1676
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,800
because he looks totally crazy.

1677
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,040
He just has a clear surface around him, and wires,

1678
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,160
and pistons, and stuff inside, because he is just

1679
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,360
an undressed animatronic.

1680
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,240
If Lincoln didn't have any of his skin,

1681
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,040
he would look like Alec Tronic.

1682
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,680
If robot Lincoln didn't have his skin.

1683
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,880
Not if the real human Abraham Lincoln.

1684
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,480
Correct, thank you for clarifying.

1685
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,640
Speaking for everyone knows.

1686
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,840
This was kind of this centerpiece.

1687
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,440
He was almost as close as there was

1688
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,840
to a mascot of Innoventions, although not

1689
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,720
to be confused with Sky Cyber Guy, who

1690
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,080
was a Motorola animatronic who you could also

1691
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,040
meet in Innoventions.

1692
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,880
But he was only in the Motorola part.

1693
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,520
Alec Tronic was a host to the whole thing.

1694
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,800
Do you know the timeline on Alec Tronic?

1695
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,220
Because when you sent me that video,

1696
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,160
I was wondering if Tom Morrow was just him with another head

1697
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,520
that they had hastily sent to the West Coast for Innoventions.

1698
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,200
That sounds correct.

1699
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,760
Because it didn't feel very planned.

1700
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,080
And that looked like the same body, but don't they all?

1701
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,360
Maybe it was a last minute.

1702
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,040
Maybe they're like, we need an animatronic in this thing, too.

1703
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,240
Yeah, because Tom Morrow felt like an afterthought,

1704
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,280
and had such an incredible range of motion considering how

1705
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,560
little he entertained people.

1706
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,560
He has such people walk past him.

1707
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,560
And I mean it in terms of time, but also in terms

1708
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,920
of entertainment value.

1709
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,920
This is the one voiced by Nathan Lane that sang an update.

1710
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,120
And he had horrible hair.

1711
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,960
Yeah, it looked like it was just magnetic tape.

1712
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,200
Yeah, he sang It's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow.

1713
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,440
But yeah, he had weird curly hair.

1714
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,640
But like about products you could buy.

1715
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,840
Yes, and I didn't realize until recently

1716
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,320
that he had four different songs to preference,

1717
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,760
four different pre-shows.

1718
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,260
Oh my god.

1719
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,520
I think they quickly stopped running most of them,

1720
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,120
because I only ever saw The House of the Future,

1721
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,000
to my knowledge.

1722
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,080
But I guess there was a sports one.

1723
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,880
There was like a communication one.

1724
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,800
I don't know what the fourth one was.

1725
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,280
Art, entertainment, or something.

1726
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,480
There was also this little fellow in Florida.

1727
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,960
Is this Tom Morrow 2.0?

1728
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,080
Yes, yeah.

1729
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,960
And I never saw him.

1730
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,160
I saw him on eBay a little while ago.

1731
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:03,680
Really?

1732
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,600
Yeah, and I think it was the version of him

1733
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,400
they used for promotional videos and not

1734
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,720
the actual one from the park.

1735
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,360
But yeah, he was in rough shape.

1736
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,600
And he was on eBay.

1737
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,000
How much was he?

1738
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,120
A lot.

1739
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,400
Like 10 grand?

1740
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,080
Probably like two grand, but like a lot for what he is.

1741
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:18,560
Yeah.

1742
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,200
Sure.

1743
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,000
He seemed much more endearing.

1744
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,920
I think we could get him for it.

1745
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,480
We should buy him if he's two grand.

1746
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,440
Well, he's gone now.

1747
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,560
Oh, somebody got him.

1748
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,360
For like $600, you could get the Dance in Henry

1749
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,360
from the dance machine that's now a Woody in the Connish shop.

1750
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah.

1751
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,080
Wait, what's Dance in Henry?

1752
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,360
I don't know about this.

1753
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,560
I forget what the bear was called,

1754
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,080
but now it's called Woody's Roundup,

1755
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,520
and you can have Woody dance by pressing buttons.

1756
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,040
Oh.

1757
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,400
And it's just a little coin operating machine.

1758
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,280
It's in Frontierland.

1759
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,720
It looks like an old Penny arcade.

1760
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,840
There's like a Pinocchio version too somewhere, right?

1761
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,120
Oh, yeah, there is.

1762
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,000
Or there used to be.

1763
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,080
I don't know if there still is.

1764
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,800
Maybe it's on Main Street, the Pinocchio one.

1765
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,960
I think that's in the confectionary on Main Street.

1766
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,640
I think it is.

1767
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,280
I think it's on the right wall where all the

1768
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,200
little dancing guy.

1769
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,600
So we can't move past electronic without talking about the rap.

1770
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,080
So I don't know with the full range of what he did exactly,

1771
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,320
his full show, but I found the one that is clearly the only one

1772
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,160
to care about, which is and I don't know why,

1773
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,840
why the robot host of a computer electronic show does this.

1774
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:21,440
But there is a rap that he does about the recent presidents

1775
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,560
of the United States.

1776
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,800
Wasn't like Lyndon B. Johnson in the lineup?

1777
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,080
He goes back that far.

1778
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,600
Comedy gold.

1779
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,160
He goes back to Kennedy.

1780
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,080
He kind of closes.

1781
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,400
Yeah, he makes fun of all of the stereotypes

1782
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,960
that we know about LBJ.

1783
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,920
Yeah, you can tell he's doing voice impressions.

1784
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,520
And I was like, I don't know if this is what Lyndon B. Johnson

1785
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,160
sounded like.

1786
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,200
I have no idea.

1787
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,080
I only know about Lyndon B. Johnson at all

1788
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,320
because there's a robot of him at his own presidential library

1789
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,480
in Austin, Texas.

1790
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,280
That's pretty cool.

1791
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,280
It's pretty crazy.

1792
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,240
And you watch him tell folksy stories,

1793
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,640
and then you hear disembodied applause.

1794
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,760
Is it like a Carousel of Progress type experience?

1795
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,480
You can walk right up to it.

1796
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,520
Oh my god, can you touch it?

1797
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,680
It's just like you round a corner, and then like, ah,

1798
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,200
oh my god.

1799
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,840
Can you lay your hands on it?

1800
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,240
You're probably not supposed to.

1801
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,440
You probably could.

1802
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,560
You could maybe let him do his entire speech

1803
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,320
while just holding his lower lip.

1804
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,800
I just want to feel his cheek muscles move under my hand.

1805
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,680
Is it still there?

1806
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,920
Caress his face.

1807
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,800
Yeah, I believe so.

1808
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,800
You can look up videos of this really insane.

1809
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,440
There'll be an episode about it.

1810
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,080
I'm thinking if there's any part they don't want you to touch,

1811
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,240
it would be the face.

1812
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,920
Yeah.

1813
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,760
The most precarious.

1814
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,800
The droopy dog face.

1815
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,680
I would like that robot to be programmed to play the audio tapes

1816
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,600
of the phone call where he gives a tailor.

1817
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,240
Oh my god.

1818
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,240
Lyndon Johnson.

1819
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:31,960
That's crazy.

1820
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,440
He's talking to a tailor, I think, back in Texas.

1821
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,240
So like, yeah, I just want you to take the crotch out a little

1822
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:37,840
old pants.

1823
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,080
Old pants were real good.

1824
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,080
It's crazy.

1825
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,120
I don't know why that exists.

1826
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,000
I don't know why it is real, though.

1827
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Did the tailor record it for posterity?

1828
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,640
I don't know.

1829
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,680
I think it is from an official White House recording.

1830
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,120
I guess either they did or LBJ did.

1831
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,440
Yeah.

1832
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,760
It's in the Library of Congress.

1833
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,160
He just loved his pants, but he wanted a little more breathing

1834
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,040
room in the crotch.

1835
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,880
And also, it's a lot more vulgar than what I am saying.

1836
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,400
Oh, yeah.

1837
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,080
It's very, very coarse.

1838
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,720
It was a coarse man.

1839
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,200
Yeah, yeah.

1840
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,160
He seems unpleasant.

1841
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,920
But none of this is addressed in the rap.

1842
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,000
Mike, what would you like to display to us

1843
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
from the president's room?

1844
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,600
I'm just going to play a second.

1845
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,840
We're the whole thing will obviously post on Twitter.

1846
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,520
But let's just so you guys can get a hint of what is going on

1847
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,040
here.

1848
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,920
I'm going to tell you to our president's.

1849
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,920
Hit it, boys!

1850
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,400
The name is Bill.

1851
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,400
No doubt about it.

1852
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,880
You're listening to the president's rap.

1853
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,360
The name is Charlie, if you're watching.

1854
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,840
I'm the guy with 1,000 points of luck.

1855
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,360
The name is Ron and my friend's item is the only one

1856
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,840
with a death belly page.

1857
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,880
The name is Jimmy, I'm here from the country to help Billy

1858
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,720
sell beer.

1859
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,240
And help Billy sell beer.

1860
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,280
A lot of like C grade impressions

1861
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,040
of not relevant presidents.

1862
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,560
No.

1863
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,080
Yeah.

1864
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,440
And he also, the Ford one, it's just a joke

1865
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,480
that Chevy chased it.

1866
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,240
He's like, I fall down a lot or something.

1867
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,640
My name is Jerry.

1868
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,920
My name is Jerry.

1869
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,600
I slip and fall.

1870
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,480
Pillows and mattresses line my wall.

1871
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,040
Oh, yeah.

1872
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,200
Oh!

1873
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:26,080
Gerald Ford lines his home with soft things because he.

1874
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:26,720
Yeah.

1875
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,200
And also lining your wall ain't going to help you too much.

1876
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,920
You want those mattresses on the floor.

1877
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,760
He might also fall sideways into things

1878
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,080
with a trajectory going.

1879
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,560
That's true.

1880
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,040
It makes sense.

1881
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,120
So you need it all around.

1882
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,760
Clearly you've never had his problem before.

1883
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,480
Gerald Ford needs to live in Goofy's bounce house.

1884
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah.

1885
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,720
It is also the same.

1886
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,280
I mean, this has been used many times,

1887
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,200
but it's a Super Bowl shuffle, very familiar.

1888
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,720
My name is blank.

1889
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,240
Right.

1890
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,520
We want to make sure you understand the impressions

1891
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,080
because they can't trust you two without identifying

1892
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,920
who they're doing an impression of, like any good comedy act.

1893
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,000
Not that good.

1894
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,960
Yes, every impressions should say, oh, I'm.

1895
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,080
That's how a lot of people start impressions.

1896
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1897
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,160
That's my favorite thing when people start an impression

1898
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,760
and have to say I'm and the name of the person

1899
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,680
they're trying to do.

1900
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,440
Well, we're describing the best content on YouTube,

1901
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,280
which is I'm Stewie.

1902
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,680
Oh, god.

1903
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Seven million views.

1904
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,160
I shouldn't say it.

1905
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,640
I won't.

1906
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,560
It's an actual YouTuber.

1907
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,280
How can you?

1908
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,240
There's no way to know.

1909
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,120
I'll tell you after.

1910
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,600
There are 250 YouTubers who do Stewie Griffin impressions.

1911
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,640
Look, I'm starting shit with Tom Morrow, who technically

1912
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,880
was the mayor of Tomorrowland unofficially.

1913
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,840
Oh, was he?

1914
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,320
That's true.

1915
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,120
He's kind of a mayor.

1916
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,240
They still mention him on the People Mover.

1917
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,160
Oh, that's right.

1918
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,080
Paging Tom Morrow.

1919
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,160
Tom Morrow.

1920
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,280
So that's the question.

1921
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,360
That's referencing the Tom Morrow in Epcot.

1922
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,920
I believe it is.

1923
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,680
Well, in general, I think he was a recurring character name.

1924
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,200
Huh.

1925
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,120
That's interesting.

1926
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,960
I forget, did the episode come out where we sort of,

1927
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,440
because you know C, the Society of Explorers and Adventures,

1928
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,200
but we came up with another thing we think

1929
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,880
we should pitch called space.

1930
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,600
I would love that.

1931
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,280
Tomorrowland Extended Universe.

1932
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,320
Yes, because it does exist.

1933
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,760
Yeah, there's a lot of aldermen in Tomorrowland 94.

1934
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,720
There's a lot of bureaucratic positions.

1935
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,720
With people like Sunny Eclipse.

1936
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,120
When will we talk about Sunny Eclipse?

1937
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,640
Boy, that would be a great topic to address.

1938
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,360
I agree with you.

1939
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,480
Or on that later.

1940
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,960
Should we use the animatronics as the juncture point

1941
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,880
to switch over to West Coast interventions?

1942
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,440
We've already talked a little bit about.

1943
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,320
My home in Oventus.

1944
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,000
Would you know much more about, yes, you've

1945
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,160
spent seemingly a lot of time in there, potentially.

1946
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,920
Certainly enough.

1947
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,960
Compared to other people, regular people.

1948
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,840
So yeah, you're, all right.

1949
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:56,200
This was part of New Tomorrowland 1998.

1950
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,000
One of the major parts of it.

1951
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,600
And I was such a weird, poisoned kid

1952
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,240
that when I read that on Disneyland.com

1953
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,720
in the computer lab in sixth grade, which

1954
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,720
is where I spent lunch looking at Disneyland.com instead

1955
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,720
of socializing.

1956
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,720
And I have a very specific memory of going to the website

1957
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,600
and saying, oh, Innoventions is coming out here.

1958
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,160
Well, that's a smart idea.

1959
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,560
And I probably went and told that

1960
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,800
to another kid who just snarled at me and looked away.

1961
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,560
Smacked a lunch bag out of my hand.

1962
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,480
We went to the opening of Tomorrowland 1998.

1963
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:29,980
Wow.

1964
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,480
Really?

1965
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,840
There was very little.

1966
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,360
I barely remember it.

1967
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,240
But I do remember the CEO came out and talked

1968
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:38,360
and then flung a bunch of astronaut Mickey beanbags

1969
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,480
into the crowd.

1970
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,960
And we caught quite a few of them.

1971
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,280
They tossed a lot.

1972
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,560
My aunt found one recently and she sent it to me in the mail.

1973
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,120
Just like, I thought you'd want this.

1974
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,720
So I have a Mickey Mouse beanbag astronaut.

1975
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,360
Wow, have you tweeted that?

1976
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:52,880
I should.

1977
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,600
I think it's literally in my apartment.

1978
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,280
So I should.

1979
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,880
Well, we tweeted.

1980
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,560
The listeners want to see that beanbag.

1981
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,960
They got to see that beanbag.

1982
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,960
He even still has his tag on because it was just

1983
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,000
one that my aunt had.

1984
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,440
So it was never played with.

1985
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,240
That's great.

1986
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,800
How much things have changed.

1987
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,240
You were just encouraged to play with that Mickey that

1988
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,920
was thrown to you as opposed to eat that Mickey

1989
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,160
at an opening attraction.

1990
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,640
The thing is with the new Tomorrowland,

1991
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,160
I believe other than cosmetic changes,

1992
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,760
like moving the Astro Orbiter and things,

1993
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,040
I think that the only new things were

1994
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,600
Autopia and Innoventions.

1995
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,980
And I might be wrong about that.

1996
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,600
But I think otherwise it was just Rocket Rods.

1997
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,560
Rocket Rods.

1998
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,800
Can't forget Rocket Rods.

1999
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,040
Which I wrote, I think, twice before it closed.

2000
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,040
That's what I did too.

2001
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,560
It's pretty good.

2002
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,440
Twice is pretty good.

2003
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,080
And I really liked Rocket Rods.

2004
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,000
I actually remember that after the Mega Wait, that I sort of,

2005
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,960
I enjoyed it more than I thought because it had been built so

2006
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,680
down.

2007
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,440
Yeah.

2008
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,440
I remember both times we went really early.

2009
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,800
So we didn't probably wait more than a half hour,

2010
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,680
which is really nice.

2011
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,040
Oh, really?

2012
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,560
But the trick was being there when it didn't shut down.

2013
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,360
I think there was at least one time we waited in line

2014
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,280
and it closed.

2015
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,400
A hard trick to pull off.

2016
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,200
Which is pretty common.

2017
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,400
So you're at the first day when Innoventions

2018
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,200
sparkling new.

2019
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,480
The only real thing I remember about opening day

2020
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,160
was after getting beanbags thrown at us,

2021
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,200
was walking in and being really impressed by the neon Mickey

2022
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,360
that tumbles in his astronaut gear.

2023
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,240
Do they still have that?

2024
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,000
They sure do.

2025
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,640
They do.

2026
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,720
God bless it.

2027
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,800
I love that.

2028
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,920
I was so impressed by it.

2029
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,240
I swear if it ever goes away, that's when I protest.

2030
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,520
That's when I throw pipe bombs.

2031
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,720
So yeah, I remember the gift shop had all these Tomorrowland

2032
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,760
things in it and I remember the Mickey on the wall.

2033
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,000
But I don't remember doing a lot else that day.

2034
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,880
But yeah, I have vivid memories of Innoventions,

2035
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,800
the new attraction and being excited to find out what it is

2036
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,880
and queuing up to go into Innoventions

2037
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,360
and watch the pre-show and everything.

2038
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,560
And then, yeah, it's really just an ad for things.

2039
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,480
I remember that right up until their closing,

2040
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:59,200
they still had a large section where you would play PS1 games.

2041
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,080
The PlayStation 1 Lilo and Stitch games.

2042
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,040
Oh, yeah.

2043
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,880
I remember that.

2044
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,600
That was the closing day of Innoventions.

2045
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,520
They still had that.

2046
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,280
And I want to say that game is from 2006.

2047
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:09,960
Sure.

2048
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
Oh my god.

2049
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,840
It was so old by that point.

2050
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,360
They had some Disney Infinity stuff too toward the end,

2051
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:16,840
right?

2052
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,840
Yeah, toward the end they did, which

2053
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,000
should have been an Omen.

2054
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,880
And was it still called Innoventions

2055
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,960
when they had the Marvel stuff open on the top?

2056
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,000
No, then it was Star Wars Launch Bay and Marvel headquarters,

2057
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,680
I think.

2058
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,200
And that's what they renamed it the Tomorrowland Expo Center.

2059
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,360
And they put up on the outside, cute,

2060
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,680
retro-looking Stark Expo posters.

2061
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,400
Oh, that's right.

2062
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:34,880
OK.

2063
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,560
Which I thought was an apt use of the space,

2064
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,400
because it doesn't have that World's Fair vibe.

2065
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:38,920
Sure.

2066
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,600
But the contents were not interesting or good.

2067
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,320
But visually, it was a nice concept.

2068
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,080
I think there was one or two Marvel things when it was still

2069
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,160
in Innoventions right at the end.

2070
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,280
It was the Thor meet and greet and then Spider-Man meet

2071
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:51,880
and greet.

2072
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,600
Oh, I did the Thor meet and greet.

2073
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,320
And maybe Captain America too.

2074
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,840
Yeah, and the Iron Man suits where you could do, again,

2075
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,160
Kinect technology.

2076
01:09:59,160 --> 01:09:59,640
Yes.

2077
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,000
It would look like it put the suit on you.

2078
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,720
I did the Thor.

2079
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,720
And then I think send you a GIF of it or something.

2080
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,200
And then the empty area where like,

2081
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,000
Awesomo would come out.

2082
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yes, I wanted to talk about Awesomo.

2083
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,280
I love Home of the Future.

2084
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,040
I love that in their version of the future,

2085
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,920
they had what was basically Alexa technology.

2086
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,160
But instead of it just being a box

2087
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,720
that you set in your living room,

2088
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,000
they thought that it would be a 500 pound, four foot tall boy

2089
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,760
robot that walks around.

2090
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,480
And it can only really do things like call people for you,

2091
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,760
order a pizza, add something to your grocery list.

2092
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,680
Literally nothing beyond what Alexa can do.

2093
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:42,880
But it has to be a fully mobile 500 pound boy that shuffles

2094
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,720
around your house ominously.

2095
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,360
And he has to be next to four massive Microsoft Surface

2096
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,800
tabletops that are pushed together.

2097
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,960
And yeah, already out of date by the time they were.

2098
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,440
And he knows your voice.

2099
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,360
And they never made it clear from a cultural perspective

2100
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,400
what Awesomo is doing when he's not doing tasks for you.

2101
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,160
Like, do you think he goes on autopilot

2102
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,320
in their imagining of it and just wanders your house?

2103
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,800
Or do you think he stands in a corner unmoving

2104
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,240
until you acknowledge him?

2105
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,280
Put him in a closet.

2106
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,040
I was going to say.

2107
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,000
Yeah.

2108
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,240
What is life with Awesomo?

2109
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,720
Yeah, it depends how often you have to charge him, I feel like.

2110
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,440
It feels like.

2111
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,640
Probably really often.

2112
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,920
Probably really often.

2113
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,480
So you probably.

2114
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,680
I want to hope that he knows himself

2115
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,040
how to navigate to a charger and plug himself in.

2116
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,640
But I'm not confident that's the case.

2117
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,680
I would like us taking a nap or going to sleep.

2118
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,120
Yeah.

2119
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,520
I would like to think that he knows, but he can't get there.

2120
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,600
And he has to like hold up.

2121
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,320
He has to come to you for help.

2122
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,600
He holds up his plug and goes, please plug, please.

2123
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,560
Mother.

2124
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,080
Mommy.

2125
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,720
I can feel the Windows 9 installing.

2126
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,800
Edwin stands and clearly wants a walker food.

2127
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,000
I remember for a time he ran.

2128
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,280
But it happened frequently enough that he would fall over backwards,

2129
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,040
that they discontinued his running because he was so heavy and fragile

2130
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,360
that when he would fall over backwards, they were told not to move him.

2131
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,800
So they would come out with like a portable curtain.

2132
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,720
Yes, they just bring a wall out, which was the same thing

2133
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,320
they would do with the meet and greet Wally when he broke down.

2134
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,360
They would bring out a little curtain, like a changing screen

2135
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,880
and just put it around him and have everyone leave.

2136
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,760
That's why he's too heavy to move.

2137
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,960
Yeah, that was the same with Wally.

2138
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,560
I think Wally weights like 400 pounds or something.

2139
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,440
I think if you're living with Osimo, like a dog who wants to play

2140
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,000
catch or play frisbee, Osimo constantly wants to show you

2141
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,520
that he can climb the stairs.

2142
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,400
Yes. And he does it really slowly.

2143
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,600
And he's wide enough that you can't go around him.

2144
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,560
Is there something you need once he starts?

2145
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,320
Can I go up the stairs for you?

2146
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,320
Can I fetch you a glass of water, particularly one up the stairs?

2147
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,760
He moves like half a mile an hour around the house.

2148
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,840
His steps are so careful.

2149
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,480
Osimo, it's really OK. I can run up.

2150
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,440
No, no, let Osimo do it.

2151
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,280
Osimo can climb stairs.

2152
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:05,000
And if he's halfway up and you change your mind, he has to complete the ascent

2153
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,240
because he can't turn around without falling.

2154
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,840
That's too complicated. It's OK. You can stop.

2155
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,600
No, I can't. Yeah, I will fall.

2156
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,360
What are you? Do you have a curtain?

2157
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,440
Otherwise, I must finish climbing the stairs.

2158
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,560
What am I even doing anymore?

2159
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,000
Fuck, man.

2160
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,920
Who is Osimo?

2161
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,160
If Osimo cannot climb stairs, is there Osimo?

2162
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,680
I believe this was so it was called Dream Home, right?

2163
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,600
I loved Dream Home. Dream Home. Yes.

2164
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,840
That's what I was talking about with the screens.

2165
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,400
Yeah, yeah. With the smart screens sponsored by H.P.

2166
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,160
Microsoft and Taylor Morrison, a home building company.

2167
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,280
Taylor Morrison. OK.

2168
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,080
I remember one time I was there and they were doing their spiel about the TV

2169
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,480
and it was like a smart TV.

2170
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,600
This was like in the end times of interventions, like in the last five years.

2171
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,880
So it was a smart TV, but it was connected to Wi-Fi.

2172
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,640
And they were trying to show us the like beautiful picture quality,

2173
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,040
like the high def picture.

2174
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,200
But the Wi-Fi wasn't good.

2175
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,720
So it was the worst image quality ever.

2176
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,000
It was like 240p.

2177
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,400
And there were only about like five people watching.

2178
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,920
And my sister said much too loud.

2179
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,360
It looks terrible.

2180
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,080
And she said it to me, but everybody heard.

2181
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,600
And the host had to awkwardly be like,

2182
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,680
it's well, that's because of the Internet speed.

2183
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,280
But the capabilities of the TV are much better.

2184
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,800
So like they had to talk back to her saying that it looked really bad.

2185
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,120
And I was mortified. Disneyland.

2186
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,960
Not great Internet, not great Wi-Fi.

2187
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:39,000
Still, still, the hotels have gotten a lot better.

2188
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,560
But the walk around life is well, even for employees, the Wi-Fi is not good.

2189
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,480
There are several like info kiosks they kept having to move

2190
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,040
because you couldn't get Wi-Fi at them.

2191
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:54,320
In fact, I think right now the one on the pier, like Pixar Pier, it's called now.

2192
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,240
The kiosk used to be closer to the Incredicoaster line,

2193
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,960
and they moved it across the way.

2194
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,000
And now it just never has Wi-Fi.

2195
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,520
And the Wi-Fi is slightly better, but now it's really loud

2196
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,200
because you have to hear Dash screaming every day.

2197
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,280
Oh, yeah.

2198
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,640
So I think at the time that I left, everyone was begging them to move it.

2199
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,120
And I don't think they have yet.

2200
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,160
I did just go there for something, and it was something they couldn't do

2201
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,400
because they weren't hooked up to something or other.

2202
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,840
Set you up with like a if you're handicapped and you get the return times,

2203
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,880
they can't do that without Wi-Fi and they can't give you fast passes.

2204
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,080
They can't book anything.

2205
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,640
Basically, every aspect of their job, except giving you buttons

2206
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,720
or walking directions, can't be done without Wi-Fi.

2207
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,600
It's one of the few things that Universal Hollywood outpaces,

2208
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,360
probably because they are owned by Comcast and Information Services Company.

2209
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,920
They aren't the good as opposed to being the company that tried to start Go.com.

2210
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,440
Always a spotty history with Disney and the Internet.

2211
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,520
He tried to start Go.com.

2212
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,720
Wow. Yeah, that was their like competitor to Google or to ask.

2213
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,120
Oh, my God. Yeah, that's why their site is still Disney.Go.

2214
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,960
Disney. Oh, my. Is it really?

2215
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,000
Yeah, if you like book a hotel or yeah,

2216
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,960
I read times and stuff, it's Disney.Go.com.

2217
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,160
Yikes. Oh, that's crazy. Yeah.

2218
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:19,600
So in other words, in 2015,

2219
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,280
Disney had a big display of poor Wi-Fi and video games from 2006.

2220
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,880
Yeah. Here is a take from me of all the things.

2221
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,160
I'll just do the I'll just do it.

2222
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,920
How about in my lifetime since I've been going to Disneyland?

2223
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:40,240
Inventions Disneyland, I think, is the worst thing passed off as an attraction.

2224
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,000
And I count Superstar Lemmo.

2225
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,680
I can't because that's a ride.

2226
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,760
It is a stupid. Yes. But a rocket rods.

2227
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,920
You did go really fast. Yeah.

2228
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:56,040
What is the innovative that building is so big, a massive footprint.

2229
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,160
They they dare call that an attraction.

2230
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,680
Are you kidding me?

2231
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,800
If it's a good if you if you listed under glorified shops,

2232
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,920
if that's the heading on the map, then sure worse than like, I mean,

2233
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,360
and I don't think these are bad.

2234
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,760
The tortilla tour. Yeah.

2235
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,560
At least I have fun for that.

2236
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,280
Yes. I mean, I agree.

2237
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,320
I'm just trying to throw things out.

2238
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,120
Bread tour. You get a piece of bread. Sure.

2239
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,520
The caterpillar. I agree.

2240
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,920
The caterpillar is like Choo Choo train.

2241
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,280
No, not like Choo Choo train.

2242
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,880
The the farm equipment. Oh, right.

2243
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,160
Bountiful Valley Farm Valley Farm.

2244
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,520
Yeah, you might have me on.

2245
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,600
You finally have one. Cornstalk characters,

2246
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,640
which automatically makes it better than intervention.

2247
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,600
Yeah. Yeah. Although does Osomo not.

2248
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:40,720
Do you agree with my.

2249
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,440
Oh, you're right. Osomo is pretty good.

2250
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.

2251
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,440
I didn't see the Osomo show, but he was not always running.

2252
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,160
OK. Huh.

2253
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,560
A single segue. I think too.

2254
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,840
Yeah, not so like he's still on the he's on the utopia now.

2255
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,960
Yeah. I've always wondered if those are actual Osomos who have just been disabled

2256
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,600
or if they or if they're just I think they're Osomo shells.

2257
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,280
But how scary to think that they have like a full brain and can like recognize

2258
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,800
faces and are capable of walking, but not allowed to.

2259
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,200
But I will never climb stairs again. Yeah.

2260
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,240
It doesn't move, though, right?

2261
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,360
On the utopia, isn't it? Or like a very little.

2262
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,600
It moves. It's bird friend bird. Yeah.

2263
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,640
Bird with a Y. OK.

2264
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:26,400
The most famous moving robot is on the car ride and can't can't move.

2265
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,360
I think one of them waves.

2266
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,640
Yeah. The one that you can see from the train waves.

2267
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,200
Oh, yeah. Yeah. OK.

2268
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,640
He does like a Miss America wave.

2269
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,920
That's something great.

2270
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,920
Worth keeping that attraction.

2271
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,200
Keep that forever.

2272
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:42,040
Keep interventions and empty husk forever.

2273
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,440
Yeah. What's going on?

2274
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,720
Huge footprint that really be something better or at least electric.

2275
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,160
Just going to put it out there.

2276
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:53,240
Oh, sure. It's kind of embarrassing in Tomorrowland to have gas powered vehicle.

2277
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,640
Well, doesn't Tokyo have electric ones?

2278
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,440
I think they do.

2279
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,280
But I think they cost a million dollars.

2280
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,160
We didn't do it.

2281
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,560
And I don't remember where it is, but I mean, I don't know if it was.

2282
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,640
Can they get like Tesla to sponsor it or something?

2283
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:10,640
Well, that's I mean, that that's my big because in Michael Iser's pitch

2284
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,720
to to the viewing public about interventions, he said, like,

2285
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,240
only the best of the in their fields are going to be here.

2286
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,760
So I. Yeah.

2287
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,160
Yeah. Honda, GM.

2288
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,800
I mean, so when it first opened, it was GM and Sega.

2289
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,360
And it was Chevron to initially of Autopia.

2290
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,880
They had the Chevron car mascot.

2291
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,080
Oh, that's when they had the faces.

2292
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,720
Yeah. Right. That was cool.

2293
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:39,440
But I always wondered why didn't they just turn interventions over to like Apple?

2294
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:44,760
Turns out Apple was an original tenant of interventions, but it was 1994

2295
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,920
Apple when they were selling the Newton, their version of the pilot.

2296
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,280
Oh, no.

2297
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,160
She's Newton.

2298
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,600
It was the most awkward era of the most awkward between Steve's.

2299
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,000
Right. The one that was the fewest, Steve's were pre.

2300
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,720
Yeah. And pre next when Steve like sold that and then came back to Apple.

2301
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,120
Yeah. So that that was very.

2302
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,040
But like, yeah, you'd think like Apple and Tesla

2303
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:15,320
like taking it over could do something.

2304
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,360
Companies like that could do something, though.

2305
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,160
Probably best that there's not a platform for Elon Musk.

2306
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,280
Yeah, I don't know.

2307
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,120
We need him and he's a rat.

2308
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,320
He's a bum.

2309
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,200
Maybe like five years ago, Elon Musk, before people like knew really what he was like.

2310
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,400
Yeah. Yeah. Before we knew any facts.

2311
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,040
Yeah. When he was just the guy that owned a company that was doing well.

2312
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,040
And all I remember hearing like, you know, he's actually kind of like the real life

2313
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,880
Iron Man. He's Tony Stark.

2314
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,240
No, but he loves the idea that he's Iron Man.

2315
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:46,080
I think there's an Iron Man statue inside of SpaceX.

2316
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,840
There's also one of Rick from Rick and Morty.

2317
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,680
So, you know, but so two statues, zero unions.

2318
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,360
Yeah. I mean, we can't deny that both Tony Stark and Rick would be anti-union.

2319
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,880
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2320
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,600
That's why those are the statues.

2321
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,800
Rick does not exactly think collectively.

2322
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,680
No. The first episode of ours posted on Reddit with seven hundred ninety six comments.

2323
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,040
Two thousand down votes.

2324
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:13,880
No.

2325
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,480
Stay away from Rick.

2326
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,480
Oh, boy. Our first real death threat.

2327
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,120
And they didn't tell us how they're getting into Galaxy's Edge.

2328
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,040
That's true. This is why you withhold the information.

2329
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,560
Yeah. Yeah. You have to earn that.

2330
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,080
Now, you talk about leaders in your field.

2331
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,720
There were, of course, there were leaders in their fields at interventions.

2332
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,360
Ninety eight. And I'm talking about Kaiser Permanente.

2333
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,000
Thrive. Thrive.

2334
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,400
The second floor was health geared.

2335
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,840
I also remember my first trip to Innoventions.

2336
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,640
They had a tiny corral of segues.

2337
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,400
And I found that really exciting.

2338
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,600
It was the first time I had seen or heard of a segue.

2339
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,880
But I was very young and you had to be 18 to try the segues.

2340
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,520
So basically, anyone old enough to try them was too old to be interested in trying them.

2341
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,960
All the children wanted to ride the segues, but it was not allowed.

2342
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,120
It was a liability.

2343
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,560
The same. You had to sign a waiver before getting on the set.

2344
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,160
Oh, yeah. Innoventions, you can sign waivers.

2345
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,920
You've never dreamed of was there wasn't a segue.

2346
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,840
There was like a segue tour of California.

2347
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,600
California just a few years ago.

2348
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,120
We've talked about that before, I think.

2349
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,600
I regret never doing that.

2350
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,280
So that was all probably from the same batch of segues.

2351
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,680
Yeah, the same sponsorship.

2352
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,120
You're right. They would wrangle them from the corral and take them right.

2353
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,280
To California Adventure.

2354
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,720
The running of the segues. It was so cute.

2355
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,440
It was like a segue petting farm.

2356
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,360
Like it was maybe like a 10 foot diameter little thing.

2357
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,040
And like everyone was just like having to go and then stop

2358
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,800
because there were so many segues in this tiny little circle.

2359
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,720
It really was like a segue corral.

2360
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:44,960
Like they were going to round them up for branding or something.

2361
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,840
But it was kind of eating time.

2362
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,600
Yeah, they were milling around electricity, little pellets from a machine

2363
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,360
and have them come up to you over the fence.

2364
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,920
Bolts. I that's insane.

2365
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,280
If I could talk about this Kaiser Permanente thing really fast, I sent you

2366
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,240
I sent you guys a video.

2367
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:09,000
I yourself would really think you least want to do it at theme park

2368
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,760
in front of your weight.

2369
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,160
And then it would give you like pointers on how to like lose weight.

2370
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,920
God, what?

2371
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,480
Your BMI for you and then went like you might want to eat less carbs.

2372
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,760
After you just like ate a churro, it's like, cool, I love this.

2373
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,160
I oh, yeah. Wait there.

2374
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,040
Well, there's also confusingly, there was also a thing that was sponsored

2375
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,840
by St. Joseph's Hospital.

2376
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,960
What? Like the Children's Hospital?

2377
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,440
Yeah, it's kind of a down.

2378
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,880
This attraction was called Healthy University.

2379
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,960
That's where you could calculate your BMI, play virtual sports games

2380
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,520
and have a chance to see yourself 50 years in the future.

2381
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,040
Oh, no. You're fat.

2382
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,360
Here's what you're going to look like before you look what you look like.

2383
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,360
When death looms before you.

2384
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:53,080
50 years is like not fun for anyone, even if you're really young.

2385
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,120
At least they said 10 years, maybe if you're 10, you want to see yourself

2386
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,720
as like a hot 20 year old and be like, oh, good.

2387
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,200
It's all going to work out.

2388
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,320
Hey, get ready.

2389
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,240
But yeah, no years.

2390
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,520
There's no age at which 50 years you're going to be like

2391
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,280
like you're looking forward to that.

2392
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,360
But 50 years gives them a huge margin for error because like you

2393
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,080
no one can look at it and go, that can't be right.

2394
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,200
What if 50 years is so long?

2395
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,920
What if you were 80?

2396
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,600
Oh, no.

2397
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,880
It shows you like a skeleton.

2398
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,520
This is a you at a hundred and seventy.

2399
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,400
The skeleton dance short that plays in the face.

2400
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,880
So so also there also is a kind of because of permanent

2401
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,800
thing, and I found a video about Kaiser Permanente's

2402
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,400
it was from their YouTube channel that was from, you know,

2403
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,360
Kaiser Permanente's video magazine Perspectives.

2404
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:51,400
This is now posted to their YouTube channel where it has a solid seven

2405
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,000
hundred and ninety one views.

2406
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,560
Oh, my God. And I hope it.

2407
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,840
Hey, listeners, get up there.

2408
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,560
Let's get them to a thousand PTR Army.

2409
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,320
Let's help Kaiser thrive.

2410
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,400
And you'll also get to see Charlie McMillan, the president of the McMillan

2411
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,800
group, which is something that has to do with what he's hanging out there

2412
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,920
to give an awesome type show every hour.

2413
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,520
Show us what you can do, Charlie.

2414
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,360
You can run downstairs.

2415
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,240
Let me just show it since you didn't see this video, Jenny,

2416
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,200
let me just show you some stills of the boardroom where people wait.

2417
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,920
Was that a physical thing inside?

2418
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,560
Oh, that's a video.

2419
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,640
No, this is this is people brainstorming at easels.

2420
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,560
The you know what the attraction is going to be.

2421
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:37,720
And this is a purple plastic wall that says magnetic madness,

2422
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,400
magnetic resonance imaging.

2423
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,120
And then here's the lady who's the host of perspectives in front of a light.

2424
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,160
Literally just get an MRI at Disneyland.

2425
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:50,120
Yeah. Why would you like, hey, think about MRIs?

2426
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:54,040
Always a good sign when you're getting one of those MRIs.

2427
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,840
You you not only that, but you could do

2428
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,120
a practice ultrasound.

2429
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,640
You could like rub the little arm onto something or other.

2430
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:07,080
Some where little belly and in the frame that I have in front of me,

2431
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,960
I sent you guys a video, but I don't know if you saw this detail.

2432
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,200
Well, yeah, you're looking at sort of a simulation of a little baby

2433
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,360
black and white in the womb.

2434
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,480
Sounds like x-rays were like you're not supposed to get them for fun.

2435
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,760
Like it's not great for you.

2436
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,160
So you're supposed to do it sparingly.

2437
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:24,160
It's better, I think, than an x-ray, but I don't know that it's not.

2438
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:27,320
I think I remember some news story where like a rich celebrity

2439
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,520
bought an ultrasound because his wife was pregnant and he just enjoyed using it.

2440
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,640
Like recreationally, let me see the fucking good buy one.

2441
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,080
We can use it all the time.

2442
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,040
And I remember the news was very much like this is not a thing

2443
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,680
you should have done because it's not like medically responsible

2444
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,920
to do that all the time.

2445
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,600
I don't editorialize very much, but I need to I need to say something here.

2446
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,120
This Edward Armour moment.

2447
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,800
Maybe it was a question of like, if you're not a licensed tech,

2448
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,000
it can be dangerous.

2449
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:55,720
But I don't know.

2450
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,000
The impression I got was you're not supposed to just go,

2451
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,680
let's look in your arm.

2452
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,880
It's Disneyland.

2453
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,640
Boy, well, I had a great day at Disneyland.

2454
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,600
I did an MRI.

2455
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,840
I did a false ultrasound and I went on seven roller coasters.

2456
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,520
Anyway, can't wait to have that baby next month.

2457
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,520
The very MRI like take a long time.

2458
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,440
I want to imagine they like put you in the tube for like 45 minutes.

2459
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,080
I think so.

2460
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,160
It's very loud, right?

2461
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,240
They're very loud.

2462
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:25,960
Noises.

2463
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,760
I don't know if there was a shout over it.

2464
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,960
I'm not entirely sure that there was like a fake MRI,

2465
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,560
but you could learn about MRI.

2466
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,320
Maybe they had like a puppet MRI kind of like the House of the Future

2467
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,880
demonstration where there wasn't really someone on the phone.

2468
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,320
Right. So it's like the machine's not really on.

2469
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,120
It just screams at you.

2470
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,800
And it goes, look, that's their brain.

2471
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,680
And it's like an actor.

2472
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,840
They should have put awesome in the MRI.

2473
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,880
Oh, God.

2474
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,920
What are you? OK, you're in here with me.

2475
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,480
You need a fork in a microwave.

2476
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,840
I feel like something bad would happen.

2477
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,640
Yeah, that's true.

2478
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,600
Yeah. I climbed in here with you so I could keep you company.

2479
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,520
Ah, zap fire.

2480
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,400
You burn up to they should have put the old John animatronic

2481
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,520
from the carousel progress in the MRI machine.

2482
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,720
Well, yeah, that would have been better.

2483
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,200
Well, I can't.

2484
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,960
I like a turtle. If I'm on my back, I can't get up.

2485
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,000
So someone please help me.

2486
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,120
The frame in the ultrasound point, they can't get up.

2487
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,040
After he falls down.

2488
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,800
Oh, tap.

2489
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,400
So the frame in this Kaiser Permanente video

2490
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,200
where they're showing you the fake ultrasound,

2491
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,160
it has a big blue bar up at the top of it.

2492
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,720
And children are looking at this.

2493
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:36,160
The big blue bar says, current view, genitalia.

2494
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,760
No.

2495
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,960
This is what they showed in their YouTube video.

2496
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,840
Computer, enhance.

2497
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,840
No.

2498
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:43,640
No, mom.

2499
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,440
So that's what a baby's dick looks like.

2500
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,920
Why are they doing that?

2501
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:47,840
That's bizarre.

2502
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,880
I don't know.

2503
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,320
Innoventions where you can see unborn babies.

2504
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,920
It feels like the Imagineers had nothing to do with this.

2505
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,120
I hope not.

2506
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,960
It just feels like this is a separate thing

2507
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,480
from the rest of Disney.

2508
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,080
I feel like they were involved as much as a teacher's involved

2509
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,680
in a group project you might have,

2510
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:09,160
where they check in on your idea and give you gentle guidance.

2511
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,760
And the more lost you are, the more they step in.

2512
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,760
Right.

2513
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,320
It's a nurturing role.

2514
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,440
Although maybe somebody's like, my proudest

2515
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,600
accomplishments at Disney, California screaming,

2516
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,360
and Tower of Terror, and got to go with the baby genitalia

2517
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,760
machine.

2518
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:27,760
My three proudest.

2519
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,040
Put those on my tombstone.

2520
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,960
I was the one who made the choice

2521
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,640
that Innoventions in Epcot, the pathways through it,

2522
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,360
would look like little roads.

2523
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:41,840
So there was white lines with brakes that you could pass,

2524
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,800
and yellow lines if you shouldn't

2525
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,240
be walking on that side.

2526
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,000
It added some whimsy.

2527
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,880
Roads indoors, they said.

2528
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,640
They left me out of the room, but I showed them.

2529
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,640
Well, if you were on a Segway, that

2530
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,800
would make a lot more sense.

2531
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,280
Now it's a division of the traffic lines, right or left?

2532
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,960
All the sidewalks are going to have that one.

2533
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,800
Segways are the new thing.

2534
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,720
It's coming up.

2535
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,800
Any day now.

2536
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,120
We're going to wake up, and it's going to just have happened.

2537
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,640
We're in Segway worlds.

2538
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,440
Tomorrowland 2020 will be the future that never was,

2539
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,400
but it was the future predicted in 1999.

2540
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:23,680
So a lot of Segways, a lot of in the promotional,

2541
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,080
one of the Innoventions specials,

2542
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,760
are like, in the future, your phone's just going to disappear.

2543
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,920
You won't have a phone.

2544
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,920
It'll be in your TV and your coffee maker.

2545
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,760
And you have Osmo instead of a smartphone.

2546
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,880
And you have Osmo.

2547
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,480
And they were kind of right.

2548
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,280
And also, they were horrifically wrong.

2549
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:43,040
Now our phones are like drugs that we can never

2550
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,800
be without them.

2551
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,680
Well, maybe this was a juncture point in Britain.

2552
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,920
Maybe we wouldn't be in all the messes that we're in if we

2553
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,000
didn't have these things.

2554
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,520
And we just had little eager Osmos want to climb stairs.

2555
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:58,080
Eager Osmos, more curved metal, more curved plastics.

2556
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:02,000
And we all go out and we're not connected to each other

2557
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,560
because we're looking at our phones.

2558
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,640
But if to be connected to the internet,

2559
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:10,160
require you to carry around a 500 pound baby at all times.

2560
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,400
Right?

2561
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,400
Yeah, we need to go.

2562
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,000
This is the almanac I want to go back and get.

2563
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,080
And when you want a picture of something,

2564
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,600
you say, Osmo, take a picture.

2565
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,560
And he goes, well, what do you like me to take a picture of?

2566
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,360
And you have to point your finger very precisely at what

2567
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,040
he's going to take a picture of.

2568
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,520
It's a three minute ordeal.

2569
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,080
You have to kind of lean over his shoulder

2570
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,360
to see what it'll look like from his perspective.

2571
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:33,360
Or aperture.

2572
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,200
And then he emails it to you and you can look at it at home.

2573
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,480
Portrait or landscape.

2574
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,400
Yeah.

2575
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,440
It will be from a low POV.

2576
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,840
I am very short.

2577
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:44,840
Unless I climb stairs.

2578
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,240
A lot of them flattering selfies.

2579
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,640
Instagram would have never existed.

2580
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,240
Sure.

2581
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,320
Everyone from chin down.

2582
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,720
Osmo is the solution to the selfie.

2583
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,400
But if you were using a stranger's Osmo,

2584
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,800
it would be constantly, sorry, I security lock.

2585
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,720
How do I?

2586
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,920
Yeah, and he wouldn't know how to recognize your face.

2587
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,080
So he would not focus on you.

2588
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,400
I was not told I can trust you.

2589
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,800
You are not my owner.

2590
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,720
I would also like it if he was just upset when you would check

2591
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,120
and make sure he was doing something.

2592
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,920
No, I'm OK.

2593
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:16,120
I took a few.

2594
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,560
Come on.

2595
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,400
It's fine.

2596
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,040
You don't need to check.

2597
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:21,600
Who are you?

2598
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,560
Mom?

2599
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,120
Dad?

2600
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,720
I am never shaky.

2601
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,960
I'm very steady.

2602
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,040
Get off my ass, everyone.

2603
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,960
I'm tired of this.

2604
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,680
So did you guys experience the show

2605
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:37,960
that was in the smart home?

2606
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,400
Not only the intro show with Osmo and the interactive stuff,

2607
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,120
they had a tiny theater you could go into,

2608
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,960
where you would go on a virtual vacation to one of three places.

2609
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,080
Oh, yeah.

2610
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,840
The walls were screens, and they would pump one smell per location.

2611
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,880
So if it was like a camp, it would be like a woodsy smell.

2612
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:01,040
Or if it was a jungle, it would be like some kind of tropical smell

2613
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,840
or like beach smell.

2614
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,400
And the seats didn't move.

2615
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,360
And I think there were only like five seats.

2616
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:09,480
It was like a single row of movie theater chairs.

2617
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,920
And then you picked your destination

2618
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,000
and they'd be like, OK, you're at a vineyard.

2619
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,800
And they'd be like, ooh.

2620
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,920
And then you'd leave.

2621
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,240
So is that as if soon you will take vacations in chairs at home?

2622
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:26,640
I guess they thought in the future you would have all your walls

2623
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,720
be screens and buy scents.

2624
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,200
And there will be just different vats of scents

2625
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,840
that you will keep for different vacations you want to come and go.

2626
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,340
Exactly.

2627
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:37,960
Instead of just buying a candle, you're going to get a scent machine.

2628
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,560
That's like vacations of Fahrenheit 451.

2629
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,880
That sounds like a nightmare.

2630
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,880
And I was always questioning how much of a return

2631
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,200
you get for a room with walls that are screens over just looking

2632
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,280
at a video of the same image.

2633
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:59,280
How much more are you deceived by bigger screens than just like,

2634
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,920
you still don't think you're there.

2635
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,680
And the Wi-Fi keeps cutting out.

2636
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,200
Yeah.

2637
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,640
And it's all low res.

2638
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,280
And it's not a VR.

2639
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,120
Yeah, no, it's not.

2640
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,800
We're adults, so it wouldn't trick us.

2641
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,720
But if you had a child and raised it in a world where

2642
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,960
they thought that was traveling.

2643
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,120
So if you're constantly deceiving your own child

2644
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:25,800
into thinking they're going on vacations, then you raise them that way.

2645
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,440
You train them not to enjoy vacations, so they make no demands of you.

2646
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,880
Don't ever get curious about the outside world.

2647
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,360
See, look, we just stepped into another room,

2648
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:41,320
which took us to Colonial Williamsburg, which smelled like tar.

2649
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,720
So you never want you never want to go there again.

2650
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:48,320
I hope you want to go back because we bought at least a liter of the tar smell

2651
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,160
and it's super concentrated.

2652
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,680
So we have to go at least 60 more times.

2653
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,760
Unless any of you folks would like some tar scent.

2654
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:01,360
Yeah. Your dad got upsold on tar smell at the vacation store.

2655
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,720
Salesmen really talked it up.

2656
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,000
Like if you get five at once, it's like four of them are free.

2657
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,680
Yeah. Yeah.

2658
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,480
You got to get the tar.

2659
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,160
I don't.

2660
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,000
Future Giants.

2661
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,560
I went in and I think, but my memory of it is just so nothing.

2662
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,240
Because I think every room, so they had like the kitchen,

2663
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,440
which was the demo space. There was a piano in there, right?

2664
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,240
Yeah, there was a smart piano.

2665
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,760
But like people would play it as well. They would.

2666
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,920
I think I tried playing it.

2667
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,200
Smart was like the keys would light up to like a guitar hero of a piano.

2668
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,320
Yes, that's right.

2669
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,360
So if you didn't know how to play, in theory, it would teach you,

2670
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,280
which I think is a tech people buy now.

2671
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,200
Yeah, yeah, it is.

2672
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:38,880
I think our pianos.

2673
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,440
We had a keyboard that did that in like 1995.

2674
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,520
But it was built into a real piano.

2675
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,080
Oh, it's built in. Oh, OK.

2676
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,280
Yeah, well, I think keyboards have done that for a long time.

2677
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:48,800
Yeah, yeah.

2678
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,840
I feel you and I were in that room and I think I sat down at the piano.

2679
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,760
Maybe maybe I'm mixing up my time.

2680
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,040
I definitely remember.

2681
01:35:55,040 --> 01:36:00,040
I remember going once in like 2012 and making the connection of like, oh,

2682
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,120
dream home, like House of the like the old House of the Future.

2683
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,280
How cool.

2684
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,280
What an interesting throwback concept.

2685
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,520
And they did not lean on the nostalgia.

2686
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,920
They just leaned on the Microsoft. Yeah, not at all.

2687
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:15,000
I remember being more entertained by like at some point you got

2688
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:19,000
like one of the light bulbs that you can change the colors on from your phone.

2689
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,920
Like, yeah, yeah.

2690
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,080
Eleven or 2012.

2691
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,440
And we were all kind of like, oh, shit, check this out.

2692
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:27,000
And that entertained us for longer, I think, than the house.

2693
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,440
The tree. Oh, yeah.

2694
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,000
Oh, yeah. 100 percent.

2695
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,120
They had that was like a missing the mark kind of thing was

2696
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,120
they did have app controlled light dimmers.

2697
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:38,920
And I think in theory, like the temperature control, although obviously

2698
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,880
you can actually control it in the demo. Yeah.

2699
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,440
But instead of deciding it would be on your phone,

2700
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:48,160
they believed that in the future, people would attach tablets to their walls

2701
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:52,160
permanently and just go up to the tablet to control it instead of like

2702
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:54,440
having a thing in your pocket to control it from.

2703
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,920
So, you know, if you want to do the lights in every room,

2704
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,200
you have to walk to the wall switch tablet.

2705
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,440
So it's not any more convenient than having a dimmer switch.

2706
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:08,720
I used to work at an office that had like some tablets framed outside of like

2707
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:12,760
common you like conference rooms and stuff so that you could like

2708
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,160
you could just slide over.

2709
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:18,040
You could slide over just whether it was occupied or not,

2710
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,520
which must have just been like the photos app on an iPad.

2711
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,800
And those iPads were turned on for about two weeks, I think.

2712
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,120
And then just I could see it having that instead of a switch,

2713
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,680
if it fulfilled like many functions, like if it was temperature,

2714
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,800
whether it's occupied, what's in it, and then maybe an app.

2715
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,760
If you're lost in the building and need to know where to go.

2716
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,680
But it seemed like it only ever replaced a thing a switch could do

2717
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:45,560
and did the same thing a switch would do. Yeah.

2718
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,920
I think they had that Neil Patrick Harris's character has that on an iPad

2719
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:55,000
in Gone Girl, and it's meant to be like, look at this insane person.

2720
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,480
It was gotten surveillance and can control everything in his home

2721
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:01,600
from his iPad. Look at this weirdo.

2722
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,280
A man of the future.

2723
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,520
A man of the future.

2724
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:07,280
You want to be like Neil Patrick Harris in Gone Girl.

2725
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,680
Spoiler alert, he does not get to see much of that future, folks.

2726
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,360
But yeah, it doesn't work out so great for him.

2727
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,320
You know, in keeping with

2728
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:21,360
interventions being the home of characters no one is fond of,

2729
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,760
there was also apparently something called Body Builder, a 3D game

2730
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,440
allowing guests to build digital human body.

2731
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:33,480
It featured the voice of Wallace Shawn as Dr. Bones. That's great.

2732
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,000
I mean, I'm kind of into I wish I'd met Dr.

2733
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,840
Bones. Yeah, but nobody ever told you it was good.

2734
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,040
No, we character, I guess so.

2735
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,520
And maybe just a voice. Yeah.

2736
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:46,680
So if how good could it have been if nobody ever alerted you

2737
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:50,760
that there was a wall of Shawn characters only in theme parks that you could go see?

2738
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,760
Because there's no part scale for this.

2739
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,160
There's no Park star Dr.

2740
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:55,640
Bones that I have or anything.

2741
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,280
These are think about this list.

2742
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,760
Electronic Tom Morrow, Tom Morrow, 2.0.

2743
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,600
None of them are Park stars.

2744
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,800
They made six wave five waves of them.

2745
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,520
Even Sunny Eclipse is a Park star.

2746
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,480
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, of course.

2747
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:10,080
I mean, there's much more obscure characters in Sunny Eclipse, too.

2748
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,920
Who would you say is the most obscure Park star?

2749
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,240
Oh, that's a good question that I now feel like.

2750
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,440
You set it up. I set it up.

2751
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,960
I got one. Yeah. Laguna Gator.

2752
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:18,960
Yes, that's good.

2753
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,880
The old mascot of Typhoon Lagoon.

2754
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,480
Typhoon Lagoon. Yeah.

2755
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:25,120
Yeah, not the brother of the ice skater.

2756
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,360
Is he no longer the mascot?

2757
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,680
I think he might still be.

2758
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,320
He was never prominent like ice skater. Not obscure.

2759
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,120
Not as obscure. Well, Wally Bogue is kind of obscure.

2760
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,440
Wally Bogue, the human man, is a Park star.

2761
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,440
Yes, I have him. Yeah.

2762
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,160
Wally Bogue, Abraham Lincoln.

2763
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,760
And I feel like there's one other real life person.

2764
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,480
Yeah, I forget.

2765
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,080
Abraham Lincoln is also an animatronic. Wally Bogue is not.

2766
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,080
No, he's a man. He's definitely a man.

2767
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,600
That's what makes that really weird.

2768
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah. You know, you could get a Wally Bogue.

2769
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,200
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

2770
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,360
But no Eisner. No Eisner.

2771
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,120
We want more Eisner merch.

2772
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:57,720
That's a big thing on this podcast.

2773
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:58,960
Like for voodoo purposes?

2774
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,120
No, we like. No, we like him.

2775
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,320
We have a fondness for him.

2776
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,560
We have the specials when he would introduce, you know, like.

2777
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,800
Did he just spend an hour and a half complaining about an attraction

2778
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,280
that he thought of? Yes, but.

2779
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:13,640
Yeah, he tried to like make himself a character like a Walt Disney.

2780
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,520
And he succeeded in our hearts.

2781
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,720
And we want a hundred dollar deluxe toy of him.

2782
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,040
We won't stop until we get it.

2783
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,120
Oh, like one of those super realistic ones.

2784
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,960
Yeah, like like Marvel characters like this Adam West.

2785
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,680
Adam taught toys by Adam West.

2786
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:28,680
And I have over here. Yes, that's what we want.

2787
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:29,880
Yeah, Michael Eisner.

2788
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:33,760
Are we are we anywhere near the hundredth episode of this show?

2789
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,600
Did we close?

2790
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,560
Oh, we were close. If we're OK.

2791
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:41,720
Well, if we're 80, I have this is 80 in my weird numbering system.

2792
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,800
They were just for me.

2793
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,440
I'm going to tease a little something.

2794
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:49,640
Oh, I have a Michael Eisner related surprise that I will be really

2795
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,880
that I will be sharing with you guys and the audience for the 100th episode.

2796
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,320
Whoa, 100th episode spectacular.

2797
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,440
Let that be an exciting.

2798
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,280
I'm excited about this.

2799
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:02,360
Almost as exciting as my father being on a lot to look forward to.

2800
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,200
And that one out, that's a surprise.

2801
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,960
Yeah. Oh, shoot.

2802
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,360
I'm glad it's in this one.

2803
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,440
Well, what have we missed?

2804
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,200
You know, I don't think we like I don't think we really acknowledge.

2805
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,960
I didn't talk about bedroom of the future.

2806
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,480
Oh, please. Yes, which was the final room of the House of the Future.

2807
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,640
And it was like a girl's room.

2808
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,840
And it also had a tablet control.

2809
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:27,320
But it also had like a smart mirror where you could virtually try on outfits.

2810
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,040
And clueless.

2811
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,960
Yeah. And it was very dated tech.

2812
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,680
So it did not work well.

2813
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:37,080
It was just kind of a hovering image of a cartoon outfit in front of your body

2814
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,560
that like kind of synced up to your movements.

2815
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,440
And we went in there today.

2816
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,800
It would be readily that.

2817
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,560
Yeah, that was something that you could easily do.

2818
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,840
Probably on your phone.

2819
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,960
No, you could probably do an app where you take a picture of yourself

2820
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,000
and upload it to a site or something. I would imagine.

2821
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,640
But they also had like a computer that I think had its own game of some kind.

2822
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,960
But my sister went over to it and immediately hit control.

2823
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,400
I'll delete, I guess, just to see what it did.

2824
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,280
And it just crashed everything in the room.

2825
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:11,080
And like the mirror had like an error warning that popped up

2826
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,440
like on the smart mirror, which was obviously just a screen

2827
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,840
hooked up to a computer that was in the same system.

2828
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,680
And she was like, oh, oh, no, something happened.

2829
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,400
And I was just immediately like, we have to go.

2830
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,440
And I just like physically dragged her out of the room.

2831
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,640
I was like, I want to be out of this house of the future

2832
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,840
before someone notices that you broke it.

2833
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:31,280
But yeah, that's my strongest memory about the house of the future.

2834
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,720
Were you worried that the control all delete would also turn the Osmos evil?

2835
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:38,240
Yes. Everything's going south, which they couldn't.

2836
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,120
They can really chase after you.

2837
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,840
But if you were running outside and one of them was trying to start to jog

2838
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,680
after us, but fall over back.

2839
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:48,440
No gods, no masters, no god.

2840
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,480
But it would remember my face after it looked at me.

2841
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:54,040
So, yeah, you're never really clear.

2842
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,600
If you went back four years later.

2843
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,000
Yeah.

2844
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,800
You might like lightly try to punch you start walking toward you and never tire.

2845
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,480
Take this. It's like it follows.

2846
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,600
But with Osmo,

2847
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,920
yeah, that's a good idea.

2848
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,120
He's slow, but he doesn't stop.

2849
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,600
It might take it might be like 12 years, but he will track you down.

2850
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:15,040
And he might need a stranger to like put him back on his feet.

2851
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,440
Please help.

2852
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,200
I don't think we acknowledged enough that they

2853
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:26,600
suckered the Sherman Brothers into doing a new right.

2854
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,640
But they really reassize it.

2855
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:33,280
Yeah. And in this opening special that I found, they you can see them

2856
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,800
singing the new song.

2857
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,600
No. Yeah.

2858
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:37,600
They're still alive.

2859
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,240
Someone else read it. The lyrics.

2860
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,280
No, they like we did it.

2861
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,720
He had a song about sports.

2862
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,160
He had a song about the house.

2863
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,000
I think they did it.

2864
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,840
I think they wrote that's devastating.

2865
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,920
You can say I found the video.

2866
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,920
I'll send it. I'll send around.

2867
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:50,120
They you can see them go.

2868
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,560
It's a great big world of in a bench.

2869
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,000
It kind of crushes your spirit.

2870
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,400
It's like, I don't know.

2871
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:02,360
It has a vibe. It's it feels like I like watching the guy.

2872
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,000
And this is when they were both still alive.

2873
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,600
Yeah. Yeah.

2874
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,360
That's even sadder.

2875
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,000
What if it was the one guy's last work?

2876
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,320
It could have been man.

2877
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,560
Although he's the surviving one, the lyricist or the melody man.

2878
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,720
I think the lyricist that's still alive.

2879
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:20,000
Well, Robert is a or Richard is alive and he's the guy who played the piano.

2880
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,920
Oh, OK.

2881
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:22,480
The other one's just kind of sitting there.

2882
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,840
He oh yeah, he would.

2883
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,200
He is the one who clearly saw some stuff in the war.

2884
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,040
Yeah, he was the one who came back from the war.

2885
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,600
He was like injured and he had PTSD, right?

2886
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:32,480
Something. Yeah.

2887
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:35,160
I'm like probably undiagnosed because it was the olden days.

2888
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,960
Right. They're just like, yeah, just get over it.

2889
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,560
Yeah. Yeah. If you're a man, you'll be fine.

2890
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,280
But then, yeah, stuff it down.

2891
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:44,680
Yeah. But then he would come up with like some whimsical lyric about something.

2892
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,760
He was lyricist guy. Yeah.

2893
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:50,040
Oh, so like the weird like the the stuff that makes you cry,

2894
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,920
like the feed the birds kind of stuff. Yeah.

2895
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:56,320
Well, so the reason I asked is because that is sadder because the only one

2896
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:00,120
that really had to redo anything for InnoVentions was the lyrics guy.

2897
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,400
So it may well have been his last work.

2898
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,200
Oh, my God, we have to look at it.

2899
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,600
If it was the last work of the melody man, I'd be like, well, he already wrote the melody.

2900
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,560
So that's not sad.

2901
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,120
Right. They did that musical, right?

2902
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:12,880
Didn't they? Wasn't there a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang musical that they did some new songs for?

2903
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,720
Oh, yeah. Maybe that's right.

2904
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,920
Like a stage. Yeah, yeah.

2905
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,720
I ran in the West End. You're right. You're right.

2906
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,880
I've run long at the West End.

2907
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:21,760
Yeah. I forget. Yeah.

2908
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,160
But they what a nice way to go out to like write, you know,

2909
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,840
like there is a man named Dr.

2910
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,600
Bones to find him just beyond the future home.

2911
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,920
I don't think that I don't think they'll know.

2912
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,880
Pretty good. That would have been pretty. Oh, yeah.

2913
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,520
Yeah. Yeah.

2914
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,440
Your phones disappear into TV.

2915
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,520
Now go try some virtual reality.

2916
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:53,320
The example they showed in one of the specials of virtual reality was the magic carpet ride.

2917
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,520
Oh, yeah, there was a real look at the Disney Disney Quest one.

2918
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:00,600
Well, it looks like a primitive version of the Disney Quest one that goes.

2919
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,240
And they had that in California.

2920
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,080
I think it was in Orlando.

2921
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,080
I also don't know how far.

2922
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,760
But that sounds good.

2923
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,920
The my other favorite thing of the opening

2924
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:14,720
is when the the guy who was the representative for Sega

2925
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:18,640
says the phrase in the most monotone voice,

2926
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,920
the Sega experience is going to be overwhelming.

2927
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,000
We might just have to do a commentary track for that special.

2928
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,360
Yeah, that's a good idea.

2929
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:33,560
You know, I wrote down who that guy is, Tom Kalinsky, who's a major figure in Sega history.

2930
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:34,560
I didn't look into it too much.

2931
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,280
But like if you're apparently the book, Console Wars, which now I do want to read.

2932
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:42,360
Yeah, he's responsible for a lot of Sega innovation,

2933
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:45,640
interventions, including the scream.

2934
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,680
He like pushed the scream.

2935
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,280
This is our Sega. Oh, really?

2936
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:53,840
I don't know if he thought of it, but he's the guy who's like, that is our hook.

2937
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:58,320
Sega. So that boring guy was the guy who thought it was memorable.

2938
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,120
I know Sega. That's it's memorable.

2939
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,360
That's a scream.

2940
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:05,640
I don't know. Well, that's when that's when it's turned on.

2941
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,240
That's when you turn it on.

2942
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:10,040
OK, yeah, that's the Genesis startup sound.

2943
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:10,880
I think they dropped it.

2944
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,880
Well, I'm sure that you're discovering now that I didn't have a Genesis.

2945
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:16,120
That's why I know none of us were Genesis kids.

2946
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,600
I had a Genesis. I had a Genesis.

2947
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:22,200
You said you were a Nintendo house. I was a Nintendo house. Hey, boy.

2948
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,680
That was our six. We we so we got in.

2949
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:27,600
I think when I was like in second grade, we got Nintendo.

2950
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:32,080
See, all right. Lindsay was a Genesis kid and she is proud.

2951
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,880
In fifth grade, I think we got a Genesis.

2952
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:36,600
And then when I was in seventh grade, we've got an N64.

2953
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:40,840
We always got the systems when it was a little into the like a couple

2954
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:44,480
years into the life run when you would get like Disney to.

2955
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Well, sure.

2956
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:50,400
Yeah, so we had and then eventually once my brother, my brother was very good

2957
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,320
at saving his money to get new games and systems and stuff.

2958
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,280
And that's when I sort of faded out from from video games.

2959
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,040
Checked out a bit.

2960
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:01,360
Did anyone have a dream cast? No, no, but I loved playing the demos and stores

2961
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:04,280
like they were good about getting those demos and stores.

2962
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,240
And I would love to play.

2963
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,000
What was it? Knights Knights?

2964
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Yeah, Knights. The first Sonic Adventure had a great demo.

2965
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:14,440
Yes. First level in the cool cut scene with like chaos breaking out of the building.

2966
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:17,000
And you'd go, what's that? Oh, my God.

2967
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,000
Good for Sonic.

2968
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:24,160
Any any closing thoughts about interventions before we wrap it up?

2969
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:27,600
I mean, what what can you say about an attraction like interventions?

2970
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,000
I mean, what would we how would we plus it up?

2971
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,400
I was going to be my question.

2972
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:34,440
What would you guys do if you got if you were in charge of the new

2973
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:35,520
interventions project?

2974
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,480
You guys mean you don't like spectacular brought you by Marotta

2975
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,360
electronic components?

2976
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:49,360
The one thing to current clients is is the color topia and then spectacular.

2977
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:53,200
Inventions West entirely closed in 2015,

2978
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,480
and they claimed they were going to do something with it.

2979
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,400
Nothing has really happened.

2980
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:00,520
I believe that you some of it is still in there behind the scene.

2981
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,720
I think you can see it on the YouTube channel for that back to our Disney

2982
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:08,720
account, an account that seems to constantly be having a very normal one,

2983
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,800
very regular.

2984
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,280
Oh, just a balanced guy.

2985
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,280
Just really.

2986
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:17,520
Everything seems great over there.

2987
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,640
He's definitely in like a great time in his life.

2988
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:24,040
It's having a normal one all the time.

2989
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:27,920
So yeah, a lot of the 90s kind of design stuff still hanging out in there.

2990
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,280
So who knows what will happen?

2991
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,640
Oh, interesting fact, I learned this is probably more for the communicator one.

2992
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:37,920
Those buildings were built so high because they blew sky early on.

2993
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,200
We're thinking about putting a people mover,

2994
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,360
connecting them where you could look down.

2995
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,360
Wow.

2996
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,600
It's a breeze.

2997
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,520
Oh, yeah, that would have taken it up a real.

2998
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:52,040
So I think that like an actual like more science driven,

2999
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:55,880
because I think like Cornell University did sponsor some exhibits at some point.

3000
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:00,560
So a more science and academic and nonprofit driven one, I would be interested.

3001
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,080
So is that what you would do if you could decide more science?

3002
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,080
Yeah, more science stuff and a people mover to oversee it all.

3003
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,560
More sonic is what I say.

3004
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:09,920
Sonic the Hedgehog. Yeah.

3005
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,240
Why can't they get sonic?

3006
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,080
Make all of the things sonic.

3007
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,600
So it's a health exhibit, but it's sonic and you're like running.

3008
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,520
And then you could see Sonic and Tails or Amy.

3009
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,040
Who was Amy a character?

3010
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,640
Yes. Amy Rose. Amy Rose.

3011
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:25,360
Right. Come on, Mike.

3012
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,800
Well, I forget because I stopped playing.

3013
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,840
I'm a big Sonic fan, but I can't could show up.

3014
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,240
Those are the characters.

3015
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,200
Big the Cat.

3016
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:37,320
I'm only tangentially familiar with that when they introduce all those characters.

3017
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:40,120
So I know. Look, I'm an old school

3018
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,440
rotor guy from the Archie comics.

3019
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:47,040
I read the walrus and Sally.

3020
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,880
And what was it?

3021
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:51,400
A little fox with the Colonel's outfit on Antoine.

3022
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,960
I was waiting. Yes.

3023
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,840
I was way into that.

3024
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,440
I was a way into the ABC cartoon.

3025
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:59,000
Antoine was definitely the weirdest concept.

3026
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,200
Yeah, he wore like a little generals outfit.

3027
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,040
He was a Frenchman and his character trait was that he was a coward.

3028
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:08,160
Yes. He was a one joke character.

3029
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,680
And they always had to like phonetically write out his French accent.

3030
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,280
I'm sure they really just busted it.

3031
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:17,640
So Vichy France exists in Sonic canon.

3032
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,360
Funny Sonic cartoon or dark Sonic cartoon?

3033
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,720
Oh, dark all the way. Yeah.

3034
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,280
Funny. I didn't care for that much.

3035
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:26,680
And there was a lot of like the Sonic Saturday morning one

3036
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,600
where everyone's getting roboticized.

3037
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,840
Yes. Maybe it was dark.

3038
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,320
And I really liked it.

3039
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:34,600
They were both your little white voiced.

3040
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,360
But I think they put all the characters.

3041
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,560
You can meet all the characters, theme, all these like loose

3042
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:42,840
corporate things to whatever Sonic and his character.

3043
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,800
Fantastic.

3044
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,160
Now you got me in there.

3045
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:49,520
Maybe it's a little chintzy, but it's tied to an IP that I love.

3046
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:51,720
And it's done deal. I'm into it.

3047
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:52,600
It's a go Sonic.

3048
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,880
Oh, wait. Well, let me tie it to an IP I love.

3049
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,000
You said Jaleel White.

3050
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,160
This is one fact that I missed that interventions was the home

3051
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:06,080
of the invention of the year contest in the Disney World episode of Family Matters.

3052
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,360
This was the first public demonstration

3053
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:14,400
of the transformation machine that turned Steve Urkel into Stefan or Kel.

3054
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:20,040
Laura broke off a piece so that he would stay stuck.

3055
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:22,120
Stefan or Kel.

3056
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:26,880
But so, you know, this the machine had only been used in the Winslow's

3057
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,320
basement or wherever Urkel lived.

3058
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,600
This is the first public demonstration of it.

3059
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,520
This is science history.

3060
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,400
This is pop culture history.

3061
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,880
Yep. The first place.

3062
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:42,560
And he ended up David Lander from Laverne and Shirley challenged.

3063
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,560
He had a suitcase car, which initially worked better.

3064
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:49,880
People did not believe that the transformation machine was real and really worked.

3065
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:56,360
In a really stirring emotional two parter, eventually

3066
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:01,440
spoiler Urkel bests David Lander and wins the contest.

3067
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:06,360
So if you'll carve out a little bit of Sega for me to constantly tribute.

3068
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:11,120
Would it be an animatronics driven dark ride conveying the story you just told us?

3069
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:11,920
Hell, yeah.

3070
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:15,680
Yeah, it could be a full ride because it's again, the moral is it's better

3071
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:18,040
to stay the way you are and never leave your home.

3072
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:19,440
Hmm. Yeah.

3073
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,040
Like you mean like so it's like a little like morality tale.

3074
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:24,080
Yeah, but now Urkel singing at the end.

3075
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,800
It's better to stay the way you are.

3076
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:32,000
If and also like doing the snow white witch effect, but a fun version

3077
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:35,520
where you're looking in a mirror and it's Urkel and then he turns and he turns

3078
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,400
around and you see the back of normal Urkel and instead of, you know,

3079
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:42,920
shoving an apple in your face, he's offering you a rose, a rose,

3080
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:45,360
a rose for you, my lady.

3081
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:45,960
Yeah.

3082
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:46,960
Mm hmm.

3083
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,640
Stefano Urkel's famous catchphrase and of course, yeah.

3084
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:56,480
So put that I want Stefano Urkel presence and if not burn it to the ground

3085
01:53:56,680 --> 01:54:01,480
for insurance money, except for the electric umbrella restaurant,

3086
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,240
which I like because it looks like a 90s Edwards movie.

3087
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:05,760
Oh, OK. It's sick.

3088
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,200
Yeah, we can all agree on that.

3089
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,840
I have two ideas for what to go for.

3090
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:11,040
Yeah. OK. For California.

3091
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:15,400
My first idea when I didn't know what I know now is I for a long time

3092
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,720
wanted the interventions building to become the new Q building for something

3093
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,280
utilizing the people mover track.

3094
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:24,000
Yeah. Because it used to load from the building that's now Buzz Lightyear.

3095
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,720
They couldn't use that anymore.

3096
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:29,400
So I was like, that's plenty of space to put like a big wrap around Q

3097
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,160
and loading bay on the upper deck.

3098
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:33,360
And it's attached to the people mover track already.

3099
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:37,680
Yeah. But then I found out that, A, the people mover track is no longer complete.

3100
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:40,560
It has a big chunk out of it at the Buzz Lightyear building.

3101
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,360
But they could rebuild that.

3102
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,120
But the bigger issue is that it's no longer to code

3103
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,000
and they'd have to totally redo all of it to ever use it again.

3104
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:52,200
So if we're going with the actual budget that might be given to an

3105
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:57,000
innoventions project, I would decide that in like Florida's

3106
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,480
Tomorrowland, my favorite thing, which is now gone, is

3107
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:05,520
all the set dressing things like the electric palm trees, the robot newsy.

3108
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,040
The phone of the future.

3109
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:12,480
So for me, I'm taking a page out of the Mickey Mouse house in Toontown

3110
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:16,280
and doing the equivalent of that, but for like fun future ambiance.

3111
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,120
And that would just be the interior of innoventions is different scenery

3112
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:24,680
of fun, futuristic things that are also photo ops to appeal to the Instagram

3113
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:28,960
generation, who likes to go to those pop up museums and take pictures with everything.

3114
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,760
And if it's something more involved, like a ball pit or something,

3115
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,040
there's like a line for it.

3116
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,400
But otherwise, you just wander around and take pics.

3117
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,800
I feel like this is probably a silly question to ask.

3118
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,880
Would push the trash can be there?

3119
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:41,840
Yes, of course. Great.

3120
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:42,560
I'm on board.

3121
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,240
And then, you know, one room can have like a single animatronic

3122
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:48,520
of like sunny eclipse type that's maybe performing or something.

3123
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,480
Sounds good to me.

3124

That was the first one. OK, great.

3127
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,920
And it's a perfect pop up. Perfect.

Yes, in cosmic.

3141
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,840
Two empty crowds.

3142
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:46,040
Yes, often empty.

3143
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,680
To talk about him for a while.

3144
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:51,080

3147
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:01,080
But that's the ride.

3148
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:02,520
Thanks for being back.

3149
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,080
Much appreciated.

3150
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,880
Any any time, really?

3151
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,800
What a fun topic as well.

3152
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,480
Oh, thanks for bringing it to us.

3153
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,920
I know. I was pulling for InnoVentions.

3154
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,200
Yeah, yeah.

3155
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,680
Well, yeah, you got it.

3156
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,760

And if you listen to the Patreon first and you're hearing this second.

3160
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,280
Thank you. I don't have any.

3161
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,240
Yep.

3162
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:33,400
Just a reminder that InnoVentions is a portmanteau of invention and innovation.

3163
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:34,240
Sure.

3164
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:36,400
Jenny, do you want to exit through the gift shop real quick?

3165
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,080
Plug, plug all your stuff.

3166
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,320
Yes, let me exit through the gift shop.

3167
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:44,880

3171
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:55,480
sometimes just miscellaneous things I want to talk about.

3172
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:56,840
Sure. Yeah.

3173
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:58,560
You do. Yeah, you do great stuff.

3174
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,280
Yeah, my channel doesn't have a theme anymore.

3175
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:02,520
It's just whatever I talk about.

3176
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,640
That's great. Yeah.

3177
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:05,600
Why? Yeah. Don't don't box yourself in.

3178
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:08,480
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, indeed.
