1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,120
And now, to honor America, a podcast that may feature a litany of public domain songs,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,600
sad mice, sad rabbits, sad possums, and of course the dreaded bodiness.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,220
Find out which exhausting old timey song Jason thinks is a bop as we deal with America Sings

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,120
on podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,920
Welcome to podcast The Ride, a show where if you like hearing the names of corny ass

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,960
public domain songs uttered, this is the episode for you.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm here and let the public domain names begin.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Let the public domain of folky nonsense begin.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,480
You could be any sort of pop star now and do any of the songs that America Sings and

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,640
do them for free because of their public domain.

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,440
So Dua Lipa could do Yankee Doodle Dandy.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,160
Except like the last quarter of this show.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Oh, right.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Yes.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,480
Three Dog Nights would have something to say to you.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,280
Oh yeah, there's some copyright going on.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Scott Gardner is also here.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,920
Yeah, there's I think three copyrighted songs amidst a bunch of old bullshit.

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Yes.

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm so glad we're all on the same page about this.

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,760
I think we are.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,960
Yes, America Sings Likers.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,160
Apologies if yeah, we all came in with an energy.

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,120
I feel like it's an assumption that this thing was like, oh, we might be a little more endeared

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,280
to it than we are.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,320
It has all the ingredients of something that you would like on paper, you'd go, oh, wow,

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,200
this show that none of us got to see live.

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,680
I don't think right because it's we would be no.

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,720
No, yeah, nobody's here is to logistically.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,200
You may have been able to see it between the ages of like one and three because it closed

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
in 88.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,760
Yeah, I think it may be because I think the first time I went was 88.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
So it could have been there.

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,880
You could have my parents maybe didn't feel like it.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,360
And I asked my mom about it this morning and she had no idea what I was talking about.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,520
And you guys lived out here.

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
I just talked.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,000
I was just talking to my parents and they're like, oh, what's the topic for the show today?

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,280
And I said, oh, America Sings.

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
It's nothing.

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
No recognition.

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Like, what?

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,000
And my mom is much more in Disney.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,320
But we you know, she went to Disneyland in 19, I don't know, 70 something maybe the last.

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
But I don't know.

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,240
She apparently she knows she loves Burl Ives's singing voice, but she doesn't know America

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Sings.

52
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah.

53
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,200
I mean, it's not the fondest of feelings for this thing.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
But look, it's Fourth of July weekend.

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,600
We're all excited about it.

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,840
We had to talk about something patriotic.

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Right.

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Or are we making that up?

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,000
I think we might be making it up.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,840
But it feels nice, doesn't it?

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,040
We give ourselves a lot of puzzles and rules and metrics to do the show.

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,760
And this might be an example of like, oh, maybe we we may have stepped in a snare of

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
something.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,240
They're going to want they're going to want to hear about a thing that even our moms don't

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,960
know about or like they're going to need to.

66
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
It's going to boost the SEO.

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,520
Everybody's going to be searching America all weekend.

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,840
That's what I do the whole weekend is just type America into Google.

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Yes.

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
30 times a day.

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,560
We have the ceiling to floor list of federal and postal holidays.

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,120
And we're like, well, we've got to make sure when these come.

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,120
And every any piece of media that I consume, I expect some sort of patriotic version of

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
it or episodes like Hacks is on.

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,280
And I expect there will be a sort of Fourth of July hacks.

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,880
I understand the season is over, but I think that that'll probably happen.

77
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Right.

78
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Mayor of Easttown.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Yes, they'll be July.

80
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Yes.

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah.

82
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,920
Of course, America, Fourth of July.

83
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,360
Yeah, for sure.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
There's always going to be a Fourth of July special.

85
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,800
Stone's Delaware County.

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Are you kidding?

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Oh, that's true.

88
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
You know, completely.

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah, you have to.

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,280
So the audience is jazzed.

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,920
Yeah, they're absolutely jazzed.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,160
I really am talking about if we're going to do rides about every holiday or to cover rides

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,360
that cover every holiday, I really hope that there's not some Columbus ride that we are

94
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
aware of.

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,080
If there is some cursed Christopher Columbus attraction, it's some Godforsaken park.

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
There's got to be a Columbus ride.

97
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
There's got to be something.

98
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
The tales of Chris.

99
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,920
Let me I'm looking it up right now.

100
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,240
Kind of a Sinbad, like an attempt at an inspiring.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,840
He made friends everywhere he went.

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,840
Well, power of friendship and then brought on the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.

103
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
And they all talk.

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
The three ships all.

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I'm Nina.

106
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,320
Now, that is kind of that vibe is kind of present in this attraction because one of

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,280
the like the thesis of this ride is like, let's talk about the history of songs in America

108
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,200
and the music in America.

109
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,040
And Ollie Owl says, like, where did they come from?

110
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,160
And Burl Ives, Sam Eagle or Eagle Sam, not Muppet Eagle Sam, but he goes like, well,

111
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,480
people brought them from their home countries.

112
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
And it's like, that's bullshit.

113
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,880
That is not present in this ride at all.

114
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,680
There might be like one or two.

115
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Maybe one.

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,440
But most of these songs were just stolen from slaves and people singing and honky tonks

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
and brothels.

118
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Yes, that's true.

119
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,800
They never made a dime off the things they eat.

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
Well, that is very true.

121
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,040
But let's let's back up a minute to explain in case you don't know what America sings

122
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,440
is coming in real hot.

123
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Don't know what it is.

124
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm confident a lot of people.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,840
Yes, much of our audience not alive when this was running.

126
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Probably like us, a chunk of them just born.

127
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,920
That's true.

128
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Yeah.

129
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,520
But so there was the Carousel of Progress and most people I think if you're listening

130
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,520
to this show, I would assume you know Carousel of Progress.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,760
It's a robot show where like an older man explains the new gadgets in his kitchen.

132
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
Like that's basically the show.

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,640
But the but in different kitchens and kitchens, 20 years apart until you get to the in the

134
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,520
current one until you get to the future of 1998.

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Yes.

136
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,040
I mean, that would be funny if Walt pitched it like that.

137
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,000
It's the it's a man and he's older and he wears a sweater and he explains what new devices

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,840
are in a kitchen.

139
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
And that's basically it.

140
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,520
The most dynamic show I've ever heard of.

141
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah.

142
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,960
And that ride, of course, looking towards tomorrow, looking towards the future.

143
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Tomorrowland.

144
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
Where this ride exit Tomorrowland.

145
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
The song.

146
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,120
Progress to tomorrow.

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,640
But what is more Tomorrowland than a look back at the past?

148
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,440
Yeah, there's a lot of this thing that yeah, like a lot of moments in it where like why

149
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:02,080
Why is this this old hound dog or like chastising a drunk goose?

150
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,960
And this is this is in Tomorrowland.

151
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Yeah.

152
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
And it's.

153
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,320
I got a question about the hound dog hassling the drunk.

154
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,480
Is the drunk coded as Irish?

155
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh, boy.

156
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,080
Because like the pub window looks like it says Joe's and the drunk is wearing like a

157
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,400
little bowler hat.

158
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
And I'm like, immigrants causing trouble.

159
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,920
I mean, the cops definitely Irish.

160
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,200
He was going to beat the shit out of that drunk for singing.

161
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
The old dog.

162
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,400
The old dog was going to beat the shit out of the goose.

163
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,440
What kind of name is Adeline?

164
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
That's that's the key.

165
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
That's a good question.

166
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,480
They're singing about sweet Adeline Adelaide line.

167
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,080
I'm not sure that was on the B-sharp.

168
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,000
They sing that on the B-sharp episode of The Simpsons.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,440
The whole attraction is full of weird, cruddy songs that I only know from The Simpsons,

170
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,280
which you all because later you also get old gray man.

171
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Oh, yes.

172
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Yes.

173
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,400
Which used to be which completely on The Simpsons is presented as like what if an old man pulling

174
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,920
his pants down, saying this cruddy song?

175
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,320
Yes, that is true.

176
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,400
One of the safest songs to do.

177
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
That one seems follow.

179
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Who knows?

180
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,960
You never know what's what's around the corner.

181
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
But anyway, yes.

182
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,840
To fill in the history of this, we're getting into the 70s and there's kind of a feeling

183
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,440
that people have seen the Carousel of Progress.

184
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
They know it.

185
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,120
They know all its moves.

186
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,680
And we got to get something else into this rotating, spinning theater and go take the

187
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,200
Carousel of Progress so that a new audience can see it and we can go not change it there

188
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,640
for 15 years.

189
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Yes.

190
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,000
This premise is wild to me that in the 70s, they're like, I feel like people have seen

191
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
this.

192
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Don't we have to do something different?

193
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,640
Like around around the world at these parks?

194
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Like I think it's fine.

195
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,160
I think we'll let that one sit.

196
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,120
Well, that feels like more of a general electric suggestion than an imagineering suggestion,

197
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,640
maybe because it was so dependent on their sponsorship in electronics.

198
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,960
And it's like, well, a lot of people in California have seen this, but you've got a brand new

199
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
park.

200
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Maybe we can move it there.

201
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah, we need the people in Florida to see the appliances in the kitchen.

202
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,400
They haven't seen the progression of appliances.

203
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,520
So if they yeah, now we get we'll give them 40 years of this 40 plus.

204
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,760
Teach them about appliances from 50 years prior.

205
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Yes.

206
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,480
You know, there's you know, there's washboards now, electric washboards.

207
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,920
And it's been the times Floridians.

208
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,840
It's been dazzling Florida audiences ever since.

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,520
By the way, I'm making these jokes.

210
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
We like Carousel of Progress.

211
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Oh, yeah.

212
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Carousel of Progress looks like like Ben Hur compared to America Sings, whatever Casablanca.

213
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,120
It's like Carousel of Progress is a masterpiece compared to America Sings.

214
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,320
I just blinked because I'm like, yes, I'll pretend I've seen and like Ben Hur can do.

216
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,160
Well, I'm just I'm catering to that film, the AFI Top 100 crowd when I say that, you

217
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
know?

218
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Yeah, sure.

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm not saying that's one of my top 10 films.

220
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Carousel of Progress looks like Citizen Kane compared to this, The Other Side of the Wind,

221
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
right?

222
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Film heads.

223
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
That's right.

224
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,160
You're more if there's anyone on the podcast, it's the AFI guy.

225
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
It's you.

226
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Yes.

227
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
The Other Side of the Wind, of course, is Worsen Welles' unfinished movie that was finished

228
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,760
finally a few years ago.

229
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,560
And you can watch it for free on Netflix or if you like me were a sucker and paid $40

230
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,600
to a Kickstarter seven years ago.

231
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,120
You can watch it that way.

232
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
It's fine.

233
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
It's fine.

234
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,960
He had a lot of all this time.

235
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,920
We've waited for this Orson Welles gem to come.

236
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
It's fine.

237
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Yeah.

238
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,680
You were I mean, I believe I don't know if we've talked about it since I think on the

239
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,320
great movie right episode, I did declare you podcast the rides Robert Osborne.

240
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
Yeah.

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,400
So that's a little more of some Osborne style factoids from you.

242
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Yeah.

243
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah.

244
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I don't remember that part.

245
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,040
I think the gangster came in and started shooting us and talking about cum.

246
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Huh.

247
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,360
That doesn't seem familiar to me.

248
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,160
But I guess the Osborne thing.

249
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
I don't know.

250
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I'll go back.

251
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,520
I think if everyone thinks of the bit they like the most from that episode, they're going

252
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,240
to think about when I said Jason was like a kindly old man that would introduce movies

253
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
on TCM.

254
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Yeah.

255
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Or whatever.

256
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
TMC?

257
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
What the hell?

258
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Turner Classic Movies.

259
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Turner Classic.

260
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Oh, I was right.

261
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Good.

262
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Who saved the great movie ride for the last few years.

263
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
They ponied up sponsorship.

264
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
He saved it.

265
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,880
Putting a Robert Osborne intro saved the ride.

266
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
No, no.

267
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I mean like saved it monetarily, support wise.

268
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Yeah, financially.

269
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,600
I thought you meant that was like a refresh where they were like, we got to do something

270
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
current for the great movie ride.

271
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
I know what it is.

272
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I loved it.

273
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
I would certainly.

274
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Oh, Osborne.

275
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Yeah.

276
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,640
All the kids then came back to see it.

277
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Yeah.

278
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
But anyway.

279
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Too many 11 year olds.

280
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,360
They had to push them out of the park.

281
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,600
So yeah, it's 1974.

282
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,880
We got to get something else in here.

283
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,440
Let's and so America's Things shows up.

284
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm acting like I have more information.

285
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
Well, they wanted to celebrate the bicentennial.

286
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
America had bicentennial fever.

287
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
And yeah, sure.

288
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,760
Two months after this ride opened, Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace.

289
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,320
Don't worry about it.

290
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
That's funny.

291
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,520
What are the makers of the funny he's supposed to do about Richard Nixon?

292
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,360
Mark Davis didn't know about Richard Nixon like Whitewood and Watergate.

293
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,960
Or the vibe in America sometimes like, hey, you everyone's kind of out of it because we

294
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,560
lost the Vietnam War.

295
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,400
Let's get a ride in there.

296
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,960
Starts off with the Confederacy of history's biggest fucking losers.

297
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,280
It was the 1970s, though.

298
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,200
No one knew what the hell was going on.

299
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
No, no.

300
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
It was kind of a bleak time.

301
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,160
I think that's why people latched on to the bicentennial.

302
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
It would be crazy.

303
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,320
It would be crazy if it was like a very progressive show, honestly.

304
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,120
That would be more shocking to me.

305
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Oh, I don't.

306
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
I didn't expect that.

307
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
They were like, we got to go.

308
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
You got to come back in the studio.

309
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,480
You have to, as Sam Eagle, address the resignation of Richard Nixon.

310
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Yeah.

311
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,680
We have to.

312
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
We have to do that.

313
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,360
We have to amend this to talk about what Nixon has done.

314
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
The theater won't be moving today.

315
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
I have some thoughts.

316
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
You know, the White House is not to be sullied with.

317
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Burlives should have gone in.

318
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,600
They should have done like an overlay every time there was some sort of disgraceful thing

319
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
America did.

320
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
And Burlives would go in and address the audience.

321
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
I'm just saying that.

322
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Disney is very good at mythmaking.

323
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Of course.

324
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,160
And the number one thing they're good at mythmaking is Uncle Walt, the character of Walt Disney.

325
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Yes.

326
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,360
Well, that's their greatest character.

327
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
That's the greatest character.

328
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,960
The number two mythmaking could be argued, American excellence, like is in a lot of the

329
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
parks.

330
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Like not the international parks.

331
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,360
You've got a real essay prepared for today's episode.

332
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
I did.

333
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,640
You got a college term paper.

334
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,480
Because I was waiting to like latch on to like, well, I like this bit.

335
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,760
Just wasn't coming.

336
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,040
It started to bubble up on the second or third viewing because I was trying to give it a

337
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
chance.

338
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,400
But man, I was ready to drop kick that weasel.

339
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
I'll tell you what.

340
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
The weasel is rough.

341
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
The weasel is definitely rough.

342
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
The weasel is bad.

343
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Yes.

344
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I don't disagree with that.

345
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Yeah.

346
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,120
It's just, you know, look, this is the same.

347
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
It is funny.

348
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,600
I was like even just like thinking about being a kid and like doing the Pledge of Allegiance.

349
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,480
Now I go, that's kind of weird.

350
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,800
It's kind of weird.

351
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,000
So like the idea, yeah, in the 70s, it's like, yeah, of course, the show is going to be like

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
this.

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,480
There's like no way around that.

354
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
But look, there's cute animatronics as well.

355
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,720
Well, of course, Mark Davis designed animatronics, which I think outside of the context, yeah,

356
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,080
of the whole show even because I don't even like, look, this is not as good as Country

357
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,320
Bears by a mile.

358
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,680
Country Bears, again, Country Bears is like Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless compared to,

359
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,160
OK, compared to some crappy French movie.

360
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Yeah, right.

361
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Exactly.

362
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,840
To some Gerard de Pardue bullshit in his later years.

363
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:12,240
Some confusing action he made where he could barely jump over a foot high wall.

364
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,280
De Pardue, I believe in Europe, has like taken the career path of like a seagull.

365
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,720
De Pardue movies now are like, oh, this is dog shit.

366
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,560
But he's like beating people up, hopefully.

367
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Like Seagull.

368
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,440
It's just hard to tell.

369
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,480
No, no, just in like Seagull got really bad and will do anything.

370
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

371
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,920
Well, look, I don't want to put down the early work of Gerard de Pardue.

372
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm just saying later.

373
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Sure.

374
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm going to keep doing film references as a man who knows all about film, the whole

375
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
show here.

376
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
OK.

377
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm going to keep doing film.

378
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:55,320
But like, OK, so we've got, well, all right, Mark Davis, we could talk about a little bit.

379
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:02,760
He like, I mean, the best thing about this show for sure is the characters and Mark Davis,

380
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,280
I can't pretend to be a super expert about the stuff in these, you know, what specific

381
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,480
Imagineers and everybody did.

382
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,440
But I do associate Mark Davis with the characters that you see that match the sketches that

383
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,720
you can go look up and where the characters really fully formed, you know completely what

384
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,620
they're about and sort of what the joke of them is.

385
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,880
There's something charming about him that translates from his sketch to his animatronic.

386
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,960
And he fits a lot of story into an animatronic that essentially can't do much, you know?

387
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,760
Like at most they can move from one point to another point, or they can rock in a rocking

388
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,280
chair or maybe even just flap their mouths.

389
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,000
But I feel like all these Mark Davis characters, you're like, all right, totally, like if you

390
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,240
needed to make a movie about this character, you could.

391
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,960
You could figure out a lot just from the way they look and their vibe.

392
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,880
And that's a thing you'll see a lot about this ride is that a lot of this stuff, a lot

393
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,800
of these characters were concept art designs for the unmade Chanteclerc movie.

394
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Chanteclerc is back.

395
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Chanteclerc is back.

396
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,280
What was the episode where Chanteclerc like overtook the episode?

397
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,240
Was it Sword and the Stone for some reason?

398
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Yes, it was.

399
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
But why?

400
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
What was the connection there?

401
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,720
I think they had two or three options of a movie to make that was in the running.

402
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,560
Like Chanteclerc was in development for a long time, maybe like 20 years or so.

403
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,840
Was it like Orson, that Orson Welles movie?

404
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,160
You know, actually a lot of his stuff was in development for a very short amount of

405
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,200
time, especially later in his career where he kind of had to run and go, but probably

406
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,480
a little too influenced by the European French New Wave movement.

407
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,960
But there's no Kickstarter to make it Chanteclerc made.

408
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,240
Not until we post this episode.

409
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,440
No, but the folk tale of Chanteclerc was the inspiration then for Rock-A-Doodle.

410
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Yes.

411
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,320
Yes, we did talk about that.

412
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Crucially.

413
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
You saw Rock-A-Doodle when you were a kid?

414
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,960
No, I have no Rock-A-Doodle.

415
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
You haven't seen Rock-A-Doodle?

416
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
No, I haven't seen Rock-A-Doodle.

417
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Man, we might.

418
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,760
That was a movie that...

419
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,360
I haven't seen Rock-A-Doodle either.

420
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Oh my God.

421
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I watched it a bunch and it freaked my shit out every time.

422
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
It warped you.

423
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Yeah.

424
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,200
You were talking about how you weren't that into music on the last week's episode, but

425
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,120
now you're saying you were a big Rock-A-Doodle kid.

426
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
I was a big Rock-A-Doodle.

427
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,960
Well, I feel like we got VHS tapes of Rock-A-Doodle and the Brave Little Toaster and both of those

428
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,680
kind of like sinister stuff in both of them.

429
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,640
Characters in distress in an upsetting way.

430
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, well yeah, like Fievel and all that.

431
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,440
We were talking, I think, on the other episode where it was like there's stretches of movies

432
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,400
around that time where you're like, the character just seems depressed and they're sobbing and

433
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,880
it feels like this is going on forever.

434
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,480
You're a little kid and you're like, this is supposed to be fun.

435
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,080
They move slower than characters today.

436
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Yeah, much slower.

437
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
The scene is darker.

438
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,440
There's only one character in there.

439
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Yeah, if you told me...

440
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
It's getting rained on.

441
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,480
I haven't seen Fievel Goes West since I saw it in the theater as a little kid.

442
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,240
If you told me there were 45 minutes of Fievel sobbing alone in that movie, I would not be

443
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
shocked.

444
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,600
I go, oh, that seems right.

445
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Yeah.

446
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
I miss my home.

447
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Yeah, yes, exactly.

448
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,480
An American tale, yes.

449
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,840
Fievel Goes West, I remember being a little lighter.

450
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
It's very orange.

451
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Maybe.

452
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
It's very brighter.

453
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Maybe.

454
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
I had that one on tape.

455
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
I didn't have the other one on tape.

456
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
And yeah.

457
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Only 40 minutes of sobbing.

458
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
40 minutes versus 45.

459
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,800
Oh no, someone got cholera on the way to Deadwood.

460
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,360
Fievel's sick.

461
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,840
Throw the mouse corpses off the boat.

462
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Oh no.

463
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,600
They'll make us sick, don't you see?

464
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm stressed for weeks afterward.

465
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
Is Fievel going to be okay?

466
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Will there be a sequel?

467
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,160
Mother, this was Jimmy Stewart's final performance, mother.

468
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,680
Mother, this is Jimmy Stewart's final performance, mother.

469
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,800
And I want you to be aware of that.

470
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,120
We should be respecting Jimmy Stewart.

471
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
That's you, by the way.

472
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
He's great.

473
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
He's great in Fievel Goes West.

474
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
He gives it his all.

475
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Sure.

476
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I forgot that.

477
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Yeah.

478
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
And he, yeah, the old kindly sheriff who ends up killing Fievel.

479
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,400
And there's a 15 minute funeral sequence.

480
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
And then in the movie they're like, everyone stand up and really imagine this is happening.

481
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,000
There's like a title, there's like a card that appears.

482
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,120
It's like, please everyone stand.

483
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,600
Now is the point in the showing where the audience should feel free to get up and say

484
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
something about Fievel.

485
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,120
There's a reason they call Fievel Goes West a prequel to HBO's Deadwood.

486
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,440
It's like, yeah, early, if he was at the arc light, now I'm like, now sure as to come

487
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,920
in and like direct traffic.

488
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Does anyone want to say anything?

489
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,520
Where, I mean, we're in here for another 25 minutes.

490
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Yeah, we can't.

491
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,720
There's no way to fast forward this.

492
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
So.

493
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Yeah, sure.

494
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,040
I felt pretty bad when he was sobbing for so long there.

495
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
That's all I got to say.

496
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Yeah.

497
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
All right.

498
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Good.

499
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Anyone else?

500
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Come on, talk.

501
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Yeah.

502
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
You may as well talk.

503
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
It's going to be weirder if you don't.

504
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Quite frankly.

505
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Okay.

506
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,520
So it's, it's Mark Davis characters and I do like the characters and I think it made

507
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,440
me think that I might enjoy this attraction more.

508
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,360
Yeah, that's of course what, yeah.

509
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,720
But like, you know, I think there's no reason to like save this chronologically.

510
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,120
America Sings probably most famously now is the source of so many of the animatronics

511
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,240
in Splash Mountain.

512
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,040
We know this, we've covered this in Splash Mountain.

513
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,200
If you're a Disney head, you know that, that America Sings closed around the time that

514
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Splash Mountain was going to open.

515
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,600
How do we populate this long ride with lots of characters?

516
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,760
This is the way to do it.

517
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Right.

518
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,080
We tied together nicely because Mark Davis did concept art for Song of the South.

519
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,040
Now I say nicely in the same sentence as Song of the South and I regret it instantly.

520
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
I clocked it.

521
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I clocked it.

522
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Let's just remove those.

523
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,800
I just mean in terms of art style.

524
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,160
You're just giving the fact.

525
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,360
You're giving a fact.

526
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm saying what they thought then in the 80s.

527
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Yeah.

528
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Yeah.

529
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,320
I was like, I know how to make this a less grim episode.

530
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,520
Let's talk about Song of the South.

531
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,680
Dear God.

532
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:17,040
I think that we, again, the characters are nice and I like them in Splash Mountain too.

533
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,920
I think I thought that America Sings is a traction with no blood on its hands.

534
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:29,280
So I feel bad that these characters are thrust into Splash Mountain where, which is problematic.

535
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,000
Another poor turn of phrase.

536
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,440
In fact, it has literal end figure to pull on its hands.

537
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,960
We have to brighten this episode, guys.

538
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,000
I'll just stop using language of any kind.

539
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,040
We could just go back to that bit about Fievel being so sad.

540
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,880
That'd be fine, yes.

541
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,120
I'll say that I agree that I think the character designs are nice, but I think Country Bears

542
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,280
by a country mile in terms of getting characters.

543
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,760
Now that's a wholesome phrase.

544
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,200
That's the way to make a point, Scott, on this episode.

545
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,920
Nothing wrong with that sentence.

546
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
I think.

547
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Let me Google it.

548
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,560
A country mile, originally a term designed for.

549
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Oh no.

550
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,000
They're forced to walk country miles against their will.

551
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,880
I think Country Bears does a much better job of communicating quote unquote character,

552
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
like vibe of a character.

553
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, I think that too.

554
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,320
But the character design is certainly very bright and vivid.

555
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Of course, because Mark Davis did so much Disney stuff, you see the characters and they

556
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,440
feel very familiar.

557
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,040
Very much a little piece with many other attractions in the parks.

558
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Yeah.

559
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,160
But yeah, I don't.

560
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,640
It's like, yes, I think we all kind of have the same thing of like we love robot bullshit.

561
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,760
The show is like 90% robot bullshit here on this podcast.

562
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Yeah.

563
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,080
So we're like, hey, Mark Davis design?

564
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Yeah, great.

565
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,080
And then it's just, I don't think the show is not like Country Bears, like a funny show.

566
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
This show isn't really funny.

567
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,360
There's maybe like a couple of attempts at jokes.

568
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,560
The clip, the show I watch on YouTube, it's like not getting much as far as laughter is

569
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
concerned.

570
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Maybe it was a bad crowd.

571
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,400
We've all had rough nights on stage.

572
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,680
I did see a video where the audience was clapping along a lot to Yankee Doodle Dandy, and I

573
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,440
think it was just like the backing music is a certain like...

574
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,000
You think they had it clapped then?

575
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,040
No, I think the audience is clapping along because it's just like...

576
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
But that's because...

577
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Easy to clap to.

578
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
It's easy to clap to.

579
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Yeah.

580
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm like thrilled to hear any of the...

581
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,680
I think that's right also.

582
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,280
I don't know how they escalate it so quickly from like a dozen animatronics in Country

583
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Bears to over 100 in this attraction.

584
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,760
Is that how many it is?

585
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
It's something like...

586
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
It's 115.

587
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Yeah.

588
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Is it really?

589
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,160
115, which there's so many in Splash Mountain, so that kind of helps explain it.

590
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,640
That does make sense because they're like the same kind of geese come back, but then

591
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,440
the geese will be wearing like a different vest and a different hat.

592
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,880
Yeah, but it's different and different on different stages and stuff.

593
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
And it's also...

594
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
I counted...

595
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,800
I don't have a rough estimate because some of the songs repeat, like 37 songs?

596
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,160
Just snippets of so many songs.

597
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,680
Country Bears is like a perfect album length of songs.

598
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,080
And this is just doing like two seconds of like where the buffalo roared.

599
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,360
It is like the sequel to Country Bears, but they got too...

600
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
They got too much money.

601
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,600
They had too much access.

602
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,440
We've seen it a million times in rock and roll and in the movies.

603
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Or a filmmaker.

604
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
In rock and roll.

605
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Rock and roll, you see it.

606
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,440
You see it in rock and roll all the time.

607
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,440
You know, American Idiot is perfect, but then the next album...

608
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
You fucked up.

609
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
You fucked up.

610
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Sorry about that.

611
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
What are you talking about?

612
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I've never wanted to storm out of an episode so much.

613
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,880
It would have been so much easier on yourself if you said Dookie and then like American

614
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Idiot.

615
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,880
No, American Idiot I maintain is good.

616
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
And the follow-up...

617
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
You didn't say good.

618
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
You said perfect.

619
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
That is a heck of a word.

620
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I'll tell you this.

621
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,680
I don't have a memory of saying perfect, even though it happened 45 seconds ago.

622
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,320
I don't have a memory of learning all the lyrics to a lot of American Idiot songs,

623
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,680
but I somehow do when it comes on the radio.

624
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,240
It was just an earworm back, you know.

625
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
I really...

626
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Here's what the thing is.

627
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,120
I thought I might have a great reference because I'm going to say the name of the follow-up

628
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,200
album, which was not nearly as good.

629
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm trying to find it because I'm blanking on the name of it.

630
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,200
But it was an attempt to do another bigger, crazier thing.

631
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,520
They were trying to do American Idiot part two.

632
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
It did not work.

633
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,440
So Country Bears equals American Idiot and these are both perfect.

634
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,400
American Idiot and Country Bears are both perfect pieces of art.

635
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,860
Similar, definitely of a piece.

636
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,300
Probably one inspired the other, you'd have to assume.

637
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,460
Yes, I think that's probably correct.

638
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,340
The album, of course, was called 21st Century Breakdown.

639
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
We know that now.

640
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,220
That phrase is like, been in songs already.

641
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,260
This is the most uncreative...

642
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,260
But I know you're not saying that one's perfect.

643
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Yeah, no, that's the bad one, Scott.

644
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,580
That's the flawed album.

645
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,660
Not the album that has Jesus of Suburbia on it.

646
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,460
A nine minute song that I do legitimately enjoy.

647
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,260
I feel like I'm like, I don't want to keep talking about American Idiot, but I also don't

648
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,420
want to keep talking about America Sings.

649
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:37,260
So I'm like choosing between two floating blocks of ice and I don't know which one to

650
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,660
jump on or whether to just jump into the cold water.

651
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,460
Phrase called pick your poison.

652
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,180
Yeah, do you want, I wish I were in Dixie or my old Kentucky home.

653
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,620
Or do you want We Are, We Are, We Are the Waiting, which is one of the songs called

654
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,620
We Are the Waiting.

655
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,500
Do they say we are, we are?

656
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
We are, we are, we are, we are the waiting.

657
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,860
That's the same as We Are the Youth of a Nation, that other stupid song.

658
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
It is.

659
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
We are, we are.

660
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
That's a P.O.D.

661
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,820
We Are, We Are, immediately after P.O.D.

662
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
After P.O.D.

663
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Yes, they copied P.O.D.

664
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
Oh boy, boy, oh boy.

665
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,220
Well, it's nice to be more mad at something than America Sings.

666
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:23,820
I want to talk about one of the things I have an issue with America Sings is, I mean, every

667
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,980
sort of like making a video on, there's a defunct land on this from a few years ago

668
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,900
that hits a lot of good factual stuff and big points about this.

669
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:39,420
And they, Kevin, pretty much immediately is like, you know, why is this in Tomorrowland?

670
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,420
So already it's confusing where it is.

671
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:49,180
And then you, you, another thing I came across was like, this is, this is the last, the first

672
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,340
ride that Walt did not have fingerprints on.

673
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,420
And it is, I don't know, it does feel very inconsistent.

674
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,260
Well, it was written by Mark Davis and Albertino, I think mostly.

675
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:06,420
Albertino being, and we'll get here, we're going to do a little tease later maybe, but

676
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,380
Albertino is the basis for Big Al on the Country Bears.

677
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,380
He was an Imagineer.

678
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Oh.

679
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,860
And he looks like Big Al from the Country Bears.

680
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,260
But I think Mark Davis and him wrote this as well.

681
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,220
You say Albertino?

682
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,980
His name is A-L-B-E-R-T-I-O.

683
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Albertino.

684
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Yes.

685
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
Okay, got it.

686
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,820
But one of the things that's inconsistent too is like, it's split up with a prologue

687
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,320
and an epilogue, and then it's divided into four parts.

688
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,220
But those parts split, like the first two, Acts 1 and 2 are the early south and the old

689
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,180
west, so geographical locations.

690
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,580
Act 3 is the gay 90s, so like the swinging 1890s.

691
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,180
And Act 4 is just called modern times.

692
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
So kind of inconsistent.

693
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,180
What do you mean?

694
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,740
Well, like two, it's like, okay, the first half of the show is places and big places,

695
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,740
important.

696
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,580
Oh, you're saying there was locations, the first two are locations.

697
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,620
There's locations and then there's time periods.

698
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,620
And then there's time periods.

699
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,460
And that just seems like bad production sense.

700
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,500
It's like someone needed to do another pass.

701
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,420
Well, do they, let me ask you this.

702
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,340
Do they say those names in the show?

703
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
I can't remember.

704
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,020
Do they say like, and now we go to modern times?

705
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:22,380
I think these are the behind the scenes because I consistently came across these four names.

706
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,900
So this might have been within Imagineering.

707
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,100
They're referring to it as this.

708
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,380
I would also say, yeah, they would, calling it the deep south is probably better than

709
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,140
being like before the Civil War.

710
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,900
When you were starting to do research on this and then you come across, like, so what was

711
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,940
this thing where the, what's the first part of the deep south?

712
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,940
Oh no.

713
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,820
Sorry, the early south, the early south.

714
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,180
It says deep south on the Wikipedia here.

715
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,180
Oh, okay.

716
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,500
Well, yeah, both are bad.

717
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,700
The first act you can throw into the ocean, except lay down by the river, down by the

718
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
riverside.

719
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,180
Except for the heavenly singing voice of Burl Ives.

720
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,580
Yeah, wait, let's talk about Burl Ives.

721
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,300
Because Burl Ives ties it all together.

722
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:13,340
Burl Ives is Sam the Eagle, who is, as I've definitely said on the show before, all Eagles

723
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
are Sam.

724
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
They are.

725
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,900
There's like three, the Olympics, Sam Eagle.

726
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,820
The Olympics from the 1984 Olympics.

727
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
Yeah.

728
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,580
Sam Eagle, who I'm very fond of because he was still kind of around LA when I was a baby.

729
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
He was hanging out.

730
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
I like him.

731
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,580
Yeah, yeah, you'd just see him at peace.

732
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
He was like Angeline.

733
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,860
You'd see him at Randy's Donuts, all the kind of typical, stereotypical LA spots.

734
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,540
Sam the Eagle, the Muppet, obviously.

735
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,980
And then this is Sam.

736
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,820
Eagles can only be named Sam.

737
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,820
Right.

738
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,900
Here's a tangent, which I think is less troubling than something I think you're talking about.

739
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Sure, go ahead.

740
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,860
Which I'm happy to do.

741
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:57,820
I was like, I don't know a lot about 84 Olympics Sam, other than I saw him when I was a baby.

742
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,180
What was the deal with him?

743
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:08,220
And I found on his Wikipedia that there was a, in that era, in like 83, 84, 85, that it

744
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,500
was such a Sam mania, such an Olympics mania.

745
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Really?

746
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,740
That there was a full cartoon series made about him in Japan.

747
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
Really?

748
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
Why?

749
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,340
If you haven't seen Sam the 84 Olympics mascot, it's very similar to that.

750
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,820
He's like wearing a red, white, and blue hat.

751
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,700
He's a very Uncle Sam Eagle, or the American symbol.

752
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,620
And yet they made a Japanese cartoon about him, which I highly encourage looking up the

753
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:44,140
intro of, you know, I mean, bonkers 80s Japan animation, as you might imagine.

754
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:50,140
But let me read the description of what this show is.

755
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,980
Private investigator Sam of Los Angeles is mysteriously transformed into an anthropomorphic

756
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,580
eagle resembling the 1984 Olympic mascot.

757
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,900
I really read this before copy pasting it.

758
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,540
It's a man and the mascot exists.

759
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,300
So it isn't a show about the mascot.

760
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,820
It's a show about a man who gets turned into somebody who looks like the mascot.

761
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,220
Is that how like when Todd Phillips is doing press for Joker, he's like, this might not

762
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,340
be the Joker.

763
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,860
It's a different Joker.

764
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,860
It's not the Joker.

765
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,860
Yeah.

767
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
We're all eagle.

768
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Everyone's getting eagle fied.

769
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
Eagle fied.

770
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:29,100
Is it like similar to like the story of like not Buzz Lightyear, the toy, but the band

771
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,260
was like, it was the original version of that.

772
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Yeah.

773
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,220
Whoever did this, if there was Twitter in the 80s, they would have explained forever

774
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
like him.

775
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,140
OK, with the help of his hilariously busty assistant canary.

776
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

777
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Hold on here.

778
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,380
I can't make it through one sentence of this.

779
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,380
There's things to find at every turn.

780
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,740
Busty canary.

781
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,260
But it's not a canary.

782
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,540
It's a woman.

783
00:33:53,540 --> 00:34:00,940
And if you watch the intro, like definitely the main way, the main thing that is featured

784
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,380
about her is cleavage.

785
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,860
And apparently that like factors into the show.

786
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,900
Like her boobs help things happen.

787
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,140
But she's a woman.

788
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,220
She's a woman who just resembles a canary.

789
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,100
No, her name is Canary.

790
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,180
Oh, she's just a normal woman.

791
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,660
Normal woman named Canary.

792
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Is she blonde?

793
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Like canary yellow.

794
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
I don't think so.

795
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Is it color?

796
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
No.

797
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
I don't think so.

798
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
I'm giving them too much credit.

799
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
I can't.

800
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,260
I can find no life preservers for either of you guys.

801
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,140
I don't know how to make this make sense.

802
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:37,340
So with the help of Canary, Sam has to fight the bad guys and chase down his nemesis, a

803
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,260
cockroach riding a skateboard.

804
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,140
OK, now is the cockroach a real cockroach?

805
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,300
Yes, I did watch the intro and you do watch him ride in on a skateboard and the whole

806
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,300
gang.

807
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,820
The cast of characters, which from the group shot at the end of the intro seems to be 45

808
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,140
characters, they all get startled and run away from the skateboard cockroach.

809
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,500
OK, and does the cockroach have any like physical thing I should know about, like a large bulge

810
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
or something?

811
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,980
Is there anything I need to know?

812
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,900
The intro does not reveal how big the cockroach's penis is.

813
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,820
And I want to say, I mean, maybe that can't be big because it might get in the way of

814
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,180
the skateboard riding.

815
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,740
So maybe it's like maybe he's just got like a pretty wide butt.

816
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,420
Maybe it's something else.

817
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,940
The cockroach has a big butt.

818
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,420
OK, that's what I'm going to take from this.

819
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,900
Got it.

820
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,140
Now I can picture the character.

821
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

822
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Big old seat.

823
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,300
So and then just, you know, that's the standard as it goes.

824
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,380
Sam's hat contains almost everything he needs.

825
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,220
And when the going gets tough, he takes out special magical Olympic rings to help.

826
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,500
Wait, wait, his hat gives him what he needs?

827
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
His hat.

828
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,420
Yeah, there's infinite things in his Uncle Sam hat.

829
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,220
It's like Felix's magic bag.

830
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
Yeah.

831
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,820
Wait, Felix the cat has a magic bag?

832
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,660
Yes, Felix the cat, a character from 60 years ago that had a cartoon.

833
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,660
You should all be familiar with that.

834
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,180
Flesher Studios, yeah.

835
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,140
He was created in the gay 90s, 1890 around.

836
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,340
Yeah, Felix had a magic bag like Mary Poppins' bag and he could pull anything out of it,

837
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,700
a knife, a gun, I guess, anything, anything he needed for an invention.

838
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Mainly weapons?

839
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,980
Yeah, he was a violent cat.

840
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,340
So you're saying this hat is like that, but he also had rings with the rings stored in

841
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
the hat?

842
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,180
It says he takes out the rings, so I think so.

843
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,900
I think he probably keeps those in the hat.

844
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,340
I mean, if you had a hat with infinite space, kind of like a phone that's hooked up to the

845
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,700
cloud, that's really what this is.

846
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,980
You can put anything you want in there except physical.

847
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,500
If the cloud, you could put like stuff, your things in your apartment.

848
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
It could be like a gizmo duck.

849
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,380
Do you remember how gizmo duck would get his outfit on, his robot outfit?

850
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
No.

851
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,660
I believe he would say blather in blather skythe.

852
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,060
I believe that was his catchphrase.

853
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,540
And then wherever, Jason's looking at me like I'm crazy.

854
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,420
There's a reason this company is the biggest media company in the world with these home

855
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,940
runs.

856
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,920
Much like later Iron Man suits, wherever the gizmo duck suit was, it would like come to

857
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,300
life and fly to, I forget, Quentin something was his name, was the character's name.

858
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,740
Harry Poppins bag also has quite a bit of stuff in it.

859
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,740
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,460
I'm just saying that maybe the Olympic rings are a similar thing where he could like summon

861
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,220
them wherever they were at any moment.

862
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,300
Oh man, like he doesn't have to keep them in the hat.

863
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,740
Yeah, he doesn't have to have them in the hat.

864
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,020
He could have them at home and he summons them.

865
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:33,180
Or like, yeah, like Iron Man summoning the Hulkbuster armor from a satellite.

866
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,140
You gotta hope that, because those things could be sharp.

867
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,140
Those become like, those are blades.

868
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,740
If they're whipping around the earth to get to Sam the...

869
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
They're sharp.

870
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
They're sharp.

871
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,740
Maybe.

872
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Or just the speed.

873
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,700
It's like if you throw a quarter off a skyscraper.

874
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,460
By the time it's to the destination, it's a weapon.

875
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,940
I bet you could, or I bet he could change them to like, they could be sharp sometimes,

876
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,340
but I bet he could shrink them and they could be like brass knuckles.

877
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,700
Oh, that's cool.

878
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,940
Or like the Captain Planet rings don't like...

879
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
Yeah.

880
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,300
Those expand into something, or like powershoot out of them or something.

881
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
Well, but their powers combined.

882
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,420
Well, yeah, they each have their own power and then they combine.

883
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,900
But they keep the ring on them, right?

884
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Yeah, they keep the ring on.

885
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,940
Yeah, it's similar to Green Lantern.

886
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
Very similar.

887
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
Now that I'm thinking about it, very similar to Green Lantern.

888
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,140
Now this is great.

889
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,500
I love that we're not talking about the attraction.

890
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,420
This is Sam the 84.

891
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,220
I knew that I loved him when I was a baby and I didn't know why and it was because years

892
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,220
later he would stall.

893
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,220
He would save you.

894
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,620
He would help us stall and not talk about the attraction for much longer.

895
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,340
Yeah, well, look, I like the idea of the show.

896
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,220
I mean, I'm dying to find some episodes of Sam Eagle in 80s anime.

897
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,740
Or Eagle Sam maybe.

898
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,740
Eagle Sam.

899
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
Yeah.

900
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:54,180
Yeah, let's see if we can do that and if we don't like the rest of this episode, we'll

901
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,980
just edit in an old episode of Eagle Sam for the rest of the time.

902
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
So right now if you hear...

903
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,060
We'll record us driving to Little Tokyo to see if we can come up with bootleg DVDs of

904
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,060
Eagle Sam.

905
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,020
If we abandon the rest of the episode, right now you'll hear a fuzz and then it'll just

906
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,020
cut out and there'll be a...

907
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,780
And there'll just be like, just Japanese dialogue for 28 minutes.

908
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
Right.

909
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:23,860
Burl Ive's, I think best known voice performance as the narrator in the Frosty the Snowman,

910
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,300
the rank and the best Frosty the Snowman.

911
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,700
Rudolph in his reindeer, I believe, right?

912
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Or is he also...

913
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
Sorry, it's Rudolph.

914
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Yeah, you're right.

915
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
You're right.

916
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
He is a snowman in...

917
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,740
He is a snowman in Rudolph.

918
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,220
He's in the claymation one, not the cell painted one.

919
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,700
Yes, and I love that special growing.

920
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,140
I still think it's great.

921
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,180
I think his performance in that is great.

922
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:52,220
I am not wild about Eagle Sam, probably because of just how much he sings Yankee Doodle, man.

923
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
I just think...

924
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,220
You don't really like Yankee Doodle.

925
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
And that's more, yeah, that's...

926
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,420
And truly like that, I agree with you, but yeah, then that's just like, Yankee Doodle

927
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,420
is not a very good song.

928
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,420
No, and you have to hear it again and again.

929
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,340
Like, glory, glory, hallelujah, at least has some oomph to it or something.

930
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,020
What is better, Yankee Doodle or the Boulevard of Broken Dreams?

931
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,020
I mean, let's examine the lyrics.

932
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,020
Wait, I don't know though.

933
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Maybe, if I had to listen to one of them, Yankee Doodle is going to be over like that.

934
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,020
Do, do, do, do, do, do, or I walk a lonely road.

935
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,020
The only road that I have ever known.

936
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,020
No, what should it say, Yankee Doodle?

937
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,020
Yankee Doodle.

938
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,020
My shadow is the only one that walks beside me.

939
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:40,020
My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating.

940
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,020
Yes.

941
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,020
Please stay away from, don't make me hear 21 Guns.

942
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,020
21 Guns is on the other 21st Century Breakdown.

943
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,020
Oh, phew, okay, okay.

944
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:55,020
21 Guns is too, sounds too much like all the young, like bad version of all the young dudes to me.

945
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Oh, absolutely, it's another ripoff.

946
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,020
These dicks.

947
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,020
All the young, yeah.

948
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,020
I was mad, I made fun of you for Time of Your Life, I think, one time.

949
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,020
Yes.

950
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,020
And I guess I'm making, apparently I really hate Green Day.

951
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,020
Well, I was shocked because one time you told me you never even liked Dookie or anything when you were younger.

952
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,020
No, that would have made sense to like.

953
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,020
Yeah.

954
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,020
And I wouldn't hate anybody for liking that.

955
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:22,020
But like, I don't know, well, I'll look big in 94 just like my arch-nemesis Weezer.

956
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,020
I guess these bands, I'm like, I don't let them for the one album.

957
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,020
I don't cut them slack.

958
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Even Pinkerton.

959
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,020
More albums from Weezer.

960
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Yeah, Pinkerton, yeah, Green Day.

961
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,020
It's interesting, yeah, Green Day, I don't know.

962
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,020
I've never heard anyone who hates Green Day.

963
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
Weezer, I've certainly heard.

964
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Every one of these songs gets a rise out of me.

965
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:51,020
You know what would be a good Patreon is just maybe even a video component of you listening to all nine minutes of Jesus of Suburbia.

966
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
The whole, like it's like five parts.

967
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,020
It's one song.

968
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,020
It's one song.

969
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,020
It's one song. It's nine minutes and it changes.

970
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,020
It's like five different parts.

971
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,020
It's like a suite.

972
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
Dear God.

973
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,020
And I would like to, and then you could pause in between each part.

974
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,020
Each suite, yeah, we interview you.

975
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,020
And we interview you on how you feel.

976
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,020
We give you some like behind, hey, we watched the behind the music.

977
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
The lyrics.

978
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
On this one.

979
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
And what do you think about this, Scott?

980
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,020
Does it make you like it a little more to find out they, actually they recorded that part and like that came to them.

981
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,020
They wrote it in an hour, they recorded in an hour.

982
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,020
That's pretty good.

983
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,020
Oh, really?

984
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,020
I believe it.

985
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,020
But then the other suite, it took like days and days to get that right.

986
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,020
I'm the son of.

987
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,020
Is this how I stand when I talk to people with a beach voice?

988
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,020
Hold on. I just want to give you a couple of lyrics here.

989
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,020
I'm the son of rage and love.

990
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,020
The Jesus of Suburbia.

991
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,020
The Bible of none of the above.

992
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,020
On a.

993
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,020
Also is such like.

994
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,020
I just went to college and I have some ideas about religion.

995
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,020
On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin.

996
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,020
Oh yeah.

997
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,020
Because that's how we treat our kids in this country.

998
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:59,020
We just say we just like amp up the energy and distract them from the real issues.

999
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
The rot.

1000
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,020
We got it.

1001
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,020
We got it.

1002
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,020
We got to do this for a Patreon.

1003
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,020
We got to do it.

1004
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,020
I guess I is a real breakthrough.

1005
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,020
I guess I hate green.

1006
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,020
Two thousand core.

1007
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,020
Right.

1008
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,020
This is or this is just after two thousand core.

1009
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,020
Well, it's like two and four, I think.

1010
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,020
Yeah.

1011
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,020
So I don't think it's perfect in like late 90s, early 2000s, two thousand core.

1012
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,020
But I don't think we've given a nomenclature term yet to what came after.

1013
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,020
Yes.

1014
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,020
Yeah.

1015
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,020
We're on terror core.

1016
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,020
Is it super fun?

1017
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:38,020
We keep talking about another tier for our Patreon and maybe it's like a pain tier because I've said I'll release a solo, an album I made when I was like 20 and maybe the other.

1018
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,020
Yeah.

1019
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,020
The other episodes are I forced you to listen like Weezer's songs during day songs.

1020
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,020
This would be a pain tier for the listeners as well.

1021
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,020
Maybe.

1022
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,020
Maybe it'd be tears from them.

1023
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,020
They'd be crying like five.

1024
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
How could we punish Jason though?

1025
00:43:52,020 --> 00:44:00,020
Oh, I just have to read the tweets that come in where someone just says, I actually like that, which happens for you.

1026
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,020
It's like, yeah, guys, you can like it.

1027
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,020
It's fine.

1028
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,020
We don't care.

1029
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,020
We like you.

1030
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
You hate that as much as I hate these songs.

1031
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
No, no, no, not to that extent.

1032
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,020
No, no, no.

1033
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,020
I'm just going to be a little Jason.

1034
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,020
Jason, I will say is the most bothered by like negative stuff.

1035
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,020
Yeah, mildly.

1036
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,020
Even mildly negative, I think.

1037
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:27,020
Yeah, I just I sometimes I worry I provoke provoke the same reactions of like, no, I love this thing.

1038
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,020
I'm just goofing on it because it's a little silly.

1039
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,020
I love silly stuff.

1040
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
And it's like, no, this one, this sucks.

1041
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,020
No, the America sings like kind of socks.

1042
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,020
Jason tortured here, making me to banana in the morning.

1043
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
Oh, wow.

1044
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,020
I've been a little better on that recently.

1045
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,020
If I found if I eat something before the banana, I'm OK.

1046
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,020
You still have to prime the pump.

1047
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,020
I need to prime the pump because I know I need the fiber and the potassium.

1048
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,020
Once again, my baby son can have a banana in the morning with no ish.

1049
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,020
Well, he's got you know, he's just a ball.

1050
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,020
He's like a brand new car.

1051
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,020
You just drove it off the lot.

1052
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:09,020
And I'm like at best at best certain car makes it.

1053
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,020
Yes, sir.

1054
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:17,020
Car Max certified pre-owned where where it's like, oh, it shouldn't go wrong, but you never know.

1055
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,020
Real quick before we get back to America sings.

1056
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,020
I wonder how are we done?

1057
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:27,020
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall.

1058
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:32,020
Where did you find that random live journal full of poetry from 1999?

1059
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,020
I want to make it clear.

1060
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,020
I do like this song, but I do think it's funny.

1061
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,020
I have I have another I have one more thing that if we just fill up 90 minutes, can we not talk about the show?

1062
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,020
Does that count?

1063
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,020
I think it's interesting.

1064
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,020
Would anyone be I mean, we floated the idea of like what nobody's watched.

1065
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
This is related though.

1066
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,020
I can sum up like chunks of the show pretty well.

1067
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:59,020
If you have another you know, if you have a non unrelated America sings, I do have a couple things I'd like to discuss.

1068
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:02,020
It's not unrelated because it's a it's a burl Ives thing.

1069
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:07,020
I think it's very related to issues that we that we discuss because I was curious.

1070
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,020
More stuff about burl Ives.

1071
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,020
I know the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.

1072
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,020
But what else was this guy?

1073
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,020
And he's described as an itinerant singer for a long time.

1074
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,020
A folk singer like kind of keeping keeping old songs alive.

1075
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,020
It's why it makes sense for him to be the narrator of this show.

1076
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:36,020
And I discovered that as he traveled the US in the early 30s playing his banjo, he was jailed in Mona, Utah for vagrancy and for singing.

1077
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:43,020
Foggy do an English folk song, which the authorities decided was a body song.

1078
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,020
Wow. Really?

1079
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:53,020
The official phrase I found every anywhere I googled burl Ives foggy do incident.

1080
00:46:53,020 --> 00:47:01,020
If you go to the Wikipedia for Mona, Utah, this is a town that has nothing else to say for itself other than that they jailed burl Ives in the 30s.

1081
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,020
Because it's like a dirty song.

1082
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:09,020
A body song. Seeing the word body in the wild was something to me.

1083
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,020
Now let me so all right.

1084
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:17,020
The song is about because I was trying to then decipher what was up with foggy do.

1085
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,020
What was so this is it required a jailing.

1086
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,020
Someone had to be arrested.

1087
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,020
Right.

1088
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,020
They didn't even write the song.

1089
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,020
They were singing foggy do with their banjo on the street corner.

1090
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:33,020
And so the song is about the outcome of an affair between a weaver and a girl he courted.

1091
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:42,020
It has one of the lines in it is and many a time I rolled my love all over the foggy do something weird about it.

1092
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,020
But also I can't like all over.

1093
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,020
I can't I don't know.

1094
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,020
I mean, I guess you could sort of sexualize that.

1095
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,020
But it seems like a stretch.

1096
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,020
So I'm like, well, that can't be it.

1097
00:47:51,020 --> 00:48:02,020
And then I discovered that in the 60s, Burl Ives appeared on the Ed Sullivan show and he wanted to perform foggy do despite his arrest for this very song 30 years prior.

1098
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,020
And they said, sure.

1099
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:14,020
But they made him change a line, much like famously the Rolling Stones and the doors had to do these silly line changes to be on Ed Sullivan.

1100
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,020
Right.

1101
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,020
And I have no idea.

1102
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:23,020
The third in the offensive song trifecta was Burl Ives and foggy do.

1103
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:36,020
And I'm now going to read you the verse of the that contains the lyric that had to be changed and see if you I want you guys to see if you can guess what is the what was the line that was a problem.

1104
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,020
Okay, go ahead.

1105
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,020
Again, I am a bachelor.

1106
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,020
I live with my son.

1107
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,020
We work at the weaver's trade.

1108
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:47,020
And every single time that I look into his eyes, he reminds me of that fair young maid.

1109
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,020
It's the last one.

1110
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,020
It's got to be.

1111
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,020
I look into his eyes and remind me of the fair young.

1112
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,020
Because he had an affair.

1113
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,020
Like he didn't was it married to the woman.

1114
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,020
That's the source of the problem.

1115
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,020
Right.

1116
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,020
Yes, you got it.

1117
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,020
I didn't get it while reading.

1118
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,020
It's a very good.

1119
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,020
But that but you don't have the line.

1120
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,020
You don't have the line that had to be changed.

1121
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,020
Okay.

1122
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,020
Yeah, I don't hear.

1123
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,020
Oh, you reminds me of like the different body part of the woman.

1124
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,020
No, no.

1125
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,020
The bust of the woman.

1126
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,020
No, no, no.

1127
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,020
I was reading that.

1128
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,020
I was reading the original.

1129
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,020
Oh, that was not the kind of.

1130
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,020
Okay, God, that could not be on television.

1131
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,020
All right.

1132
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,020
The line is again.

1133
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,020
I am a bachelor.

1134
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,020
I live with my son.

1135
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,020
This had to be changed on television to again.

1136
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,020
I am a widower.

1137
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,020
I live with my son.

1138
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,020
Oh, the idea that you would have a daughter.

1139
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:40,020
That you would have a child out of wedlock could not be broadcast on television in the

1140
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,020
1960s.

1141
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:47,020
Well, there was no there was no scenario where they were like, yeah, that could be that could

1142
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,020
be a guess.

1143
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,020
Yeah, that goes by so fast.

1144
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,020
Like, what's the problem?

1145
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:59,020
I think it's that he he might be back on the scene after the death of his wife and he lives

1146
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,020
with his son.

1147
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1148
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,020
It's just just saying I'm a bachelor.

1149
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,020
I think it sounds like they wanted a clarification.

1150
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:09,020
Yeah, I think clarification clarification because that like you live with your son and

1151
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,020
not your son and wife because the wife is dead.

1152
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,020
But I'm not sure within the world of the song if the wife is dead.

1153
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,020
I think I think she might be alive.

1154
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:22,020
I think they I think Ed Sullivan killed the wife for narrative purposes.

1155
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,020
They would rather have the wife be dead than alive and divorced.

1156
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:30,020
Yes, it made everyone feel much better about this like this carouser.

1157
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,020
Great.

1158
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,020
Good.

1159
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,020
You could play a burl.

1160
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,020
You could play your show on TV.

1161
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,020
What was happening in this?

1162
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:43,020
You think of the 60s is like when things started getting wild and that makes zero sense.

1163
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,020
What a square time.

1164
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:52,020
That actually ties in almost one to one with the song in America Sings called A Bird in

1165
00:50:52,020 --> 00:51:02,020
a Gilded Cage where it says that one of the songwriter was asked to clarify, change some

1166
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:08,020
of the words in the song to make it clear the woman in the song is married and not a

1167
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,020
mistress.

1168
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:16,020
This is this is again a great tie together to America Sings as an example of like man

1169
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:20,020
people in the past sure were stupid and insane.

1170
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:27,020
Not to look at everything through a 2021 lens, but the past so many nothing but funny

1171
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:33,020
days like it's the exact it was like the same reaction to like like a Cardi B song.

1172
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:38,020
It's the exact like it was the exact same like oh my God, we can never show this to

1173
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,020
people and on Cardi B stuff is on TV now.

1174
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,020
We're not the only guy her room thing is like Ted Cruz.

1175
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,020
He's kind of like fake doing it.

1176
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,020
Yeah.

1177
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,020
Like now is this was a it was like the whole world was a bunch of Ted Cruz's and I mean

1178
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,020
like attractiveness wise too.

1179
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,020
It's yeah, it's the Republican kayfabe.

1180
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,020
It's the like fake outrage stuff.

1181
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,020
Yeah.

1182
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,020
Whether it is like trying to get somebody mad but like Ted Cruz doesn't give a shit about

1183
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,020
most of what he says.

1184
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,020
Megan McCain will miss you so much on the view.

1185
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:09,020
Your different perspective is what brought the fire to the show.

1186
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:16,020
Disney owns both Star Wars and Marvel and a daily show where some of the dumbest people

1187
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,020
in the country sit around a table and have conversations about things they couldn't possibly

1188
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,020
have in the most case any knowledge about.

1189
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:30,020
I think they should put I was going to say put Sam Eagle in this chair.

1190
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,020
I guess he's not a female though.

1191
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:38,020
I was going to say Scott is to Green Day as Jason is to the view.

1192
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,020
Jason hates the view.

1193
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,020
We both discovered some.

1194
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:47,020
I mean I like Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar to some extent and it's just but even they

1195
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,020
have some really cockamamie takes sometimes.

1196
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:53,020
They at least had like a talent they displayed at one point.

1197
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,020
I guess we know them from their work and other media.

1198
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,020
What is Megan McCain?

1199
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,020
Yeah.

1200
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,020
She is her father's daughter.

1201
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,020
Do you know who her father is?

1202
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:10,020
She would have been mad that America Sings got taken out if she was on the air during

1203
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,020
this time I think.

1204
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,020
That would have been all.

1205
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:17,020
Can you imagine the conservative news cycle if the cable news had existed when America

1206
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,020
Sings got taken out?

1207
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,020
I don't think we've said yet.

1208
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,020
America Sings stuck around until 1988.

1209
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,020
Sure.

1210
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,020
But still.

1211
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,020
Fourteen years.

1212
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,020
Yeah that's true.

1213
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,020
That is a long time.

1214
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:32,020
We've inadvertently done a series of rides recently where one of the takeaways is like

1215
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,020
that was there for what?

1216
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,020
How long?

1217
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:38,020
Can I ask a logistic question about Sam Eagle as a character?

1218
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,020
Yeah.

1219
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,020
This one.

1220
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
America Sings one.

1221
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,020
Not America.

1222
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,020
America Sings one.

1223
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,020
Not the Olympic ring slinger from Japan.

1224
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,020
Or the Muppet.

1225
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,020
Or the Muppet.

1226
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,020
Does Sam Eagle have a tattoo on his chest?

1227
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,020
He has like a you know what I'm talking about?

1228
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:57,020
He has like he wears okay he wears like a top hat that's very like stars and stripes

1229
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
but then he also has like an emblem.

1230
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,020
I think that's a girdle.

1231
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,020
I think that's a peritreotic girdle.

1232
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,020
I gotta perform.

1233
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,020
I got stuck in the gut.

1234
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:13,020
Or did he shave his feathers off on his belly and tattoo a big like American flag shield?

1235
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:20,020
Or dye some of the feathers or like have colored feathers stitched in.

1236
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,020
Like change them out.

1237
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,020
Put red and blue ones in.

1238
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,020
I feel like 74 isn't that far removed from like you have a tattoo.

1239
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,020
What are you a sailor?

1240
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,020
Was Sam?

1241
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,020
He got it in the wars.

1242
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,020
He got it on like a fleet week.

1243
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,020
On the Navy.

1244
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,020
He got a full.

1245
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,020
Yeah it's a stick.

1246
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,020
He got a full like belly tattoo.

1247
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,020
Because it's so weird.

1248
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,020
Are you looking at a picture of it?

1249
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,020
It looks so strange if it's not a piece of clothing.

1250
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,020
I'm not currently looking at a picture of Sam Eagle no.

1251
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,020
Maybe Google it.

1252
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,020
I mean it just it looks so strange to me and I really can't tell what they were going for

1253
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:03,020
other than to make him like yeah like he's like not even like it's a it's an abstraction of a character even.

1254
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,020
He's holding like an arrow as well.

1255
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,020
And you know the arrow is very funny.

1256
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,020
Which at the end of the attraction he is holding outside of the capital.

1257
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,020
Yeah that's true.

1258
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,020
Do you imagine he's also got zip ties in his back pocket?

1259
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,020
Yeah Sam Eagle for sure.

1260
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,020
I mean he's up to something.

1261
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:31,020
Yankee Doodle Danny says I don't understand all these objections to the recount Arizona.

1262
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,020
I'm putting this arrow right through Mike Pence's head.

1263
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,020
That traitor.

1264
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,020
He's no Yankee Doodle.

1265
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,020
I'll tell you that.

1266
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,020
Ollie Al you haven't spoken enough support.

1267
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,020
You're dead to us.

1268
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,020
Stabs him with the arrow.

1269
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:51,020
I feel like there's a reason they didn't put Sam Eagle into Splash Mountain.

1270
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,020
They knew something.

1271
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,020
They knew something.

1272
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,020
They're like no no no.

1273
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,020
Sam Eagle's too much.

1274
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:01,020
No well no those the animals at that point were like he is a carpet bag and he shan't be coming.

1275
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:11,020
So yeah I don't know I cannot find any literature on the idea of what that was on his chest belly.

1276
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,020
Let's okay let's how little can we talk about the show.

1277
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:29,020
So it is a bit a big review of as we've said a bunch of sort of what now feel like public domain songs but they are like a lot of them are like traditional American songs and also as we said Yankee Doodle is the it's the rap around music.

1278
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,020
That's why it's in it so much.

1279
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,020
If you've ever seen the Carousel of Progress you know that the song is used as the loop.

1280
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:39,020
You leave one room and you enter the next room and they're singing Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow.

1281
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:45,020
It's a theater in the round so the same song has to play to seamlessly take you from one room to the next.

1282
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,020
And in this they use Yankee Doodle as that.

1283
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:57,020
It's really all on the back of Yankee Doodle and they not only that but it is like so breathless about Yankee Doodle not only do they sing it a bunch of times and then in different styles.

1284
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:07,020
Then you've got that weird part at the end where it sums it up like Yankee Doodle told us once that songs will build our future.

1285
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,020
And that sucks so much.

1286
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,020
That might be one of the worst touches that arrive at a track.

1287
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,020
I'm like fuck off.

1288
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,020
Like fuck you man.

1289
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,020
Do I still have this in front of me?

1290
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,020
The past is just a start.

1291
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,020
Tomorrow will bring songs to you that come straight from the heart.

1292
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,020
Another thing he had to say.

1293
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,020
What he didn't know he didn't know.

1294
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:33,020
The A team is working on Epcot at this point.

1295
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:37,020
American Adventure is like the seventh samurai.

1296
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,020
Kurosawa's seventh samurai compared to this.

1297
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,020
That's right.

1298
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,020
Like American Adventure is like much more watchable I feel like than this.

1299
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,020
Oh yeah.

1300
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:59,020
I think one of the things that's interesting about America's Adventure is that there's an absurdity to it and there's also a consistency to it which is missing from this.

1301
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,020
These snippets of songs are so short.

1302
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:08,020
And like just the first, okay right out the gate you're singing Dixie.

1303
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,020
You're singing I wish I weren't Dixie.

1304
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,020
Come on man in 1974 you knew that sucked.

1305
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:25,020
And then Lil Liza Jane is a very, that seems to have a very murky history of like slaves had been heard singing a similar song.

1306
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:35,020
And then but then also you bookend that with Camp Town Races which has a very checkered like history.

1307
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,020
You don't know the history of all of them do you?

1308
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,020
I don't want to know them.

1309
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,020
No I do know the history of all of them unfortunately.

1310
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,020
But I'm not going to do all of them.

1311
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,020
But it's just like I don't expect Disney to be like the people's history of the United States.

1312
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:56,020
But it's like you're stripping any context or history from it when you're just putting everything next to each other like that.

1313
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:01,020
You Google any song that like you sang in preschool and you're like oh my god it's from where?

1314
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,020
What the fuck? Like horrified.

1315
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:10,020
But it's like on top of just what you're saying of like if you look at history for anything you're like oh Jesus.

1316
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:15,020
But on top of that you're like these songs aren't even like who wanted to hear this in the 70s?

1317
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:21,020
Like it's just not it's like the country bears is like stuff that the songs like were funny or weird or whatever.

1318
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:32,020
But like I don't know it's just like I guess you're right in the sense that like putting all this stuff together isn't even like an enjoyable show even if you were to like take out any of the context for it.

1319
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,020
Right.

1320
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:40,020
Like some of these songs are like 100 years removed by the time you're at 1974 let alone looking at them nowadays.

1321
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:49,020
And yeah a lot of it gets stripped away for like schoolyard or chorus children's courses singing stuff with no offense intended.

1322
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:54,020
But it it is like when you go back it's like oh ring around the rosy is about the plague.

1323
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:58,020
There is yeah there is a lot of stuff like that.

1324
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:02,020
It is it is all it got to a comical point as I was going through the show.

1325
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:09,020
I think this to give it some credit acts three and four start to get start to get better.

1326
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,020
But like I mean there's some nice at that point it's too late.

1327
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,020
It's a little late.

1328
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,020
The down by the riverside I think is a cool set of cases.

1329
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,020
I want is a good like song.

1330
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:22,020
There's a pig that's like a showgirl and I like that character.

1331
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:31,020
I was exactly thinking that I don't think I always don't like when animals are showgirls.

1332
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,020
Another pet peeve of Scott's animals are showgirls.

1333
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,020
I think yeah I think so.

1334
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:40,020
And I think yeah anytime we've come across which in theme park world you do you come across this all.

1335
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:49,020
There are every theme park if it's been around for over 40 years has like a handful of female characters that are animals that were dressed as showgirls.

1336
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:56,020
Showgirls that has removed the context of the sex work that would often go along with that position.

1337
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,020
This is really Debbie Downer today.

1338
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,020
Yeah.

1339
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:03,020
I want you to know that that pig was also doing sex work on the side gentlemen.

1340
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:08,020
I'm adding a little bit of the Nashville the 1970s Nashville Robert Altman.

1341
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,020
Yes.

1342
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,020
Yes.

1343
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:15,020
It was a good time Jason but that pig that pig would also turn tricks for you.

1344
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,020
So yeah I know that that's right.

1345
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:18,020
Yes.

1346
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:25,020
No I don't like big when yeah animals like big feathers and they're in cancan lines and I don't like animal Mae West.

1347
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,020
Why is there so much of this.

1348
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,020
Would you be comfortable with animal prostitutes.

1349
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:32,020
The same way you don't like that.

1350
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,020
Not because they're not very aware.

1351
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,020
What's that.

1352
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,020
Because they're everywhere.

1353
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:42,020
I would personally say no but I wouldn't frown.

1354
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:45,020
No no we are pro animal sex work.

1355
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:50,020
OK.

1356
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,020
Well let me let me say this.

1357
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:59,020
One thing I was thinking about was the characters who I enjoy seeing in Splash Mountain.

1358
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:06,020
What did they do in this because it's a whole like we now you just pass by him on the log ride and you're kind of missing the context.

1359
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,020
What was their thing before.

1360
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:18,020
And I was especially looking forward to what do what were the sad characters doing because that's the funniest turn in Splash Mountain is when things things get dark.

1361
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:28,020
And it's always such a surprise you're cruising along and then like oh and I was like OK so it's a possum and it's bunnies.

1362
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,020
And the answer is pretty funny with both of them.

1363
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:34,020
The mother possum has a ton of baby possums.

1364
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:40,020
We know that for Splash Mountain and then you see them in this and she's singing the song I wish I was a single girl again.

1365
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,020
Yes.

1366
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:46,020
And that's that's definitely the sequel to the guys that turn me on turn me down.

1367
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,020
I feel like that's the sort of a similar joke.

1368
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,020
Sure.

1369
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,020
It's in the same lane of like but not as good not nearly as good.

1370
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:58,020
Not as good but I like I like knowing that like OK so her character context is she hates the children.

1371
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,020
Yes she's mad at having children.

1372
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,020
Yeah that's the joke.

1373
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,020
Get rid of the kids.

1374
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,020
And then the other one the sad rabbits.

1375
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,020
Yes.

1376
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,020
The rabbits do.

1377
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,020
Like what could this have been.

1378
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:13,020
And you know like all right I don't think they changed it from a happy face to a sad face.

1379
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,020
They must have been sad and America sings too.

1380
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:27,020
And in that case it is Ma Rabbit with a bunch of kids and there she's upset because she doesn't know where her husband is but is pretty sure he's at the bar.

1381
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:34,020
Like she's wailing about her drunk dad multiple drunks in this.

1382
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:41,020
That's another like we're talking about this being just unpleasant and it's unpleasant on 10 different levels.

1383
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:46,020
Good old songs of America and then like where's my husband.

1384
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:52,020
Yeah like every context it's almost every except for just like looking at a picture of the characters.

1385
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,020
Every other every other piece.

1386
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,020
Yes in the history of everything.

1387
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,020
I think it's why we thought we should do this.

1388
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,020
Yes because we like I know that.

1389
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:05,020
Oh and then they moved to Splash Mountain that'll be fun to talk about and one of them is a Goose It Star Tour.

1390
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:06,020
We'll talk about that and I've seen pictures.

1391
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:09,020
I know that this show is a blast.

1392
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,020
And you watch a video.

1393
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,020
No it's not a blast.

1394
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,020
It's not a bummer.

1395
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,020
Too late.

1396
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:21,020
It is like they got like some message like everything like Country Bears is like they're like very jokey about everything and I'm like it's like awesome gallows humor.

1397
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,020
Yes.

1398
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,020
Oh but that's OK.

1399
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,020
Next on to the next one.

1400
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,020
This is like this rabbit looks like she's been depressed for 30 years.

1401
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,020
I know all rabbits can live till.

1402
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,020
On Laudanum and Opium.

1403
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,020
Yes she is.

1404
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,020
Every sort of old timey Coca Cola.

1405
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,020
The doctors.

1406
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,020
Like the crazy Coca Cola.

1407
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,020
The doctor's out of options and they're going to consider a lobotomy because she's so sad.

1408
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:48,020
This is a song about the good humor the humors and you're you've got too much black bile not enough yellow bile.

1409
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,020
It is really like grasp.

1410
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:55,020
You're just we're just grasping for something and then you're like yeah there's those two sad characters from Splash Mountain.

1411
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,020
Oh yeah.

1412
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,020
Oh yeah.

1413
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,020
They're still sad.

1414
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,020
Still sad.

1415
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,020
Yes.

1416
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:04,020
It would be funny if they like had a smile on this and then they curve the smile down.

1417
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,020
Sorry robot you're sad forever.

1418
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:13,020
Unfortunately the story behind that is when they curved it you could hear the breaking of the robot bones.

1419
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,020
Well of course the robots have.

1420
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,020
And they said it sounded like screaming.

1421
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,020
Yeah the robots have feelings you know that.

1422
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,020
Yeah they have they can feel pain.

1423
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:26,020
In a lot of ways that the robots that made it out the with the easiest assignment were the geese that were stripped and put into star tours.

1424
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,020
Got an early retirement.

1425
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,020
They got out of there early they didn't get put in friggin Splash Mountain.

1426
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,020
Oh yeah yeah.

1427
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:33,020
They're out of luck with that anymore.

1428
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,020
Oh wait wait a minute.

1429
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,020
But one of the.

1430
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,020
But in Star Wars there were a lot of.

1431
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,020
No no.

1432
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,020
In the Star Tours one there's a nod.

1433
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,020
I saw someone point this out that Star Tours.

1434
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:58,020
The goose that became a robot in the queue for Star Tours is singing I've Been Working on the Same Droid to the tune of I've Been Working on the Railroad which does appear in this show.

1435
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,020
In America.

1436
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,020
So it's a little nod.

1437
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:05,020
I'm just saying you know you didn't get put in another problematic ride.

1438
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,020
You get in Star Wars a big famous thing.

1439
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,020
They must have been like oh shit.

1440
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,020
That's a big upgrade.

1441
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,020
We dodged a friggin bullet here.

1442
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:15,020
Leave all this good and some of these geese are drunk you want to get away from them.

1443
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:20,020
Yeah and it's a sad ass show and Star Tours is like fun and like there's adventures.

1444
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,020
Those geese got lucky man.

1445
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:26,020
That is funny that they just that's how unpopular this thing was at a point that like.

1446
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,020
Yeah just get rid of it.

1447
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,020
Nobody will know it like put this four geese at the beginning.

1448
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,020
Just get rid of them.

1449
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,020
Start tours is happening.

1450
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,020
Get it over there.

1451
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,020
Skin it.

1452
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,020
Skin it.

1453
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,020
Put a pair of binoculars on its head.

1454
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,020
Rip its skin off.

1455
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,020
You got yourself a Johnny Five.

1456
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:42,020
And you got a promotion for being resourceful.

1457
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:44,020
I've got a fun anecdote.

1458
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,020
Oh go ahead.

1459
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,020
Is it?

1460
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,020
I'm scared.

1461
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,020
A song I Singing in the Rain appears in this.

1462
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,020
I knew you were going to say that.

1463
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,020
Singing in the Rain appears in this.

1464
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:56,020
And I'm sure I've probably I must have talked about this on this show.

1465
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:02,020
I was so delighted to learn like a decade or so ago that Singing in the Rain did not

1466
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,020
first appear in the Gene Kelly's Singing in the Rain.

1467
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:12,020
Singing in the Rain appeared in a stage show called the oh what is it called the Hollywood

1468
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:16,020
Music Box Review and a movie called the Hollywood Review of 1929.

1469
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:23,020
The Gene Kelly's Singing in the Rain film is what we nowadays refer to as a jukebox

1470
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,020
musical.

1471
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:30,020
And most of those songs with I think the exception of Make'em Laugh and Moses Supposes appeared

1472
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:34,020
in earlier MGM musicals of the 20s and 30s.

1473
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:38,020
So it essentially like Singing in the Rain is essentially like the Moulin Rouge of its

1474
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,020
time.

1475
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,020
Oh yeah sure.

1476
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,020
I am delighted by that fact.

1477
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,020
It's on the AFI 100.

1478
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,020
It is on the AFI well deservedly so.

1479
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,020
It is fun.

1480
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,020
It is a fun movie.

1481
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,020
Boy America Sings makes Singing in the Rain look like Singing in the Rain.

1482
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:55,020
It looks like the Hollywood Review of 1929.

1483
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,020
Yeah.

1484
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,020
That's fun.

1485
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:01,020
Can I say who my favorite character name is in the show?

1486
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,020
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

1487
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,020
Who am I going to say?

1488
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:06,020
Well there's only like a handful of characters that they bothered to give a name to.

1489
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,020
There's also a good point.

1490
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,020
All the country bears seem to have names and then they were like yeah we'll name three

1491
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,020
of the characters.

1492
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,020
No time man.

1493
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,020
There's so many.

1494
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,020
Saddlesaur Swanson.

1495
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,020
Saddlesaur Swanson.

1496
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,020
Yeah.

1497
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,020
And what does he do again?

1498
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,020
I don't know.

1499
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,020
He's got a guitar.

1500
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,020
That's a good name.

1501
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,020
I'm not even saying I like the character.

1502
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,020
I'm just saying I like the name.

1503
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,020
Yeah.

1504
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,020
That's a fun name.

1505
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,020
It's got some personality to it.

1506
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:34,020
Well and I like you know when you see when you go on Splash Mountain again now you can

1507
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,020
point out some of these character names.

1508
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:43,020
You can say that's don't just say oh look at those funny gators in the hats who play

1509
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,020
instruments.

1510
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,020
Those are the Swamp Boys.

1511
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:49,020
And the vultures are not just vultures.

1512
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:53,020
The vultures are not just vultures who are surmising your doom.

1513
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,020
They're the Boothill Boys.

1514
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:01,020
So be sure to turn to whoever you're in the log with and tell them those facts.

1515
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:07,020
Especially if the other person in the log is a 12 year old boy who saw you slowly taking

1516
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,020
off your socks before the attraction began.

1517
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,020
Then be sure to turn around and say these are the Boothill Boys.

1518
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,020
Yeah.

1519
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,020
I have not done that.

1520
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:20,020
I have not done that although it seems like it's something I would do.

1521
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:28,020
Then the giant Irish dog who works for Disney security will beat you with a shillelagh.

1522
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:34,020
Will any of these characters survive the transformation of Splash Mountain?

1523
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:40,020
I've had this question and I like because you do got to populate that.

1524
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,020
Like it's a very long ride.

1525
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:46,020
Do we think that they resemble Princess and the Frog enough?

1526
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,020
They don't like fight it style wise.

1527
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,020
Right.

1528
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:55,020
Is there room in a Princess and the Frog ride for a clinically depressed rabbit?

1529
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,020
I'd like to think there is.

1530
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,020
A stressed out mother possum.

1531
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,020
Yeah.

1532
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,020
Regretting her choice to have children.

1533
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:04,020
Yes.

1534
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:08,020
I'd like to think there is but it is a question I've had because there's so many robots here.

1535
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,020
Yeah.

1536
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,020
Yeah.

1537
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,020
Will the showgirls remain?

1538
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:13,020
I don't know.

1539
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:21,020
I mean other option is just like promote them all as that one goose was long ago and just make them,

1540
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:24,020
strip them all for parts and make them all droids.

1541
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:29,020
So now the Star Tours line is 115 droids all clanking around.

1542
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,020
There's barely room for tourists to be in line.

1543
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,020
I'd love to put them in Galaxy's Edge.

1544
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,020
Walk, they're walking around.

1545
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,020
Walking around, yeah.

1546
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:42,020
Those cat walks just like constant droid walk cycles.

1547
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,020
So much noise.

1548
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,020
You never aren't seeing droids up there.

1549
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,020
Wow.

1550
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:49,020
They sure do sing Lida Rose a lot here on Batuu.

1551
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,020
Well, there's no way to change the programming for some of them.

1552
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:57,020
They have to still sing some classic songs from the American song book.

1553
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:02,020
I mean Home on the Range applies to those ranges in Tatooine.

1554
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:03,020
Yeah.

1555
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,020
And yeah, you can change some of that.

1556
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,020
Maybe reprogram them for the lyrics.

1557
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,020
Trist, twist in Batuu essay.

1558
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,020
That's a weird...

1559
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:18,020
Okay, so you've got kind of these eras of old bad music

1560
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:23,020
that remind you that there was no good song in America until maybe the 40s.

1561
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,020
Yes.

1562
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:29,020
Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy comes along and everyone loses their damn minds.

1563
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,020
Yeah, we're cooking.

1564
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:36,020
But now you end up, yeah, so you end up in the section that is called Modern Times.

1565
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:42,020
And quickly in the Modern Times section, you have like some animals

1566
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:46,020
and old college sweaters and pennants singing a tisket of Tasket.

1567
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:50,020
And that's what you could see that represents Modern Times in 1988.

1568
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,020
1988.

1569
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,020
Michael Jackson is out.

1570
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,020
Like, imagine what was...

1571
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:02,020
George Michael is topping the charts, but you get to hear old gray mare

1572
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,020
just being what she used to be.

1573
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,020
Yeah, it wasn't 100 years ago where this ride was.

1574
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,020
No.

1575
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,020
It was existing.

1576
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,020
And old gray mare is one of the bops.

1577
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:17,020
That's the one that everyone's like, okay, we don't have to worry about this one.

1578
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:22,020
I'm not kidding that in my notes, I have in my notes,

1579
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,020
Jason's going to say one of these songs is a bop.

1580
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,020
But I guessed wrong.

1581
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,020
I guessed Ra Ra Boom D.A.

1582
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,020
No, two problematic...

1583
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,020
No, I didn't know that.

1584
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:35,020
I wasn't saying you were going to like a problematic bop.

1585
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,020
I always thought that song was nonsense.

1586
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,020
I was like, where does the Ra Ra...

1587
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:40,020
God damn.

1588
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:45,020
You did have an opinion about Ra Ra Boom D.A. in your past.

1589
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,020
I just never thought...

1590
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,020
It just sounded like gibberish.

1591
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,020
A Tisket of Tasket.

1592
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:52,020
I just knew...

1593
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,020
I didn't know what the context of that song was,

1594
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,020
but I knew a tisket, a tasket,

1595
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:03,020
anyone who talking this or that, Chris Kirkpatrick,

1596
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:07,020
you could get your ass kicked from the Eminem song,

1597
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,020
without me.

1598
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,020
You're saying that's how you...

1599
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,020
Chris Kirkpatrick can get your ass kicked.

1600
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:15,020
He says a tisket, a tasket, and I never knew what that meant.

1601
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,020
You didn't know that was from a song.

1602
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:22,020
I didn't know that was like an old time, or like an old song or something.

1603
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,020
Eminem loves the classics.

1604
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,020
Sure.

1605
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,020
He loves the old time.

1606
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,020
He loved America Sings.

1607
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,020
His mom would take him to watch that.

1608
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,020
He'd clap along, the Yankee dude.

1609
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:34,020
That's the only thing he liked about his childhood, he would say.

1610
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,020
There's a song where...

1611
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,020
It's a real positive song that he wrote about America Sings.

1612
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:41,020
The biggest influence, I have to say, Saddlesaur Swanson.

1613
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:46,020
He has done a posthumous track with Saddlesaur Swanson as well,

1614
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:50,020
where it's kind of in a dream-like image of him.

1615
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,020
Oh yeah, sure.

1616
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,020
Rare outtakes.

1617
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:55,020
They've sampled him, like they've sampled Saddlesaur.

1618
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,020
He worked with the Saddlesaur estate.

1619
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,020
Yeah.

1620
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,020
Sorry, I got it wrong.

1621
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:00,020
It's a tisket, a tasket.

1622
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:04,020
I go tit for tat with anyone who's talking shit and that shit.

1623
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:07,020
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked.

1624
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,020
I mushmouthed it a little.

1625
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:13,020
He was there at the time not talking any shit about Green Day,

1626
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,020
and I'm mad that he was.

1627
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,020
Of all the people to be targeting, he didn't come through for me back in the day.

1628
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,020
Yeah.

1629
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,020
No.

1630
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,020
Oh, I mean, maybe he still...

1631
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:24,020
Green Day still, they're kicking, so maybe...

1632
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,020
Next time they come back, yeah.

1633
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:31,020
I would like to sort of brainstorm an entire Green Day version of America Sings.

1634
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:36,020
Starting back to Dookie, and then even going back before that.

1635
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,020
So every room that you turn to is a different...

1636
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:43,020
Yeah, the first one would be Kerr Plunk, which was the album before Dookie,

1637
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:48,020
and then there's two EPs, Smoothed Out, Slappy Hour, and I forget the other one.

1638
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:52,020
How is this what's bothering me the most in this episode?

1639
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,020
There's some good songs on Kerr Plunk.

1640
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,020
It's a very low-fi.

1641
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:59,020
It's a much more low-fi one, but there's some good songs,

1642
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,020
and that would be the first room.

1643
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,020
Dookie would be the Act Two.

1644
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:06,020
But it's still Sam Eagle taking you through that.

1645
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:08,020
It's Sam Eagle, but he is...

1646
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,020
The other character is the Jesus of Suburbia.

1647
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,020
Character from...

1648
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,020
But he tells the story like,

1649
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:19,020
Billy Joe, he played a song strumming on his guitar.

1650
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:23,020
George Bush lied and people died in the middle of hell.

1651
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:30,020
And then Nimrod and Insomniac, Room Three,

1652
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:34,020
and then Act Four is Modern Times with, of course, the triple album.

1653
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:37,020
You don't think you should expand this out to hit the other mall punk,

1654
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,020
or the mall rock of its day, like No Doubt or Bush or something?

1655
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,020
Absolutely not.

1656
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,020
Okay.

1657
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,020
Only Green Day.

1658
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,020
Green Day sings.

1659
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,020
I'm useless then.

1660
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:50,020
In that case, I'm useless if you're just taking the Green Day and Scott's mad.

1661
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,020
You might be on your own with this one, brother.

1662
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,020
Uno Dos Tres, the triple album they released.

1663
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,020
Jesus fucking Christ.

1664
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,020
Uno Dos Tres, because Tres Cool is the name of the drummer.

1665
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,020
You just want to expunge this shit from your brain.

1666
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,020
You want to just vomit these awful phrases out,

1667
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,020
not have to have them in your head anymore?

1668
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:11,020
If you've been vomiting a good way, yes,

1669
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,020
because I love saying these things.

1670
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:18,020
It's like when you're stretching for the first time after a flight or something.

1671
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:22,020
I haven't been able to say Uno Dos Tres for a long time,

1672
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,020
and now getting to say it really feels like,

1673
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,020
ah, that feels good, stretching my arms here,

1674
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:31,020
after a long multi-year flight of not being able to talk about Green Day albums.

1675
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,020
That's like you just stretched your arms out real wide

1676
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,020
and smacked another passenger in the face.

1677
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:38,020
That's what happened to me.

1678
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:41,020
In your instance, I smacked you in another,

1679
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:44,020
maybe there's a person on my right that I was more of a massage,

1680
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,020
like I was rubbing their back, and they liked it.

1681
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,020
They like what's coming out here.

1682
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:56,020
I'll come up with a foolproof set list for Billy Joe Sings,

1683
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:58,020
or whatever we're calling it.

1684
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,020
4X.

1685
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,020
Well, share it with Lindsay.

1686
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,020
See how long she stays in the room.

1687
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:08,020
Whisper it into a seashell and throw it in the Pacific.

1688
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:16,020
You may as well have just said, go soak your head, Fresh Boy.

1689
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,020
I'll write it up.

1690
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:24,020
The audience is going to want to see what I would do thematically,

1691
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,020
like what makes sense.

1692
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,020
Sketches.

1693
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:27,020
You sure?

1694
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:32,020
Well, I didn't say I was going to sketch Billy Joe.

1695
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,020
Overheads.

1696
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,020
So then.

1697
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,020
The Jesus of suburbia.

1698
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:38,020
Well, now we're back on, if we get to write the spoken word,

1699
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,020
we get to write the skits.

1700
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:44,020
What would burl Ives say about Green Day?

1701
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,020
Burl.

1702
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:50,020
If Burl Ives was singing Nice Guys Finish Last.

1703
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:57,020
I cannot emphasize that the framing device is just not helping in this.

1704
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,020
The Yankee Doodle framing device.

1705
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,020
No.

1706
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,020
I don't.

1707
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,020
How many times do you want to hear that song?

1708
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,020
Can I say real quick?

1709
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,020
I think there's many different ways.

1710
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:13,020
Because I was always confused about the reference of macaroni in Yankee Doodle.

1711
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:20,020
Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a pony, stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni.

1712
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,020
We sang this as children.

1713
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,020
No idea what it meant.

1714
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:31,020
This article says, when Yankee Doodle became popular tune in the late 18th century to call someone a macaroni was to connect them to a satirical type.

1715
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:36,020
Typically a male overly concerned with continental fashions and foreign art.

1716
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:40,020
Which I guess maybe it's like homophobic, but also like foreign art.

1717
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:45,020
Like, I don't know, like, ah, high snooty high society man who likes fashion and art.

1718
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,020
Like, I guess.

1719
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,020
So like, is that?

1720
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,020
There you go.

1721
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:51,020
It's like a big wig, like powdered wit.

1722
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,020
Kind of like.

1723
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,020
Yeah, I guess.

1724
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,020
So they were like, oh, you're a fancy boy, eh, Yankee Doodle?

1725
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:56,020
Like.

1726
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:57,020
Yeah.

1727
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:01,020
Yankee Doodle is just essentially David Letterman's dialogue from Cabin Boy.

1728
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,020
Do you want to buy a monkey?

1729
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:05,020
Isn't that the dialogue?

1730
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,020
He can do it.

1731
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,020
He says like, oh, you're some sort of fancy boy.

1732
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,020
Oh, right.

1733
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,020
Yes.

1734
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,020
Yeah, there's more.

1735
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,020
Yeah.

1736
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,020
Yeah.

1737
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,020
Sorry.

1738
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,020
I don't remember.

1739
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,020
Cabin Boy.

1740
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,020
I that's weird.

1741
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,020
Wait, so the guy is you're a macaroni if you wear that stuff.

1742
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,020
Yeah.

1743
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,020
The article is also confusing because it's like it might not be that.

1744
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:24,020
But like I had no one.

1745
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,020
Yeah.

1746
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:28,020
I mean, I think it's like that was like that was either a light diss or some sort of a

1747
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,020
diss.

1748
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:34,020
It's like when regular people are like, Obama's wearing a tan suit and I'm mad.

1749
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,020
Yes.

1750
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,020
Yes.

1751
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:40,020
There's the same outrage of like this man likes art.

1752
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,020
This man knows knowledgeable about art.

1753
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:45,020
I mean, I'm certainly feeling some heat right now for being so knowledgeable about Billy

1754
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,020
Joe Armstrong's art.

1755
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:49,020
I'm certainly like this is some macaroni.

1756
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,020
A little bit.

1757
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,020
Yeah.

1758
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,020
I kind of feel like, you know, I'm kind of more of like a worldly culture guy when it

1759
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:59,020
comes to some one of the great artists of the 21st century, 21st century breakdown.

1760
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:00,020
When it's in.

1761
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,020
Yeah.

1762
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,020
I'm feeling.

1763
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,020
Wait a minute.

1764
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:05,020
The good stuff's in the 20th century.

1765
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:08,020
Don't tell me is 21st century output.

1766
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:13,020
There's a new he has a new song that samples that Joan Jett song that was written by Gary

1767
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,020
Glitter, which is a good song.

1768
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,020
But problematic.

1769
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,020
Jason.

1770
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,020
I can dislike it on moral grounds.

1771
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,020
Now for more about Gary Glitter.

1772
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:26,020
Gary Glitter, I believe, though, doesn't make any money off his songs anymore.

1773
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:30,020
So I don't think he got paid from either an article shows when Joker came out, everyone

1774
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:34,020
was like Gary Gooder is getting a lot of money for the iconic stair dancing scene.

1775
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,020
But I believe he's not.

1776
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:38,020
I don't want Gary Glitter to get money from it, obviously.

1777
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:43,020
But if that was off the table, the animatronic show I would like to see now is an animatronic

1778
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,020
dancing down stairs.

1779
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:48,020
If they did that somewhere, forget about Spider-Man.

1780
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,020
Flipping through the air.

1781
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:54,020
If there was a set of stairs on a DC campus and Joker could do the dance.

1782
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,020
Six Flags, come on.

1783
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,020
Yeah.

1784
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,020
Get on this.

1785
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,020
This is such a great idea because they're so advanced.

1786
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,020
And I'm trying to say like Olaf can walk now and you know, but we can get yeah, we can

1787
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:10,020
get a dancing Joaquin Phoenix Joker down the stairs at a Six Flags.

1788
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,020
And then cops chase him away.

1789
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,020
And then the looper.

1790
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:17,020
And then cops chase him away.

1791
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,020
And then the loop starts again.

1792
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,020
And you never know when it's going to happen.

1793
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,020
It's going to happen 20 times a day.

1794
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,020
And it's a good show.

1795
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,020
At the very least until the technology is perfected.

1796
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:30,020
Just get one of the Valencia teens to dress up and do it.

1797
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,020
Why not?

1798
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,020
Like why not?

1799
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,020
Like a bunch of them.

1800
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,020
Joker.

1801
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:37,020
Every employee at a Six Flags should be dressed like the Joker.

1802
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:42,020
Jesus is the Joker like the fight club for this generation of like high school kids?

1803
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,020
Oh, for sure.

1804
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,020
You think so?

1805
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,020
And he's like the boom docks.

1806
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,020
Bigger because more people saw it now.

1807
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,020
That's true.

1808
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:54,020
Fight Club was one of the breakout like DVD like cold hits.

1809
01:21:54,020 --> 01:22:00,020
If you're a younger person, let's ask, do you love the Joker like the movie, the movie

1810
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:05,020
specifically or the character, the movie, the movie, the new Phillips Joker?

1811
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,020
Yeah.

1812
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,020
OK.

1813
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:10,020
There's a lot of iterations of the Joker that I think are of course more interesting

1814
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,020
or more fun.

1815
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:13,020
Like Jared Leto Joker.

1816
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,020
Oh, yeah.

1817
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,020
Well, that's just cool.

1818
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,020
I mean, Skrillex, we all know and love Skrillex.

1819
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,020
He's still around.

1820
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,020
He's still top of the charts.

1821
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,020
Yeah.

1822
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,020
You know.

1823
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,020
But yeah, I look, I want to see.

1824
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:29,020
I want to see the you guys didn't watch the end of the Zack Snyder Justice League, but

1825
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:35,020
they tease a future post apocalyptic movie where Jared Leto teams up with Batman.

1826
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,020
Oh, right.

1827
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,020
Spoiler alert.

1828
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:38,020
Teams up.

1829
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:42,020
We live in this is that where though we live in a society that not in the movie.

1830
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:47,020
That was just a clip for that was an outtake drive everyone and say, yeah, Jared Leto improvised

1831
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,020
that that sucks on the day and they put in the trailer.

1832
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:54,020
But is that line is not in the actual movie still things that were shot that aren't in

1833
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,020
the Snyder cut.

1834
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,020
Yeah.

1835
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,020
So there are there are.

1836
01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:01,020
He tried to shoot a scene with a green lantern and the WB wouldn't let him put it in.

1837
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,020
So there's still more.

1838
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,020
There could be yet another Snyder cut.

1839
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,020
Yeah.

1840
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:10,020
You're talking about the Snyder verse and the air is cut of Suicide Squad.

1841
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:11,020
But they are talking about that.

1842
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:15,020
Of course, there is the one cut we want the Schumacher cut of Batman.

1843
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:18,020
Well, that I think that's the real commercial.

1844
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,020
Yes, please.

1845
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,020
I mean, I like to see the Schumacher cut of Justice League.

1846
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:27,020
Just take the same footage and put a bunch of like trombones in it.

1847
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:34,020
And when you two and see all the let's Schumacher fi all the sound effects.

1848
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,020
Bonk, boink, pooh.

1849
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,020
Yes, I completely agree with that.

1850
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:40,020
That is a good idea.

1851
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,020
It is a good idea.

1852
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,020
I think away.

1853
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:49,020
One thing we I don't think we've touched on yet is that the like big finale song of

1854
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,020
America sings is old langsine.

1855
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,020
That's really weird.

1856
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,020
That's weird too.

1857
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:59,020
That's like America now sing to America.

1858
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:01,020
That is weird.

1859
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:04,020
TGI McScratchy's every show.

1860
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,020
Almost is equally weird.

1861
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:10,020
Slightly before it, they do Joy to the World.

1862
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,020
Not the Christmas Carol, the Joy to the World.

1863
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,020
The Three Dog Night.

1864
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,020
The Three Dog Night song, which is from an album from 1970.

1865
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,020
So closer, closer.

1866
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:24,020
Like by Disney standards might as well be topical in this ride.

1867
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,020
Like that's pretty current.

1868
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,020
Some of the closest they've ever come, maybe.

1869
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,020
Yeah.

1870
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,020
Being right on.

1871
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:33,020
I think kind of like a universally beloved.

1872
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,020
Like correct.

1873
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:38,020
That makes sense to me in here.

1874
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,020
Sure.

1875
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,020
It's the rest of the show.

1876
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,020
Maybe.

1877
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:45,020
I was thinking if I was somewhere and I saw a band go, all right, here we go.

1878
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:47,020
Jeremiah was a bull.

1879
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:51,020
I would turn in the opposite direction of that band.

1880
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:55,020
But you're like begging for it at that point in America Sakes.

1881
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,020
I think.

1882
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:57,020
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1883
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,020
It's like the best song.

1884
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,020
What is the best song in the show?

1885
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,020
Is it this?

1886
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,020
Is it Hound Dog?

1887
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,020
Maybe it's Hound Dog?

1888
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,020
It might be Hound Dog.

1889
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,020
Shake.

1890
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,020
Do you like Shake, Rattle and Roll?

1891
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,020
Maybe it's Shake, Rattle and Roll.

1892
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,020
It might be Shake, Rattle and Roll.

1893
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:12,020
I just saw that at the end of Clue they played that song.

1894
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,020
I think it's Shake, Rattle and Roll.

1895
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,020
I think it's Shake, Rattle and Roll.

1896
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:16,020
Hound Dog is fine.

1897
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:17,020
I've never been a big Elvis guy.

1898
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:19,020
Never been an Elvis guy.

1899
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:23,020
Like sometimes I listen to it and I go, oh yeah, he does have a nice voice.

1900
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,020
But Elvis never grabbed me.

1901
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,020
I get it.

1902
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,020
I get it.

1903
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:29,020
But I was never way into him.

1904
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:32,020
There's a lot of wonderful covers of Down by the Riverside.

1905
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:35,020
I do think that's a great song.

1906
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:36,020
Okay, all right.

1907
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:43,020
I like that you do get into the rock era in modern times.

1908
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:49,020
I don't know what site I copied this from, but I just like the dry description that you see a rock band

1909
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:54,020
consisting of a hippie stork with dreadlocks, love beads and granny glasses,

1910
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:59,020
a porcupine on drums and a rooster with his crest teased into a freight wig.

1911
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:02,020
And that's what they think rock music is.

1912
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:10,020
It's similar to like, am I remembering correctly that those vultures in Jungle Book look Beatles-y,

1913
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,020
but then they didn't do a Beatles-y song.

1914
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,020
They did a barbershop song.

1915
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:17,020
But they're like, all right, so we're representing the Beatles hair.

1916
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:23,020
We're representing the shaggy hair in a year by which they had stopped doing that hair.

1917
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:27,020
That is one and the same with that.

1918
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:32,020
Disney thinks, yeah, shaggy hippies, hippie dweebs, they're always rail thin.

1919
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:37,020
It is like, why aren't the Chuck E. Cheese and the Peach Boys,

1920
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:42,020
why aren't the Peach Boys in this or why aren't the Beatles, why isn't there?

1921
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:46,020
Yeah, I was thinking of it because Chuck E. Cheese has a lot of old songs in it too,

1922
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:49,020
but it's fun and a little sillier.

1923
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:54,020
It's sillier and this just, I don't know, despite the comical, like whimsical animals,

1924
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:57,020
it feels like it takes itself so seriously.

1925
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:03,020
That is probably what, I mean, obviously a bunch of older guys of this era probably were like,

1926
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:07,020
we must do justice through song for the bicentennial.

1927
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:11,020
And they probably, yes, they probably, they were like, this show is not,

1928
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:15,020
this show with a showgirl pig is not a joke.

1929
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:18,020
This is nothing to be, we'll have a few mild laughs,

1930
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:24,020
but in general, no, the show with an eagle and a top hat needs to be serious.

1931
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:27,020
And the only attempt at humor, we haven't said this,

1932
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:34,020
really the only joke throughout is that early on we hear Pop Goes the Weasel

1933
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:37,020
and a little weasel pops out and says, Pop Goes the Weasel.

1934
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,020
Again and again.

1935
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,020
And then this happens at every single scene.

1936
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:43,020
You're at his, the next scene happens, he keeps, you don't know where he's going to show up,

1937
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,020
and they put all their jokes in that basket.

1938
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:49,020
The one not changing joke over and over again.

1939
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:55,020
Look, if you're that weasel, if I come across you on the street, I am drop kicking.

1940
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,020
The weasel is bad.

1941
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,020
The weasel is really bad.

1942
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:00,020
The bit is not good.

1943
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:06,020
It's up there with the Yankee Doodle finale of like worst elements of this ride.

1944
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:11,020
I mean, I think, I wish they had kept adding stuff throughout,

1945
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:14,020
like, because you can reprogram Chuck E. Cheese.

1946
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,020
Of course.

1947
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:17,020
They could have added new songs.

1948
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:19,020
People in gas stations who are doing it still.

1949
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:21,020
They should have as the 70s gone on.

1950
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,020
After Nashville, Robert Allman's Nashville came out,

1951
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:27,020
they should have put in the It Don't Worry Me song that they're constantly singing.

1952
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:31,020
That very melancholy is played over the end of the chaos of that movie.

1953
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:34,020
I don't know if they were willing to be that subversive.

1954
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,020
Well, that's my punch up.

1955
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,020
That's what I would think.

1956
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:43,020
I would, yeah, my, well, I already said my punch up, which is perfect.

1957
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,020
It's Billy Joe.

1958
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,020
Send the right into the future.

1959
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,020
Send the show into the future.

1960
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,020
You're going to go work on the you're going to work on the punch up.

1961
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:50,020
Yeah.

1962
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,020
Make your plans.

1963
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,020
Yeah, sure.

1964
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:55,020
But yeah, there's a hundred things you could do.

1965
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:59,020
There are better like songs in the early 20th century.

1966
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:01,020
I think they picked wrong songs throughout.

1967
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:04,020
I think what always kept me away from really checking this thing out is when I was like,

1968
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,020
OK, wait a minute.

1969
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,020
So it's a revolving theater and it's a bunch of animatronics.

1970
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:08,020
That sounds like fun.

1971
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:09,020
What are the kinds of songs?

1972
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,020
That doesn't sound very good.

1973
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,020
I think that's why I hadn't watched this until this week.

1974
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:14,020
We decided to talk about it.

1975
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:16,020
More fun, more fun.

1976
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:21,020
On the way out the door, I saw a clip from an old Christmas special where Glen Campbell

1977
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:22,020
is on stage.

1978
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:28,020
He pops around all the locations and he sings Christmas songs with these characters.

1979
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:30,020
And I don't think they reprogram the robots.

1980
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:34,020
I think it's just editing to like make pseudo sync up happen.

1981
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,020
But it's better.

1982
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,020
It's more fun.

1983
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:39,020
Yeah, I did make I kind of liked the pig.

1984
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:45,020
I kind of liked the pig dancer because Glenn was kind of like, you know, cozy and up to

1985
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,020
her.

1986
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,020
And I was they had some chemistry.

1987
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:48,020
I felt.

1988
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,020
Yeah, I hear that.

1989
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:55,020
So that little clip, that clip genuinely is like so much more fun than the show.

1990
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,020
I am begging for that.

1991
01:29:56,020 --> 01:30:01,020
I mean, the idea of the current iteration that we know of is Christmas is a very American

1992
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,020
creation.

1993
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:10,020
Essentially, partially done by the Coca-Cola company adopting the idea of Santa Claus as

1994
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,020
a man.

1995
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:16,020
Like a lot of stuff that we consider Christmas traditions are very recent in modern history.

1996
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:21,020
And I think that would easily those traditions and songs could slot into this.

1997
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:24,020
Why aren't they like singing like Frank Sinatra songs or something?

1998
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,020
Clearance, I think.

1999
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,020
I think that's got to be it.

2000
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,020
Yeah, maybe.

2001
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,020
None of these.

2002
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:32,020
Yeah, because you don't have any of like, yeah, songs are getting good in that cold

2003
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:33,020
cold war Gershwin era.

2004
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:36,020
Those are old songs from the 70s.

2005
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:39,020
By that point in the 70s, those songs were still popular, but they were old.

2006
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,020
And those songs, like people play still.

2007
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:43,020
That would make so much more sense.

2008
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,020
Yes.

2009
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,020
Not really jazz represented per se.

2010
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,020
Yeah, it's so like, yeah.

2011
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:49,020
So hokey.

2012
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,020
All of this.

2013
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:54,020
It's like it's like it's like the old guys didn't have like a great taste.

2014
01:30:54,020 --> 01:31:00,020
Like Country Bear has some tradition, some original songs, some sort of like joke songs.

2015
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:03,020
I think it's a lot of like classic country and folk songs.

2016
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:06,020
But this but this kind of folk song.

2017
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:11,020
This is like when you go to a wedding, even a wedding where you're like, this DJ just sucks.

2018
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:14,020
Like this is just so like he doesn't know how to get people up.

2019
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:18,020
There was a good flow going on the dance floor and he's killed it.

2020
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,020
Like he kills it after one song or he or she.

2021
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:22,020
It doesn't matter where.

2022
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:24,020
Yeah, but it's like it's a no.

2023
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:28,020
Like you just that person who's doing the playing of the music doesn't know.

2024
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,020
Yeah.

2025
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:31,020
And that's how this feels to me.

2026
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:35,020
They don't know whoever put this together doesn't know how to get a crowd on their feet.

2027
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:39,020
Are the purple videos that I watched did not end in a standing ovation.

2028
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:40,020
No.

2029
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,020
Except what people got up to.

2030
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,020
But I think that was to leave.

2031
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,020
Yeah.

2032
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:44,020
Mark.

2033
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:46,020
Look, Mark Davis obviously is involved in stuff we like.

2034
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:48,020
I would not let him DJ my wedding.

2035
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,020
Sorry, Mark.

2036
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,020
Yeah.

2037
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:57,020
But I guess a DJ needs to know if you're going to like create a nice little flow to a set

2038
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,020
or you want to end big.

2039
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,020
You want to end with something great.

2040
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,020
Yeah, of course.

2041
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:05,020
Do we maybe want to so that this isn't it's similarly maybe we need to end with a bang.

2042
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,020
Sure.

2043
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,020
With I'm glad we saved this information.

2044
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,020
Anything else to say about the ride before?

2045
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:14,020
Because I think we if this episode's had a bunch of like weird and cruddy and dark stuff,

2046
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:17,020
although I ended up having fun.

2047
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,020
You know, I think we got something fun here to end with.

2048
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,020
But oh yeah, for sure.

2049
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,020
I know.

2050
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,020
I think I'm good here.

2051
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:23,020
We're set.

2052
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,020
OK, OK.

2053
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,020
We can skip over the.

2054
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,020
The gruesome death.

2055
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,020
The horrible death.

2056
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,020
Yeah, yeah, that's awful too.

2057
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:31,020
Because in case if anyone was getting ready to comment, I wonder if they're going to talk

2058
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,020
about the death.

2059
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,020
They didn't talk about it.

2060
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,020
We just did.

2061
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,020
We talked about it.

2062
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,020
That's it.

2063
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,020
I have to acknowledge it.

2064
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,020
The ride only shut down for two days.

2065
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,020
This is one of the grimest things I think we've come across.

2066
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,020
It's so awful.

2067
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,020
Yeah.

2068
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:47,020
And you can learn about it in the defunct land video where Kevin Perger even put in a

2069
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,020
warning card and it's bad.

2070
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:51,020
Yeah, it's it's it's just bad.

2071
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,020
This is a thing in general.

2072
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:55,380
I'm always like when we run across the rides where there was a death, I'm like, does anyone

2073
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:58,020
really want to hear us talk about the deaths?

2074
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,020
Sure, I don't think.

2075
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:05,540
No, this one is so notorious and it's negligence and it's shocking they didn't catch it ahead,

2076
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:12,460
like catch that this switching the clockwise versus counterclockwise rotation that no one

2077
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,500
it's insane.

2078
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,420
It's a huge lapse of safety and yeah.

2079
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,420
Yeah.

2080
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:21,740
But yes, that that also that ends up being like what people I think is Kevin says in

2081
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:22,740
that video.

2082
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,340
He's like, yeah, that's what people remember this ride for also.

2083
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:30,580
So yeah, getting gutted for to fill out Splash Mountain every every kind every piece of every

2084
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,580
layer of this ride or this show.

2085
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,580
Yeah.

2086
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,740
Anyway, I don't think we knew.

2087
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:35,740
I don't think we knew.

2088
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:39,340
I don't think I fully knew until we were talking and I was like, oh no.

2089
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,340
Yeah.

2090
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:41,380
Yeah, boy.

2091
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:46,540
We just like landmines in every direction, apparently, except for the end.

2092
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:47,540
Oh, yes.

2093
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,540
Yeah.

2094
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,340
Because here's what we have to say.

2095
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,340
So all right.

2096
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:52,620
It's Fourth of July weekend.

2097
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:57,940
There was a long time ago where we talked about like, OK, well, if hey, if old if old

2098
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:05,460
Joe, full Joe Biden is aiming for things to be up and running by the Fourth of July, which

2099
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:09,740
things sort of confusingly are to some extent.

2100
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:10,740
Yeah.

2101
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:16,620
I think I will still spend my I think I'll spend my Fourth of July still avoiding crowds,

2102
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:20,780
for health reasons, which is because I think it made me realize I don't want to be in crowds

2103
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,780
anymore.

2104
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:22,780
Oh, yeah, sure.

2105
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:23,780
Yeah, sure.

2106
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:24,780
Yeah.

2107
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:28,140
So but anyway, I mean, they're still it's been gradual, but I think there's good feelings

2108
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:34,500
and we had just like we had said maybe is Fourth of July maybe a good time to do something

2109
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,020
that we keep we've talked about for so long.

2110
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:41,460
So we talked about being the first thing back when we were back in person and then we realized

2111
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,180
like, oh, it's too much to pull off.

2112
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,900
It's something we talked about doing in 2020.

2113
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,100
So we have teased so aggressively.

2114
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:55,620
It is not this show, but another animatronic animal musical show.

2115
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,980
And I think you know what we mean at this point.

2116
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,140
Talking about the country bears.

2117
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:01,140
Yes.

2118
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:06,300
So I mean, what from our perspective, is it maybe it's just it's felt too daunting.

2119
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,980
It's felt like, you know, like, like, really, are we there?

2120
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:10,980
Are we ready?

2121
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,980
Are we in a place?

2122
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:13,380
Yeah, it certainly felt daunting.

2123
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:17,220
There's been a lot of angles like I think, oh, then there's this angle to take on it.

2124
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:18,220
There's a song.

2125
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,220
There's the history.

2126
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:21,860
There's the making of and so it's been a little daunting.

2127
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:27,180
It was cursed because we said we're going to do it in this way at this time.

2128
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,020
And that pretty much is a pod any podcast.

2129
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:31,860
If you do that, life is going to get in the way.

2130
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:36,980
Like, I don't know that any of us expected America to like the vaccines to like hit the

2131
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,700
gas and like stuff to open that quickly.

2132
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,700
Yeah.

2133
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,980
We very quickly tried to jump and get some like back, you know, go back to theme parks.

2134
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:47,940
We've been talking about not going to theme parks for 16 months.

2135
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:49,820
Let's get to some theme parks.

2136
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:50,820
So yeah, that's true.

2137
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:51,820
Yes.

2138
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:54,340
Yeah, current finds a way like gets in the way.

2139
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,340
I don't know.

2140
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:57,100
What do you want to say?

2141
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:58,100
Lots going on.

2142
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,100
I don't know.

2143
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:03,340
But I think the main thing is ambition is grown.

2144
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:04,940
We want to do we want to do this right.

2145
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:07,380
We want to do some fun with it.

2146
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:16,020
And that is why we are announcing officially Country Bear Jamboree week, an entire week

2147
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:21,620
and we end which we should say the phrase a daily podcast series.

2148
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:22,620
Yes.

2149
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:24,340
Devoted to the Country Bear Jamboree.

2150
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,340
Yes.

2151
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,340
We're going to do it right.

2152
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:29,540
We're going to do it exhaustively.

2153
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,540
Not 18 part, not 19 parts.

2154
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,540
No, no, no, no, no.

2155
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:36,100
Well, I mean, what it like, why would we do that many?

2156
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:40,660
It's not as if this is a shopping district next to a theme park.

2157
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:41,660
Yeah, no.

2158
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:48,940
But and the rules and metrics of Country Bear Jamboree are evolving as we speak.

2159
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:50,940
It's being locked down as we speak.

2160
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,940
By that you mean we don't know when we're going to do it yet.

2161
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,940
That's what you're saying.

2162
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,940
Well, but that and also like and then it'll be this.

2163
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:58,100
Oh, I know exactly what it is.

2164
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,860
Well, yeah, this has been Mike's opus for a while.

2165
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,860
We all have our favorites.

2166
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:03,860
I'll give Scott.

2167
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:04,860
Scott was the idea to do it.

2168
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,620
Scott had a great.

2169
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:07,620
Yeah.

2170
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,620
For the week, I think.

2171
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,620
Yeah.

2172
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:10,620
Yeah.

2173
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:12,420
Which then now I end up getting mentally punished by these things.

2174
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,900
I'll have the idea and then I end up regretting it later.

2175
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:20,140
But I don't this seems like this seems like a blast fun way to cover.

2176
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:25,300
And the idea and all I'll say is my idea at all time was what the finale is going to be.

2177
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:28,260
That was that is what I'm very, very excited.

2178
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:31,900
I'm excited for everything, very excited for the finale of this.

2179
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:32,900
Right.

2180
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,420
Well, now we'll see what that is.

2181
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,660
And again, we keep digging ourselves deeper into what I promised.

2182
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:40,300
Yeah, I promised a real spectacular finale.

2183
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,980
So you keep saying it.

2184
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:46,820
Yeah, no, it's going to be like again and again until the expectation is so high.

2185
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:51,380
Got a minute and a half like Sam Eagle and Muppets and Muppets 3D.

2186
01:37:51,380 --> 01:37:52,380
Yeah.

2187
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:54,580
You know what?

2188
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:57,380
If you have any suggestions for how we do that, if there's things that you don't want

2189
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:00,580
us to to miss, if there's something where you're like, that's how it should go.

2190
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:04,100
If there's if anybody's listening who, you know, like, hey, our favorites, you know,

2191
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:07,300
we're talking to you if you want, if anybody there are favorite guests, if you want to

2192
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:10,260
come talk about anything about country bears, feel free.

2193
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:15,020
Or it'll just be us for four days because we determine nobody cares.

2194
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,460
Four to five. We don't know that either.

2195
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,980
I don't know. But it'll be contained to a week.

2196
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:20,860
Country Bear Jamber Week.

2197
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:22,580
I think it's five. I think it's going to be five.

2198
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,180
OK, great. Good. Great.

2199
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:26,140
But you never know. These things grow.

2200
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:27,660
That's a good point. Yeah, that's a good point.

2201
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:30,540
It could be a full traditional calendar week of seven.

2202
01:38:30,580 --> 01:38:31,940
I don't know how it would be.

2203
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:35,220
But that would be the it doesn't feel like seven, but

2204
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:37,780
isn't five feeling like two.

2205
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:40,020
But five is a work week.

2206
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,980
Five is a work week. Yeah.

2207
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,300
So these are work week.

2208
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:46,500
Although, I mean, maybe you all of a sudden I'll try to slip in like

2209
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,220
Captain Kidd's buffet into Country Jamber Week.

2210
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:51,420
Would that count? That's getting annexed.

2211
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:52,460
I don't know. Maybe.

2212
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:54,140
I think it's closed, by the way. Do we know?

2213
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:55,900
I think so. We've heard we've heard.

2214
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:58,580
Captain Kidd's captain closed.

2215
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:01,740
The like Google page or yell pages are a little, you know,

2216
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:03,380
those can never be 100 percent accurate.

2217
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:05,340
But I think some people said they went by it.

2218
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,220
Yeah, it was closed.

2219
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:09,900
So it's not somewhere I'm dying to be. Right.

2220
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,100
No, I'm not. You sure.

2221
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:15,700
But I am dying to be in the in the country, bear jamboree in my mind.

2222
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,700
We will do this soon.

2223
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,580
We don't know exactly.

2224
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:23,460
But by the further now and then we'll get then we'll do an announcement

2225
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,140
in 14 months where we break down what it's going to be.

2226
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,620
And then we still don't do it.

2227
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,100
Yeah. Keep getting slid and slid.

2228
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:33,220
What is wait a minute. What is this?

2229
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:36,620
What's the analog from the AFI top 100?

2230
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,180
What is a movie that kept taking forever?

2231
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,100
Is it the apocalypse now?

2232
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,140
Oh, Titanic's on the AFI list, is it?

2233
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,340
Yeah, that took quite a while to do.

2234
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:51,220
And then apocalypse now, if you're including is is the is Verner Herzog's

2235
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:53,980
Fitzcarraldo on the list?

2236
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,780
It's Carraldo someone with the boat, right?

2237
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:57,140
Yes, it's trying to.

2238
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:00,180
It is like the plot of Fitzcarraldo.

2239
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:04,740
Like we country bears is us trying to drag the boat up the mountain.

2240
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:05,780
Scott, you know, we're talking about.

2241
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:07,620
I haven't seen it. I'm aware of the reference.

2242
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:08,780
Yeah, yeah. He was trying to.

2243
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:11,900
There was he's trying to actually pull like a boat in real life over

2244
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:14,020
like this hill to into another body of water.

2245
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:18,620
And the boat got stuck that way for a very long time, stalling every like

2246
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:21,780
everybody was stuck on location, people going mad.

2247
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:23,540
There's a documentary about it.

2248
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:26,780
Klaus Kinski is regular mad man already.

2249
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,980
Yeah, it's like, yeah, Batman and the Joker.

2250
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:32,940
Heard talking Kinski. Yeah. Wow.

2251
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,700
So that's our country bears. The same thing.

2252
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:35,940
It's OK. OK.

2253
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:39,340
We found one more A.F.I. analog or A.F.I. adjacent.

2254
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,740
That might not be on the A.F.I. list.

2255
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:44,780
Also, Warner Herzog also direct Grizzly Band, and that's also bear related.

2256
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:46,980
Yeah, you're right. That get thrown in.

2257
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:51,220
I mean, we have to decide which which of each of each song

2258
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:53,740
is aligned with which Verner Herzog movie.

2259
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,020
That's so much to determine.

2260
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:56,900
Yeah. We put it on five. We'll see.

2261
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2262
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,540
Tears will be the chasers of my one.

2263
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,140
That's kind of like the

2264
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,300
port of call badly, and it's kind of a call.

2265
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,780
Is that her song? I think I believe so.

2266
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,380
Yes. Yes, it is. Yeah.

2267
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:11,820
OK, so it's on the books.

2268
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,100
We can't take it back now.

2269
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:16,020
We can't delay it still, but hopefully we don't believe we do it soon.

2270
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:16,700
We'd like to do it.

2271
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:17,180
We can do it.

2272
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:19,580
So what a take, you know, because it's a suburb.

2273
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:22,020
We like to see our families.

2274
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:23,300
I guess they. Yeah.

2275
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,860
And travel a little.

2276
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:27,260
And so it's in the works. Great.

2277
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,420
OK, so it's coming.

2278
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:32,100
