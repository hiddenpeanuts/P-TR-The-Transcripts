1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,720
Warning, said the Lord to uncharismatic creationist Ken Ham.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:18,420
Thou must recreate Noah's Ark in Kentucky and make it full of dinosaurs, depressed animatronics

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,540
doing chores, and unlimited soda refills.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:31,780
If thou faileth, the earth shall be smoten, and lo, Ken built this ark, and it was bad.

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,580
Today, the Ark Encounter on a special Easter podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:01:00,940
A most mournful Good Friday to everyone.

9
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:08,640
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a show hosted by three very good men, much like Noah's sons,

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,960
Shem, Ham, and Japeth.

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,880
We're the Shem, Ham, and Japeth of podcasting.

12
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,320
I'm the Shem Scott Gardner.

13
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,920
I guess, I don't know.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,020
Well, Japeth is closest to Jason.

15
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,180
So Jason is Japeth.

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,660
You know, I thought I was a given for Ham, but I guess-

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,660
Oh, what am I saying?

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,660
It was right there.

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,660
I was right there.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,080
We've been doing this podcast for years now and you didn't?

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,880
That's the lowest hanging fruit I've ever heard.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,820
That's a good Ham.

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,340
There's an evil Ham today that's gonna come up a lot.

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,340
Oh, that's right.

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,940
Maybe you don't want to be associated with Ham.

26
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,300
But that's the Easter, that's the traditional Easter feast, you know?

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,060
Yeah, well in two days, all of us will want to be associated with Ham as much as possible,

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,540
including Mike Carlson, who I guess has shifted to Japeth.

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,620
I am Japeth, but I like to think of myself as a Ham.

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,500
I know we're three Cliffords and our listeners are all Cliffords, but for this episode, we're

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
three Hams.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
They love it.

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,300
Three Hams and our listeners will be known as Hams, just for this week, this holy week.

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
That's fine to me.

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,620
Whatever definition you want to take, but maybe yes, maybe not a Ham in the way.

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:35,660
We're certainly not related to Ken Ham, the guy who figured out the evil Walt of today's

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,860
park.

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,420
Just to be clear before we get into it, this is the beginning of Easter weekend and last

39
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,940
year we kind of started a tradition of talking about religious theme parks.

40
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,740
Last year we talked about Orlando's very bizarre Holy Land experience, a place where there

41
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,700
are crucifixions on the daily.

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,740
And I didn't know if it could get more bizarre or maybe more contemptible.

43
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,460
Contemptible is the word that I have written down multiple times.

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,620
I stole that from you.

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,140
You said that before we started recording and I really liked the word and it's a correct

46
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
word.

47
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:21,620
That's the Ark encounter, a place where you can see Noah's Ark in the exact proportions

48
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:30,860
that it was built in Noah's time, which as we learned from all this was what, like 4000

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,860
years ago?

50
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
A couple years ago.

51
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
A couple years ago.

52
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
Really?

53
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
Yeah.

54
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,300
Right before the Pilgrim times.

55
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,300
This definitely didn't happen in a, well, no, maybe it did happen in America.

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm not sure where that lands in the whole creationist mythos.

57
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,220
Maybe Noah's Ark actually did happen in Kentucky.

58
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,980
Oh, that's yes, that's a very good chance.

59
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,040
There's a lot of, I kept writing down the word retcon in my notes while watching interviews

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,800
with Ken and for just a little context, I'm sure we talked last year, I had virtually

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,200
no religious teaching as a youth.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Jason is similar?

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Yes.

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,840
No, we went to church most Sundays.

65
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,960
We went to like a very chill Protestant church, although it was Presbyterian and there's some

66
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,200
kooky branches of Presbyterianism.

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,240
A lot of it going back to I think the origins of Calvinism, which is, I believe, the idea

68
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,920
that when you are born, it's already predetermined whether you are good or bad.

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,120
And I didn't get any of that shit.

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,240
I got like what the Simpsons got, you know, going to church.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
So that's okay.

72
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Yeah.

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,040
Simpsons stuff seems like, yeah, Simpsons seemed like a pretty like passable, you know,

74
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,040
that's a kind of religious, you could be and be fine.

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Yeah.

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,440
I mean, the thing that I always bring up when I talk about it is like a lot of pastors who

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,520
would start a sermon by trying to be relatable to the crowd of like, you know, I was at the

78
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,840
mall this week and I saw a group of teens goofing around and that reminded me of the

79
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Apostles.

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,840
You know, they would just make very tenuous connections of like, I was watching America's

81
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,200
funniest home videos and so pretty harmless stuff.

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,400
But I know a lot of people who have the worst, much worse story.

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,200
In some ways, the original Biker Mice from Mars were the three wise men.

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
That's a pastor who really studied TV Guide.

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,280
He actually did the deep dive.

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Yeah.

87
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,720
He wanted to really relate to the kids.

88
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,860
So yeah, I mean, I, we would go once in a while to church and, but I didn't go to any

89
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,360
sort of religious school.

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,400
I vaguely, I knew probably religious most from the Simpsons and the things.

91
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Yeah.

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Oh, wow.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Wow.

94
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
That's an interesting context for it.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Yeah, completely.

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Yes.

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,160
Raised hardcore Catholic, which again, on the scale of things is not the hardest of

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,880
core that there could be.

99
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,920
And all this was making me flash back to what did creep me out when I would come across

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:18,040
it because there's not enough, like I was pretty comfortable with Catholicism, but then

101
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,400
you were always right around the corner from ickier stuff and there's not like, there's

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
not enough full Catholic media to avoid the ickier stuff.

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,760
Like you'd catch little glimpses of it.

104
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,000
My parents would do their best to say, well, that's not really what we believe, which I

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,960
appreciated because boy, as we'll find today, there is some, some big time icky stuff.

106
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,280
The other thing that I was flashing back to is that, yeah, I was full Catholic for not

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,720
my elementary school, but my middle school and my high school.

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:07:00,040
So a lot of Catholicism in the education, including that my high school theater program,

109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,920
which Joe Rody is a graduate from, he got his start painting sets for my, the school

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,080
I eventually went to.

111
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,480
We did, and I say we, I wasn't really part of it.

112
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,920
I was the crew that filmed the play and there was a play that was done called Noah and nobody

113
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Maybe don't know the play Noah and that is because it was written by the theater director

114
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,200
of my high school.

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:33,200
This was an original production and like a big long play with lots of numbers and you

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,720
know, the way they have to cast that stuff, Jason, you know this where it's like, all

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,440
right, we need a 90 parts because we got to fit everybody in.

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,480
So this was a massive sprawling production where you aren't even on the arc until act

119
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
two.

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,520
Like you have to go through the creation of man.

121
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:59,600
God is a character in the show and you have to see first sin and a song by a sexy snake

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,320
who's in like pleather pants in sort of like Brittany era, early 2000s.

123
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,260
It was, he was seducing man.

124
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,760
But when, in just in thinking about Noah's arc, I was flashing back to my fondness for

125
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,920
Noah, which really was an incredible production and which I wish made it past my high school

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:28,600
and was something that all high schools had to do, especially because there, you know,

127
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,880
you know what wasn't on Noah's arc were animals that are made up like unicorns, unicorns,

128
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
not on the arc.

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,000
And this is addressed in my high school play because there is a song where the unicorns

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
are late.

131
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,760
They didn't get to the arc on time because the wife unicorn was fiddling around with

132
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
chores at home.

133
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,120
The husband was there on time.

134
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,800
Women love to sacrifice their own well-being to do chores?

135
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
To do, yeah.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,180
Even in the face of the biblical flood, of the big flood, the woman, the wife is still

137
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,940
like tidying things and they address this in the scene.

138
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,120
Where were you?

139
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,520
I was straightening up at home.

140
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,080
But the flood is coming.

141
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
I don't know.

142
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,200
Habit, I guess.

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Where is the arc?

144
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
The arc has left already.

145
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,160
And then it's, I would post this if I didn't want to like embarrass the people I don't

146
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,960
know who are in the production, but I have tapes of it because I filmed it.

147
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,480
I was media crew.

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,120
So there's this incredible song and boy, I would love The Arc Encounter more if there

149
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,140
was something as creative as this on it.

150
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:51,760
This great song where the character of God's favorite dove swoops down and sees how sad

151
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,540
it is that the unicorns miss their chance to be in the arc and get saved.

152
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:02,420
So she has a new plan and the plan is to make them live in the realm of imagination where

153
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,060
it's like here you will be in our dreams.

154
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,620
You may not get to thrive and reproduce, but you'll be in the hearts of man forever, which

155
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,100
is conveyed in a song that is mainly ripped off from Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds that

156
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,980
even has lines about tangerine sunsets and stuff like that.

157
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:28,260
And then it's a dance done by two human unicorns with like big plastic horns glued to their

158
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
heads.

159
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Oh my goodness.

160
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,900
And you can't just blur all these people out and post this for us?

161
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,100
It would take a while.

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
This would be a process.

163
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Maybe.

164
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Yeah.

165
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:47,180
So if I could get it to a post studio, what I can do is recite from memory the thing that

166
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,900
the dove says at the end of the when it's time to do our part for the unicorns.

167
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,560
Let me make sure I think I knew because this is this was in 2001 and it's still burned

168
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
into my brain.

169
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,580
So let me just see if I can do this.

170
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
Okay.

171
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,100
Angel friends come now it's time from the floodwaters they must climb.

172
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,300
This is a part I don't remember very well.

173
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
From this realm they must depart.

174
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,140
Lift them high high up in the human heart.

175
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,820
Place them in their destination in the realm of imagination.

176
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:31,140
And then the song is like you'll be always and forever till all the stars have been wished

177
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,420
away and then some psychedelic stuff.

178
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
Wow.

179
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Wow.

180
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
I know this so well.

181
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,180
I've thought about this like nonstop since almost 20 years ago at this point.

182
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,620
That almost sounds like the Phil Collins Hercules soundtrack.

183
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
Yeah.

184
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Tarzan you mean.

185
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
Yeah.

186
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
I'm so sorry.

187
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,620
That's the yeah.

188
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Excuse me.

189
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
A little bit.

190
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,220
Well it's that like son of man.

191
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,540
There is that that grandeur to it.

192
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,740
I feel like if only roadie had still been around.

193
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,820
If he was still checking out the alma mater maybe he could have seen it and then got it

194
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,820
made in the part.

195
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,660
He this would have been a shoe in I think for Animal Kingdom.

196
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,940
No alive right after Tarzan's done.

197
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
There had to have been.

198
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,220
I mean obviously they want to Disney wants everything to be very secular but what a great

199
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
idea.

200
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,660
Well Disney they did know in they've done know actually several times they did know

201
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,980
in Fantasia 2000 where the animals marched to the graduation theme which was distracting

202
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,700
to everyone.

203
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:37,660
And did you know that there was a Tony Danza modern version of Noah done by Disney for

204
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,140
the wonderful world of Disney in the late 90s.

205
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Oh my God.

206
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,700
This is unfindable.

207
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,300
There's not even clips on YouTube.

208
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,460
No one is bothered to archive this.

209
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,460
Wow.

210
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,620
It's like only barely there that a record even exists much like biblical texts.

211
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,340
It's gotten erased to the sands of time.

212
00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:01,140
And Mike the angel who tells Tony he needs to be a modern carpenter that he needs to

213
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,100
build an ark Wallace Sean.

214
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
No way.

215
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Yes.

216
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Yes.

217
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Wow.

218
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,220
How does nobody know this for it being as an angel named Zack.

219
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,820
Wallace Sean is the angel Zack.

220
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,020
How did you come upon this then or did you see it when I saw it in a dream.

221
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,940
God himself spoke to me.

222
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,940
No I was just looking up like depictions of Noah and there besides the weird there was

223
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,780
a look at was it Aaron off schema Aaron Austin and I'm Bren Evan Almighty.

224
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
Obviously Crow.

225
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
Yeah.

226
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,180
By the way this arc experience taught me I think Evan Almighty lied to me about some

227
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,180
of this stuff.

228
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,580
You know it wasn't a funny weatherman.

229
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
Yeah.

230
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,580
Being betrayed by Evan and Evan Almighty.

231
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,420
That's wild.

232
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,100
I mean I guess no I mean I knew the story of Noah.

233
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,020
That actually I think I guess as I was saying that is like kind of been secularized to some

234
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
degree.

235
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,460
I mean you leave out all the other like I mean God tells Noah what to do.

236
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,780
But other than that as a kid it's just like oh there was a lot of water and he saved all

237
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,980
the animals like that story is fine.

238
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,500
Like you don't have to necessarily.

239
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,780
There's nothing terribly and you and we'd grow up watching I think you could be non-religious

240
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,620
and end up seeing the Ten Commandments or even some amount of Jesus stuff.

241
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,580
Even Disney made Jesus.

242
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,140
There's a thing about the called small one about the donkey who's there in the nativity.

243
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Yes.

244
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,900
So like Disney wouldn't avoid it.

245
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,700
I think today they would but 80s 90s they'd still go there.

246
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,980
People who even aren't religious can acknowledge like there's some good stories.

247
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,660
There's a reason these are like inspirational stories creationist stories.

248
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,780
But then sometimes they take a little bit of a wrong turn.

249
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,860
Look I my feeling with a religion I take the Kevin Smith dogma approach.

250
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,220
I happy but everyone believe what they want to believe as long as it's not like you're

251
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,740
not starting a war you're discriminating against people like that sucks.

252
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
That stuff sucks.

253
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,360
Yeah I don't disparage anyone their faith but Young Earth creationism.

254
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,460
Get the fuck out of here man.

255
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,500
Get out of here with that shit like and the fact that you are trying to this place the

256
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,820
Ark encounter is trying to use it as like elementary school kids come learn the real

257
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,900
truth like I feel like that is such a fine.

258
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,940
There's a real slippery slope from the earth is 6000 to 10000 years old to the vaccines

259
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,940
got 5G chips and Donald Trump gonna be president in August anyway.

260
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,300
You know this is exactly what I was leading into this.

261
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,420
Yeah I think you know in considering my religious upbringing and what I object to about it and

262
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,820
this was not my parents.

263
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,700
There was no trickery going on with my parents but you'd run into trickery you'd run into

264
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,780
like here this is a nice thing we're going to tell you about and then it's fire and

265
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,300
brimstone and something even crazier than fire and brimstone.

266
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:09,420
I was recalling a thing where my mom seeing that I was getting into CDs found me a magazine

267
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,260
called breakaway magazine and this was a cool magazine.

268
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,900
There's a surfer on the front you know like I like and she gave it to me and said this

269
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,220
is for young people this is there's actually they talk about some of the albums you listen

270
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,220
to I thought oh no kidding well then I must check this out this magazine and there was

271
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,860
there was in fact a review of the Beastie Boys Hello Nasty potentially my favorite album

272
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,820
at the time which just throws the whole thing under the bus because of the one line I be

273
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:48,580
smoking roaches in the vestibule so therefore the Beastie Boys are damned for all eternity

274
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,660
how dare they befoul vestibules but then I kept going then I like what that well I this

275
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,780
isn't I don't want to read about why my album is bad what's this thing who made breakaway

276
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,540
magazine focus on the family.

277
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
There it is.

278
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,580
James Dobbs said yeah and you know that that's like I can't remember the specifics about

279
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,620
but that's like that's horrible hateful bigoted like an awful organization.

280
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,180
That guy and the Catholic League if you remember the offshoot of the Catholic Church the Catholic

281
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,620
League who I think pretty much the Catholic Church washed their hands of a long time ago

282
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:30,140
that was the guy who was most mad at things like dogma or any popular culture after like

283
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,900
1950 you know.

284
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
Yeah.

285
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,180
Yes yeah did I say last time we talked about religious stuff how much I remember it wasn't

286
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,100
my church but I go on a vacation and then the other church we didn't go to the preachers

287
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:53,180
completely upset about dogma and about maybe the movie kids I remember that wasn't the

288
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,220
same year but I remember a sermon about kids I remember a sermon about powder.

289
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,220
Powder.

290
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,700
Yeah something wrong with powder I don't remember why.

291
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,300
I think powder is a creepy movie.

292
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,260
I think he embraces the supernatural phenomenon right like he's got some powers but they're

293
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,860
not necessarily from God.

294
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,580
Did he have a problem with John Travolta's phenomenon?

295
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,700
No I think phenomenon is wait no phenomenon is.

296
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,020
Michael is the angel John Travolta will be.

297
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,140
But phenomenon is supernatural stuff.

298
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,140
He like makes a spoon like float.

299
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
Phenomenon is not Michael.

300
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,380
Phenomenon is not Michael.

301
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,900
Michael and Michael is not powder.

302
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,340
And neither of them are K packs.

303
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
Neither of them are K packs.

304
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,820
Neither of them are K packs.

305
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
No.

306
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
What could be.

307
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,060
I was saying before we started recording that it's a very funny week to be doing this episode

308
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:52,140
because we're coming off like the satanic panic of the Lil Nas X Montero music video

309
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:58,180
where he grinds on and then murders Satan and takes his crown.

310
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:04,060
And there's like a sneaker sneaker customizer doing a limited run of like these sneakers

311
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,100
each have a single drop of human blood in it.

312
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:14,420
And every maniac right wing swab came out of the woodwork just be like I stand on guard.

313
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,740
I stand on guard against you and the devil.

314
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,740
And meanwhile Lil Nas X is just having the time of his life giving them the business

315
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,460
of being like here's the storyboards we made.

316
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,780
I use the screen grab of SpongeBob and Patrick to inspire this.

317
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,580
Like he's just just having a ball.

318
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,980
And while every weirdo freak hungover from the Trump administration is just like worried

319
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,060
about the devil.

320
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,660
Silent on multiple shootings in the country.

321
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,660
But this video that's like the South Park movie.

322
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,060
Yeah. Like Halloween Horror Nights makeup.

323
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,180
I've hit miniature golf balls into more realistic demons mouths like.

324
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,060
And it's fun. He's having fun.

325
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,860
The guys have a fun like.

326
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,220
I'm going to watch this video.

327
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,460
He's I'm not you know like I'm not in the age range to where I should be.

328
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,340
Like I'm not watching a lot a lot of Lil Nas X.

329
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,060
But boy it seems like he's having a blast.

330
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,860
Just everything.

331
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,740
Dancing around those kindergartners all singing the song with him.

332
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,340
He's just he's he's having the time of his life.

333
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,220
Yeah. Well, yeah.

334
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,220
Still this kind of thing.

335
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:31,820
But while Satan is an ongoing issue and fear, you might not realize the ongoing the biggest issue,

336
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,820
which is all of us thinking that the earth is more than six thousand years old, which is apparently

337
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,980
the primate we've all been indoctrinated.

338
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,460
I assume most listeners to this show.

339
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,060
Maybe you think that the earth is very young.

340
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm not sure.

341
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:54,700
If if if if you're a younger creationist, then maybe you already stopped listening after Jason said to fuck yourself.

342
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,900
But get out of here.

343
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Probably probably stop listening now.

344
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
That's what what this whole thing comes from.

345
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,900
And now I didn't know any of this going into it.

346
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,700
I think maybe a couple of listeners had said this arc encounter thing is funny.

347
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,180
And I you know, you got to assume that if something has a lot of money and a theme park gets made,

348
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,980
that it's probably a little more fundamentalist.

349
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,820
But I did not know the whole agenda here.

350
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,700
I'd maybe heard of Ken Ham in passing, but I'd never married all this.

351
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,780
And now I know how it all works.

352
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,460
And maybe I wish I didn't.

353
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,500
Yeah, it's yeah.

354
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,780
I was hoping that when we did this, it was going to be like, and it is a big boat.

355
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,660
And here's the like most dry, basic like.

356
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,620
And then he put all the animals on.

357
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,380
And there you go. Isn't it fun to see the little robot animals?

358
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,780
And it's a lot more it's a lot more.

359
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,060
What is the word I'm looking for here?

360
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,860
I kept thinking about like loaded.

361
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,780
Sacrilegious. Oh, yeah.

362
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,500
Like, you know how like they were so obsessed with Star Wars,

363
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,700
Galaxy said with Bato about the narrative and making sure everything fits and timeline and whatever that is.

364
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,340
It's that times 10 only with real world implications.

365
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,740
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,140
And if you deny one ounce of this, then you burn for all eternity.

367
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,100
Right. But also they can make up whatever crap they want.

368
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,940
But also, yes, that's also a part of it as well.

369
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,340
Yeah. Yeah. And they can get tax breaks from the county and state.

370
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,020
Yeah. Which happened when I came up with the Holy Land experience, too.

371
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,940
This is a good way to get it.

372
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,180
Disney might want to consider getting more religious because they're proposing all this new stuff across the street.

373
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,660
We talked about it on the Patreon.

374
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:48,180
And if some of it was religious, maybe I definitely Orange County would pay for it.

375
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,340
There's a crystal cathedral down the five.

376
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,980
That's a good thing.

377
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,700
Or I think they'd be psyched for some Disney religious park.

378
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,940
I think, you know, if if at this point, Disney is its own religion.

379
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,820
And a lot of this anger that people have had historically over religion,

380
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,020
I think, has moved into places like Disney or Star Wars, The Last Jedi.

381
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,980
I think it's a different it's moving there.

382
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,020
That's where we're headed, I think. I think you're right.

383
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,540
Yeah. Well, because the tales everyone grew up reading are less and less the tale of Shem, Ham and J.

384
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,220
Pitt, more, you know, Iron Man and Black Widow and what have you.

385
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,700
Methuselah died at age nine hundred and sixty nine.

386
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,140
I learned that on the sign outside.

387
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,860
But like how old was Seg L Superman's grandfather when he died?

388
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,700
Like we should know this.

389
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,740
These are all the same.

390
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,060
We're all playing in the same ballpark here.

391
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,300
It's just, again, these characters have real world implications.

392
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,100
Yeah. Yeah.

393
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,820
I almost think the Holy Land experience is a little better because not better.

394
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,660
That's not the word.

395
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,540
Less less egregious.

396
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,140
Yeah, less egregious, because it's just like this is what it was like back.

397
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,140
This is what the Bible talks about.

398
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,300
I mean, I'm sure there was some weird stuff there.

399
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:11,540
But yeah, there's a lot more like hook them while they're young stuff at the Ark encounter,

400
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,340
where it was like prosperity gospel like grifters.

401
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,260
Maybe I'm just I have a soft spot for that because that's a very American con.

402
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,580
That's like a very American to con people out of their money

403
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,580
with the promise of like snake oil and like good luck or whatever is very American.

404
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

405
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,540
We've sort of we've said so they built this giant Ark.

406
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,620
He built this giant like, I guess, accurate maybe to a scale.

407
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,580
Well, the cubit cubit.

408
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,540
Exactly the cubit.

409
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,460
Yeah, they had to choose what cubit, which version of cubit.

410
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,700
And then they settled on cubits aren't even the same height.

411
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,700
Right. Well, yeah, no, it's not.

412
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,620
It's not clear depending on which book you're reading or whatever.

413
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,660
I saw it was six hundred eleven miles of wooden boards used

414
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,580
where if you laid them all out, they would go from Kentucky to Philadelphia.

415
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,260
Yes. And it's like in some parts, it's seven stories tall.

416
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,660
Some parts, it's five stories tall. Yeah.

417
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,420
One and a half football fields wide, I believe, is what Mr.

418
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,260
Ham said. Yeah.

419
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,300
And divided into three three levels inside with different.

420
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,420
I hesitate to use the word exhibits, but I can't think of a better word.

421
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,260
Well, almost cubbies.

422
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,380
Cubbies of propaganda.

423
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,020
Even propaganda feels too big to use.

424
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,940
Sculpture cages.

425
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,980
There's cages where sculptures have to live.

426
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,540
Some of what caught my eye and probably a lot of people's about all this

427
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,940
was the headline from from Vice.

428
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,700
As with the Holy Land experience, these things exist for vice people to go

429
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,900
and be mad at and which say, thank you guys for going.

430
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,980
So we don't have to

431
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,100
their headline.

432
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,820
This one hundred million dollar Noah's Ark theme park is a boring homophobic mess.

433
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,500
So sounds great. Sounds like a blast.

434
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,980
And if it did, we not say Williamstown, Kentucky,

435
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,340
which is probably the closest major city is Cincinnati, Ohio.

436
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,540
And if you're looking it up on a map, it's it's on one Ark and counter drive.

437
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,860
That's how you know you got a lot of money.

438
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,020
Yeah. When you get the street named after what your themed attraction is,

439
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,700
it's like, OK, you either spend some money or the state gave you a lot of money.

440
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,340
Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,380
Um, we did. Yeah.

442
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,380
I'm a big guy. Yeah, we really did.

443
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:49,540
The so the the man behind this, the the the

444
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,420
Bizarro John Hammond, I guess, is is Ken Ham.

445
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,300
A little bit of the name in there, too.

446
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,820
Ken Ham is an extremely vocal creationist.

447
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,020
And what is creationism?

448
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,980
Well, I mean, his specific thing is that

449
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,380
it's very anti evolution, first of all, and that is because he is a Bible literalist.

450
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,860
He is the the kind of Christianity.

451
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,820
And this is like the heart, almost the hardest core in a way,

452
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:27,900
where every bit of the Bible is exactly true, and especially the book of Genesis,

453
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,140
which is the the formation of the world and man and everything.

454
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,500
And his organization is called Answers in Genesis.

455
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:40,100
So it seems like a lot of it's almost like mainly those first couple books.

456
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,500
He is just down to the word.

457
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,300
All of this is exactly true, which has a bunch of implications,

458
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,900
one of them being that the earth is only six thousand years old.

459
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,180
And why? Because there's no date in there.

460
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,020
Well, it's because there's all of the so and so, baguette, so and so, so and so,

461
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,380
baguette, so and so.

462
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,860
So from that, they're able to determine how far back it goes.

463
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,940
And this takes you to Noah and this takes you to Jesus Christ.

464
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,500
But it's all bizarre because that ends you up with, yeah,

465
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,980
a bunch of people who are like 500 years old or 900 years old.

466
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,220
Yeah. So why did people stop being 900 years old?

467
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,700
Do we have an answer for that?

468
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,780
There's a lot of tenuous justifications, like Mike said, retcons, where it's like,

469
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,820
OK, so after the flood, everyone stopped being thousands of years old.

470
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,700
And now they're just hundreds of years old.

471
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,100
And of course, the Tower of Babel splintered language.

472
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,260
And that's why we all speak different languages.

473
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,660
And and there's a lot of this stuff.

474
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,260
And it it I asked my dad, my dad went to Catholic school, too.

475
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,020
And I was like, did you encounter a lot of this, like sort of literalism in school?

476
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,860
He's like, no, his teachers were all mostly like Jesuit priests,

477
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,100
like the keepers of knowledge or people from the neighborhood.

478
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,420
And like he told me about one teacher who was like,

479
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,700
if you believe everything in the Bible happened literally, you are an asshole.

480
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,580
Like, that's the education he got.

481
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,260
Like, like, you know, you got to be a little blunt to get people's attention

482
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,340
in Northeast Philadelphia.

483
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,900
So, you know, they were pushing like this is to inspire you,

484
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,260
this is to teach you to be a good person, teach you the lesson.

485
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,180
Like, you're not supposed to track this exactly literally.

486
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,780
Yeah, it would be like tracking Batman's 80 year history and going, OK,

487
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,340
this all did happen to one man and I know all of it and it's in here

488
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,260
and I can explain it to you and I can explain it to you how it works.

489
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,860
Like any sort of long, not thought out as far as being a giant piece

490
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,500
of like multi-year entertainment was committed completely to memory

491
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,740
and you couldn't deviate from it ever.

492
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,900
Like that's watching videos of Ken Ham walking through here,

493
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,180
which I've watched several at this point.

494
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,340
He has it's it's cool.

495
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,500
It's funnier than any like comic book nerd you've ever heard

496
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,300
talk about anything he likes or any any different piece of trivia.

497
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,140
Like he knows exactly how to justify it.

498
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,580
And some of it seems like maybe he's just bullshitting in the moment

499
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,860
because he hasn't figured out like it's impossible to justify everything

500
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,300
as being truly everything that truly happened.

501
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,460
But he's did everybody watch Bill Nye walk through the arc with him?

502
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,380
No, no, I know this exists.

503
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,620
And I think this is why Ken, I think Ken Ham is

504
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,740
what is more well known because of these two Bill Nye

505
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,220
debates that he has done.

506
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,620
I think Bill Nye seemingly on the opposite side, wanting to challenge him,

507
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,420
completely raised the profile of Ken.

508
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,860
Yes. And that's maybe not a good thing.

509
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,700
And I think on this show, I've once in a while been critical

510
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,780
that I'll watch Bill Nye and I go, I don't know that he knows

511
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,460
that much about what he's talking about.

512
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,380
He just says like seemingly a basic information, basic knowledge.

513
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,900
But Ken Ham apparently was a science teacher.

514
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,940
Which is funny, which is very funny.

515
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,060
So weird. They had some sort of debate.

516
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,900
I did not watch that.

517
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,780
They had some sort of creationist versus science debate.

518
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,500
But then years later, Bill Nye came to the arc and walks.

519
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,540
It's like a two hour video.

520
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,340
A walking debate, they call it a walking debate.

521
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,820
And Bill Nye is just upset the whole he's perturbed from the get go.

522
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,940
And Ken Ham is like he's a he's a soft spoken English

523
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,700
English gentleman, I believe, right?

524
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,460
Australian, Australian, excuse me.

525
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,060
Can I read a quote about him for context?

526
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,380
I this credit to the reporter, which this is the Atlantic, I believe.

527
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,940
Ham is Australian, a rare, rare sort of Australian

528
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,060
in that he is religiously devout and completely humorless.

529
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,100
That really good like sums up the vibe because, boy, this is a dry

530
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,100
just like non

531
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,020
like doesn't project, does it like isn't like giving you the bit?

532
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,940
You know, if he's the Walt of this place, they need, I think,

533
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,820
maybe somebody with some higher energy to be a hype man,

534
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,700
because this is a very sleepy Walt to be their Walt.

535
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,260
He's like he he's like dead inside.

536
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,980
He's truly like so like there should be Bill Nye is looking at something

537
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,460
that says that the earth is six thousand years old and something about glaciers.

538
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,500
And he's like, it's like, how do you know this?

539
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,540
Why why do you think this?

540
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,500
What what is the justification for?

541
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,340
And he's like, are you just come here to be upset?

542
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,180
Let's just talk like let's talk.

543
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,420
And he's like just like even keeled and Bill Nye's just like,

544
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,700
I don't understand this.

545
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,780
He's like, well, how would you know how old ice is?

546
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,580
How would you know how old ice is?

547
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,180
He goes, he goes, is it dated?

548
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,940
And he goes, yes, it is dated.

549
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,500
You can look at it.

550
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,300
You look at molecules, you can look.

551
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,700
There's a way to tell.

552
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,940
And it's just he's like from the get go, very upset with him.

553
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,060
And it's very funny, honestly, I was enjoying it.

554
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,340
I need to watch the rest of it.

555
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,980
It's like two hours long.

556
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,820
Yeah, I saw him saying that there are obviously the entire arc is fraught

557
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,100
with errors, but he said the third floor has not one correct fact anywhere.

558
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,620
Not a drop.

559
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,980
My favorite part is I zoomed to the middle and there's a part where people

560
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,380
start gathering and like ganging up on Bill Nye and it's just people are like,

561
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,620
hey, do you do you have a soul?

562
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,100
Do you think you have a soul to Bill Nye?

563
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,500
And he's like, I don't know.

564
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,340
I'm not sure.

565
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:17,900
I don't think.

566
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,740
And then, and then finally, Mr.

567
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,380
Ham, Ken Ham is he good.

568
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,220
He just goes, he goes, okay, so you, he goes, you believe that when you die,

569
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,940
that nothing, nothing will happen.

570
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,660
There's nothing after that.

571
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,460
And Bill Nye goes, yeah, that's, that's what I believe.

572
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,780
He goes, okay, what do you care then?

573
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,060
What do you care that we're doing this?

574
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,980
Like, it's just literally like he hits his breaking point where he's like,

575
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,420
just give us our fun.

576
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:41,700
What?

577
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,980
Who cares?

578
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,020
Like that's his, that's ultimately where Ken Ham's argument ends up where it's

579
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,660
just like, just let us do this.

580
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,140
Why are you mad at us?

581
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,340
I mean, that there's like a kernel of truth there.

582
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,100
And it was like, yeah, it was just a private experience for you and your weird

583
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,380
little creep friends.

584
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,900
But then this guy is like, you know,

585
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,780
the started getting heat from politicians of like, you're not inviting.

586
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,340
Are you encouraging elementary schools to come to this?

587
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,460
And he's like, yes, elementary schools should come to this.

588
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,900
And it's like, OK, no, no, stop it right now.

589
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,300
That's a good line. Yeah, it's starting to regard it as a as a museum,

590
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:27,100
especially because here's one that I was deep on the website for the Arc Encounter.

591
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,740
I found the tab overnight adventures, looking for the perfect group

592
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,540
adventure or youth retreat.

593
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,700
Spend a night aboard Noah's Arc.

594
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,180
This behind the scenes opportunity is especially popular with youth groups

595
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,580
and Christian schools.

596
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,900
So not only inviting children, but inviting children to spend the night

597
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,820
spending, spend a night in the Arc.

598
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,220
Noah did 40. Why can't you do one?

599
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,540
And also the Arc kind of sucks.

600
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,340
So who cares? Like, that's not even that fun.

601
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,580
Completely sucks.

602
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
Like it's really drab in there.

603
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,300
Really boring in there.

604
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,500
There's some like, yes, static animals and a few robots.

605
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,060
But like I could see a situation where like, you know, it was one of the most

606
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,220
hateful places, but I'd go, well, at least the animatronics are good.

607
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,100
You know, at least.

608
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,740
Yes, right.

609
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,460
Um, yeah, which if that was the case, then,

610
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,860
yeah, sure. And you go and you laugh.

611
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,740
But hey, they put on a good little show.

612
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,140
But this is different here.

613
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,900
And let me just jump somewhere into the middle of the park to help make this point.

614
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,180
You guys might have seen this, that there is something.

615
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,820
You know, we're saying that it's drab.

616
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,580
Well, it's not drab over in the part fairy tale Arc.

617
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,420
It's fairy tale Arc.

618
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,700
This is what you imagine Noah's Arc to be like.

619
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,860
It's this big molded plastic sign with a bunch of really friendly

620
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,100
elephants and monkeys and giraffes all poking out of various corners

621
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,380
and the top of the Arc.

622
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,140
And this is the Noah's Arc we remember from cartoons and from books.

623
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,580
And you look inside and it's a children's library.

624
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,820
And there's a it's it's a bunch of Noah's Arc books in there.

625
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,540
It's all kinds of, you know, a little piece of literature that tell the tale of Noah.

626
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,380
But it turns out that once you actually go under this friendly cartoon

627
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,940
Toontown sign, that it's just a thing saying all of these books are

628
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,700
evil because they don't show the reality.

629
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,260
Noah's Arc was not fun.

630
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,580
It was arduous.

631
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,500
And these cartoon elephants and giraffes, they undermine

632
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,140
this serious this seriousness of the oh, jeez, Jason.

633
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,460
Oh, this is what you've pulled up.

634
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,660
The seven D's of deception, one of them deceptively cute.

635
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,260
Discrediting the truth.

636
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,020
This is you've shown us like this is for two year olds.

637
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,860
This is an even more simple cartoon.

638
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,780
This is there's like a bad bar on there, like really simple,

639
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,220
cute birds and giraffes who could hate this drawing.

640
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,940
I guess Ken Ham could hate the drug.

641
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,180
How confusing.

642
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,820
So it's like cute animals and stuff.

643
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,020
No, not cute animals.

644
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,540
That's evil. No, don't make it palatable and understandable for children.

645
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,700
Make them stare at this plaque that says, why does a loving

646
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,620
God allow so much death and suffering?

647
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,660
Now, that's a cool field trip.

648
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,420
I yeah. What parents?

649
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,060
You'd you'd you'd want to think that there's a lot of parents

650
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,260
who went to this were imagining a fun cartoon thing that kids might like

651
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,060
and were upset at what they found.

652
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,340
Like people that I would hope that there are parents who agree with all this

653
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,700
and went and said, this sucks.

654
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,860
And Mike, you brought up the thing that has not come up yet, because

655
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,740
I it seems to me that with

656
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,500
taking Genesis literally and all of this bizarre.

657
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,340
All right. So people were 700 years old.

658
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,780
Yeah, that's right. And I used to only 6000.

659
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,820
OK, sounds good that all of this bizarre pretzel logic seems

660
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,020
at the end of the day to all be supporting an anti LGBTQ bigotry.

661
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,700
And why? Why is that the case?

662
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,860
I guess because in Genesis, like I've never understood why the Bible is anti.

663
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,460
It feels like there's like four things in the entire big, thick Bible

664
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,900
that you could maybe construe, but not really as being that

665
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,820
bitch can only be men and women.

666
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,740
Like, it's such a stretch to me to still like go further

667
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,340
and say that it's anti homosexuality.

668
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,180
But like this whole thing seems to be about.

669
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,980
OK, so if we say that there were dinosaurs on the ark,

670
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,260
maybe that'll teach some kids that they shouldn't kiss a boy.

671
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,580
Well, and it goes back to like different versions, like interpretations

672
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,660
of different versions of the Bible, because like there's

673
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,180
there's something there's a line of like, do not lie with another man.

674
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,620
But like earlier editions, earlier translations say, like,

675
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,380
do not lie with a child.

676
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,980
Yes. Yeah, that's good.

677
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,260
Yeah. Use that. Use that phrase.

678
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,860
Like focus on that one. Yeah. Don't do that. For sure.

679
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,700
Wait, that was the same thing. One change to the other.

680
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,140
It's just there's so many of changes like that.

681
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,140
There's so much like

682
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,420
from generation to generation.

683
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,620
It's almost like people use it to scapegoat.

684
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,820
Yeah, for sure.

685
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,740
So do you mean like the thing that they actually think themselves?

686
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,140
They use this big complicated, well, if you look in the book.

687
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,060
Sometimes it's that sometimes it's just they want to raise some

688
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,900
some millions of dollars for their shitty church.

689
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,140
There's a lot of shitty little griffs.

690
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,060
Yeah, they're shitty. They're bad pseudo theme parks.

691
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,420
So let's because almost I'm not sure that we even justified

692
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,540
why we're talking about it on the show.

693
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,820
But like as far as I knew before we started looking into it,

694
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,340
you know, I figured there wasn't much more than the Ark.

695
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,980
But I definitely saw it quickly being described as a religious theme park.

696
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,420
This is a theme park centered around Noah's Ark.

697
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,140
But then you start looking and like, I don't know, is it?

698
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,140
I don't think it is.

699
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,900
I think there are plans to make it more that have not really come to fruition.

700
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,820
Like, in theory, the Ark is just the beginning.

701
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,540
But I like it's just going to be part of a campus.

702
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,300
But yeah, I don't know.

703
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,700
I don't I think they have stopped way short of it being an actual theme park.

704
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,620
Yeah, I mean, there's a VR experience that exists.

705
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,020
Yes. Now, I was going to build to the VR experience.

706
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,620
I'm tempted to talk about the VR experience right now.

707
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:46,500
In order to get us on more fun ground, because the VR experience is something.

708
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,660
And this this does make it more of a theme park.

709
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,700
Right. That's the closest thing you can point to, I guess,

710
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,060
for it being sort of a themed theme park.

711
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,260
They do have annual passes. I checked.

712
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,620
Oh, you can get a go to this more than anyone would want to do this more than once.

713
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,100
You can get I think your entire family, you can get like a five

714
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,980
hundred dollar pass for all of them to go for a year.

715
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,660
Mm hmm. So that's there.

716
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,460
I'm not sure.

717
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,580
I 60 bucks, by the way, between admission and parking.

718
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,780
That's what that's where you're paying.

719
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,660
I mean, that's high.

720
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,060
That's it really does, especially because.

721
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,460
All right. So what else makes this a theme park?

722
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,780
All right. There's a VR thing. Cool.

723
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,300
With a petting zoo. OK.

724
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,180
Yeah, that's kind of something almost zip lines.

725
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,220
There's zip lines. Sure. That's a ride.

726
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,620
I mean, we've never talked about zip lines in hundreds of episodes,

727
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,100
but OK, close enough.

728
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,020
All right. One zip line, please.

729
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,780
All right. At least 50 more dollars, if not more.

730
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,260
Yeah. Thank you.

731
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,860
Well, it's an upcharge.

732
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,540
It's not even part of that 60 dollars you spend.

733
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,380
Yeah, that's wild.

734
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,980
So, yes, it's it's high.

735
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,460
I mean, look, we you know, we did these drive through experiences

736
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,380
that were close to that, but that's because of covid.

737
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,540
That's because of the cost.

738
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,180
You know, that's a one year thing.

739
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,860
People making the best of a bad situation.

740
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Right. Building up from scratch, too.

741
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,860
Which I mean, this had to do.

742
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:16,220
But the petting zoo is very funny because you can't.

743
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,740
Biblical, as you can't Bible's eyes, the zoo,

744
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,180
you have to feed these animal zoos are regular.

745
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,780
There's a certain.

746
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,540
I mean, there's some wonky zoos in America, but by all accounts,

747
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,940
like there's a certain level of care, like you thought.

748
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,020
Even if you have like animal wrangler zookeepers,

749
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,260
they still have to know what they're doing, even if they're religious.

750
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,500
Like you can't just feed a tortoise

751
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,580
only millet or whatever they would have been eating back back.

752
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,060
Only what Noah would have fed the tortoise.

753
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,180
Yeah, that's an old family expression, too, right?

754
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,780
From your family. Oh, you can't.

755
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,860
Can't just feed a tortoise millet.

756
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,020
Yeah, you know, you can't.

757
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,060
Judaism feed Methuselah only ancient grains, the very old tortoise

758
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,900
Methuselah, which is pretty good.

759
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,900
I mean, I got to give them credit credit where it's due.

760
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,180
That's pretty good.

761
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:18,100
Yeah, I'm also just a bummer to me that like this ostrich or whatever

762
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,820
has to live in rural Kentucky.

763
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,820
Let it let these animals.

764
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,780
There's a there's a kangaroo.

765
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,180
The kangaroo has to live in this field. Are they?

766
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,740
They must all be jealous of the animals in animal kingdom.

767
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,940
They're like, well, at least let us go to Disney World. Come on.

768
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,980
I think so.

769
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:41,740
But then Ken would say, now you listen, it's that's a place of ill virtue.

770
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,140
So be happy here next to this this cafeteria.

771
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,980
I really can't under say how how uncompelling Ken Ham is.

772
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,260
Like, how is he this firebrand?

773
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,020
How have we ever heard of him before for him being the most listless?

774
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,700
Like, I'm sure all of our dads are far more dynamic in every like,

775
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,180
this is the sleepiest man.

776
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,500
Yeah, I I'm building I'm waiting.

777
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,140
I'm building to a Ken Ham thing I found where I was like, it's

778
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,500
it's obviously not the most egregious thing he's ever done.

779
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,180
But it's like you son of a bitch, like just insult to injury on top of anything else,

780
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,060
because he's just such a charisma black hole.

781
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,300
And let me say, by the way, I don't want to give any airtime

782
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,820
either to the atheist and skeptic community.

783
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,660
There are also fucking creeps.

784
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,100
No, I know.

785
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,700
I've watched a bunch of stuff like in trying to find

786
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,740
what where do you get footage and stills of this thing?

787
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,540
Yeah, I've gone down some atheist YouTube rabbit holes and like,

788
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,820
oh, God, these guys, that's the most annoying voice.

789
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,740
This guy's got a big ponytail.

790
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,140
Geez, these atheists. Yeah.

791
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,260
Yeah, yeah, I'm with you.

792
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,980
So but let's you know what?

793
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,860
Let's try to judge this as we did with our fake theme parks.

794
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,580
Let's try to judge some of the experiences.

795
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,180
Of course, the philosophy is abhorrent,

796
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,580
but maybe there's something fun to do in this arc somewhere,

797
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,780
somewhere on on campus.

798
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,580
After all, it was built by a guy named Patrick Marsh.

799
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,380
And Patrick Marsh was one of the leaders on the Jaws

800
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,420
and King Kong projects for Universal Studios.

801
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,940
And he worked on Sanrio Puroland, which I liked very, very much.

802
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,620
So they had a theme park world ringer.

803
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,980
So surely he must have pulled off something amazing.

804
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,380
Do you think the arc itself, do you think do you imagine that you're

805
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,860
driving up, you crest the hill and there is I mean, we love our big

806
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,020
our our big spectacles, our castles and our

807
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,900
Hallelium Mountains and our radiator springs.

808
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:00,020
Do we do we think at least we look at this arc and go, whoa, how about that?

809
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,820
I got to gram this.

810
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,580
It is impressive in its size.

811
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,820
And it does like I would see it and I would say, oh, that looks like Noah's Ark.

812
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,820
I would think I wouldn't think that before knowing where I was,

813
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,180
if I was just transported there.

814
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:18,820
So I think, yes, I think if you were assessing just the outside,

815
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,180
you'd go, oh, very impressive how big this is.

816
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,580
Could it be better? Yeah, it could be better.

817
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,220
It could look better.

818
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,820
Yeah, I could use a little more character.

819
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,900
A little, I think so, which I guess is this petting zoo thing.

820
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:37,220
I get not petting zoo, the children's arcs like maybe like if it was like

821
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:42,500
a charming Disney boat with that sheen that the Disney would has,

822
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,660
that'd be nice, but it's pretty like it's just drab.

823
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,460
It's extremely drab and accurate,

824
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,460
except that then if you look around the back, then it's just like a building.

825
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,300
Like there's there's just a stucco building attached to it.

826
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,300
So they didn't even go full tilt on that.

827
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,660
It's like an actual bark.

828
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,940
The whole well, but the the HVAC units on the roof are period appropriate.

829
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,820
You know, they are two thousand year old heating and air conditioning.

830
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,340
Ham keeps telling Bill Nye how accurate it is.

831
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,380
And then Bill Nye asks, well, can it float?

832
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,500
And he's like, no, so

833
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,780
it's not accurate.

834
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,340
It can't be accurate unless it's floating.

835
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,580
And it could like, you know, take the weight of all those animal

836
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,860
every animal species on the planet.

837
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,300
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a lot of design flaws.

838
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,900
When I think this is a good example of this is what happens

839
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,580
when you have no gay people on your design team.

840
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,780
Right. There's just there is no character.

841
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,940
Artists. Yeah, this is like when straight people try to do camp.

842
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,300
And it's just like, oh, man, this sucks.

843
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,300
All right. However, they have.

844
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,700
OK, now, yes, again, you can't avoid it.

845
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,460
This place is extremely anti-gay.

846
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,860
If you want to work there, even seasonally,

847
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,180
you have to sign a statement of faith that says that you go to church

848
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,340
and you view homosexuality as a sin.

849
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,500
You can't even be part time or you would have to, I guess, like

850
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,340
you could sign that and go, yeah, I do.

851
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,260
If you all homosexualize, but I am homosexual.

852
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,460
So who cares? Get away from me. Sure.

853
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,900
But you do. Technically, this is in the.

854
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,780
But that's not to say that they haven't worked.

855
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,780
They haven't had homosexual employees before because they

856
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,420
at the same organization as a thing called the Creation Museum.

857
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:34,260
That happened before the arc encounter.

858
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,180
And they made a movie about Adam and Eve.

859
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,260
And it was running there for several years before somebody figured out

860
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,180
that the guy who played Adam was the owner and operator of a gay porn site.

861
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,740
Nice. And just did it as a like acting gig.

862
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,260
You got some slow gigs, you know, in comedy.

863
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,660
Sometimes you do a prank show.

864
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,220
Sometimes you do like some sort of hardcore porn.

865
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,420
Yeah, sometimes you do.

866
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,980
You know, it's something you got slow years, folks.

867
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,780
You got so years.

868
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,020
That's what happens in gigs where you can.

869
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,460
Anyways, so well, so that's the outside.

870
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,660
There is a little bit of imagination in the queue.

871
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,380
And by that, I mean that the queue is big enough to fit a thousand people.

872
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,740
But typically on you will on a typical day, you'll only see about 10.

873
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,700
Yeah, that's yes. I think maybe he was optimistic.

874
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,180
I mean, I think with a lot.

875
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,340
Anytime you dig into any of these religious theme parks,

876
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,180
whoever put them together has a fantasy that this thing is going to be

877
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,460
so inspirational that there will be thousands of people lined up.

878
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,060
And I have yet to see evidence that that can happen.

879
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,740
I don't think that's maybe there is a place right now that's going

880
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,820
and it's the best religious theme park.

881
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,700
But maybe the Jim Baker one got close, right?

882
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,340
The Jim Baker theme park from the 80s.

883
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,300
But that seems like a better theme park in a way.

884
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,300
It at least had it doesn't, you know, they didn't exactly have any

885
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,100
radiator springs racers there, but they had like, you know, a merry-go-round

886
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,340
and like a flume ride and a water slide.

887
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,620
So do that stuff and like tapings that that kind of thing helps.

888
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:14,340
I think maybe they aren't doing like the periphery stuff to make you want

889
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,420
to make thousands of people want to keep coming. Right.

890
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,540
Well, Jim Baker was a he's a bigger celebrity than Ken Ham.

891
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,060
Maybe it's him needs to up his profile and become more of a of a charismatic figure.

892
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,580
I don't know how I should make a response video to Lil Nas X.

893
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,580
Yeah, he makes a response video, starts selling buckets like Jim Baker sells

894
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:40,300
now of MREs and dehydrated food for the end times. Of course.

895
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,940
Oh, yeah. Weird buckets.

896
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,380
And then Lil Nas X can like tweet at him like, hey, can Ken Ham is daddy or something?

897
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,420
Stay mad, daddy.

898
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,500
If we all if we all just talk about how Ken Ham is hot.

899
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,300
That's that's ethical, right?

900
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,100
We can he won't like that, but I like it, but it would keep him.

901
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,020
He should like stir up.

902
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,620
He should know that controversy is good for him. Yeah.

903
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,740
Well, I mean, we talked about, you know, former Disney CEOs getting it,

904
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,940
quote unquote, but can Ken Ham get it?

905
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,700
I mean, I don't think I don't think I'm going to say absolutely no.

906
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,860
I think so. Ken Ham do not show feet.

907
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,220
Thank you very much.

908
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:28,540
So you get into the thing and then what do you see?

909
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,860
Then you see, all right, well, here's where all the animals live.

910
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,260
But again, it's against the rules to have.

911
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,620
Here's the giraffe head poking out and you could barely squeeze into the cage.

912
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,980
It's just like a bunch of cubbies.

913
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,660
And you look inside through like slats and you see like a non,

914
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:50,620
but mostly non animatronic animals, mostly like in the dark.

915
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,500
Yeah, it sucks. It's like, go to Disney.

916
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,660
I see you like can't go to Disney and see what it looks like to go on a decent

917
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,300
ride with some robots like it sucks ass.

918
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,100
It's like it's really it's it's really bad.

919
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,500
I know the Vice article, I'll steal this observation from them that

920
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,780
they pointed out a room that is full of like charts on the wall and numbers.

921
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,260
And they're like, yeah, you know, there's a ride at Epcot and the ride is called

922
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,580
Test Track. And when you're in the line, there's a lot of charts and numbers.

923
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,260
But then at the end of all the charts and numbers, you get in a car and you go

924
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,020
65 miles an hour.

925
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,860
The arc encounter is like if they didn't do that last part.

926
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,620
Yeah. The top floor is all like museum.

927
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,860
It doesn't even look like an arc from the shots I saw.

928
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,980
Maybe there are parts that still look kind of like arc like.

929
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,420
But the pictures up there made it look like it was a cheap ass museum.

930
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,860
Yeah, I watched a walkthrough by what I quickly learned

931
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,540
was a family with four children and they live in an RV.

932
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,860
And they just kept talking about how like, this is so amazing.

933
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,380
This is so great. There's so much information.

934
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,580
They said that so many times.

935
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,820
There's just so much information here.

936
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,100
And I beg to differ.

937
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,380
I don't know that there's much besides like the parking lot is that way.

938
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,140
Uncle Leroy's fudge is that way.

939
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,540
That, I think, is the only information.

940
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,900
You know, do we were we able to find any reviews of the fudge in our encounter?

941
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,420
I've got fudge material. Don't worry.

942
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,380
Let's you know, let's let's go out of order in order to just to keep the fun

943
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,340
flowing. Yes. I'm uncle.

944
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,860
What do we know about Uncle Leroy's?

945
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,820
Well, OK, so there's a 36 minute long video

946
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:41,580
called Ken Ham Becomes a Fudge Expert that you can find on YouTube.

947
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,020
And so it's 36 minutes long because it was the live

948
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,500
stream video from New Year's Eve 2019.

949
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,780
And Ken Ham goes to the fudge.

950
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:00,900
There's this fudge counter in the Ark named Uncle Leroy's fudge.

951
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,380
Uncle Leroy is there. He's a guy.

952
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:09,300
He said he's been doing this for 45 years, I guess, making fudge for 45 years.

953
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,340
And very quickly, you realize this video also sucks

954
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,300
because Ken Ham is a charisma black hole.

955
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,500
He will not let Uncle Leroy talk.

956
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,380
He keeps cracking the worst jokes.

957
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:29,460
There's another guy there and they go, this is Cody and Cody is along for the video.

958
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,060
There's no explanation of who Cody is or why he's there.

959
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,900
The fudge looks competent.

960
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,260
It's more of the loaf shape kind of fudge.

961
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:46,060
Oh, interesting. I don't know if you guys are more partial to square or rectangular

962
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,820
square, man, but I'm interested in this.

963
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:51,540
The different shape actually makes me more intrigued to have it.

964
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,540
I don't know if that doesn't maybe make any sense, but I'm intrigued because maybe

965
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,940
the process of making it is different.

966
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:02,900
I'm starved for fun now, so I'd gladly grab a vanilla pecan fudge loaf.

967
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,740
Yeah. Yeah.

968
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,900
Devour the whole thing.

969
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,660
Jason's being negative, but let's be honest, he would get baptized by Ken Ham to try

970
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,220
some of Uncle Leroy's fudge.

971
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,540
Oh, look, the fudge looks good.

972
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,060
Uncle Leroy seems like a pro.

973
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,220
I believe it's his son is making the fudge like in the video.

974
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:23,540
I did not watch all 36 minutes of it because I wanted to hear about fudge making and see

975
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,220
how he did it.

976
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,940
But Ken Ham kept fucking interrupting him.

977
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,420
I do have to say, unlike the fudge, M.

978
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:37,060
Zara's buffet, the all you can eat buffet looks like some of the brownest,

979
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,020
most underseasoned food I have ever seen.

980
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,620
That macaroni cheese doesn't look like it's melted very well.

981
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,180
No, no.

982
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,020
Mostly cheese. Yeah, it's like straight out of the bag of shredded cheese.

983
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,420
I yeah.

984
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,740
Ick cinnamon. Those cinnamon rolls don't look good.

985
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,860
Some of these just big like whipped cream type trays.

986
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,140
I don't even know what's in it.

987
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,340
What is that in the middle?

988
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,180
I think in the middle.

989
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,780
I don't know what that is.

990
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,780
That's mashed potatoes on the right, I assume.

991
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,540
But what is that thing next to it?

992
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,100
No, I think that's tapioca.

993
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,940
I think this is the dessert trays, which has.

994
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,940
Oh, you're right. You're right.

995
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,060
I thought that was mashed potatoes. I apologize.

996
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,740
It's got the most sinister energy coming off.

997
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,860
It really does. That's evil food.

998
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,660
Yeah, this is terribly underseasoned.

999
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,620
And M. Zara's buffet, the buffet next to the Ark,

1000
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:36,140
is one of the largest restaurants in the world, capable of holding 1500 diners.

1001
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,260
Unbelievable.

1002
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,100
I saw that fact and I confirmed it on a listicle of the biggest restaurants

1003
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,180
in the world, and it's buried towards the back because most of them

1004
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,580
are more interesting than this.

1005
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,300
And then they're like, yeah.

1006
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,860
And then for some reason, the Kentucky

1007
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,300
Ark encounter is the biggest restaurant.

1008
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,220
And to me, it seems like, is this a mistake?

1009
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,340
Like, did was this a reverse of the spinal tap Stonehenge

1010
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,300
where the little like inch marking was in the wrong place?

1011
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,580
And so make sure you can hold 150 people. Got it.

1012
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,740
And then somebody read something as a zero that they weren't supposed to.

1013
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,740
Like, when is this ever needed?

1014
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,020
1500 people.

1015
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:17,940
Then like Ken Ham has found something that he can tie it to in one of the chapters

1016
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,980
in Genesis to say, well, we all should be dining with

1017
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,540
1499 of our close friends at all times.

1018
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,660
It's got to be something he's figured out.

1019
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:33,180
Let me ask. I'll show you guys this and I'll post this so people can see.

1020
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,820
Can you identify any of these items?

1021
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,260
Oh, OK. All right.

1022
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,220
Uh,

1023
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,220
there's brownies on the right.

1024
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,580
Those are brown. OK, good. All right. OK.

1025
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,020
Yeah. OK.

1026
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,740
Oh, which maybe puts it all in dessert.

1027
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,980
That helps me because there's a big there's a bunch of balls

1028
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,380
that are like different shades of brown.

1029
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,780
And I was thinking falafel.

1030
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:58,820
But if it's dessert, then it's not falafel.

1031
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,420
And maybe edible cookie.

1032
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,860
I thought maybe it was like ball versions of the Cheesecake Factory breads,

1033
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,260
the two types, the brown bread and the regular bread.

1034
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,980
But I don't now.

1035
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,500
Now I don't. I actually don't know.

1036
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,300
Besides that, it's I think those are blondies maybe next to the brownies.

1037
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,180
Yes, possibly.

1038
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:24,340
I think these look like maybe like munchkin, maybe like donut holes.

1039
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,140
Oh, yeah. Maybe or maybe a little bigger.

1040
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,860
Chespie squares on the right.

1041
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,100
Yeah, like a custard pie.

1042
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,900
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Or banana cream.

1043
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,100
But it's like a big mess like the the the

1044
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:41,340
it's it's like a slop made up of individual slices.

1045
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,820
You know where one begins and the next ends.

1046
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,820
Yeah, it's a yick.

1047
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,940
It's it's rough stuff.

1048
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,820
I mean, I've been to a I've been to a buffet in my time.

1049
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:56,780
I've been to my family, went to Amish smorgasbords in Pennsylvania.

1050
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,980
And very kind people.

1051
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,900
There are nice people, again, food pretty under season.

1052
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,820
But there's a lot of it, certainly.

1053
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:08,580
But the nicest, again, the nicest people

1054
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,420
working those places, not trying to convert you at all,

1055
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,500
not like the answers in Genesis crowd.

1056
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,060
Yes, the whole point is to

1057
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,140
the can I say two facts really quick?

1058
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,180
One is that M Zara is the name of Noah's wife.

1059
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,020
Yes, apparently.

1060
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,140
But that's not I don't think in the Bible.

1061
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,500
I think that's pulled from other stuff over the years.

1062
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,260
But more fun fact is that I'm looking at a sign

1063
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,660
that's right outside the actual arc that has some soda cups

1064
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,700
branded to our encounter.

1065
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:45,420
And it does inform you that there's the possibility of a flood of refills.

1066
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,940
See, that seems like that's too much fun to be had. Yeah.

1067
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,460
I think it's the only fun thing on property.

1068
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,580
And it's just because Ken hasn't seen it yet.

1069
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,820
They're like steering him away from the sign.

1070
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,980
Don't let Ken see.

1071
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,020
The gift shop.

1072
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,380
Do we look at this?

1073
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,660
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, no, I missed it.

1074
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,780
OK, so the gift shop.

1075
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,980
So we're talking about fun.

1076
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,300
You're talking about how, you know, they do that

1077
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:14,780
misdirect with the cute animals, and that's not what this is about.

1078
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,300
Don't think that for a second.

1079
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,980
You go into the goddamn gift shop. Excuse my language.

1080
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,420
No, do it. And the episode.

1081
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,620
There are cute animal plush everywhere.

1082
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:29,540
It's full and under it on a headline, it says equip children.

1083
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,660
What? Why?

1084
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:37,660
Why is it said so formally for with a equip children with a little

1085
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,580
stuffed camel? Yeah.

1086
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,860
And we barely even talked.

1087
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,980
I didn't realize dinosaurs run Noah's Ark.

1088
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,700
That's news to me.

1089
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,700
Well, I mean, that's kind of the corner that you're around.

1090
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,700
Yeah, like that's the big secret of the place in general.

1091
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:58,100
Yeah, is the presence of dinosaurs, which does get us into fun a little more.

1092
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,340
That's not what they intended.

1093
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,060
I agree. It would be more fun if like also the mighty Akron was on the Ark.

1094
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,900
That would be even better if we could get some other fun character, fun animals.

1095
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,260
So we'll focus on this gift shop. There's a couple more things here.

1096
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,140
So they got the cute plush and the cute.

1097
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,980
So that's already go spitting in the face of Ken Ham's idea.

1098
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,180
And then on the left here, I love there's a lot of books

1099
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,540
that say stuff like Inside Noah's Ark, why it worked.

1100
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:29,060
Oh, it's so obsessed with like practically explaining.

1101
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:33,180
This is so funny because there's like videos where it's like explaining

1102
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,140
how the Batmobile would work in real life.

1103
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,020
No one cares. It's a fucking story.

1104
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,540
Like Batman isn't real.

1105
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,260
There's no reason to explain.

1106
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,900
Because we are I don't think we're a fan of any of the Neil deGrasse

1107
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,100
Tyson type stuff.

1108
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,180
It's like, actually, that wouldn't have been is not very realistic.

1109
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,700
It's stories. Shut up.

1110
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,660
Did the point of the story work?

1111
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,980
That's true of movies. That's true of the Bible.

1112
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,100
I've said it. I'm sure I've said it on the podcast before.

1113
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,940
But Grant Morrison, our one of our favorite comic book writers, was saying,

1114
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,780
he goes, when you show a kid a movie with a talking crab,

1115
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,980
the kid just goes, oh, the crab is talking.

1116
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:12,860
But when an adult gets a hold of it, they're like, well, why is this crab talking

1117
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,420
and why the kid knows it's fake?

1118
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,820
The kid knows it's made up.

1119
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,420
But adults, for some reason, have this bizarre thing where it's like,

1120
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,620
we must explain.

1121
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,780
And it's like, it's so boring. Who gives a shit?

1122
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,860
You can also get a book called A Flood of Evidence.

1123
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,020
Forty Reasons Noah's Ark Still Matter

1124
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,140
or Noah's Ark Still Matters or an S at the end of that.

1125
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,660
Ken Ham wrote this book, folks, with Bodie Hoge.

1126
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,980
Bodie Hoge or Hodge.

1127
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,540
Bodie Hodge.

1128
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,500
That's probably Hodge.

1129
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,900
I'm choosing Hodge just to go with Bodie.

1130
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,180
Bodie Hoge.

1131
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:51,140
In case you want more books that that have evidence in them.

1132
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,100
How about this? The flood evidences combo.

1133
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,940
There's more books with evidence.

1134
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,300
Imagine going to a gift shop that's just here.

1135
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,620
Take a book full of evidence.

1136
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:06,060
Format, pack, technicality, layman, ages seven and up.

1137
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,420
Oh, so my seven year old will like Echoes of Eritat.

1138
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,780
Oh, man. Evidence.

1139
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:16,460
Flood of Evidence also is three hundred and thirty six pages long.

1140
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,860
Yes. But but but back to the cuteness stuff, too.

1141
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,380
If you look on this page, here's Noah.

1142
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,220
He's a cute cartoon man.

1143
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,860
This is this is not what Ken Ham was talking about.

1144
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:32,500
So I'm surprised he's allowing this, but I'm also not because he's probably

1145
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,100
raking in money from it.

1146
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,780
Yeah, I also just don't think he's paying a lot of attention

1147
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:43,300
and that'll come back into play when we talk about the virtual reality stuff.

1148
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:48,300
I don't think this is a Walt in charisma or in obsession with details.

1149
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,180
I think he is not obsessed with details.

1150
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,540
I think he wanted his arc and he ignores a lot of other stuff. Yes.

1151
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,460
I would. I'm always curious about exactly how deep these guys go

1152
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:03,140
with what they're saying as well, because like as evidenced by him

1153
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,580
just being saying to Bill Nye, what do you care, man?

1154
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,260
Hey, I'm done arguing with you.

1155
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,020
What do you care about what we're doing?

1156
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:14,100
That feels like maybe you're out of you're out of evidence.

1157
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,660
Yeah. Perhaps.

1158
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,460
Also, you invited me here.

1159
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,060
You're getting content out of this just like I have.

1160
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,540
Why are you getting to that point?

1161
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:28,620
I did see the one gift shop thing I saw was a yarn

1162
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:33,220
beard and cap so that you could be a little Noah.

1163
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,260
His famous cap and his beard.

1164
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,900
All right. Can we get that for you?

1165
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,300
Oh, yeah. Not from not from here.

1166
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:48,140
We can get a separate Etsy yarn beard, but that's yeah.

1167
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,380
We're not supporting this place.

1168
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,340
Yeah. Can somebody make is there a different, more secular character

1169
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,260
like the mascot for a beard beard papa?

1170
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,380
Yeah. Oh, Jason is beard papa.

1171
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:07,420
Can we have somebody on Etsy make us a beard papa outfit for Jason, please?

1172
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,620
Sure.

1173
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:13,380
And if the post sizes somewhere, just DM us, we'll give you sizes.

1174
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,660
Let's talk about dinosaurs,

1175
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,700
because that's what they're anxious to do.

1176
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,780
My exposure to the notion of creationism

1177
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,740
and dinosaurs or religion dinosaurs going together

1178
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,980
was the cabezon dinosaurs.

1179
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,700
Apologies if I'm saying that that name wrong.

1180
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:40,740
Cabezon the that, of course, being the dinosaurs that are on the way

1181
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:43,820
to Palm Springs, probably on the way to other places.

1182
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,220
But I think of them from the Palm Springs Drive.

1183
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,540
They're famous from Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

1184
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,340
You pass by him on the side of the road, maybe once in a while.

1185
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,540
People go, I'm going to get out and take some photos of that

1186
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,340
scene of my whole life.

1187
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:59,140
Obviously from Pee Wee, they've been there since the 50s or 60s.

1188
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:05,380
And finally, like one time going to Palm Springs with Aaron, like,

1189
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,260
all right, we got to go.

1190
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,420
We got to go check this out.

1191
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,980
I didn't know that in the recent past that there was a change

1192
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:16,700
in ownership to the cabezon dinosaurs and it had become a creationist museum.

1193
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,260
So they took the fun dinosaurs that Pee Wee hangs out with

1194
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,420
and they built a whole little thing around it with smaller dinosaurs.

1195
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,940
And there's this whole little maze that you walk around.

1196
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,780
And I don't know if it's still like this.

1197
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,540
I think it may have changed ownership again.

1198
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:32,980
I was when I went there.

1199
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,500
So did you go into the thing?

1200
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,660
We didn't pay for the thing.

1201
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:36,220
We just pulled.

1202
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:39,020
You can just pull over and park next to the Burger King

1203
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:42,780
and take your picture under the big dinosaurs for free and then leave.

1204
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,020
And that's what we did.

1205
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,780
But it seemed like mostly the thing they were pushing is come in.

1206
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:56,100
There's a petting zoo and get soft serve ice cream and like dinosaur cones,

1207
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,380
like the fish, the fish, soft serve ice cream codes.

1208
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:03,980
Unfortunately, you had to pay to get past the entry to get to that ice cream shack.

1209
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,340
So we. But there's other ice cream.

1210
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,900
Yeah, there's you needn't pay that fee.

1211
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,860
So yeah, you can still get your pictures taken there for free.

1212
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,540
And that's what we did.

1213
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:18,100
And then got in the car because the winds were knocking everyone over.

1214
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,820
It was so windy.

1215
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,020
Oh, yeah, it's so crazy.

1216
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,660
Well, there's that whole feel the windmill is not far past that.

1217
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:29,580
But so at least whenever we went in there, totally surprised,

1218
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:33,580
totally got the smack that this was a religious museum.

1219
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:40,420
And and but religious, however, with in that there's like a T-Rex

1220
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,540
attacking a medieval knight.

1221
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,700
That's the kind of crap that's in there.

1222
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,380
And I'll tell you, way more fun than the Ark encounter.

1223
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,820
This may be a separate thing to be done about the Cabezon dinosaurs.

1224
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,940
Pretty like clever of some group to come in and say,

1225
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,660
hey, people know those dinosaurs and they know Peewee.

1226
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,300
What if we we have a message around it?

1227
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,500
And all the little tableaus of us like a scared knight

1228
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,340
holding up a spear like, what do I do?

1229
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,940
Like as a velociraptor, that shit.

1230
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,740
Pretty fun, stupid, wrong, incorrect.

1231
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,780
But anyway, that was my exposure to all of it.

1232
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,660
And I didn't know there was this whole strand of thing that there

1233
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:23,380
and that is very kid baiting, like, well, kids like dinosaurs.

1234
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:27,620
And maybe they don't know that God created dinosaurs

1235
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,140
and on the same day that he created Adam and Eve.

1236
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,820
That was news to me in researching this episode.

1237
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:37,060
And I was like, wait, so it does it say in the Bible

1238
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,740
God created dinosaurs and then he created man?

1239
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:43,300
No, it says created the land animals, created all the land animals

1240
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,620
and then created man.

1241
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,180
So it's still a leap to say dinosaurs.

1242
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,380
They're pulling. There's no dinosaurs in the Bible.

1243
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,500
They're pulling this out of nowhere, which makes it extra bizarre.

1244
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,580
When you walk around here and you see signs that say things like,

1245
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:00,540
did you know up to 85 kinds of dinosaurs were on the Ark

1246
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,260
to Tyrannosaurids to Stegosaurids?

1247
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,900
What are you talking about for being Bible literalists?

1248
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:11,420
How are you getting that there were two Stegosaurus on there?

1249
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,740
That is made up.

1250
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,900
This is kids making up rules on the playground.

1251
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,260
You don't get to say how many Stegosaurus were there.

1252
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,260
The gremlins may as well be on the Ark.

1253
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,340
Like it like you may.

1254
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,340
It doesn't it doesn't make any sense.

1255
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:30,300
You said Mighty Akron, you said this is the way this is how they get me.

1256
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,300
If all of the great creatures from literature,

1257
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:39,300
if the xenomorph is on there, it's created the xenomorph kingdom.

1258
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,260
If they put the beastly kingdom in.

1259
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,300
Yeah, that's right.

1260
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,300
There's minions.

1261
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,140
God created the minions, created Stuart.

1262
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,420
That's game over if you get minions in there.

1263
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,580
That's God created the biker mice from Mars and they're on the Ark.

1264
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:59,860
Do you is Ninja Turtles sinful in this viewpoint

1265
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:02,300
because it was a mutation?

1266
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:07,540
Well, no, no, no, because God created the turtles and he also created the ooze.

1267
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,060
And then an accident combined these two things.

1268
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:13,220
So the mutation that that just happened, that was,

1269
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,100
I guess, eventually part of God's plan.

1270
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,620
Yeah, for sure. That's yes, the turtles were part of God's plan.

1271
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:22,380
That's what I always that's the most religion, by the way, I had as a child.

1272
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,140
That was your religion.

1273
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,220
Yes, it's still going into some degree.

1274
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:31,860
But the dangers of Eastern religion, you know, the spirituality and

1275
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,900
and discipline that comes in the art of the ninja of martial arts.

1276
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:37,780
The ninja. Yeah.

1277
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:41,220
And I have to reconcile like how in the movie,

1278
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:45,660
Hamato Yoshi is a man who is killed and his rat becomes splinter

1279
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,500
versus in the cartoon Ninja Turtles, where

1280
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,860
Hamato Yoshi becomes the rat man.

1281
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:53,260
It's different.

1282
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:56,100
So I have to reconcile how that works in my brain.

1283
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:00,100
And I I don't have a great Ken Ham explanation for it yet.

1284
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:05,260
This is like King James and different like, yeah, it passes through different sources.

1285
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,300
So how do you reconcile?

1286
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,500
How can you be a literalist when there's

1287
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,780
original Ninja Turtles, but also Ninja Turtles meet Batman and Robin? Right.

1288
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,100
How does it all work together? Yeah, it's tough.

1289
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,500
And I got to maybe talk to a Ken Ham like guy

1290
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:22,140
to help, you know, make it my faith straight, my turtle faith.

1291
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:27,420
Yeah. Also, what does it do to one's brain to run the Twitter account

1292
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,180
for Ark encounter where they post like, check out this animal,

1293
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:34,780
like the statue of this animal, which went extinct a long time ago.

1294
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:39,420
And all the replies are like, yeah, went extinct two million years ago, asshole.

1295
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,340
Just got to ignore sinners, haters. Yeah.

1296
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,740
On on the dinosaur front, though,

1297
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:53,180
just this this twisted philosophy because you well, you start going like

1298
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,660
like those Twitter people poking holes in everything.

1299
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,060
Well, how could there have been dinosaurs on the Ark?

1300
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,580
Because they're big. They would have eaten everything.

1301
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,860
Well, no. God thought of that.

1302
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,940
He put small dinosaurs on.

1303
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:08,020
You see, they were smaller, so they wouldn't go and they were caged.

1304
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,340
So don't worry about it.

1305
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,860
But then there's this whole other.

1306
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:17,140
I mean, part of the Noah story is that there was so much sin on Earth

1307
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:21,580
that God decided to wipe it and, you know, start fresh.

1308
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:25,780
And only the pious Noah and Ham and all of them were going to make it.

1309
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:31,740
So this the Ark encounter has exhibits that show you what was that sin,

1310
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:34,220
what was going on on Earth that was so bad.

1311
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,780
And apparently it was mistreatment of dinosaurs.

1312
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,700
This is probably the most prominent tableau.

1313
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,660
I'll zoom in a tiny bit where

1314
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:52,260
there's a gladiator pit and people like like gladiators or whatever.

1315
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:57,340
Warriors are being made to fight a dinosaur while other people cheer and holler.

1316
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,580
And then I don't know why over here on the left,

1317
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,460
giants come into the mix.

1318
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,260
We also got giants.

1319
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:10,860
Dinosaurs fighting giants because you shouldn't be gay.

1320
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,540
Right. That all ties there.

1321
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:17,660
Giants. OK, like what?

1322
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,540
I guess look at this.

1323
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,620
This is a sign on the wall to giants Genesis six four.

1324
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:28,860
And you look it up and one out of 10 Bible versions use the word giants.

1325
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,860
The rest, it's some made up term.

1326
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:35,100
But they're from that they're convinced the giants are a major

1327
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,260
part of the Bible story. Huh.

1328
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,820
Are giants bad?

1329
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,780
I guess they are in this context.

1330
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:46,940
Well, also, humans were much smaller in the time of the Bible.

1331
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:51,420
And they might think Mike was a giant.

1332
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,300
You know, that's a good point.

1333
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,060
I could be a giant. Yeah.

1334
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,620
Let's call me Ken Ham.

1335
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:59,900
If you came poking around Ken Ham with questions about the Ninja Turtles,

1336
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,820
would he go, ah, giant and runs run screaming

1337
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,340
or his half hearted version of screaming?

1338
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,540
Yeah, he yeah, he would not.

1339
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:14,860
He can't. He runs like one mile an hour and his scream is like, ah, ah,

1340
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,340
oh, don't eat me giant.

1341
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,060
Also, isn't this a perfect

1342
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,860
isn't this a perfect opportunity to retcon dinosaurs

1343
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,900
out of the actual timeline that they probably existed in?

1344
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,460
Just say they were killed in the flood

1345
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,300
and Noah didn't have time to collect the dinosaurs and then that wiped them out.

1346
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,180
So you get rid of the problem of them existing far longer ago

1347
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,780
than 6000 years away. Yeah, that would be easy.

1348
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,260
Well, there's a whole wipe clean.

1349
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,100
Why did Noah take dinosaurs? Right.

1350
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,940
Because then they stopped existing. Right.

1351
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,260
You have to explain then why they stopped existing past that.

1352
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,780
There's it's such an easy I mean, he's really got to talk to Jason.

1353
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,580
Who are like the best

1354
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:00,540
like crisis on infinite earth is a DC event where they like

1355
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:04,020
took all their continuity and it was so heavy that they just like stripped it away

1356
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,660
and got rid of characters.

1357
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,540
He's really got to talk to somebody who who.

1358
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,140
Marv specialized.

1359
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,340
Yeah, well, you should.

1360
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,900
Comic book writer Marv Wolfman should really be involved in this.

1361
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:19,460
Or even just script like like Robert McKee, like Robert McKee.

1362
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:24,420
Help me help me simplify this this story.

1363
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:29,180
That said, I think like not to be Pat and be like all this stuff there.

1364
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:31,460
Like, you know, they complain about is cool. But

1365
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,380
the statue they made of a priest delivers a human baby

1366
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,300
into the belly furnace of a snake god is pretty bad ass.

1367
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,740
What this is this is nuts.

1368
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,940
Yeah. Now this is like psychedelic.

1369
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,260
No, it's like H.R. Geiger.

1370
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,860
This is cool. Yeah.

1371
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:54,500
Now I would in a flood at that, I would just be pissing off that snake god.

1372
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,740
And, you know, I don't want any I don't want beef with snake gods, you know.

1373
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:00,820
There was a snake god or is that a statue?

1374
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:01,660
Oh, that's a statue.

1375
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,300
That's a false idol. It is a false idol.

1376
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:08,980
OK, so there were there weren't big snakes running around, but there were giants.

1377
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,220
No, but there are eventually after the flood.

1378
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,580
Eventually, you get to modern history and there are pagans.

1379
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:20,860
So I don't know quite know how they square that circle.

1380
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:24,700
Also, other world religions, I'm sure they're not fond of them.

1381
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,820
Well, mainly because they don't fit in the narrative very well. Yeah.

1382
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:34,940
There's also there's on the dinosaur front.

1383
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,180
Oh, another weird thing is that,

1384
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:41,100
again, with that gladiator thing, this apparently was a very common like,

1385
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,500
all right, what are the sins of man?

1386
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,420
What are they doing that are bad?

1387
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,340
Apparently, there's artwork all over

1388
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:52,020
showing humans at the time being bad to dinosaurs.

1389
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,100
There's like a first sacrifice.

1390
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,380
It's a real thing in the Bible.

1391
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,420
They just make it a dinosaur in this.

1392
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,180
And they just show other like, I don't know what it is exactly.

1393
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:06,380
But I think like, you know, I guess they know God had to wipe out all of humanity

1394
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:08,940
because people were like kicking a dinosaur in the butt.

1395
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,260
That's that seems like a simplification of what the message was, was it?

1396
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,380
Wasn't there like a bigger message?

1397
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,700
Forgive me not knowing anything about religion, but wasn't like, yeah,

1398
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:23,540
I don't think it was just like it wasn't just like yanking dinosaurs

1399
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:26,020
tails or like making them do stuff for you.

1400
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,620
Take me to school.

1401
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:34,620
And mush. It's it turns out it turns out it was not a living.

1402
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:38,820
The way that humans were misusing dinosaurs.

1403
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,660
That was exactly.

1404
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,820
That is exactly what I was about to say.

1405
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:48,860
Is the is an easy retcon just showing old Flintstones footage

1406
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,860
and them using like an old dinosaur as a garbage can?

1407
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,940
And then you go, oh, yeah, humans misused dinosaurs.

1408
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,740
They did. They were abusing them at this time.

1409
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,900
And this is our actual can and would say like this is actual footage from the past.

1410
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,220
There is one accurate text.

1411
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:09,900
There is only one piece of true media in filthy vile Hollywood.

1412
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:13,540
And it is this from the fire center in Barbera.

1413
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,500
You see the these sinners were using

1414
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,700
elephants as showers and pig dinosaurs as garbage disposals.

1415
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,820
Some kids like, oh, I saw them meet the Jetsons once.

1416
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:27,660
He's like, no, you didn't.

1417
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,660
No, you did not.

1418
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,820
That was because God created a time machine.

1419
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,340
That is what happened.

1420
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:38,820
Yeah, I mean, there's so many easy pop culture ways, you know, to get around this.

1421
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:41,300
And I feel like Ken Ham did a shit job.

1422
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,700
And easy, real easy.

1423
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,500
Just just have a room in your not fun museum.

1424
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:51,140
Have a room that just plays Flintstones episodes all day.

1425
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,940
That would make this 10 times a better theme park.

1426
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:58,700
If you need to edit it to scary music and put like, you know,

1427
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:04,580
filters on it to good, then the and these heathens would when it was

1428
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,220
they would ride a dinosaur all day for work and then

1429
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:12,580
yell a celebration word that was nonsense

1430
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:14,900
and slide all the way down its tail.

1431
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:21,220
Here you can see them committing the sin of gluttony, eating a far too big rib platter.

1432
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,980
God. OK, so God was watching the Flintstones and he said, this must stop.

1433
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,580
And he told Noah to build the ark and get all the animals there.

1434
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:38,380
And then after he did that and then the flood went away, God said,

1435
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,900
All right, now I will kill the dinosaurs forever.

1436
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,220
I will wipe them out.

1437
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,220
Good news. I saved the dinosaurs.

1438
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,340
All right. Good.

1439
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,420
Thanks for saving the job for me.

1440
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,460
Now I like the lightning bolt.

1441
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,340
And he gets no now.

1442
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,420
He now God in heaven is using

1443
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:58,340
dinosaurs as record players and as garbage cans

1444
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,660
because he's brought them up to his kingdom.

1445
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,460
And he stole our idea.

1446
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,900
Yes, Flintstones idea.

1447
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,580
He is abusing the dinosaurs now.

1448
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,500
That's what's happening.

1449
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:11,180
And it's it's that sort of, you know, for forward thinking

1450
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:14,060
usefulness that would make him a great hire.

1451
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,300
It's basically Sprockets company.

1452
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:20,140
No, it doesn't. Oh, no.

1453
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:23,660
The the pterodactyls holding a cloud up with God sitting on it.

1454
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,380
And the pterodactyls, of course, say it's a it's a holy living.

1455
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,380
It's a holy.

1456
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,620
It's a pious living.

1457
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:36,300
I like the idea also that in the aftermath of the flood, that you as somebody

1458
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:41,060
would be digging for fossils and then find the perfect fossils of Fred and Barney.

1459
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:46,100
Like short, weird, stout, early man.

1460
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,540
I mean, yeah, tiny early man looked like height,

1461
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,420
stun it by those, you know, lucky strikes.

1462
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,580
OK, so there's all that.

1463
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:03,420
There's also the fact that so there's a documentary about all this

1464
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:07,500
called We Believe in Dinosaurs, which is mainly notable for a part

1465
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,940
where they show a Ken Ham lecture where he's talking to a bunch of children.

1466
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:16,300
And he says, so what do you say when somebody says that the earth was old,

1467
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:20,580
actually, and a bunch of kids all say, were you there?

1468
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:26,780
And then he says, and what do you when somebody talks about dinosaurs,

1469
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,620
what do you say that they are called?

1470
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,140
And they all say, missionary lizards.

1471
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:38,380
What? Yeah, never heard that one in my life.

1472
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,980
A great improv team name.

1473
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,540
If you're looking for an improv team name, you could do a lot worse.

1474
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,700
Of course, improv was wiped out by the great flood of 2020.

1475
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,140
Yeah, I don't know that it needs to come.

1476
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,620
The great plague, I guess.

1477
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,580
I don't know if that needs to come back.

1478
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,100
Much like dinosaurs.

1479
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,780
God told God told certain people to put it on their boat,

1480
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:06,020
but they actually had paid too much for the boat and they had to sell the boat

1481
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,300
because they had made bad business decisions.

1482
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,380
So then they didn't have a boat to save it.

1483
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,780
It's a very sad. You will build a great.

1484
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:20,380
Yeah, imagine a great arc, two stories with classrooms and a storefront.

1485
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:23,060
Should I fill it? No.

1486
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:25,460
Yeah, I put a business in there.

1487
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,460
That's not my plan.

1488
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:30,620
Imagine Noah built like four boats, two at once.

1489
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,740
And like maybe the demand wasn't there.

1490
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:36,180
He is not listening to Ham or M.Zara.

1491
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,980
He's listening to no one who came after him.

1492
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:42,060
He has these meetings and it's like, why are we even having the meetings

1493
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,260
if M.Zara is not going to get a word in?

1494
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:47,620
Yelling at the dinosaurs?

1495
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:52,140
The two boats, the two boats were like a cash cow, like Noah was living good.

1496
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,220
Yeah, off those two boats.

1497
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,540
But then the four of us.

1498
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,580
Stupid new vision.

1499
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,740
The two more boats.

1500
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:04,620
Ken Ham's lack of charisma does prime him

1501
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:10,540
that if this endeavor ever goes under, he he could easily be a comedy teacher.

1502
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,740
Yeah, Jason and I, we were younger.

1503
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:20,020
We would pay Ken Ham four hundred dollars for eight classes of comedy instruction.

1504
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,340
He told me we needed a boys band, too.

1505
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,900
All right. The first rule of improv.

1506
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:30,380
Yes. And unless you're not straight.

1507
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,220
Well, and now that is leave right now.

1508
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,580
That brings up a good I don't think we've talked about this.

1509
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:38,340
This is on top of everything else.

1510
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:43,580
The lamest thing he can ham did in December 2016.

1511
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,620
The they lit the arc with rainbow colors,

1512
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:53,380
with the idea of reclaiming the symbol from the gay rights movement.

1513
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:55,460
Oh, for God's sake, that's soft.

1514
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:59,220
Oh, like that's so bad.

1515
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:01,780
It's take back the rainbow.

1516
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,100
Take back the rainbow campaign.

1517
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,780
That's catchy, isn't it?

1518
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,740
Yeah. Yes.

1519
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,620
What a what a good use of your time.

1520
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,980
What a wonderful use of your time.

1521
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:15,420
Yeah. Planet Earth.

1522
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,980
Heal the sick, heal the sick, feed the poor.

1523
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:21,900
No, no, no. We got a we got a culture war bullshit about rainbows.

1524
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,740
Is he mad? Is he mad at Skittles, too?

1525
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,900
Does he want the rainbow back from Skittles?

1526
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,060
Does he not want you to taste the rainbow anymore?

1527
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:34,180
It's coming for the Christians should have Skittles.

1528
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:39,620
Sherman, Sherwin and Williams committed sins by making this many paint colors.

1529
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:46,700
Only Brown, only arc brown, like the delicious meals

1530
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,500
you can get at M.

1531
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:52,460
Zara's Cafe, which unfortunately has been converted back to a cafeteria

1532
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,780
due to this covid hoax virus.

1533
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,820
That's something we haven't talked about.

1534
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:00,540
They still have to adhere to the basic safety

1535
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:03,060
tenants of businesses and theme parks.

1536
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,500
Like CDC regulations.

1537
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:11,580
So they have to have mask enforcement.

1538
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:15,660
They have to have like like limited seating at M.

1539
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,700
Zara's, and I'm sure it's killing them.

1540
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:23,500
Oh, because if it was just if it was like zoned as a museum,

1541
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
then they wouldn't have to do it because it is a museum.

1542
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,180
But because they made it, they said the word theme park.

1543
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,740
Now they're stuck under theme park rules.

1544
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,860
Oh, I think just just it's Kentucky.

1545
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,060
I think just basic Kentucky, like most states.

1546
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:37,340
I don't know. I'm sure they've scaled stuff back.

1547
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,420
A lot of states have.

1548
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:43,060
But like it's just basic common sense stuff of hand sanitizer and all.

1549
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:47,460
And it's like how much are they like pissed about that?

1550
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,740
Right, right.

1551
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,500
Before we leave the arc, I want to nod to the Noah animatronic.

1552
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,340
You got to like that.

1553
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,260
There is an animatronic.

1554
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:02,140
He talks in that history voice that all history animatronics

1555
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:05,020
talk in like Ben Franklin and Mark Twain.

1556
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,140
He answers a lot of bizarre questions like,

1557
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,260
why don't I look 600?

1558
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,660
What do you mean?

1559
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:16,460
This is what all the 600 year olds I know look like.

1560
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,340
But not my wife.

1561
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,780
She doesn't look a day over 400.

1562
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,340
Yeah, yeah.

1563
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:31,380
He also it's also canon that Noah hates woodpeckers.

1564
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:34,220
What they ask, what's your least favorite animal?

1565
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:37,260
And he says, they're all wonderful in God's eye.

1566
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:44,380
But why do question why Shem put that bird that knocks on wood all day

1567
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,740
next to the living quarters?

1568
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:50,580
And I'm just I'm out of this room by the time this is over.

1569
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,140
I love robots.

1570
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:55,500
What else is going on in the news today?

1571
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,060
Airplane food, huh?

1572
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:03,260
I'm sure we're going to do a little plus up, but like here, live it up.

1573
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:07,380
Throw Woody Woodpecker in there to like pestering.

1574
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,140
Yeah, pranking.

1575
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,540
He's like bothering Noah.

1576
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:13,500
He's like Noah's figment, you know.

1577
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:17,260
Oh, Woody, I guess it is you.

1578
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,420
I do despise you sometimes,

1579
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:22,660
but it is part of God's plan that we spar.

1580
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:26,540
And then he does his noise that we all can do an impression of.

1581
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:31,980
Right. It does that.

1582
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,700
That's fine. That's fine.

1583
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,980
You know, we can't assume just because we're all so bad at Donald's

1584
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:39,980
that we can't do at least that you can't do, Woody.

1585
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,700
That was very good. Thank you.

1586
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,380
Jason, you want to try it?

1587
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,140
Um.

1588
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,140
No, I can't.

1589
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,140
I can't.

1590
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:48,140
A little bit better than Donald.

1591
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,140
Yeah.

1592
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,140
You would recognize.

1593
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,140
Schako.

1594
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,140
Yeah.

1595
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,140
Sure.

1596
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,140
OK.

1597
01:27:54,140 --> 01:28:01,140
And then and then Ken Ham, you go, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1598
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,140
Yeah, that's about right.

1599
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:06,140
He does a great Donald, though, I bet.

1600
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:09,140
Broadly perfect Donald.

1601
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,140
Oh, yeah.

1602
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,140
Donald, though, I bet.

1603
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,340
Broadly perfect, Donald.

1604
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:19,820
There's also an animatronic of Jepeth's sad wife sweeping up the floor.

1605
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,820
Oh, man.

1606
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,500
Does she talk?

1607
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,500
No.

1608
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:25,900
Is Jepeth's wife?

1609
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,220
What do we know her name?

1610
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,220
I didn't write it down because I was going to butcher the Helen.

1611
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,820
It's probably no, it's way you could.

1612
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,820
I have the names.

1613
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:43,180
Wait, well, here, I'm going to share this from Wikipedia, which is where I learned about

1614
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,180
the.

1615
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:45,940
Oh, here we go.

1616
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:46,940
Thing.

1617
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,420
It's got an apostrophe at the beginning.

1618
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,340
What is that? How do you pronounce that?

1619
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,100
Not Elta Muck.

1620
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:56,940
That's a guess.

1621
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,460
No, that's Ham's wife.

1622
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:01,500
Jepeth's wife is of course.

1623
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,740
Yes, of course, it's Jepeth's wife, who is added added to the.

1624
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:08,860
Tenis is that a tennis.

1625
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:13,580
Well, we've got we are trying to say Shams wife's name, old names.

1626
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:14,980
You know what? Shams wife.

1627
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,140
It's Old Testament.

1628
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:20,540
I don't know. Some of these people might be very holy in the Torah.

1629
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:27,740
So for the sake of proper religious dignity, which this place has none of,

1630
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:31,020
I will not attempt these.

1631
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,060
Shams wife. Yeah, that's for the best.

1632
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:37,700
How would Woody Woodpecker say one of these names is the question.

1633
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:44,420
Second to say, said it said a telebab.

1634
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:47,500
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, I think it actually helped.

1635
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:51,700
Yahweh will allow that. He will allow what he a little more chill.

1636
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:55,940
Yeah, so let's we're winding down, but we got to talk about this.

1637
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,500
Now, here's where it becomes a theme park.

1638
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,340
Everybody is the VR experience.

1639
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:02,660
Now, this I like.

1640
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:07,300
I I got way more excited knowing about the VR experience.

1641
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:11,580
Why it's called Truth Traveler.

1642
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:14,140
That's right. Strap on your goggles.

1643
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,300
It's time for truth traveler.

1644
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,660
Let me find the description.

1645
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:23,500
Get seated in the truth traveler time machine and journey back to the time of Noah.

1646
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:28,140
Well, again, more in our immersive virtual reality experience.

1647
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,540
A flood of reality.

1648
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,300
More floods.

1649
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:33,860
And here we go.

1650
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:38,340
Finally, some catnip pod, the lovable robot.

1651
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:39,740
We have a character.

1652
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:43,940
It's pod will be your guide as you witness the building of Noah's Ark.

1653
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:47,820
Experience the flood, venture inside the Ark with the animals and some surprises,

1654
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:51,220
some exciting surprises along the way.

1655
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:55,420
We can't see a ride through of this because this is a VR goggle experience.

1656
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:58,980
But I did learn what one of the exciting surprises is.

1657
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:02,100
And would you believe that the first exciting surprise

1658
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:07,260
is that you were greeted in this VR attraction by a hologram of Ken Ham?

1659
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:09,900
Oh, man.

1660
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:14,180
Hello, it's me, holograms, all this time.

1661
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,500
Welcome to. Yeah.

1662
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:20,820
Wow. I did not realize that, like much like on star tours,

1663
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,540
you get a Princess Leia hologram here.

1664
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,860
You get the Ken Ham hologram instead.

1665
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,540
Oh, man, am I going to get Leia?

1666
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,940
Am I going to get a Yoda?

1667
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:33,260
Oh, I got Ken Ham.

1668
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,460
It's such a perfect, like disappointing name.

1669
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:43,100
Ken Ham and Ham again.

1670
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:47,140
How is John Ham the most like dashing name?

1671
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:51,340
And Ken Ham is just the saddest dipshit.

1672
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,100
Yeah.

1673
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:55,460
Scott, you know what else makes this place a theme park?

1674
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,220
Grand expansion plans.

1675
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:01,140
Oh, yeah, there's yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,620
There's a huge map of unbuilt stuff.

1677
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:04,620
Yeah, they want it.

1678
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:07,100
They want to make this a whole complex.

1679
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:11,140
The Ark alone seemed to cost a hundred million dollars,

1680
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:15,900
and that's with like private fundraising and state incentives and stuff.

1681
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:19,620
But they also were including a

1682
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,620
a model of the Tower of Babel and replicas

1683
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:28,460
of an ancient walled city and a Middle Eastern village.

1684
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:33,180
And yeah, if this is your proof of concept, the Ark, I wouldn't.

1685
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,620
Like, I don't.

1686
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:38,020
First off, I don't I don't want to meet the people who live in that village.

1687
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:40,420
I'm afraid of what they're going to say.

1688
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,460
Mm hmm.

1689
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,420
Yeah, sure.

1690
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:47,420
They did almost build there or part of the plans

1691
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:50,740
have included a thrill ride about the 10 plagues of Egypt.

1692
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:55,500
But I guess they've if you can believe that they have scaled back those plans,

1693
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,340
there will not be this now.

1694
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:59,500
Now, what does thrill ride mean to them?

1695
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,300
That's my question.

1696
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,980
Um, I don't know.

1697
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:08,420
I mean, look, it's just to go back to the truth

1698
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:12,940
traveler really quick because I watched a video where Ken Ham does a walkthrough

1699
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,460
of the truth, travel experience.

1700
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:18,620
And if this is their idea of a thrilling experience, this

1701
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:25,420
is the saddest thing I've ever seen, where this is like older man in a mask

1702
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:29,740
and like the most wires on a VR setup I've ever seen.

1703
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,820
There's so much more than the void or on an Oculus.

1704
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:37,260
I mean, he looks like he's like undergoing surgery.

1705
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:40,900
This is like like he's going to be here for 10 hours

1706
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,660
and it's going to be really invasive.

1707
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,380
This is so this is such misery.

1708
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,700
But then you get to like

1709
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:52,060
you go around the boat, you know, like you get to do in reality.

1710
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:56,340
But instead with goggles and you're in like it's it's a it's a row of four

1711
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:01,140
40 X chairs, basically, that move around in unthemed rooms.

1712
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:06,620
And everything here, that's just like black walls

1713
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:12,100
with just like the your headphone shelves or just right above your head.

1714
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,500
This is but then you but you do see dinosaurs.

1715
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:18,460
There's there's there's pod reacting to a dinosaur.

1716
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:22,980
You come face to face with a baby T-Rex

1717
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:26,660
because there were only small T-Rex is on the arc.

1718
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,580
So as opposed to other dinosaur theme park attractions,

1719
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:35,100
you get the tiniest dinosaur.

1720
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:39,060
The graphics look like GameCube, Nintendo GameCube graphics.

1721
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:42,220
Yeah. And this is a newer experience.

1722
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:45,100
So it feels like they didn't maybe put so much money into it.

1723
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:46,980
Maybe not.

1724
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,580
At least the character is there, though, I'll say that.

1725
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,220
Yeah, he's British.

1726
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:56,060
So he's got sort of a Ken Ham vibe himself.

1727
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:59,340
Did you get any sense of do we like pod?

1728
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:06,060
Well, it's pod is pod anti LGBTQ, because that might I assume he is probably.

1729
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:09,540
Is it a hate monger robot? Yeah, I don't.

1730
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,340
Probably. He seems nice.

1731
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,620
But some people, you know, are nice, but have hate in their heart.

1732
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,540
I did read the former

1733
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:22,700
the former head of Hirshend Family Entertainment,

1734
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:25,540
which runs Dollywood and Kentucky Kingdom and Silver Dollar City

1735
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:27,380
consulted on this project.

1736
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:30,940
And to them, I ask, what did you do?

1737
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,180
What did you contribute?

1738
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:36,940
Have a couple different restaurants like

1739
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,180
you're going to have no proof of.

1740
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,100
Yeah. Theming here anywhere.

1741
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,340
No. You know, you know what I would love?

1742
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,580
And maybe this if I do we have anything else before like

1743
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,940
really fast, here we go.

1744
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:54,180
I was just going to say my absolute favorite Ken Ham video

1745
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,780
is him being taken around this facility of truth traveler.

1746
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:02,180
And the best moment is he's going around with like another total dullard.

1747
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:06,860
And the two of them walk in and Ken's like, OK, looks good.

1748
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:07,740
So this is the lobby.

1749
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:11,100
And it's going to be more it's going to be more themed.

1750
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:13,020
Eventually, you're going to put up more stuff.

1751
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:15,060
And the guy says, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1752
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,020
No, you are. Oh, yes.

1753
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,620
He just did like the minimal amount to get it open.

1754
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:21,260
Yeah, exactly. So it's going to be so it's going to be like, yes.

1755
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,700
No, we're going to do the theming. OK, good. Good.

1756
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,980
And then he then they leave and he does it again.

1757
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:28,700
You're just like, why did they publish this?

1758
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,780
Him scolding his own employee.

1759
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:36,020
And then they then the guy says and so the thing kicks off actually with you.

1760
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:37,620
It's a hologram of you. And he's like, oh, right.

1761
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:39,380
Me. That's oh, yeah. OK.

1762
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:43,740
Like he's in the ride and doesn't even know he doesn't know Pod's name.

1763
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,500
He's so checked out.

1764
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,820
This is like, what's he doing?

1765
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:51,180
If not this, if we had our own theme park, it's all we would think about.

1766
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:54,380
Yeah, no, he I at the most.

1767
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:57,100
I don't know. It's obviously worse if it's this is whole.

1768
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:01,620
It's just a cynical exercise on his part to rake in money, which it might be.

1769
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,740
I don't know. I'm not sure.

1770
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:07,180
But yeah, of course, you'd be like very excited to.

1771
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:10,940
He built a giant arc like you should be at least excited about that.

1772
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,700
Yeah. But nothing does it.

1773
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,460
For this guy, apparently.

1774
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,620
Yeah. Well, how do we save this play?

1775
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:21,820
Like what if it changes hands like the cab is on dinosaurs and it gets.

1776
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,780
Is there something fun you can do with an arc?

1777
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:28,180
Well, I think and I'm not sure what connection it'll have,

1778
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:30,300
but I think it should change hands.

1779
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:34,780
And I believe it should go in the hands of hard rock park creator John Binkowski.

1780
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,260
I. Hell, yeah.

1781
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:40,700
I think you give, you know, go back and listen to our hard rock hard rock

1782
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,940
park episodes.

1783
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,220
But you got to give you got to give a guy with that passion,

1784
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:48,700
with the creativity that's exploding with ideas like Winston,

1785
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:52,900
the punk rock dog and the bare metal family, original characters.

1786
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,260
He knew what was fun.

1787
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:59,540
I believe that was a failure of a park because of advertising and location.

1788
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,260
And I don't think it was for lack of creativity.

1789
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,300
So I think turning over to somebody like a Binkowski.

1790
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:08,780
And now we're now we can get something going in here.

1791
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:13,620
Are there any famous big boats in rock history?

1792
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,460
We just make this hard rock park.

1793
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,220
That's exactly what I was trying to figure out.

1794
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,620
What is a big boat in rock history?

1795
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:21,460
That boat.

1796
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:25,420
There was a movie with Philip Seymour Hoffman about the pirate radio stations

1797
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:27,980
off of the coast of England.

1798
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:30,180
That's true. Yeah, that is true.

1799
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:34,100
Well, is it called pirate radio?

1800
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:36,540
Is it called the boat that rocked?

1801
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,580
Was it one that had like different names?

1802
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,420
Hmm. I don't remember.

1803
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:46,140
Hmm. There is, of course, I'm looking at famous songs about a boat.

1804
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,900
And there is a Jimmy Buffett song called Something About a Boat,

1805
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:51,100
but that might not be so famous to do.

1806
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,420
Come Sail Away, a famous Styx song, of course.

1807
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:59,260
Well, if we're going to make this Styx land and now Styx is the river in hell.

1808
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:04,140
So, you know, that would really be against the wishes of Ken Ham.

1809
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,340
But what better way to stick it to him

1810
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:11,940
than to give it over to Tommy Shaw and John Binkowski?

1811
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:15,340
Well, and then you actually make the river Styx.

1812
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:17,420
You'd be like, oh, yeah, water red.

1813
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:20,380
It's a blood red river.

1814
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:22,020
Styx playing all day.

1815
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:22,380
All right.

1816
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:24,820
Bunch of robato's walking around serving you.

1817
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:28,780
Get your two coins for the pay the river man to put over your eye.

1818
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,300
I don't think I get that one. Wait, what's the river man?

1819
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:38,300
Oh, you when someone back in the day, when someone died,

1820
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:40,220
you would put a coin over each eye.

1821
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:43,020
And those were the two coins to pay the river man

1822
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:47,580
to ferry you across the river Styx to the.

1823
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:50,500
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1824
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,860
Oh, to get past to. OK, OK. Yeah.

1825
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:55,340
I'm into this.

1826
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:58,100
If it's not the arc, it's the come sail away.

1827
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:01,980
Yeah. Paint it white.

1828
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,020
Yeah. Like, sure.

1829
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,300
Get a coat of paint on that thing fast.

1830
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,740
And what's inside?

1831
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,420
You know, we don't have to limit it to sticks.

1832
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,140
Other bands can.

1833
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:11,580
Well, and that's what I was going to say.

1834
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:14,780
I think you need another business minded musician in there.

1835
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:19,420
Maybe someone with royalty, you know, royal prestige, like a knight,

1836
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,780
a knight in Satan's service.

1837
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:22,860
And I'm talking about Mr.

1838
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:25,820
Gene Simmons, the restaurateur.

1839
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,580
You know, you get him involved.

1840
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:31,300
He's not going to like sharing power.

1841
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:35,020
He's not going to like sharing attention, but he could bring a lot to the table.

1842
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:37,260
Of course, he does bring a lot to the table.

1843
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:40,460
But the Kiss, I don't believe has any songs about a boat, unfortunately.

1844
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:43,980
So Scott Garner's favorite band does

1845
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:47,740
have a song about boat and all references to other boats.

1846
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:49,460
How about the Beach Boys?

1847
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,820
The Sloop John B. What about that?

1848
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,660
Oh, make it the Sloop John B.

1849
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:55,620
It's a it's finally a

1850
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:59,540
exactly accurate recreation.

1851
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:02,540
This was the size of the Sloop John B.

1852
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:07,220
These stages are where these cages are, where people were when they

1853
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,420
wanted to go home because they felt so broke up.

1854
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,100
That's exactly right.

1855
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,380
And there's books that you wrote that are 500 pages long evidence

1856
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:16,620
about the Sloop John B.

1857
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:19,700
And it's where you explain how the Sloop John B could have existed.

1858
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:20,700
And it did.

1859
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,660
And it's yeah, well, it's all convincing.

1860
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:29,620
It's converting people to, you know, Brian Wilson Beach Boys

1861
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:34,260
ism as opposed to it's about converting people away from love ism.

1862
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:36,140
Right. Because it's in Kentucky.

1863
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:39,900
There might be more Mike Love supporters and people who would still go see

1864
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:43,580
the Beach Boys. And now, look, I'd love to ride a roller coaster with the guy.

1865
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:47,540
But I think he's using that name a little wrongly these days.

1866
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:50,380
And I don't like that he's going around to Trump events. So

1867
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,500
yeah, that made a difference.

1868
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,780
Mike Love did not save the campaign ultimately.

1869
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:57,460
And then also.

1870
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:01,580
And what's interesting, too, is that there were dinosaurs on the Sloop John B.

1871
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:03,780
Yeah, leave them.

1872
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:07,620
The lyrics don't say there were dinosaurs, but there were.

1873
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,260
And it explains it all here at the Sloop John B.

1874
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:13,980
That's the was not was deck.

1875
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:17,420
That's where Walk the Dinosaur plays.

1876
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:20,060
Yes, that's the name of that song, right?

1877
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,340
Yes, yes. Great, great.

1878
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,860
Well, all the best music is going to be at.

1879
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:28,780
So do you just call it maybe you just unify it?

1880
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:33,260
Obviously, Sticks Beach Boys was not was all the best bands get involved.

1881
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:36,260
But and Kiss Kiss is in there, too.

1882
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:39,060
But is this is it Hard Rock Park to

1883
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,860
Hard Rock Park?

1884
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:45,060
Is there a biblical way to like like

1885
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:48,780
what's when Jesus comes back from the dead?

1886
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:51,740
It's the resurrection, the rising.

1887
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:52,980
It's the resurrection.

1888
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:54,700
Hard Rock Park Resurrection. Yeah.

1889
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:56,260
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

1890
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,420
The rising is, of course, Bruce Springsteen song.

1891
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:00,660
That's who the boat that rocked.

1892
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:04,900
Hard Rock Park Resurrection, the boat that rocked,

1893
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,660
which was the official name of in America.

1894
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:12,580
This movie was called Pirate Radio with Nick Frost and

1895
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:18,060
Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nye about the pirate stations in England.

1896
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,900
Oh, weird. OK.

1897
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:24,980
Well, yeah. Then the whole thing is Hard Rock Park.

1898
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:25,620
What do we like?

1899
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:27,540
Hard Rock Park rising Hard Rock Park.

1900
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,780
Wait, what's the resurrection?

1901
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,940
Yeah. Hard Rock Park Resurrection.

1902
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:36,420
I mean, either one. Yeah, I think either one is good.

1903
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:37,100
I don't know. I don't.

1904
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:39,260
And then it's the boat that rocked within that.

1905
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:41,420
Both that rocked. Yeah, that's good.

1906
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:44,460
That could be the simulator ride.

1907
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:46,420
You're like, we've got to get offshore.

1908
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:50,980
We've got to get to the oil rig where we're broadcasting the kink songs.

1909
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:56,140
And then there's a hologram of John Binkowski that appears.

1910
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:02,020
It'd be why don't we save pod the robot reprogram him,

1911
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:05,100
right, make sure that he doesn't have any bigoted views.

1912
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,380
So we'll say we'll save him. Right.

1913
01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:12,260
And what if like every because there's 12 rooms in that VR experience,

1914
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:14,740
they're all programmed to different things and just offhand.

1915
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:16,940
It's all stopping rocket disasters.

1916
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:21,500
Like we're all going to go in the time machine to save the plane.

1917
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:22,660
Right. Buddy Holly.

1918
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:25,820
Don't get on that plane, big buffer and Buddy Holly.

1919
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:29,540
I'm pod. I'm here to save you.

1920
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,980
Not in the religious way, right?

1921
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:36,460
No, like your life. Oh, yeah, baby.

1922
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:42,020
One of the rooms is pod convinces Stephen Page not to quit the bare naked ladies.

1923
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:47,780
Oh, there. Well, yeah, one of the major one of the big major stories in rock

1924
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,780
that shake the world.

1925
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:53,220
Yeah. Stopping John Denver from going skiing.

1926
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:56,220
Yeah. Pod yanks him off the slopes.

1927
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:58,740
Wait, was he skiing or a foot? Wait, Sonny Bono.

1928
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:02,100
Sonny Bono was a yeah. Denver was a plane. Yeah.

1929
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:03,540
All right. So we'll pull him out of the plane.

1930
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:06,420
We'll pull Sonny Bono away from the skis.

1931
01:45:06,780 --> 01:45:08,500
And that's great. Yeah.

1932
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,700
It's a lot of missions of getting people not to get on planes.

1933
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,140
Mostly planes, largely planes.

1934
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,020
I mean, this is yeah, it's unlimited.

1935
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,540
It's unlimited. And also you'd have

1936
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:24,780
I mean, there'd be so many so many just opportunities for walk around characters.

1937
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:26,860
And it would just be it would be full of life.

1938
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:29,580
You could really do a ton with it. Yeah.

1939
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:33,140
Would it be cruel to keep the animals at the petting zoo,

1940
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:35,460
but to paint them kiss colors?

1941
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:37,860
No, not at all. No.

1942
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:41,220
As long as it's safe, we'll make sure it's whatever we're using is safe for them.

1943
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:44,860
Yeah, we do need to branch out a little more than Hard Rock Park.

1944
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:49,260
And that's why you have a walk around like Drake character.

1945
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,500
And he sings God's plan.

1946
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,020
His big hit song. OK.

1947
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:56,740
Well, that's still in the day.

1948
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:58,820
Religious roots. We do honor them.

1949
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:00,660
Yeah. And a big mascot, Drake.

1950
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:02,460
That sounds pretty good to me. Yeah.

1951
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:05,620
So that's I mean, kids stay awake.

1952
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,780
Actually, maybe not.

1953
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:11,300
We saved it.

1954
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:13,620
We saved it. But it's going to take a couple of years for this to have.

1955
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:15,980
This place has to fall apart slowly.

1956
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:20,140
I think it is being burnt to the ground for insurance money slowly.

1957
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:27,820
And yes, well, can Ham learn a lesson from all this as humanity did from the flood?

1958
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,620
Perhaps not.

1959
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:34,180
But I hope maybe some Kentucky land will be going for real cheap soon

1960
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:37,220
and we can grab it on behalf of John Binkowski.

1961
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:39,500
I think that's a great idea.

1962
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,300
And when we eventually have Binkowski on, we'll float this idea to him.

1963
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:45,860
We really did. At this point, we really got to talk to that guy.

1964
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:48,380
Yeah, that's a good that's a good goal for the near future.

1965
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:52,500
But for now, we close out.

1966
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:57,700

1972
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,580
Everyone have a very happy Easter.

1973
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:24,140
Have hopefully the last holiday for a little bit that has to be done

1974
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,700
in a weird, careful, bad way.

1975
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:30,340
And next Easter will finally be a rager.

1976
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,180
I can't wait.

1977
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:34,540
I'm going to go as nuts as all those pagans did before the flood.

1978
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,900
Oh, my gosh. Dying.

1979
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:38,820
I'm going to die so many eggs every year.

1980
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:44,380
Every honey baked ham out of like location is going to just be a full on bacchanal.

1981
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:49,220
You know, I will say I'm going a little crazy right now

1982
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:51,500
because I'm going to go to a grocery store pickup.

1983
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:54,340
And I did order some fruit punch flavored peeps.

1984
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:58,180
Wow. So that's pretty wild.

1985
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,460
That's so bad.

1986
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:01,900
Peeps, the notorious.

1987
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:04,940
It's like cliched to say how bad peeps are.

1988
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:06,740
And you added fruit punch to the mix.

1989
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:10,900
I am. Well, I did not create the candy, but I am a longtime fan of peeps.

1990
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:15,100
I believe peeps, people saying peeps are bad or slander.

1991
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:17,180
I was loved peeps as a child.

1992
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,620
So we'll see. Maybe they're out of them.

1993
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:23,100
It also looked like one of those niche items where sometimes I add it

1994
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,420
to the order and they're like, we don't carry this.

1995
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:26,740
What are you doing?

1996
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:28,340
So we'll see.

1997
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:33,820
I guess of all the things to get wrong in your mobile grocery orders, that one.

1998
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:36,180
But I don't know. Maybe maybe this one you throw a fit.

1999
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:40,420
Yeah, no, I've never thrown a fit at one of these pickups yet.

2000
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:44,460
But I might today if I don't get my fruit punch flavored peeps.

2001
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,420
Well, please report back.

2002
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:52,180
Let us know how they are in a post Easter episode soon. Sure.

2003
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:55,180
Everyone else, see if you can find them in your hometown.

2004
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:58,060
And we'll talk to you after Easter.

2005
01:48:58,340 --> 01:48:59,780
So long. Bye. Bye.
