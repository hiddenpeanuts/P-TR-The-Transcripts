2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,900
Tally ho and welcome to a podcast.

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,000
The ride's European vacation hosted by three guys who are excited to learn

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,980
there's a whole country that's like the Austin Powers bar in Glendale.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,200
What?

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,040
What?

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,720
Imagine the bar, a whole country of the bar.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:53,960
Okay.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,760
There's this really nice bar in Glendale that's themed to the film

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,920
Austin Powers that I love.

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,640
And I'm surprised to learn that the location from that movie is actually

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,800
a real place in real life.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,400
I can visit.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,440
It's a, it is a real and it is just as swinging.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,520
Wow.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,720
Cause that Glendale Austin Powers bar is so swinging and not shady at all.

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,000
It's definitely, it's, it's very not shady, very not sticky.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,960
It's a fine establishment that I'm sure will survive the pandemic.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,880
Jason Sheridan, can you believe this?

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,240
Uh, I just can't imagine a whole country that's as cool as that Austin Powers bar.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,680
Have you been to the Austin Powers bar, Jason?

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,280
You know, I actually haven't.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Okay.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,520
I don't know why you didn't go.

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,560
I think I invited you.

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
I went with Anthony Geo and a, uh, biz, biz friend to one night.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,920
No, several.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,240
Yeah.

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,720
I think he's a frequenter.

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,880
Um, and it's all day.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,520
It's all, um, black light.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,280
Is that right?

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,720
Or like,

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,920
you might call it that.

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,120
I don't know if it's like a cheaper version of black light, maybe.

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
Like Austin Powers liked.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,880
Uh, he liked to be in a, in a haunted house all the time.

39
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,680
Like, uh, yeah, like a velvet Led Zeppelin paint, you know, poster.

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,400
Any, if you make it out to Glendale and the pandemic is over and the

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,000
Austin Powers bar is still there, just take a look at it, but don't stay long.

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,080
Yeah.

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,840
It might be, it might've been going this entire time, by the way, they might've

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,960
never closed seems very possible.

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,600
If any bar was, was to knock,

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,680
you would just go up to the door, knock and say, do I make you horny baby?

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,600
And they'd let you in.

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,000
If you had a secret word,

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,040
they know the obscure code.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,840
Very obscure.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
Um, we, we actually, we are talking about a, uh, a, a British themed

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,040
environment that is, uh, uh, a lot more, uh, ornate and well done.

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,640
If you can imagine then the Austin, then the Austin Powers bar, I think so.

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,760
We'll decide as we go.

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,640
Um, the, uh, the second stop on pie guest rides, European vacation, or I guess the

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,760
third, if you, you know, head to the second gate to check out the day trips.

57
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,920
We just went to the Popeye village and Malta and had a good time.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,480
Uh, but we're talking today about a place, uh, that is a Southwest of London.

59
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,640
It's a place called Chessington world of adventures.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
I had never heard of this park.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
I don't know if you guys had before.

62
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:18,960
No.

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,680
But I'm glad I have now and we were made aware of it by our guests today.

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Let's bring him in.

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,960
He is a staff writer for the Atlantic and along with PCR legend Griffin Newman.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,280
He hosts the excellent podcast, blank check.

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,880
David Sims is with us.

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,160
Hi guys.

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,280
I just want to say something about this Austin powers bar that I didn't know

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,680
existed until you were talking.

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,200
Oh really?

72
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,680
Oh yeah.

73
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,120
Yeah.

74
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,720
It's called the electric pussy cat.

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,680
And I'm seeing here.

76
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,200
Yes.

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
Um, that's correct.

78
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
You know, so I just Googled while you were talking just to see like, all right,

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,440
what are they, you know, how, how Austin powers are we talking to things?

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,080
One, obviously Britain, just like this place, just in general, the whole vibe.

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,160
Mostly black lights, black lights, union Jack's everywhere.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
But you know, velvet and velour and like squiggly lines.

83
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,520
You know how like Austin powers, it's all like, you know, they love like zigzags.

84
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh yeah.

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,600
It's a real zigzaggy country and a lot of double decker buses, uh, both

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,360
inside and outside, right.

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,840
Two, uh, for my podcast, we recently ish.

88
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,680
I mean, like six months ago now, uh, went to something called trolls, the experience

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,520
that was like a sort of a themed interactive, uh, whatever inside park, like

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,280
themed experience.

91
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,760
Sure.

92
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,760
Pop up an activation inactivate.

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:34,920
Yeah.

94
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,680
They, they sure.

95
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,800
They'll take a heck out of, you know, an empty office in midtown.

96
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,200
And it had the basic, it didn't have the same like items, but the same visual

97
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,000
aesthetic as this basically, like a lot of purple and pink, you know what I mean?

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Um, and like in the dark, does that kind of maybe get you around, um, you know,

99
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,280
having to do a very complicated themed environment, right?

100
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
If it's mostly in the dark with just some splashes of color.

101
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Right.

102
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,160
So, you know, right, you know, you can, you can like, that's, that's.

103
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,160
Cutting you a lot of corners, right?

104
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Yes, absolutely.

105
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,840
It seems like it.

106
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,160
Yeah.

107
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,000
Um, I don't know about this trolls thing.

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,320
Where, uh, what else can you tell us about that?

109
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,960
Uh, it's basically like, you know, it's the, it's, it's centered on the movie

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,760
trolls, so there's a lot of like lore and characters from those movies.

111
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,640
If you haven't seen them.

112
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,720
So if you go in and expect in like the toy trolls, you're out of luck, but they

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,040
like do your hair and you have to like, I don't know, you make a, like a mix tape

114
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,560
and you gather up some, you know, glitter and you have a dance party.

115
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,360
It's all very fun.

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,520
And when we did it, it was three grown men and they very clearly like.

117
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
Made sure we were alone.

118
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
Like they were like, you're not going in with a group of kids.

119
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,520
Like you guys are going to have to deal with this by yourself.

120
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,080
We're going to sort of like hermetically have you have the, it was very,

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
everyone was very professional.

122
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,040
You can listen to our episode about it.

123
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,880
It was a very, they did the best they could with three, 30 something guys being

124
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,920
like, uh, Hey, we're here for trolls.

125
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
The experience we hit a Patreon goal.

126
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,960
So we have to do this.

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,720
Like they were, they were all very.

128
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
Well, they do your hair.

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,680
They do.

130
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,360
You have to pay extra if you want a physical wig.

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,640
Otherwise you get a paper hat essentially in the shape of.

132
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,200
Okay.

133
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,600
Yes.

134
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,960
And did you not pay for the way we did not pay for the way, but I did get a lot

135
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,040
of glitter on my face.

136
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,640
I don't know.

137
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,720
You know, I, I, I did as much as I physically could.

138
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,360
You got wrapped up in the spirit.

139
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Uh, you, I'm sure we're singing the timber lake song.

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:33,840
Yeah.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,440
Pop me and, uh, branch.

142
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,120
I believe those are the names of the, the lead characters in trolls was

143
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
hanging out with them.

144
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Did the trolls fart glitter?

145
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,120
Uh, they didn't in front of us because mostly it was just a bunch of like eager

146
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,320
20 something you imagine like Broadway, you know, aspiring Broadway actor types

147
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,920
like leading us around, but I have seen both of those movies and they do fart

148
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,520
glitter, right?

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,200
Okay.

150
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,360
They saved that up that they had that effect in universal studios.

151
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,200
I think Florida.

152
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,960
Oh, that's impressive.

153
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,120
So they must not know they didn't roll it out, I guess, to the, uh, startup

154
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,520
experience, whatever that experience was.

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Yes.

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,400
Um, this, you know, it's going to be exciting for, we'll, we'll all know the

157
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,400
mythology very well when trolls world tour wins best picture at the front

158
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,160
of the movie lists Academy awards.

159
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,120
It's at the highest grossing like of the year with an asterix or is it Sonic?

160
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,640
I, oh yeah.

161
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:33,840
No, no, no.

162
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,400
Sonic's Sonic's doing good.

163
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Right.

164
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,320
Sonic still has, he had those solid three pre COVID months like to, to all

165
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,480
do so Sonic was this year.

166
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:44,760
Yeah.

167
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,400
Jesus.

168
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
Sonic was this year.

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,480
Valentine's day surprise.

170
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,880
Yeah.

171
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,320
Sonic and, uh, do little, do little is this year.

172
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,760
Little is going to be nominated for best picture at least little.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,080
It's not going to win because maybe there was some problems with it, but it'll be

174
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,680
in the top 10 at five over 10.

175
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,040
Right.

176
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
There's some politics.

177
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,240
So yeah, maybe, maybe it'll, it's too polarizing to win, but it'll, it'll get

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,000
a good chunk of nominations.

179
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,600
There's, there's animal, uh, ass play in both troll and troll.

180
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,760
I guess trolls aren't animals.

181
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,360
I guess they're create magical creatures.

182
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
I apologize to the trolls.

183
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,640
Wait, you can see.

184
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,880
So farting glitter is ass play and reaching up into a dragon's

185
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,840
asshole to get, what was it again?

186
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,880
I think it was

187
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,360
bag.

188
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,720
Yeah.

189
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,520
Bagpipes.

190
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah.

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh yes.

192
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
Bagpipes were the button.

193
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,280
That was the funny punchline after pulling out like multiple suits of armor.

194
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,760
Seat.

195
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,000
I should have said seat play.

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,320
I apologize to all the,

197
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,520
Oh, well yes.

198
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,680
Yeah.

199
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,560
We call butts seats.

200
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
So we have to call them seat holes.

201
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,720
Uh, it reached into a seat hole.

202
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,760
COVID has made me a dear, uh, filthier in my language and I apologize.

203
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,480
Well, that's the old, as part of this European vacation, we're getting, uh,

204
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,800
we're getting a lot raunchier.

205
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,760
We're getting a looser European attitude.

206
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,760
I'm going through character development now and I'm becoming a little bit less,

207
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,240
uh, uptight when it comes to certain material.

208
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,080
What?

209
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,720
Less of a brood.

210
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,280
I see.

211
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,600
Yes.

212
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
My awakening.

213
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,920
It's my awakening with language and with sexuality.

214
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,840
So apologies, David, if it's, uh, we aren't, you know, it's the most proper

215
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,000
hosts support you on all your journeys.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,440
Thank you.

217
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,040
Well,

218
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,280
you're skeptical.

219
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
You're imagining journeys that we shouldn't be supported.

220
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,840
We want to encourage them too much.

221
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,960
We want to encourage them, but we don't want to push them too far.

222
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,800
Um, okay.

223
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
Well, before we get into the park, uh, today, we're, we're, we're talking about

224
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,280
this, this partially because, you know, I, uh, David, I listened to blank check

225
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,760
and there's a, there's a fact that comes up, uh, pretty sparingly.

226
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,320
It's, it's always handled very tastefully if it comes up, which is rarely.

227
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,720
Uh, and that is the kind of obscure facts that you actually grew up in Britain.

228
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,320
I did.

229
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes.

230
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,760
Of course, anytime it comes up, everyone's very charmed and very delighted to hear

231
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:02,960
it.

232
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
And everyone's really nice to me about it.

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Uh, everyone lets it pass in a very, very sweet way.

234
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,840
Griffin couldn't be cooler.

235
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,760
Um, but yes, I did.

236
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,560
I did move to England at the age of nine and I lived there till I was 22, um, in

237
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,840
London, in North London.

238
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,080
So yes, I spent all of my adolescence there and certainly I've never been to,

239
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,400
uh, you know, Disneyland, Disney world, like the, the, the, the King American

240
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,840
theme parks, cause we just weren't here, you know, and like, you know, but I have

241
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,600
been to Britain's excuses for theme parks, some of which are very, I shouldn't,

242
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,760
I shouldn't, I shouldn't be too mean, but, uh, it's a little,

243
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,280
I was going to ask, you know, you brought this, this main topic to us, but I, but I

244
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,760
was curious any, any, since we haven't really done a lot of, uh, London or

245
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,000
England, or if, you know, knowing that, um, uh, the three of us all really enjoy,

246
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,720
uh, stupid and named themed experiences, um, were we to, uh, go to London or

247
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,240
anywhere else in England, is there anything, anything else you would recommend in

248
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,120
the world of the, you know, the dumbest themed entertainment possible?

249
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,040
This is the problem.

250
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,280
Cause like, I feel like you got, you know, like Alton towers, which maybe you've,

251
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,240
uh, dug up in your research.

252
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,320
I'm not sure, you know, that's kind of like the King park in England of like,

253
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,160
you know, it's got great rides.

254
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,560
Like they're, you know, that, that's sort of, if you're a Briton and you want to go

255
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,440
on like, you know, hair raising roller coasters, that's where you're going to go.

256
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,280
And then Thorpe park is kind of number two.

257
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:38,360
Chessington is a solid third, like very much not challenging, but I don't think

258
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm so glad that's our choice for the third best part, right?

259
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,640
Third best park, same parent company.

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,720
Yeah, yes, exactly.

261
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,160
Three.

262
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,120
And honestly, if you're throwing Lego land in there, like Chessington might not be

263
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
able to match Lego land, like, which is another, you know, but like I don't like

264
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,920
same parent company on that too.

265
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
I don't, it's a monopoly.

266
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Yeah.

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,040
Really?

268
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,280
See now, now you're, you guys know more than me.

269
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,800
I did, I did know that there was this, this one parent company controlling so

270
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,160
many of these places, but there's not like a lot of places that have the sort of

271
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,840
extensive really thought through theming, right?

272
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,960
Like the worlds with like characters and like all that stuff in Britain at all.

273
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,480
I think, like, I can't think of the best place to go for, for that.

274
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,080
I can, you know, I think your, your option would probably be Disneyland

275
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,600
Paris or Euro Disney, whatever, whatever it's branded as now.

276
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,360
Oh, sure.

277
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,840
Yeah.

278
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:31,880
Yeah.

279
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,600
Which is pretty fairly close.

280
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:33,920
Yeah.

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
Like that's, and like, that was a spot where when I was a kid, I think my

282
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,800
parents were like, well, maybe we could go there, but it had such a bad reputation

283
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,880
in the nineties is kind of like that the launch had sort of flopped and you know,

284
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,600
they weren't really figuring, I feel like maybe it has a better rep now.

285
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I don't, I don't think it didn't.

286
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,360
When I was a kid,

287
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,360
I've made my mixed opinions known on the podcast.

288
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,480
I, there's some wonderful things there and I think it was designed with the best

289
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,600
intent, but man, there is, there is some trash.

290
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,040
There is some big time trash around that place.

291
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,360
It was on the way up before the world shut down.

292
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:09,840
Really?

293
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,000
It was getting some new stuff.

294
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,720
Yeah.

295
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,480
I believe they finally closed the Armageddon themed experience.

296
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,600
The there was a little, there's a corner of the park that's Armageddon and Aerosmith,

297
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,040
which in Aerosmith did the song for Armageddon.

298
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,760
So it's really Aerosmith alley.

299
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,880
And Armageddon obliterates the city of Paris in a scene that has nothing to do

300
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,880
with anything else, like essentially a visual effects demonstration.

301
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,200
They're like, oh, let's check in with Howesworth doing.

302
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,000
And you just see Paris getting nuked with a meteor.

303
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,280
Is that right?

304
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,400
And then you don't see any like human fallout?

305
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,520
No, no, no, no, no.

306
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,000
It even brings up like, by the way, millions dead from that.

307
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,680
Like everyone's just like, we did it.

308
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,480
We blew up the asteroid and everyone's like waving American flags.

309
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,560
And like it's that it's funny that in Paris they were like, let's, let's,

310
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,440
let's highlight this.

311
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
Like, let's bring this up.

312
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,640
It's cold, callous destruction of our entire city.

313
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,680
That's kind of true in a lot of disaster movies, I guess.

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,240
That you just you see maybe Stoke cities that we care about

315
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,800
because it's in America or something.

316
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,760
But then they'll just toss off like Mumbai is gone

317
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,520
and everybody just looks down for a second and that's it.

318
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,320
That happened in Independence Day with Chicago.

319
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,600
I think they say Chicago has been destroyed, but you never get to see anything.

320
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Right. So when I was a little young, not that little, but I was watching

321
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,800
and I was like Chicago destroyed.

322
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,080
We don't even get to see it.

323
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,880
We don't even get to enjoy Wrigley Field being blown up.

324
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,840
What a bummer.

325
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,920
Yeah, you're left out of the hum.

326
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,400
And Jason, you got a certain brand.

327
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,080
I just I just watched the scene.

328
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,720
I just cute it up on YouTube and watch it's 30 seconds long.

329
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,080
That's that's that's what Paris gets.

330
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
Paris just getting blown up.

331
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,400
You know, Chicago, I think, doesn't get anything.

332
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,440
I vaguely remember.

333
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,800
Yeah, you don't. Yeah, you don't see anything.

334
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
You don't get any grad. Yeah, it's just like, yeah, all those

335
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,920
all those cities are gone.

336
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
We don't have the budget off screen.

337
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,920
Rope them off.

338
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,360
All right. OK, let's get on with this.

339
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
Like a soap opera character.

340
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,080
Yeah, I'm sorry. They had to go.

341
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
But so, OK, so you so you're implying that,

342
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,080
you know, the theme theme parks are different.

343
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,600
Themed entertainment is different and perhaps like maybe a little

344
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,840
a little lesser than in in England.

345
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,760
I mean, I don't want to be too rude because I'm not an expert.

346
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,320
And I haven't been to Alton Towers or Thorpe Park since I was a little kid.

347
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,600
And like, you know, I'm sure they had, you know, with Alton Towers is on

348
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,200
like a big old there's like a big old castle there that they bought.

349
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,760
Like, so I think that's really nice.

350
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,880
You know, like I think there's lots of there's nice things.

351
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,000
But I always think of those places and they would advertise constantly on TV

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,680
when I was a kid because I'm a kid.

353
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm watching kids shows. They're advertising roller coasters to me.

354
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,280
It was always about like we got we just got the the gnarliest new ride.

355
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,240
Like, you won't believe how intense this thing is.

356
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,440
Like, that's what they were always leading with, not like come to a magical universe.

357
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,080
And it's fun for the whole family.

358
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,640
It was like, we're going to you're going to die.

359
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,880
You're going to it's going to be awful.

360
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,200
You're you'll be so upset after you do this.

361
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,560
And the kids are like, I got to ride Nemesis.

362
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,680
Like, I got to ride this this insane thing that's going to warp my brain.

363
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,240
Well, David, since you bring that up, I feel like I should let you know,

364
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,400
since you are a film writer, Alton Towers in the last couple of years

365
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,120
introduced a roller coaster based on the Wicker Man.

366
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,400
Wow. That goes through the Wicker Man.

367
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
All right. I'm into that. That's kind of fun. Yeah.

368
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,280
That's cool. By the way, that's cool.

369
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm assuming it's a wooden coaster, right?

370
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,480
I would assume. Yeah, it's a wooden coaster that goes through the big wooden guy.

371
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,960
I think generic. I don't think it's cage.

372
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,120
I don't I don't know that you get a lot of Nick Cage.

373
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,760
Right. I think you just get like smoke effects.

374
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,880
They don't like throw toast at you.

375
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,920
I'm trying to think of like the bees.

376
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
No bees. No bees. Right.

377
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah. Yeah. No writhing beeheaded animatronic.

378
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,720
No, he's not like punching women like like throughout.

379
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,840
Oh, that's right. Is there a I don't I haven't watched this montage of insane parts

380
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,320
of that movie in a while, but does he is he in a bear costume and punches a woman?

381
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,400
Well, because it's a Neil LaBeouc movie.

382
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
Neil LaBeouc, a famously chill dude. Yes.

383
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:29,680
And he is like his like revamp of the original movie is like this is like a female only colony.

384
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,440
And that's why they're like be obsessed.

385
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,560
They are they're they're farming honey or whatever.

386
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,240
But it's all women.

387
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,880
And so when Cage has to like start trying to fight his way out, he's just like throwing

388
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
women against the wall and punching people.

389
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,960
And he's wearing a bear suit for some reason.

390
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,320
So it's not he's not targeting women.

391
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,640
No, what can he do around a bunch?

392
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,920
Neil LaBeouc doesn't have any problems with women.

393
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,680
And if you look throughout all his work,

394
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,120
he'll definitely not see anything like that that would alarm you.

395
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,040
I have the Wicker Man now as my background.

396
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,880
I just want the Wicker Man coaster if you can see it looks and it looks cool.

397
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
No, it's got Google.

398
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,480
It is cool as shit.

399
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
It is so cool looking.

400
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,640
It's like a weird they made this crazy wooden Wicker Man in the middle of a wooden coaster.

401
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
And at night, especially if you watch a ride through, it looks incredible.

402
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
Honestly, I mean, that's the thing.

403
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,800
I think Britain's got good coasters.

404
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,040
There's no national shame on that front.

405
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,400
I just think it lacks for the more thought through themed universes.

406
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,920
Whimsy fairy magic.

407
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,280
That's the type of, you know, imagineering we're looking for dark like wind, like cute

408
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
little dark rides that have more.

409
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
That's what Chessington brought to the table.

410
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,080
I mean, maybe one reason also that Britain is light on whimsy is that Britain's a fairly

411
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
whimsical country.

412
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,360
And if you go to many a small town in Britain, it feels like you're in a theme park.

413
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,720
They're very cute.

414
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
They have these old town squares.

415
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
You know, there's lots of old architecture.

416
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
You can buy fudge.

417
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,160
It's not that far from, I don't know, like a whatever.

418
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,560
You say hello to Paddington on your way to work.

419
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,440
Exactly.

420
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
So maybe that's why.

421
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,280
Maybe that's just not something people really need from a theme park.

422
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,040
Oh, and how many theme parks and how many theme parks is the theme London?

423
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,200
Now that I add up what you're saying, like how many big bends are out there?

424
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,920
How many little fave and like Universal Hollywood is it a little fake London?

425
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,680
Like if it is the place that theme parks are emulating, then how do you go one step beyond

426
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:43,920
that?

427
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,160
Right.

428
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,280
There's lots of old timey villages you can visit where it's, you know, they got that

429
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,840
here too, right?

430
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,640
Where, you know, pretend it's the days of your you were all going to go to a tin line,

431
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,600
you know, all that stuff.

432
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,240
But I'll say this, you know, since we're starting to, you know, talk a little about

433
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,640
Chesington, this, I don't know why this struck me as very like British, but they have three

434
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,800
different attractions based on books.

435
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
That doesn't happen in America.

436
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,400
Very literary.

437
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,960
Ew.

438
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Ew.

439
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,040
Ew.

440
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,160
I mean, kids books, but still books.

441
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,640
Okay.

442
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:20,800
Nonetheless.

443
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,040
All right.

444
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,640
You got me back on board a little bit.

445
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,600
One thing.

446
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,400
There's pictures.

447
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,560
Is Britain going to have like a Harry Potter world?

448
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,640
Cause that does seem like something like that's sort of a layup and I don't, I don't

449
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,200
know why that hasn't been, but maybe it has.

450
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,400
They've got, they've got that tour of the set.

451
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,360
Right, right, right.

452
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,000
Still, right?

453
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,240
Yeah.

454
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
I think that's really all they have right now.

455
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,440
Well, and they have something coming called the London resort, which is selling itself

456
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,680
as like a world-class theme park, like trying to compete on the Disney and universal level.

457
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh, I'm looking at this.

458
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
This looks fancy.

459
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,720
Wow.

460
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,800
I don't know why it's called the London resorts.

461
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,160
Clearly not in London, but like whatever.

462
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,120
I guess Disneyland Paris is not in Paris.

463
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,600
True.

464
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:03,760
Right.

465
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,080
Oh, true.

466
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,840
But I guess London, that's a, that's a national and that's a global brand.

467
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,800
Everyone knows London.

468
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,400
Yeah.

469
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,000
It's close enough.

470
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,400
But that makes sense to me that someone's like, you know what?

471
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,200
There's a bit of a gap here for like a true Disney world style place where people could

472
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,680
actually stay and, you know, have a great time.

473
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,400
David, I had a question since you live there, if you could explain a little about how people

474
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,280
kind of do vacations because the Chesington website has a million, a million different

475
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,680
spots where it is advertising come here for a short break.

476
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
And I didn't know about short break.

477
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,620
Yeah.

478
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,920
So from what I can suss out is a short break is one or two nights away

479
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,800
and a holiday is anything longer than three nights.

480
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
Is that stupid and wrong?

481
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
No, I think that's absolutely right.

482
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,000
A short break is just as far as I would think of it as a weekend, you know, right?

483
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,720
A weekend break.

484
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,080
I don't.

485
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,920
Yeah, it is funny to think of that.

486
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,360
Like, you know, I grew up in Britain and even though I always had an I was always the American,

487
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
like I always retained an accent, et cetera.

488
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,640
Like there's all these like idiomatic ways of speaking that you forget about, such as

489
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,840
saying like I'm going on holidays, like things like that.

490
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,560
There is this sort of obsession.

491
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,360
There's a place in Britain, a chain called Buttlands.

492
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
I don't know if does that I assume.

493
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
Does that mean anything to you guys?

494
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,560
No, no, no.

495
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,920
Which is there.

496
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,600
I'm sure there are American versions of it, but it's like, you know, that's a place you take your kid.

497
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,880
It's like a tented city where you will stay.

498
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,640
There's water parks, there's rides and like it's it's going to be a whole package deal,

499
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,840
like maybe for a weekend or longer where you can essentially just let your kids run wild while you

500
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,280
go to the pub.

501
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,440
Again, not to stereotype the country I grew up in and I'm a citizen of, but that is absolutely,

502
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,000
I think, how a lot of Brits approach their holidays.

503
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,840
And like that's rooted in like what I think of as the classic British vacation, because it's an

504
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,480
island nation that only really started entertaining Europe as a great place to visit in the last few

505
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,200
decades.

506
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,920
So like the classic thing is you go to the British seaside, like Blackpool, Skegness, these kind of

507
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,480
like Margate, these sort of, you know, boardwalk towns and there's a Ferris wheel and there's a

508
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
helter skelter, you know, like there's stuff like that.

509
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,400
Like that that kind of bleak thing is it was British seaside vacationing until eventually,

510
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I think it was like, oh, we could go to Spain.

511
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,480
Like it's like an hour on the plane.

512
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,280
Like we can go to like we can go to like Umbria, like, you know, these beautiful like we can

513
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,680
Sicily, like, you know, this is all incredibly cheap.

514
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,080
Like once like low cost flights started happening, that's that sort of upended everything.

515
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,840
Interesting.

516
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,800
But you were you you think some of these seaside places there was something depressing about it

517
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
closer to 1900 or so.

518
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,720
I mean, again, not I feel like I'm just coming on and I am getting in every stereotype that

519
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,640
Europeans have about Brits.

520
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,480
But yes, like they're incredibly depressing places like they're like a Blackpool, which is kind of

521
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,000
like the king resort town in Britain and probably I think a lot of people still go there genuinely

522
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,800
to go on holiday.

523
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,080
Like it could be raining the entire time.

524
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,960
Like the food is the food's not going to be very good.

525
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,000
Like it's I don't know what you're getting out of Blackpool apart from that you can see the North

526
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,440
Sea, which is a freezing lake in between Ireland and Britain.

527
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,040
It's a freezing body of water.

528
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,640
And like there's the very classic unfair British stereotype of like people going to the beach.

529
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,160
And it's that they drive up to the beach and never leave their car and eat a sandwich.

530
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,520
And then they drive home.

531
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,720
And like, of course, that's not really how Brits experience the seaside.

532
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,960
But that's how Europeans think British people experience pleasure.

533
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,800
That's how I'm going to the beach these days.

534
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,560
Literally, I've literally done this driven to the beach, eating a sandwich, not gotten out of my

535
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:12,800
guts.

536
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,160
How we have to do it now.

537
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,960
I feel so bad.

538
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,440
I want to clarify like Britain actually has lots of good food.

539
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,560
The weather isn't so bad.

540
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,360
You know, like all these stereotypes are a little exaggerated.

541
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,400
But at the same time, you know, in Britain, certainly people make fun of them.

542
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,680
You know, like these are the jokes.

543
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,520
You know, because you lived in it.

544
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,800
She was a Blackpool as a fake Eiffel Tower.

545
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,400
See, I don't know if it's I don't know if it's specifically supposed to be the Eiffel

546
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,560
Tower.

547
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,720
It's very Eiffel Tower tower like that.

548
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,600
That's kind of their thing.

549
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,640
They got the big tower.

550
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,520
I forget what it's called.

551
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:53,360
But can we all something we could all do maybe is a future tournament could be fake Eiffel

552
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,240
Towers.

553
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,120
There are a number of those across theme park world at the Americana again to bring up

554
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,000
Glendale, home of the Austin Powers bar.

555
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,240
Do you have an e-jerk what the best fake Eiffel Tower is?

556
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,160
Me?

557
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,920
I've got to stand up for Blackpool Tower.

558
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,720
Absolutely.

559
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,480
I mean, like, I don't know.

560
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
Like, I'm trying to I mean, I think of Vegas, obviously.

561
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
Where are other fake?

562
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
I think it seems like Vegas is a good one.

563
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,560
The Disney World one's too small.

564
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,240
I think I think that one's not competing.

565
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,720
Every Lego land has a fake Eiffel Tower, too.

566
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,400
I've been to I think two Lego lands.

567
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,440
They definitely both had them.

568
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,400
The land.

569
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
We've not done one Lego land anyway.

570
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:34,800
And there is.

571
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,280
Yeah, there's one in England as part of the same corporate umbrella is very nice.

572
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,400
I remember I went there a couple of times.

573
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,920
I remember having a great time at Lego land.

574
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,880
Lego is great.

575
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,160
It's hard to argue with Lego.

576
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

577
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,400
People seem very fond of those places.

578
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Dina, do you think that you would have

579
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:02,000
was your fondness for Chessington purely proximity or if all of these places were closer,

580
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,480
do you think you still would have chosen Chessington for your theme park needs?

581
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
My fondness was it was partly out of proximity, certainly.

582
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,760
As a teenager, I could just take the train there.

583
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,560
I would not even need adult adult supervision.

584
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,280
Like it was, you know, it's a day trip away.

585
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,080
But so was Thorpe Park, which is a, you know, has more intense rides,

586
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,240
probably like a better theme park overall.

587
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,280
And as a teenager, I was such a scaredy cat that I definitely gravitated towards Chessington.

588
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,000
Chessington was about the speed I could handle where, like,

589
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,400
the most intense rides at Chessington, even I was like, oh, OK, this isn't so bad.

590
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,880
Whereas Thorpe Park kind of freaked me out a little bit.

591
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,920
And there's also just like you guys know, like when you're a teenager and you're going with like

592
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,720
four male friends to a theme park, there's that weird egotistical one-upmanship of like,

593
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,160
well, I can do anything.

594
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,680
We're all going to do this because this is the scariest thing.

595
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,120
And I was such a I was very I remain, as I believe listeners in my podcast will know,

596
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,720
we did a Six Flags episode.

597
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,120
I'm not a huge fan of speed or heights.

598
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,680
Like, those are not things I like I need to feel in my life, like great heights and great speed.

599
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,120
And so, you know, like as a grownup, I'm just like, great, I can avoid that.

600
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,200
And Griff, you know, Griffin Newman, my co-host, he wants to take me to Disney World.

601
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,840
I'm excited to do that because as he's kind of made clear to me, like speed and heights are not

602
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,480
really the primary experiences there anyway.

603
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,400
Like that it's sort of a different vibe.

604
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,560
But yeah, yeah, it could be if you were seeking it.

605
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,760
But yeah, there is plenty of soft stuff to do.

606
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,720
Yeah, you're in good company here with that, except, well, you know, Jason's a speed demon

607
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,200
and a height devil.

608
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,720
I was going to say Miser.

609
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,320
You know, truth hurts sometimes, you know.

610
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,840
Height Miser, Jason Sheridan.

611
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Height Miser.

612
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,000
That'll stick.

613
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,640
I like that.

614
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,760
Yeah.

615
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Do you remember anything you were avoiding in Thorpe or something that you did or Alden

616
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,480
Tower, something that you like pushed your limits and did it and then hated it or something

617
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,880
that is still is frightening to you and you'll never do?

618
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
I'm now trying to see if they still have it.

619
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,080
Thorpe Park definitely had a ride called X No Way Out, which I believe may be gone,

620
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,760
which now that I say it, I love it.

621
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,480
It's sort of a threatening like, but that was a famously backwards ride.

622
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,640
One of those, you know, it goes backwards instead of forwards.

623
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,360
And I remember doing that, like kind of.

624
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,760
Whatever.

625
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,920
Like, you know, I would being pressured into doing that.

626
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,520
And I like my experience with roller coasters is always like, you know, if I do it, it's

627
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,080
it's fine.

628
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,040
It's not the end of the world.

629
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,480
I survived, but I never have the feeling like it has just never sparked for me where I'm

630
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,600
like, oh, you know what?

631
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,640
Like, I get it now.

632
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,160
I got to do this all the time.

633
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,360
It was always more of a thing of like, well, I did it to say that I could do that.

634
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
I, you know, I did it to check the box.

635
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,800
Colossus.

636
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,760
That was a big one.

637
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,600
I don't think I ever did Colossus.

638
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Now they're all different.

639
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,800
Now they've got something based around saw.

640
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,840
Are you guys seeing this?

641
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,520
Yes, they have a saw because I looked up Thor Park.

642
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,200
I read up because they had like the same sort of website and as this one and they have saw

643
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,680
the ride.

644
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,160
What?

645
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,640
Whoa.

646
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,440
Which is just.

647
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,880
There's the little puppet guy.

648
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
He's like taunting you.

649
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,080
Yeah, he's taunting you.

650
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,320
But it's it seems like it's just an off the rack roller coaster with the saw logo.

651
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,880
Yeah.

652
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,800
That's a waste of the saw IP.

653
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,120
Well, I mean, you guys might know, like, you know, Chris Rock is relaunching saw.

654
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,200
The exciting new movie Spiral is coming to theaters next year, I guess.

655
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,480
Now, do you think they'll seize the opportunity to like to, you know,

656
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,360
make it to kind of a prestige rebrand of saw the ride?

657
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,880
Yes, they'll add a different puppet to the queue and that'll be it.

658
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,320
Done deal.

659
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,680
And yeah, the puppet says, I think I love my wife.

660
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,240
Wow.

661
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,880
Be careful.

662
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,000
You might discover you love your wife.

663
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Is saw part of the rock averse?

664
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,280
I think it is now, right?

665
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,320
That's part of the deal.

666
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,720
Wow.

667
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,920
That's great.

668
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,160
The Chris Rock averse.

669
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,440
The Chris Rock averse.

670
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,480
I was like, what is rock?

671
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,160
I mean, we just said Chris Rock, but I couldn't wrap my head around Rock averse.

672
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Well, if you have a better name for it, I'd like to hear it.

673
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,320
I know.

674
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,520
No, I certainly don't.

675
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,680
I do.

676
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,960
I prefer calling him not Chris Rock, but the Rock Mizer.

677
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,280
That's why I got confused.

678
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,880
That's fine.

679
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,680
OK, but let's head into Chessington where you need not be afraid of.

680
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,880
Well, I mean, there's frights.

681
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,360
There's definitely frights as well as delights.

682
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,320
Yeah, you could easily be startled by Professor Burps bubble work.

683
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,080
We're going to talk about Professor Burps.

684
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,640
I mean, we just head right into it because, OK, here's my overall take,

685
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,200
not knowing anything about this park and starting to dig in.

686
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,040
You know, we just came for David.

687
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,480
The last episode we did was basically in Italy.

688
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,440
There's an entire ripoff Universal Studios where they're like, you know,

689
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,040
pulling IP that they clearly don't have the rights to.

690
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,280
And they like use Doc Brown or Mary Poppins until someone complains

691
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,080
and then they hide them in a shed and never use them again.

692
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,720
This very desperate grab for other people's IP.

693
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,200
They're just so chasing it and craving for it.

694
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
And it didn't really work out.

695
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,920
Chessington, I feel like, is full of original IP that is very delightful,

696
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,040
very creative, very British in a lot of cases.

697
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,800
I find this place so charming.

698
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,840
And I mean, just what I view as like the primary three that really jumped out at me

699
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,560
are like, I think some of the most original theme park rides we've ever come across.

700
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,840
So tell me the three.

701
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,480
I'm excited.

702
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,320
Well, I mean, we should kick it off with.

703
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,560
I mean, certainly we could build to it.

704
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,600
But I mean, what we just mentioned, Professor Burps bubble works.

705
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,160
I mean, if the audience isn't excited already by this phrase,

706
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,520
I mean, we could say the very short sentence about it is

707
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,200
that Professor Burp invites you to a tour of his wacky soda factory.

708
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:45,200
Am I missing anything that it had kind of a vague, I guess, Willy Wonka vibe to it, right?

709
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,360
Like it's a it's a water ride.

710
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,320
It's a dark ride.

711
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,040
You're in like a tube floating around.

712
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,120
And it's a it's a factory making soda.

713
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,800
So there's all kinds of bubble stuff to be clear.

714
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,960
It no longer exists, which I was sad to learn.

715
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,200
I think I vaguely had heard this, but it was open when I was like, yeah, 1990.

716
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,960
Right. And it ran for like 15, 16 years.

717
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,720
And when I was when I was going there to Chessington,

718
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
obviously Chessington had a real ride.

719
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,160
So like, you know, when you're with your friends, they want to do.

720
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,840
We're going to talk about some of them.

721
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,800
But I remember when I was like 10 being like, I think that's the best ride.

722
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,000
And that not being that controversial opinion, even among my friends trying to seem cool

723
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,800
going on the nastiest rides, like they were like, yeah, there's something about bubble works.

724
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,080
Like there's something about it.

725
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,960
It's just kind of just kind of a blast.

726
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
It had a strobe light section.

727
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,720
I think that's what we all like the most.

728
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,720
At the end, where they're like, we're going to show you how we, you know, whatever.

729
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,880
Here's the final step to soda making.

730
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,480
And then you were in this like big open hall and there would be strobes going.

731
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,640
So all of the like all the water looked crazy and you would, you know,

732
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,640
It's like big fountains like shooting over the your ride track.

733
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,360
And you're in like a they might even call them tubs.

734
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,960
You're in this like circular round thing.

735
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,000
So it's like a it's like a whitewater rafting ride that isn't rough.

736
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,560
You just like casually float and spin.

737
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,200
So you get different views of everything as you go.

738
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,760
It's like a tea.

739
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,640
It's like you're in the tea cups at Disneyland, but it's in water.

740
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,320
Yes, exactly.

741
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,880
And right.

742
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,240
And they like Chessington had like a log flume, like it had actual water rides.

743
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,320
But this was gentle.

744
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,200
But still like it had atmosphere, which I guess most Chessington rides had less.

745
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,600
Most Chessington rides were pretty basic, I feel like.

746
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
And like, you know, maybe they had a little color.

747
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,000
They had like some cute theming or whatever.

748
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,520
But like this was like this was something where there had been actual thought invested

749
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
in like the progression of it.

750
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,360
And it always felt very satisfying at the end when you went through the whole strobe universe.

751
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,440
It sounds great.

752
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,760
I was going to say it is like, I mean, probably the base, you know, on the Wonka

753
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,040
Willy Wonka scene where they go through the boat and it's like an acid trip.

754
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:20,000
It feels like even like teenage even like jaded teens would be like, man, it's like being on drugs.

755
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,400
Yes.

756
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,280
Like it's crazy.

757
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,520
Yes.

758
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,400
So like that feels like for teens, that might have been the appeal because it would it would like

759
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,040
look from watching the video, I feel like, you know, it messes with you a little bit.

760
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,720
I think that's right.

761
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,080
Now, that's exactly it.

762
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,920
As a teen, you could still argue like, well, it's trippy.

763
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,200
Like, so that's cool.

764
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,520
Yeah.

765
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,960
That was kind of the way you could get into a pretend tub for Professor Burps Bubbleworks

766
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,480
and not feel like a like a fool.

767
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920
Like, you know, you'd be like, no, we got it.

768
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,040
We actually got to do that.

769
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,920
And the other fun is I remember it's right next to the vampire, which is one of their rides that I

770
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,880
think is still going.

771
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,600
And so the vampire would always be going right by you as you were in line.

772
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,720
So there was it was like and there's a lot of trees around.

773
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,000
I just remember it being the best area of the park in terms of you feeling like you're in an

774
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
actual little universe.

775
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,400
Maybe the most themes, maybe the most like Disney universal caliber little zone they had.

776
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,880
Yeah, I think this this thing looks so delightful.

777
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,040
I think it has the the spirit of Willy Wonka without being a ripoff of Willy Wonka.

778
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,000
Is it's it's I mean, certainly inspired by that, but very much its own little universe.

779
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,160
Some some details I wanted to point out that I like you see a lot of posters of different

780
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,720
experimental types of soda that Professor Burp is working on, such as Luminous Pop,

781
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,920
the bedtime drink.

782
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,040
It I think I think it says under that somewhere it glows so you can read with it.

783
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,880
So if you if you're drinking the soda in the dark, it is also a nightlight.

784
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,560
That's great.

785
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,480
I don't there's something I don't have any further details about it, but something called

786
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,600
jackpot juice.

787
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,680
I assume there was some money going on there, right?

788
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,800
Like there's a well, yeah, Professor Burp got bought out.

789
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,000
His contract got bought out by the Jones Soda Company with all their wacky flavors.

790
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,520
They outbid Chesington.

791
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,720
They sort of generic genericified his operation.

792
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,240
Not sure if Jones kept the juice jacuzzi.

793
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,840
There was like a tickle thing.

794
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
I remember like I guess that's to test.

795
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,440
Lickle test.

796
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,600
If the if the bubbles are tickling you and I don't I don't know.

797
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:43,200
Like they found every angle on this that they possibly could, which it's so specific.

798
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,680
A soda.

799
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,160
So like how do you think of, you know, dozens of jokes about weird sodas?

800
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,640
Right.

801
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,400
And they did pull it off.

802
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,960
I want to talk about the soda.

803
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,400
They did pull it off.

804
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,920
I want to talk about a guy who I think is the main person behind this ride,

805
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
a guy named John Wardley.

806
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,760
I found an interview.

807
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,800
He I think did a lot of the rides that I found so charming.

808
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,000
The dark ride kind of things and a lot of stuff at Alton Towers too.

809
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,480
I found an interview with him where he's on the ride and kind of pointing out stuff.

810
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,240
He explains the impetus of it, which was he thought about doing a ride about a brewery,

811
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,920
seeing how beer gets made, but you can't really do that with kids.

812
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
So this became a soda factory.

813
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,680
And then he does a little part of this.

814
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
I think will be better coming from him.

815
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,280
I'm going to screen share here.

816
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,360
And this is him talking about a part of the ride that I think is is very fun.

817
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,840
And here's John Wardley.

818
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,800
When we were considering the actual processes of testing the pop over there,

819
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,280
that is the far tester that tests the fart ability of the pop.

820
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,120
Now, we actually had a board meeting to discuss whether we could use the word far.

821
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,040
That was a good one.

822
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,760
That's that pretty much with the hard egg, a bad egg.

823
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,640
I'm looking at the the fart meter here.

824
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,040
There's a man in a little chair who, I guess,

825
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,120
farts in the chair and it propels him up like a carnival game,

826
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,680
like a ring the buzzer carnival game.

827
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
And he hits different levels of fart ability.

828
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,720
Wait, if I move the play, a whiffy is one level of fart ability.

829
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,800
Whoop, whoopie, whoops.

830
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,760
I think it says bad egg Heinz 57.

831
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,000
Sure.

832
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,080
What is that?

833
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,200
Oh, I see.

834
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,840
Oh, yeah.

835
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,040
Why Heinz?

836
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,920
OK, OK.

837
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,720
He's a British.

838
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,160
He's a big beans.

839
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,320
Right.

840
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,080
They love it.

841
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Oh, I get it now.

842
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,200
I can't see what that top one something about splitter.

843
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,720
But I don't know what it's pants.

844
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
Pants, splitter, splitter.

845
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,200
Yeah, that's great.

846
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,360
The big like fart joke zone of this ride and this like I love this stuffy guy.

847
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,160
Like we talked about if we can actually use the word thought

848
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,400
and more painting, apparently.

849
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
A board meeting about British words.

850
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,160
How delightful.

851
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,840
Yeah, this thing is so fun.

852
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,560
And then what happened with it is that they kept the same ride,

853
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,280
but they kind of couldn't keep it going unless there was a sponsor.

854
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,360
Thus, it became a different ride, still a bubble oriented place,

855
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,400
so still a bubble works, but now called Imperial Leather Bubble Works,

856
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,240
which is a phrase that makes no sense to me.

857
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,600
But I guess you would know that that's a variety of soap.

858
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
It's like a big soap brand in Britain.

859
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,720
All these British companies, like they were formed in the Victorian era,

860
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,200
so they all sound like incredibly fancy.

861
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,880
Imperial Leather is just like, I don't know, it's like Dove.

862
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,400
What's like a common soap here?

863
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,680
It's just a regular old soap.

864
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,120
Yeah, but dressed up with you put Grand and

865
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,720
the old and Victorian in the title, then it seems like something.

866
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,920
But so they redid it as now a tour of a soap factory,

867
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,320
which people did not like as it was just like a big ad for this brand of soap.

868
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,600
I saw it referred to as monotonous,

869
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,760
charmless and at best a highly irritating advert for its sponsor.

870
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,000
And among the people who hated it was this guy, John Wardley,

871
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,960
who really like disowned the ride, was so disgusted by what they did with it

872
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,480
and spoke publicly about how they removed all of the charm.

873
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,320
Mike and Jason, this is a syndrome we've seen before.

874
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,840
The creator of the ride being publicly disparaging of the bad redo of it.

875
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,560
This is so much like Tony Baxter.

876
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
David, we really revere this one Imagineer who's behind

877
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,280
Splash Mountain and Star Tours and all this great stuff.

878
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,960
I was thinking that anyway, and then the season pass podcast,

879
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,440
I think had this guy in the show and they referred to him as the Tony Baxter of Britain.

880
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,280
And the ride itself is very like Journey into Imagination trippy.

881
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,080
A lot of fun stuff going on.

882
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,000
It is very similar.

883
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,240
Like it's exactly the same story really for what happened to those two rides.

884
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,360
And stripping it in stripping the ride of its wonderful main character,

885
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,760
in one case figments the dragon and another case, Professor Burp.

886
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,080
Professor Burp, which we love him now.

887
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,520
And again, is he available?

888
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,160
Can we now access him and make IP movie and TV shows with him?

889
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,440
We would like to investigate that.

890
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,520
Have we seen that he is now there is a Chessington cinematic universe.

891
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,200
Mm hmm.

892
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,240
He's connected to character on another ride.

893
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,640
Really?

894
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,920
Well, wait, I haven't got.

895
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,560
Oh, I like that.

896
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,720
So let me hear.

897
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,280
I have it here.

898
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,080
There's a character named Zappo Matic.

899
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,800
Did you see him?

900
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,760
Did you find him?

901
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,560
Yes.

902
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,440
And this is this is on the ride, the fifth dimension.

903
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:13,680
Right.

904
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,600
Which is rethemed to Terror Tomb.

905
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,600
So this says, although they only got to know each other for three years,

906
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,880
Burp and Zappa Matic were incredibly close friends.

907
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,720
Zap was his first friend.

908
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,640
And they regularly regularly met up every month after the incredible

909
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,040
rethemed of the fifth dimension to Terror Tomb.

910
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,280
Zappa Matic mysteriously disappeared under strange circumstances

911
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,840
in which he left the professor distraught and upset.

912
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,400
And I have a picture of his tombstone.

913
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,800
They canonically killed Zappo Matic.

914
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,240
Yes, I have it right here.

915
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,760
This is a fun robot character from a dark ride who they have murdered.

916
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,600
They have murdered the character because of a retheme here.

917
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,320
I'll just quickly.

918
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,000
I was just about to say this all has a happy ending,

919
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,120
but I guess it's a lot more complicated than that.

920
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,760
What?

921
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,360
Zappo Matic's grave.

922
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,880
Oh, that epitaph is like poochy.

923
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,320
Sadly, left this world for another dimension.

924
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,320
Oh, no.

925
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,360
Geez.

926
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,680
I guess maybe he survived.

927
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,520
Maybe they're trying to soften the blow for kids.

928
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,120
He went to another dimension, guys.

929
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,600
Don't worry.

930
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,160
It's all right.

931
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,200
You know, he's not dead.

932
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,960
I would argue that the headstone, though, is a bit traumatic.

933
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,280
It is.

934
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,600
Yeah, that was definitely Terror Tomb when I was attending Chessington.

935
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,560
That's what I remember.

936
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,120
Terror Tomb.

937
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,480
That was like a laser gun shooting at targets at a ride.

938
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,400
Yes.

939
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,080
Yeah, that's kind of Egyptian themed.

940
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,600
Now, OK, now there's two.

941
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,200
There were two versions of this ride.

942
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, they became a shooting ride, but there was a version that was not

943
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,040
shooting oriented thing.

944
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,240
Were you ever there when there was a character named Abdub?

945
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,760
Remind me of Abdub's role in Chessington.

946
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,840
OK, so in Terror Tomb, I'll read a description.

947
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:29,600
I copy pasted a harrowing journey through the booby trap filled catacombs with Abdub,

948
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,000
a greedy tomb robber bent on stealing a priceless emerald.

949
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,880
So you're taking a tour of a tomb, but there's this guy who keeps yelling at you

950
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,120
because he wants this emerald to himself.

951
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,880
Sounds like the British.

952
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,520
So he's kind of like trapped there.

953
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,520
It sounds like essentially he's like constantly looking for this emerald.

954
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,920
Yeah, essentially.

955
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,480
Well, and ends up truly trapped.

956
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,640
Mike and Jason, did you catch this ride or watch a video of it or anything?

957
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,920
I actually didn't watch a video.

958
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,640
I didn't know.

959
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,040
This is so great.

960
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,000
I think one of my favorite moments, honestly, in a ride that I've ever seen,

961
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,280
and I'll show it to you guys, that's build it up too much.

962
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,880
But so you're going through this.

963
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,600
You're going through this too.

964
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,240
Abdub is just a crazy creepy animatronic that people on YouTube have bought

965
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,160
and are trying to like people are like resuscitating Abdub with,

966
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,080
you know, like toss together electronics in their apartments,

967
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,880
which is very creepy and odd.

968
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,680
And you can watch that.

969
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,640
But, you know, the fun effects through this ride,

970
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,440
there's like an ever flowing amount of snakes in this one part.

971
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,720
Like it's like a spinning wheel that's covered in snakes

972
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,560
that just goes in an infinite loop.

973
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,960
So it looks like thousands of snakes are pouring out,

974
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,320
but it doesn't stop Abdub.

975
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,600
He's still after the emerald.

976
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,680
You see a big like statue of a Anubis.

977
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,960
It has big scary heads and vortex tunnels.

978
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,200
There might even be a boulder like Indiana Jones.

979
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,920
It's all a pretty like serious, scary ride.

980
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,440
And then you get to you're getting towards the end of this thing.

981
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,600
And there's a lot of heads all in canting something.

982
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,080
And then I will play what happens from that point.

983
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,880
And this will we'll have to back up and explain it to the listener.

984
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,520
But this will be, you know, probably more fun to experience visually.

985
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,400
But check out what happens to Abdub at the end of this attraction.

986
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,880
Scary heads.

987
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:53,760
Let me pause and say there is now a mummy playing guitar.

988
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,480
Oh, my God.

989
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,600
He has a light up headdress or collar or whatever you want to call it.

990
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,400
I'll play it for there.

991
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,600
Oh,

992
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,760
I mean, that's great.

993
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,640
That's fantastic.

994
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,200
Really good.

995
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah.

996
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,240
Yeah.

997
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,280
The way he yells cool is fantastic.

998
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,120
Now you've done become a cool.

999
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,800
This rules.

1000
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,600
This is unbelievable.

1001
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:52,800
You get a rock concert at the end of this ride and poor Abdub stuck in a what you think is a tomb.

1002
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,440
But then the lid raises up and it's covered in spikes and he gets locked in it.

1003
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,080
And what that is is an iron maiden.

1004
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,000
The metal music that we are hearing of Abdub is impaled to death.

1005
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,200
And I it's like, again, multiple characters in Chessington die.

1006
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,280
This rocks more than anything at Hard Rock Park.

1007
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,920
Yeah, I'd have to say so.

1008
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,400
Yes.

1009
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,720
That legitimately is that the most actually rocking song made for a theme park attraction.

1010
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,800
For yes, specifically park specific.

1011
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,040
I'll say right now.

1012
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,360
Yes.

1013
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,680
But I bet you're hedging your bets because you don't want to put it above Aerosmith.

1014
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,920
Well, of course, Aerosmith's changing the lyrics slightly to love in an elevator to

1015
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,440
love and roller coaster and kind of counts as an original song to me.

1016
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,000
Sure.

1017
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,760
So I don't want to fully knock it out, but they're tied.

1018
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,960
Let's say they're tied.

1019
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,360
Yeah.

1020
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:53,600
Yeah.

1021
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,840
So yeah, this is cool.

1022
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,640
Going to spike your brain, going to spit your soul.

1023
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,720
You'll be a slave under my control.

1024
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,000
Dark stuff.

1025
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,400
Genuinely dark road.

1026
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:07,440
Wow.

1027
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,280
You know what?

1028
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,560
That maybe takes, I don't know, does it beat the Halloween overlay for the Knott's

1029
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,360
log flume ride with the alien band at the end?

1030
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,320
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,680
That is really fantastic.

1032
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,400
That's really fun.

1033
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,680
There's a specific Halloween song from the Timber Mountain log ride around Halloween time.

1034
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,200
And they're playing like a really jaunty, fun Halloween song.

1035
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,120
And it's like a bear and an alien.

1036
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,040
And I think the bear turns you and goes trick or treat.

1037
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,880
Yes, he does.

1038
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,680
He sure does.

1039
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,960
It's like one of the greatest moments in theme park history.

1040
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,920
So with these being so awesome, why aren't there more just creatures playing guitars

1041
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,000
all over theme park worlds?

1042
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,040
This rules.

1043
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,760
It's so good.

1044
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,360
Yeah, I think.

1045
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:53,600
Yeah.

1046
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:54,880
Oh, yeah.

1047
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,800
Where would be just a brainstorm?

1048
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,240
What would be the best ride to just throw a bunch of guitars on the animals or the robots?

1049
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,600
Maybe.

1050
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,640
I mean, obviously Princess and the Frog coming to Splash Mountain.

1051
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,160
But if you give a guitar to all the animals on the riverboat at the end of Splash Mountain

1052
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,600
and they were all just soloing, that would be pretty cool.

1053
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,560
I mean, rock and haunted mansion would be great.

1054
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,160
That'd be a nice new overlay.

1055
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,560
Just all of them shredding just 300 ghosts.

1056
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,400
999 happy haunts and they can all shred.

1057
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,760
They can all shred.

1058
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,000
You could give a big guitar to the man or the creature who replaced

1059
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,040
the Imperial Leather Bubbleworks, the Gruffalo.

1060
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,520
That's right.

1061
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,600
He's that would be fairly metal.

1062
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,640
The Gruffalo, right?

1063
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,440
I don't know.

1064
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,120
Yeah, the Gruffalo is cool.

1065
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,320
I like the Gruffalo.

1066
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,400
We zoom fast that which is your background, David.

1067
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,160
That's what this ride is now, the Gruffalo.

1068
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,840
Yeah, it seems which I have not been on the Gruffalo River Ride Adventure,

1069
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,520
which is what Bubbleworks is now.

1070
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,360
But that seems better to me than just like SponCon, right?

1071
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,760
I'm sure that's a little more thematically whole.

1072
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,040
It looks very charming.

1073
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,200
The Gruffalo book was published in the late 90s and it kind of has a...

1074
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,000
Oh, God, who's the Where the Wild Things Are guy?

1075
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,560
Maurice Sendak.

1076
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:18,800
Yes.

1077
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,360
Yeah, Maurice.

1078
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,440
It has a sort of whimsical animation style like that.

1079
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,080
And I thought this, I couldn't believe, oh, this is very charming too.

1080
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,240
Like, we don't have...

1081
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,320
That was the happy ending I was alluding to.

1082
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,360
Like, well, if they redid Journey into Imagination and replaced it with something,

1083
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,040
like in the way they replaced Bubbleworks with the Gruffalo River Ride Adventure,

1084
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,640
it's like, well, that's nice.

1085
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,520
This looks nice.

1086
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,600
It's maybe not as weird as the original one, but it's like, well, this seems charming.

1087
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,040
Yeah, yeah, and better than a soap ad, I'd say.

1088
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,840
Yes.

1089
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,560
Yeah, for sure.

1090
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm reading, like, you know, it has less animations and props,

1091
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
so there's some sort of consternation about that.

1092
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,800
I think it's a lot more screens, right, which is a little less...

1093
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,480
Whatever.

1094
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,320
Unique, but that's fine.

1095
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:11,760
But apparently there are smell pods to make it smell foresty, which that sounds cool.

1096
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:13,840
Sounds nice.

1097
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,800
That's one of the drawbacks, obviously, because we haven't been there.

1098
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,320
Does that forest smell like the ET forest in Orlando?

1099
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,560
Other famous forest fake smells.

1100
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,320
We did a fake smell Final Four where we argued which was the best smell.

1101
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,160
So I would like to...

1102
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:36,080
When we eventually revisit that, I would like to have experienced the smell at this park,

1103
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,760
just to make sure we didn't overlook it.

1104
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,040
Do you remember smells in the soda factory?

1105
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,880
I think there might have been like orange, one of the classic theme park smells.

1106
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,560
Right, there was definitely lots of smells.

1107
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,400
It also, like, you know, if it was a hot day, like it was like kind of just...

1108
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
It was like cool and misty.

1109
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,520
But yes, I remember all smells like that.

1110
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,160
And like, I guess just also, you know, the joy of being in water.

1111
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,240
Like it was always like a nice sort of chilled out thing that you should do

1112
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,760
right in the middle of your visit, right?

1113
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,160
Like to kind of like, you know, reset a little bit.

1114
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:11,920
Sure, sure.

1115
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,880
That's a good thing to ask if I was like,

1116
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,160
do you remember anything else, atmosphereically, about this place?

1117
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,760
Is there anything like non-ride that jumps out at you or...

1118
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,400
Do you remember like, is food any good to this place?

1119
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,360
The food is bad.

1120
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,240
I mean, British fast food is fairly underwhelming.

1121
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,280
Like it's gotten better as it gets more Americanized,

1122
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,360
but that's like, which is not a particularly charming thing.

1123
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,280
Like, you know, what Britain has to offer on the fast food front is fish and chips.

1124
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,040
That's always been like, that's like the classic British fast food,

1125
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,440
like fish and chips in a newspaper or whatever.

1126
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,560
But I remember like the food being like, you know,

1127
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,280
totally ordinary kind of like chicken fingers, right?

1128
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,560
Like, you know, all that kind of stuff.

1129
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,760
And the, I'm now trying to find a map, like in the sort of like,

1130
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,720
it was a slightly subdivided world and it had,

1131
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,680
well, I'm sure we'll talk about Beano land.

1132
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,280
I was just going to bring up Beano land.

1133
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:13,920
Yes.

1134
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,800
But like, you know, it was, it's more like a six flags where it's like,

1135
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,240
the sun's kind of beating down on you if you're there in the summertime,

1136
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,440
which you probably are like, there's not a lot of shelter

1137
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,840
and there is a cool little monorail thing like that.

1138
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,000
You could sort of take around to look at stuff and there is a zoo,

1139
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,400
but I remember the zoo being sort of a bummer again, much like six flags.

1140
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,880
Like you don't really want to go to the zoo when you're at a theme park.

1141
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,900
Yeah.

1142
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,680
Do you have any memories of like just weird childhood stuff,

1143
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,200
like drama between friends that would happen there?

1144
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,760
Because I feel like that was always kind of a pressure cooker when you'd go

1145
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,320
with your friends to a place like that for a long time.

1146
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,400
It's what I, that is what I associate with theme parks is going with my friends

1147
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,320
and then the weird, it's like how now everyone has to negotiate their personal

1148
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,720
comfort with the pandemic where it's like, some people are like,

1149
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm not going outside at all.

1150
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,880
And other people are like, well, I wanted to go to a restaurant.

1151
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,680
And like, there's all the weird arguments within that, you know, like,

1152
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,360
you know, it's like, some kids just want to like ride the gnarly rides over and

1153
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,240
over and over again.

1154
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,360
And like, I feel like I was more of a wanderer.

1155
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,920
I liked kind of the weird freedom you have as a teenager in a theme park

1156
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,840
where you can kind of like, you know, act independently and like, you know,

1157
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,400
I'm going to go get some food and like march off by yourself.

1158
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,680
And like, that's all I remember about going to Chessington is like everyone

1159
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,000
fighting over the order of the day and how, how like, you know, we have to

1160
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,440
prioritize the vampire over the rattlesnake or whatever, you know, like

1161
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,800
the weird kind of it's like, it's like a little fake town.

1162
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,680
It's like a little fake life for you to live as a teenager, right?

1163
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,880
Like you get to pretend to be a little grown up for, for an afternoon.

1164
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,240
Now, see, I, I mostly went to theme parks with my family and everyone

1165
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,240
knew what everyone else liked.

1166
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,480
We were all very cordial about it.

1167
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,680
If me or my brother wanted to do different stuff, usually one parent

1168
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,240
would take one.

1169
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,440
One would take the other.

1170
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,920
So the one or two times I went to a theme park on a school trip, I just

1171
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,800
remember going like, you're all insane.

1172
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,280
There's an efficient way to do this, to make everyone happy.

1173
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,680
And I was immediately, I'm like, you know what?

1174
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,440
I'm just going to go off on my own because everyone's being really weird

1175
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,080
in this heat.

1176
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,440
Jason, was it just that they weren't catering to your every whim?

1177
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,640
Well, it wasn't catering to my every whim.

1178
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,560
I was just like, well, guys, this, it was things like, well, this has a

1179
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,560
shorter weight and that has a longer, why don't we do the shorter weight one

1180
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:54,640
for, and, and trying to convince like six or seven year olds.

1181
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,920
It's like, well, no, when then we'd have to double bat, not six, six or seven.

1182
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,320
I was going to say you're going there by yourself at six.

1183
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,680
Like trying to convince like, well, no, if we do this for it, we're going

1184
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,560
to have to double back.

1185
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,360
That doesn't make sense.

1186
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,960
We're going to be crisscrossing the whole thing.

1187
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,000
We only have six hours, you know.

1188
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,280
You just unlocked a memory for me, which is taking like, it was some like we

1189
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,440
won a, the classroom won a contest or something and got to go to Disneyland.

1190
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,680
My dream, that's great.

1191
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,840
But then we get there and it's like a six hour thing.

1192
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,320
It's pretty short, not nearly enough time for me.

1193
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,920
And I swear the gen, the consensus of the class of, of 11 year olds or

1194
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,600
whatever was we got to spend like an hour and a half of this in the starcade.

1195
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,160
You're fucking kidding me.

1196
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,760
How dare you do this to me?

1197
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,520
I'm like remembering the faces of the kids now who were like, no, I want to

1198
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,440
be in the arcade all day.

1199
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,800
I think I snuck away.

1200
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,040
I think I like left the chaperone so I could go on the people mover.

1201
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,920
I was so

1202
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,400
worried.

1203
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,040
God.

1204
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,360
Yeah.

1205
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,720
I was not supposed to be on my own, but I'm like, well, I'm going to go do

1206
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,720
the monorail at Hershey park and I'm going to get a chili dog and then I'm

1207
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,560
going to ride the super duper looper.

1208
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,480
And we broke protocol.

1209
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,240
We like disobeyed adults for the, we were bad kids in a way for the first time at

1210
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:12,640
theme parks.

1211
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,600
You know what you were doing?

1212
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,600
Like you were, you were being a little grownup.

1213
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,720
That's how I was too.

1214
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,440
It's like, you're like, guys, let's be efficient about that.

1215
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,120
Exactly how I was.

1216
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,960
Whereas I feel like some kids, you know, it's, it's like candy.

1217
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,360
They're like, I have to do the best thing first.

1218
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,560
We have to do it right now.

1219
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,480
Like, I don't care how long it takes, which I, when I was in it for the long

1220
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,000
haul, I have the long game in mind.

1221
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,240
Yes.

1222
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,480
Yes.

1223
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,600
What year, Scott, what year was it?

1224
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,880
What was there a hot arcade game that year that like was mortal?

1225
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,800
They didn't have mortal combat in Disneyland.

1226
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,360
Did they?

1227
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,040
That doesn't seem right.

1228
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,680
God, I don't know.

1229
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,560
Was it just a word where people just cruise in USA?

1230
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,320
Where was it just a cruise in USA?

1231
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,120
I, I specifically, I think it was like 96 or 97 because I remember all of

1232
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,120
Tomorrowland was construction walls because they were like all it was like

1233
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,800
nothing but plywood.

1234
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,120
It was very depressing, honestly, around and they had just closed EO, which made

1235
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,040
me think about all the weirdness with that.

1236
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,480
It was just very, very sad time to be there.

1237
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,520
And I was made more sad by all these arcades.

1238
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,000
I think I maybe said out loud, you have arcades at home.

1239
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,920
You can go to arcade anytime.

1240
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,040
I could go to the arcade like, yeah, it was an arcade like 10 minutes from my

1241
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,360
house.

1242
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,400
Who cares about arcades?

1243
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,000
I can play Street Fighter whenever.

1244
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,360
We see each other every day at school.

1245
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,120
We hang out on the weekends.

1246
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,680
We're at Hershey Park like once or twice a year.

1247
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,240
Fry are let's get our priorities in order, folks.

1248
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,200
I'm going to be angry about this decades from now.

1249
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:40,480
Yeah.

1250
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,520
Anyway, this is why all the media you consume, ladies and gentlemen, is so weird

1251
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,360
because it's all made by weirdos like us.

1252
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,920
Odd angers that we hold on to.

1253
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,280
I actually you know what?

1254
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,000
What is also maybe this is fine in terms of remembering, like pulling out specific

1255
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,720
memories.

1256
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,080
I found a from a website called Surrey Live.

1257
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:14,160
I found a fairly spelling and grammatically questionable listicle called

1258
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,320
15 things you'd remember if you if you I don't have in front of me, if you grew up

1259
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,240
going to Chessington.

1260
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,280
I didn't write down all of them, but I'm curious to throw these out and see if

1261
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,000
you agree.

1262
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,800
Of course, you did.

1263
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,360
Do you have memories of these things?

1264
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,680
Feeling really queasy after going on Ramsey's Revenge 20 times in a row.

1265
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,040
Yes, I certainly never went on Ramsey's Revenge 20 times in a row because that's

1266
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,000
an awful idea.

1267
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,040
But that was the hottest ride when I was a kid.

1268
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,680
That was what the advertisements led with.

1269
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,880
I don't know if you guys saw it, but it's sort of like, you know, it's like

1270
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,280
spinning.

1271
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,000
You're in a thing.

1272
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,880
You're spinning you.

1273
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,520
And then there's a bigger arm that's also spinning you.

1274
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,040
And there's water.

1275
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,200
I'm bad at theme park lingo.

1276
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:01,680
I assume there's like a word for the kind of a ride Ramsey's Revenge is.

1277
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,320
I think.

1278
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,280
Does it still exist?

1279
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,440
I was trying to remember.

1280
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,400
I don't think I have the terminology either, but yeah, you're like it.

1281
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,800
They call it a top spin ride on there.

1282
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,360
There you go.

1283
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,080
Whatever that means.

1284
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,800
That's the kind of thing we should have more at our disposal.

1285
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,080
And yet I don't.

1286
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,360
It's fine.

1287
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,000
Nobody's.

1288
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,480
It's a glorified flat ride.

1289
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,120
It's glorified kind of carnival ride with a few effects.

1290
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:25,360
Right.

1291
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:25,920
Exactly.

1292
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,760
And it was kind of dressed up in because I believe that's also where the Tomb Blaster

1293
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,360
and the Rockin' Mummies were.

1294
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,680
There was a whole kind of ancient Forbidden Kingdom zone.

1295
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,760
You know, like and Ramsey's Revenge was that's like the barf ride.

1296
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,920
That was the ride that made you barf and directly opposite it was a ride called

1297
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:54,000
the Magic Carpet that even when I was a kid, it doesn't exist anymore, was so obviously

1298
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,200
wildly unsafe.

1299
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:02,240
We would look at it as kids and we'd be like, I don't think that anyone should be getting

1300
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:02,880
in that thing.

1301
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,840
And then they closed it kind of quietly.

1302
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,160
Oh, no.

1303
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,000
I don't think anyone got on it, but it was just one of those very old fashioned.

1304
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,840
It would just go round and round and round and then stop and smash your face into a bar.

1305
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,880
Like it was it was just it was no fun.

1306
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,880
It was like a ride because like I always forget the one at Knotts that they closed down where

1307
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,560
you went on it and you were like, this hurts.

1308
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,080
It was like why?

1309
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:29,760
Yes.

1310
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,000
Yes.

1311
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:30,960
Yeah.

1312
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,920
This isn't pain.

1313
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,120
This isn't something that would last, but you know, maybe for a little while.

1314
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,280
The tense in this article, again, very strange.

1315
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:50,320
You spent the rest of the day walking around with a wet bum after going on the Dragon

1316
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,440
Falls ride.

1317
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,040
Sound familiar?

1318
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,720
Any wet bums?

1319
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,520
Oh, a wet one.

1320
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:55,840
When?

1321
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,800
Oh, yes.

1322
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,120
Yeah.

1323
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:57,440
Yes.

1324
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,760
To be British about I'm sure you say bum.

1325
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:02,320
You do.

1326
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,200
All the way.

1327
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,240
We've been saying seat.

1328
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,440
We should be we should change the lingo for this episode.

1329
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:09,760
Bum play.

1330
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,320
Yes.

1331
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,280
I mean, sure.

1332
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,560
The dragon with the dragon's fury.

1333
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,680
Now I'm trying to remember what it was called.

1334
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,720
The Dragon Falls.

1335
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:18,960
Right.

1336
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,440
That was it.

1337
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,760
That was the log plume.

1338
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,640
You have to do that late because otherwise you will be wet all day.

1339
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,680
But I mean, Jason, how do you feel about a wet bum?

1340
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,160
You like wet feet.

1341
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,480
I know that you wet socks.

1342
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,120
You like that.

1343
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,520
I think I think, yeah, I think a wet bum is more uncomfortable.

1344
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,880
I think that might be worse to me.

1345
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,200
Yeah.

1346
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,320
Is there any reason why anyone would like that?

1347
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,440
I specifically like a sopping wet bum.

1348
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,040
Sex stuff, I guess.

1349
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,920
You know.

1350
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,200
What was that, Jason?

1351
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,400
I said sex stuff.

1352
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,600
You know, probably is probably someone out there.

1353
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,640
Everything's a thing.

1354
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,840
Everybody's into something.

1355
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,840
I'm open to it now that I'm so free with my body and mind.

1356
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,960
So I'm I'm I'm open to the idea of it.

1357
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,760
I just haven't I haven't experienced it and liked it yet.

1358
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:16,240
Mike's Mike's got a big wrench just opening up the fire hydrant on his street

1359
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,600
and taking a step in front of it.

1360
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,360
Shaking.

1361
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:21,680
Yeah.

1362
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,360
Shaking my butt at a fire hydrant that's open on the street.

1363
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,160
Getting launched a few feet to get a wet bum.

1364
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,520
Worth it as far as I'm concerned.

1365
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:31,920
Sure.

1366
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,840
As mothers and children stare and point and you say you wouldn't get it, it's a European thing.

1367
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,920
I've I've grown as a person.

1368
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,840
One more of these.

1369
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,600
This seems obscure.

1370
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,760
I'm curious if you this seems very obscure.

1371
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,920
The chewing gum tree in the vampire ride queue.

1372
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,280
That feels like something too deep to remember.

1373
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,120
I do like I remember that.

1374
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,000
I do remember the vampire, which I definitely rode.

1375
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,560
And that was always next to the bubble works.

1376
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,200
And it was it was you know, your feet are dangling.

1377
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,000
One of those which at the time was still a novelty.

1378
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,960
I know that's like run of the mill now.

1379
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,000
I do not remember chewing gum tree.

1380
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,880
Don't really know what that would have to do with a vampire.

1381
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,040
That whole area was called Transylvania.

1382
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,240
It was sort of odd that bubble works was there because bubble works didn't have anything to do

1383
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,120
with Transylvania.

1384
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,280
But for whatever reason that they were next to each other and

1385
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,000
Chessington was like it's Transylvania the vampire.

1386
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:38,000
So I remember, you know, some, you know, some crosses, right?

1387
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,720
Like, you know, some like some gravestones maybe maybe that's where they buried the alien guy.

1388
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,960
But I do not remember.

1389
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,440
Oh, yes.

1390
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,080
So could be.

1391
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:46,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1392
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,160
It's a robot buried in a vampire cemetery.

1393
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,960
There is a I think the tree was just used like people just put gum in this one place all the time,

1394
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,840
which is disgusting.

1395
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,720
And why?

1396
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,880
And why would you put more gum there and touch other gum as you do so bad?

1397
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,360
But anyway, there's also I think that area also has something called I noticed on a map

1398
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,040
Vampires Burger Kitchen.

1399
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,600
Pretty good restaurant name.

1400
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,800
I dig that, which is listed as being on Leatherhead Road.

1401
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,960
Hey, good name.

1402
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,680
And Counts Cauldron, maybe two men.

1403
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,640
I like all these.

1404
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,480
But where do we head from here?

1405
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,480
Maybe over to maybe over to Beano land.

1406
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,960
Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to ask, did everyone see a video of Zapomatic?

1407
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,320
Oh, yes.

1408
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,840
Yeah, I did.

1409
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,200
I have something queued up.

1410
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,720
Were you going to bring up something specific?

1411
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,480
OK, well, I just it's just a video.

1412
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,440
He's terrified.

1413
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,880
He's so terrifying.

1414
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,040
Is the video what you're showing?

1415
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,720
Yeah, I believe.

1416
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,200
Yeah, he'll be on frame here in a set.

1417
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,080
How do we describe?

1418
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah, what does Zapomatic look like?

1419
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,320
He reminds me and it's not quite right, but he reminds me of like

1420
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,360
a Return to Oz type character.

1421
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,720
He's a little tick tock esque.

1422
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,680
He's taller.

1423
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,960
He is kind of like a what would you call it?

1424
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,160
Some sort of scarf.

1425
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,280
Is it a cravat?

1426
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:19,040
Technically, what English what English neck dressing does Zapomatic wear?

1427
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,040
Yeah, I guess it's a cravat.

1428
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,400
I like a loose fitting tie.

1429
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,640
It looks like basically like a bandana that's not around his face.

1430
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,720
An ascot?

1431
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,320
Yeah, sure.

1432
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,560
I don't know.

1433
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,720
It's funny to think like that when they open this because this was the first edition,

1434
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,120
right?

1435
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,400
The fifth dimension.

1436
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,320
They were obviously like sci fi is the thing.

1437
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,360
We got to have aliens.

1438
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,400
We got to write.

1439
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:52,800
And then they quickly pivoted to like ancient Egypt in the 90s, which is not a pivot.

1440
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:59,040
I would say like you would automatically guess like what was hot in the 90s was like tombs,

1441
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,800
but I guess I guess they were tombs were kind of hot as theme park areas, right?

1442
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,320
Maybe not so much movies, but like that was just kind of a classic theme parky thing,

1443
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,160
like a haunted tomb type.

1444
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,640
It's one of the themes, I suppose.

1445
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,400
It's like, yeah, yeah, you've got, as we said, you got a lot of things are

1446
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,600
London themed and a lot of things are Egypt themed.

1447
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,880
I mean, Chasington is technically themed to like areas of the world.

1448
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,320
There's like an English area and a Mexican Wild West area, Pirates Cove.

1449
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:40,400
Yes, there's unfortunately, they may have changed this, but there was once a Mystic East,

1450
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,000
which I feel like they should probably spruce that up.

1451
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,160
I don't know if there's so many theme parks have weird,

1452
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,920
like East Orient.

1453
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,600
Yeah, those should all start getting dismantled.

1454
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,240
Let me play this quick clip of Zap-o-matic.

1455
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:05,520
This ride, the fifth dimension, this was a dark ride and it was open for about a year

1456
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,640
and then guests started complaining that the plot was too confusing.

1457
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,360
What I'm going to play you is from the second version.

1458
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,560
So this is what this is a little snippet of the less confusing story.

1459
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,120
Let's see if you get the gist of what this ride is from this.

1460
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,760
As I told you, I am Zap-o-matic and I was sent in here to repair this TV.

1461
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,560
But would you believe it?

1462
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,160
There's a gorg in here.

1463
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,280
Horrible creatures, gorgs.

1464
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:45,200
So we got that he's Zap-o-matic is a TV repair robot.

1465
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:51,040
He's now the ride is called the fifth dimension, which so that what that means is going into a TV.

1466
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,640
And of course, yes, your TV contains dimensions.

1467
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,080
But when you know what, there's a gorg.

1468
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,760
And I don't think you get any more info about what a gorg is.

1469
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,600
Horrible creatures, apparently.

1470
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,680
Or they're, yes, you're right, you do.

1471
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,360
You get the info that they're horrible creatures.

1472
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,160
What year, Scott, is the video you just played?

1473
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,040
Does it say?

1474
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:17,760
88.

1475
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,960
OK, because I have I have I was going to play the exact same clip, but a different year.

1476
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,840
And they shoot it like it's a horror movie a little more.

1477
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,360
What? Oh, OK.

1478
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,960
Wait, is that that's a little hype?

1479
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,120
I'll I'll put it up just to show you.

1480
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,280
Yes, I'm hyping it up a little too much.

1481
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,200
But you'll see what I mean when I'm like, especially this made an impression on me.

1482
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,280
As Mike said, it's like this scary return to Oz creature and he's in front of a weird

1483
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:50,000
like a frightening grid, but that's not symmetrical.

1484
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,880
It's all like amorphous and it's it's all it's all very

1485
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,360
it's kind of like Lawn Mower Man a little bit.

1486
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,160
Very long, a lot of green, a lot of laser grids.

1487
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,560
OK, so here are the Bendy grids.

1488
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,080
Audio and audio not as good.

1489
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,480
Jesus.

1490
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,920
It's just so that's why I was really scared of him.

1491
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,240
He's a really zoom in on his creepy eyes.

1492
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,200
That is that is a better video for that angle.

1493
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,320
He's basically a robotic Jack Skellington.

1494
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,640
Right. And only his head is moving really like everything else is pretty limited.

1495
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,800
So it almost seems like he's kind of like stuck or zombified or something.

1496
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,440
Yeah. Tied up or like and in an uncomfortable position.

1497
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,720
Yeah. So it looks like, yeah, he's he's like about to die.

1498
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,560
And only one part of his body is working.

1499
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,320
We don't have to be scared anymore because he is dead.

1500
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,400
Yeah. Oh, you're right.

1501
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,840
He's been killed.

1502
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,360
Why are we upset that he's dead?

1503
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,200
We should be we should be celebrating this.

1504
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,280
You know what? Yeah. Good Zap-O-Matic.

1505
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:06,480
I guess for Dr. Burp, whatever they were friends.

1506
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,400
Professor Burp. I'm so sorry.

1507
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,680
He doesn't deserve to lose a friend.

1508
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,000
Is Zap-O-Matic gone?

1509
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,080
The Gorgs are just going to run rampant.

1510
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,400
They're just going to run rough shot over this place.

1511
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,840
Well, yeah, because he was the one monitoring the situation.

1512
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,080
And here's here's what the plan is.

1513
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,760
This is what you're supposed to how you're supposed to help control the Gorg population.

1514
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,080
It's hiding in one of the five dimensions from the video.

1515
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,720
And it's definitely not in this one.

1516
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,680
At least I don't think it is.

1517
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,800
Now, if you can find the Gorg, I can make a laser gun to destroy it.

1518
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,480
But only you have the power to fire the gun.

1519
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,240
Well, that's settled.

1520
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,080
Then I'll go to the workshop and get busy.

1521
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,360
And I'll leave you to find the Gorg.

1522
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,040
It's out there somewhere.

1523
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,640
Jesus. Whoa, that was a dramatic ending.

1524
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,600
Yeah. Lightning strikes.

1525
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,080
Only you have the power to fire the gun.

1526
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,480
But to create you have to create the gun first.

1527
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,080
I'll build the gun, but only you could fire the gun.

1528
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,120
He's also barely giving you time to respond.

1529
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,800
He's just like, anyway, so you fire the gun.

1530
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,840
Got it. OK.

1531
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,240
Like, you know, there's not a lot of call and response here.

1532
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,240
Are you prepared to fire the gun?

1533
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,720
It's like it's the warning getting on a plane of like, are you ready to

1534
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,440
use the exit row?

1535
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,960
Yeah, people exit.

1536
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,560
All right. Good.

1537
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,360
All right. In case of a crash landing, are you prepared to fire the gun?

1538
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,040
I guess. Wait, guns are involved.

1539
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,080
Yes. Hurry.

1540
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,440
This plane is full of Gorgs.

1541
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,480
Over that endless loop of.

1542
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,240
Is this all like, yeah, heralding.

1543
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,360
In Star Wars, a Gorg is like what they it's like the little

1544
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,360
froggy creatures that Jar Jar eats on Tatooine.

1545
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,000
I remember that.

1546
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,120
That's fun. Right.

1547
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:17,600
I don't know.

1548
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,120
That is fun.

1549
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,720
Could that be the same thing as Gorg found in some sort of myth?

1550
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,440
Yeah, maybe. Right.

1551
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,840
Yeah. Maybe that's where George Lucas got the idea.

1552
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,560
I don't know.

1553
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,600
Do you think there's a lot of children around this time who

1554
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,320
went on this ride, didn't even really perceive it.

1555
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:37,920
And then like to this day, have nightmares where Zapomatic type faces

1556
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,000
appear to them through the clouds and and Gorgs and swamp spines.

1557
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,120
That's another thing that shows up.

1558
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,000
Zapomatic holding like holding a gun out to them and be like,

1559
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,680
you will be the one to fire this.

1560
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,720
You only you.

1561
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,120
You have the power.

1562
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,200
For a queen and country.

1563
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:06,240
But Zapomatic, how do you have the power to build the gun but not to fire it?

1564
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,600
It seems like if we're talking about your hands, because if you

1565
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,920
have hands to build, you have hands to fire.

1566
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,360
I was not programmed to kill.

1567
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,120
Right. There's the Asimov's law of robotics.

1568
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,120
You like means that you have to pull the trigger even though he can make you a gun.

1569
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,720
Only little boys and girls can kill.

1570
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,360
For Albiad, for the king.

1571
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,240
Perhaps you'll develop a taste for it.

1572
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,160
Perhaps this won't be your last kill.

1573
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,960
I'm not encouraging you to do so.

1574
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,840
I never would.

1575
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,080
I'm I'm merely a builder man.

1576
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,720
But if you need more guns, let me know.

1577
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,520
Her Majesty Secret Service is always hiring young children.

1578
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,720
Zapomatic was recruiting for the British government.

1579
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,360
Zapomatic was recruiting for the circus.

1580
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,720
Zapomatic was on Twitch.

1581
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:04,480
He kind of looks like remember when there was that fake meme or fake like sort of scandal about kids

1582
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,320
seeing some video of a creepy demon that was like telling them to do crimes?

1583
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,640
Am I the only person who remembers this?

1584
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:10,720
Yeah.

1585
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,440
That's what he looks like.

1586
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,640
That's familiar.

1587
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:13,760
Yeah.

1588
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:14,560
Now I can't remember.

1589
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:14,800
Yeah.

1590
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,760
Wow. I guess I hate Zapomatic.

1591
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,080
I mean, I didn't you know, it's all it really shows you the power of film.

1592
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:24,880
Momo.

1593
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,120
Right.

1594
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:25,600
There we go.

1595
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:26,880
Momo.

1596
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:26,960
Yeah.

1597
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,480
Momo is a demon telling children to do bad things.

1598
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,960
Momo is not Slenderman.

1599
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,640
Momo is a different demon.

1600
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,400
Telling Momo you will.

1601
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:41,760
It's just there's a vague similarity to Zapomatic just because of the stretched mouth.

1602
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,000
Jesus.

1603
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,360
I'm afraid to see Momo.

1604
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:45,920
Momo is a little.

1605
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,320
Yeah.

1606
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,600
So I know Momo.

1607
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,000
Of course.

1608
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:57,440
Momo is like a frightening cartoon version of Shelly Duvall in The Shining.

1609
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,800
I was going to say it shows you the power of filmmaking because I didn't hate Zapomatic

1610
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,560
until I saw Mike's angle where it zooms all the way in.

1611
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,640
And that close up now is very scarring.

1612
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,600
And yes, I'd have to agree.

1613
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,640
I hate Zapomatic.

1614
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,360
But again, he's dead.

1615
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:17,840
Yes.

1616
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,360
Thank God.

1617
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,280
Now I'm not upset by that.

1618
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,960
And yeah.

1619
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,520
Hey, kids out there, if you have nightly nightmares about Zapomatic.

1620
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,560
What he forces you to do.

1621
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:32,880
Yeah.

1622
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,160
Now at Chessington, they just have nice stuff like Elmer's flying jumbos.

1623
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,320
Everyone's favorite patchwork elephant.

1624
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,280
Right.

1625
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,840
We all know Elmer the Patchwork Elephant.

1626
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,440
Jumbos.

1627
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:46,720
Elmer.

1628
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,120
Is it?

1629
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,600
Do we like Elmer's better than Babar?

1630
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,120
Probably is less like colonial overtones, right?

1631
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:53,600
I don't know.

1632
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,440
Yeah.

1633
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:55,760
OK.

1634
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:03,520
Elmer just kind of looks like a heffalumper woozo.

1635
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:03,840
Right.

1636
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,160
OK.

1637
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,320
A quilting beast.

1638
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:11,440
Is there any Babar representation in theme parks?

1639
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,480
Do we know off the top of our heads?

1640
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,040
Is there like a...

1641
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,920
I think there might be like a French one, maybe.

1642
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,320
I don't know.

1643
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,280
No, I don't think so.

1644
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,800
And here's an article from 1989 that says plans are underway for a Babar theme park.

1645
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,200
But obviously that did not occur.

1646
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,440
And also, where is the representation of Muzzy?

1647
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:39,360
The language teaching monster from it was ubiquitous on Nickelodeon for so many years.

1648
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:40,960
Where's Muzzy?

1649
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,520
Yeah.

1650
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:41,920
Muzzy.

1651
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:42,400
Yeah.

1652
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,600
Hashtag where's Muzzy?

1653
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,840
Where are the refrains of...

1654
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,080
That's it.

1655
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,880
That was the phrase.

1656
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,240
I was trying to remember the phrase.

1657
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,320
Burned into my brain.

1658
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,160
Muzzy.

1659
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:58,640
Yeah.

1660
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:58,960
Yeah.

1661
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,160
How have we not said the word Muzzy on this show yet?

1662
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,240
That's the first instance, I think.

1663
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:04,720
I don't know.

1664
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,680
There should be a Muzzy land where all the rides are available in multiple languages.

1665
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,120
What was Muzzy?

1666
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,400
Whenever you saw clips of it, it looked frightening.

1667
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,040
Muzzy looked extremely depressing.

1668
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,200
Yeah.

1669
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,320
Muzzy seemed like an experiment gone wrong.

1670
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,360
You remember Muzzy, David?

1671
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,840
I do remember Muzzy only as a commercial.

1672
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,520
I don't think I ever participated in Muzzy's language learning.

1673
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,160
But yeah.

1674
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,560
Do we know anyone who did Muzzy?

1675
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,800
Did Muzzy teach anyone French?

1676
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,880
Did he have successes?

1677
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,360
I've never heard anyone like, well, I did Muzzy.

1678
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,160
And that's why today I am a UN diplomat.

1679
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,120
Most people in that room, almost every one of them.

1680
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,000
Now I'm thinking of Park Asterix.

1681
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,360
I'm thinking of European parks.

1682
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,680
Maybe you guys are doing Park Asterix.

1683
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,640
I have no idea what your European adventures will take you on.

1684
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,360
Do we spoil it or do we not?

1685
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:01,840
So I don't know.

1686
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,000
I'll leave it ambiguous.

1687
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,680
That is sort of like if there were a Bar Barland.

1688
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:13,920
That's like a specific French cartoon character with some international fame.

1689
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,160
Who gets a whole theme park to himself.

1690
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,240
Right.

1691
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,000
Did you have any of the did you grew up with?

1692
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,320
I guess you were there from nine on.

1693
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,880
So it wasn't like so much early cartoons.

1694
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,080
But do you have affinity for characters who we would not?

1695
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,240
I had a younger brother, so he was watching all the kids cartoons.

1696
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,600
So like Postman Pat.

1697
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,360
I don't know if you guys know Postman Pat.

1698
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,720
But no, I know he's a mailman.

1699
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,400
British kids cartoons are pretty good.

1700
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,680
At least the classic ones.

1701
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,160
Because they would do a lot of puppets, a lot of stop motion.

1702
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,240
It's the BBC.

1703
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,320
So there's like that sort of like veneer of class to like classic British cartoons.

1704
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,920
Postman Pat's very gentle.

1705
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,520
He's a mailman.

1706
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,960
He has a black and white cat.

1707
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,160
He drives around in his mail truck and like the biggest disaster would be like,

1708
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,200
the bridge is down.

1709
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,520
He's got to like go around it.

1710
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,160
Something like that.

1711
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,760
Very low stakes, chill.

1712
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,120
Very relaxing.

1713
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:11,620
Sure.

1714
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,780
There's also like pauses.

1715
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:17,860
There was like the weird stuff like the clangers, which is like their little like,

1716
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:22,900
you know, felt mice who live on the moon and like they talk like,

1717
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:28,500
all that stuff where you would watch it and be kind of bewitched.

1718
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,700
Even as like a nine or 10 year old, I'd be like, what's what is this?

1719
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:32,740
What's going on here?

1720
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,020
There was nothing like that.

1721
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:38,820
I had grown up on a steady diet of like Cartoon Network cartoons about people

1722
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,220
shooting each other, like which I was like, that's children's

1723
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:41,860
entertainment.

1724
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:42,900
Like that's what I'm here for.

1725
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,060
Like I would like to see the guns.

1726
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:46,660
Yeah.

1727
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,580
David, do you have an opinion on who was better?

1728
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:52,740
Mr. Conductor on Thomas the Tank was it Ringo Starr or George Carlin?

1729
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,700
I, I unfortunately, I grew up with Carlin.

1730
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,740
So he was to me, I understand.

1731
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:02,500
I mean, like it's and I was a big Thomas the Tank engine fan,

1732
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,900
like, or a big Shining Time Station fan.

1733
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,660
So unfortunately for me, it's Carlin, like maybe not unfortunately,

1734
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:12,420
but I wish I had grown up with that just because it's such a cool thing.

1735
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:15,060
Right.

1736
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:17,380
I mean, I think that's, look, they're both great choices.

1737
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,700
I know Alec Baldwin was in a recent.

1738
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,540
Yeah, I think in the, in the film, there was a movie where he's the conductor.

1739
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:28,660
I have not seen it, but I haven't seen it either, but I, I, I just took them out of

1740
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:30,980
the running because I went with the two classics in my mind.

1741
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:36,500
Get back in the train yard, you little pig, you disgusting little piggy.

1742
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,140
You call yourself a caboose.

1743
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:43,700
Right. He, he was the conductor until he retired from public life, of course.

1744
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,820
Like, you know, so he had to run, but then of course, as we all know,

1745
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,500
Alec Baldwin retired from public life.

1746
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,780
Yeah, we see those headlines every six weeks.

1747
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,860
Like I'm not doing the conductor again.

1748
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:58,660
I can't, they ask me, they ask me so over and over again and I can't, I can't.

1749
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,380
It's hell for me.

1750
01:24:59,380 --> 01:24:59,860
I can't do it.

1751
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:04,500
He got fired from the rail, the Sodor Railway because he kept trying to play words with

1752
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,020
friends while he was conducting.

1753
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:09,780
I'm trying to think of every Alec Baldwin scandal as quickly as possible.

1754
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:16,580
Alec Baldwin crushes the larynx of a local photographer and then it's like,

1755
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,060
I'm retiring from public life.

1756
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:22,340
I do love his Mr. Conductor voice.

1757
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,340
Hello, I'm Mr. Conductor.

1758
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,940
I am the conductor.

1759
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:28,580
And he makes that little, that little purse mouth.

1760
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:29,700
Everyone loves to look at.

1761
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:35,700
So Mr. Conductor, it's like, it's, it's such an accurate Mr. Conductor that he does.

1762
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,500
That old mouth.

1763
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,500
Emmy deserving, Emmy quality performance.

1764
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:48,740
Oh, well here, if we're talking about, you know, sort of odd British children's characters.

1765
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,740
What the hell's Beano Land?

1766
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:52,020
What's going on with Beano Land?

1767
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:56,260
All right, okay, let's roll up our sleeves because I feel like this is the final big

1768
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:57,380
thing we have to tackle.

1769
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:59,460
I'm going to change my background here.

1770
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:00,980
Wait one second because I.

1771
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,820
Oh yes, take us to Beano Land.

1772
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:03,780
I found a.

1773
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:05,140
British comics.

1774
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,220
Yeah, so all right now, where is it?

1775
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:07,860
Wait a second.

1776
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,140
I got to find this.

1777
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,740
So yeah, so the Beano and as far as I know, it still exists.

1778
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:13,700
All right, here we go.

1779
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:14,660
Yeah, still going.

1780
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:15,380
Yeah.

1781
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:15,880
All right.

1782
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,580
Is is like I used to read it.

1783
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:23,140
It's a little like paper cartoon that comes out every so often.

1784
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,460
Is it weekly?

1785
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,380
I that seems crazy.

1786
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:28,420
It must have been.

1787
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,300
It is weekly.

1788
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,020
So crazy.

1789
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,700
Because it's like.

1790
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,940
Weekly magazines, weekly comics.

1791
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:36,580
Magazines are still very popular in Britain.

1792
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:39,220
That's how they got comic books over there after the war.

1793
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:43,060
Exactly, and so it's existed for forever and it's like, I don't know, it's probably

1794
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:47,460
like 16 pages long and it's sort of like one page for every one of the characters.

1795
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,300
Maybe the small characters get half a page.

1796
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:55,860
Dennis the Menace is the big character, but it is the British Dennis the Menace who has

1797
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:58,660
no relationship to the American Dennis the Menace.

1798
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:02,820
I think they were created independently and it was just because Dennis rhymes with menace.

1799
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:08,260
But like what I feel like the American, they both have slingshots, but like the American

1800
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,100
Dennis the Menace is pretty chill.

1801
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:13,300
Like I don't think of him as like a dangerous boy.

1802
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,780
He's kind of just like a bit of a prankster, whereas like the British Dennis the Menace

1803
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,580
is terrifying.

1804
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:22,020
Like he has black hair and this red and black stripes.

1805
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:27,060
He has a dog called Nasher who is like who bites like that's why he's called Nasher.

1806
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:31,700
And he like, I mean, and this is why I changed my background.

1807
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:41,060
His enemy is a boy called Walter the Softie who is, you know, wants to like have tea parties

1808
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,900
and like do his homework or whatever.

1809
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:49,620
Like he's like a nerd, but he's specifically coded as like an effeminate little boy.

1810
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:55,620
Like and I don't know if Britain has caught up to this and is now like, okay, all right,

1811
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,620
we're going to like tone down the Softie stuff.

1812
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:03,300
This is essentially just a comic about a heroic boy bullying a poor little effeminate boy.

1813
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:09,060
But like when I was a kid, it was 100% like Dennis was like, right readers, you recruited me,

1814
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,900
Walter the Softie, he's got to go.

1815
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:11,780
We're going to get him.

1816
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:15,620
Like that was 100% the vibe of Dennis the Menace.

1817
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,900
And then there are other characters.

1818
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:21,140
I mean, there's Roger the Dodger, there's Billy Wiz, there's Minnie the Minx.

1819
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,380
Like it's like a lot of prankster kids.

1820
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:28,980
It's that sort of like post-war British fantasy of like kids just like roaming around causing trouble.

1821
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,340
You pull up a background.

1822
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,660
Me not really understanding what Beano Land is.

1823
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:41,700
And then my explanation that I'm offered is a sign that says no Softies.

1824
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:42,180
That's Walter.

1825
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,020
With a cross through it.

1826
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:44,340
Okay.

1827
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,700
That's Walter the Softie.

1828
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,580
I don't know who this is.

1829
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:48,980
I can't remember her name, but another Softie, I suppose.

1830
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,740
And there's little, yeah, they're smiling.

1831
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:58,340
And there's flowers floating near them, which I guess is what makes these characters Softies,

1832
01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:59,380
but they smile.

1833
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:06,580
It's like if the cartoon Doug was about Roger the bully.

1834
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,060
Yes.

1835
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:07,460
Yes.

1836
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:10,100
And he was the hero, unambiguously the hero.

1837
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:11,460
Right.

1838
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:14,100
And you were just like, yeah, I want to see him beat the shit out of Doug.

1839
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:15,380
Fuck Doug.

1840
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,660
Which like, I almost admire it.

1841
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,140
It's not like Dennis the Menace in America where it's like,

1842
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,900
this kid's pretty anodyne.

1843
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,340
He's not really causing any trouble.

1844
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:29,300
Dennis the Menace in Britain is like, I am on the road to jail.

1845
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,300
That is what's happening with me.

1846
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,820
I don't want to go to school.

1847
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,340
I just want to beat people up.

1848
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:38,660
I want to be the kid who, if you see me coming around the corner, you cross the street.

1849
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:44,420
Dennis the Menace, British Dennis the Menace, the star of Trainspotting 2.

1850
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:46,420
Yes.

1851
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:52,340
I mean, and like there's other characters, the Bash Street kids, I really liked them.

1852
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:55,460
I remember like, and they're definitely pranksters.

1853
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,100
Like they're a bunch of school kids who cause trouble.

1854
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,940
But they're, Dennis is the only one I think of as being like malicious.

1855
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:08,740
Usually they're more just pranksters or trying to stay one step ahead of the grownups or whatever.

1856
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:12,340
I'm looking at Beano Land itself though, which I do remember visiting.

1857
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:19,860
And it was basically just like a pretty simple, like they had some, what do you call them?

1858
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:20,740
Dodger cars.

1859
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:24,100
What do you, you know, what do you, geez, is there a bumper car?

1860
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:29,220
Which they call Roger the Dodger's Dodgums.

1861
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:33,540
Yeah, Roger the Dodger was like, he's a little kid, but he's like a huckster.

1862
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,860
Like he was always like swindling people out of their money.

1863
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:39,300
I don't know why he's called a Dodger especially.

1864
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,860
And there was Billy's Whizzer, which was like one of those, you know, spinning,

1865
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,620
you sit in a chair and you spin around rides.

1866
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:50,580
Like the rides themselves seem pretty basic, but they just were sort of given the Beano skin.

1867
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:53,700
The Beano skin.

1868
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,300
It's just such a great example.

1869
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,260
And when I was a little kid and I moved to Britain and I was like, look,

1870
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:02,740
I got to get into British culture if I'm going to survive at school.

1871
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:06,340
Like I'm going to need to know like what these kids are interested in.

1872
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:10,340
So obviously I got into soccer, got into football because that's the easiest way to

1873
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,140
have a conversation in Britain is to just know about football.

1874
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:16,580
But the Beano, I was definitely buying the Beano to be like, I

1875
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,580
guess this is what they like.

1876
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:21,300
And I was like watching Saturday morning cartoon.

1877
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:25,860
You know, I was just trying to sort of like get acclimated to this new kid culture.

1878
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:34,340
So did you get into it successfully or was it just like, were you just tolerating it to get by?

1879
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:35,460
I think I got into it.

1880
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:39,300
I mean, the Beano, I think I quickly realized like, oh, people don't talk about the Beano.

1881
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:43,940
Like I think I soon was like, I guess this is not cool anymore.

1882
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:46,980
I would still buy it just because I don't know.

1883
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,180
It was a kid. It was a comic book.

1884
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:51,540
I liked any comic book, but Jason worries.

1885
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:59,860
Oh, I was going to say the conflict for me is that Walter the softie is the antagonist.

1886
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:06,740
From what I was reading, one of the other big weekly magazines, I think for kids is called Dandy.

1887
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:10,820
So Dandy's cool, but softies are bad.

1888
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,420
I'm so confused.

1889
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:13,060
It's a fair question.

1890
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,980
I don't know why it was called Dandy.

1891
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:20,900
Dandy was like the other Beano and its main character was Desperate Dan,

1892
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:25,700
who is like a cowboy with a giant chin.

1893
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,500
I encourage you to Google him.

1894
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,100
I was just looking at Desperate Dan.

1895
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:35,380
Yes, who eats cow pies, which is like a whole pie with horns coming out of it.

1896
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:40,500
So he's like some weird post-war parody of Americans where it's like

1897
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,460
these Americans, they're all giant and all they do is eat.

1898
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:49,060
And they're like these sort of like, you know, consuming, all consuming colossus people.

1899
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:50,580
It's very strange.

1900
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:57,140
He's kind of like a Paul Bunyan type, I guess.

1901
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,640
Yeah.

1902
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,560
I'm looking at other characters like Lord Snooty.

1903
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,360
Lord Snooty.

1904
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:02,860
Yeah.

1905
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:08,200
Yeah, he was not cool by the time I, he's like a classic Beano character.

1906
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:09,980
Right.

1907
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,480
Bifo the Bear.

1908
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,080
Okay, was he popular at that time?

1909
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:18,280
No, those are like original Beano characters.

1910
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:20,760
Ivy the Terrible, she was a big deal.

1911
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:25,720
She was like a little kid, even smaller than the other kids and caused even more chaos.

1912
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,320
But you know, where did, go ahead.

1913
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:29,640
Sorry.

1914
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:32,520
Where did, oh, I was going to say, where did Dan Dare run?

1915
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,320
Did that run in, or that ran in something else?

1916
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,440
That was its own thing.

1917
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,320
But yeah, that right.

1918
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,960
Because that was like, that's like action comics, right?

1919
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,920
That was, I think that's very cool in the sixties and seventies.

1920
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:47,160
And then Britain has that legacy of comic, like, because 2000 AD, right?

1921
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,760
Obviously, like all that stuff.

1922
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,040
Yeah.

1923
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:54,680
Its own little sort of universe of, and so it's nice that there was a Beano land,

1924
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:57,240
but I don't remember Beano land really being that exciting.

1925
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,040
It doesn't look like it.

1926
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,280
It didn't even like last 10 years.

1927
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,200
They, they, they kind of got rid of it.

1928
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,480
But was it?

1929
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,360
Is it gone now?

1930
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:04,920
Yeah, it's gone.

1931
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:05,800
Yeah.

1932
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:10,680
Well, does it make, does it make any sense that in the 2000s they go,

1933
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,880
how do we get kids in here?

1934
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,080
I know, Beano.

1935
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:14,360
Beano.

1936
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:18,920
It doesn't help that in America, Beano is like anti-fart medicine, right?

1937
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,600
Like that is what Beano is here.

1938
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:21,480
Yes.

1939
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,040
I don't know why it's called Beano.

1940
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:29,640
And we know this place, this park will do entire attractions based on soaps.

1941
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,800
So why would they also do,

1942
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,480
why not do an entire themed land to flatulence medicine?

1943
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,000
I'm looking.

1944
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,360
This is like the.

1945
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,080
No, go ahead.

1946
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:41,800
Yeah.

1947
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,560
I was just going to say it's like the English Toon Lagoon, which is in Orlando,

1948
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,000
which is all Kingfisher Syndicate comic strips.

1949
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,480
I guess you could maybe argue those are a bit more relevant,

1950
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,640
but how much more relevant?

1951
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:57,640
I'm not sure how much more relevant Dagwood is in America.

1952
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,000
But it's like, it's that kind of thing though, where you're like,

1953
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,680
does this just exist?

1954
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:03,880
Cause it's always existed.

1955
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,920
Like, I know, like when I was a kid, I read the funny pages.

1956
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,360
I don't so much anymore, but right.

1957
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,920
Like as a kid, you're just like, yeah, I get it.

1958
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,360
Dagwood, he likes big sandwiches.

1959
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,360
Like that's just a thing that will never change.

1960
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:16,600
Like if they got rid of it, it would be a problem.

1961
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,760
But like, does anyone care about Dagwood anymore?

1962
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,360
Has Dagwood caught up with the times?

1963
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:21,580
No.

1964
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:22,520
Yes.

1965
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,560
He sees Dagwood making commentary on what's happening in the world today.

1966
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:25,720
Right.

1967
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,320
Like is Dagwood in quarantine?

1968
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,760
Like for all I know, he is.

1969
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:29,880
I don't know.

1970
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:32,520
Honestly, now you've got me intrigued.

1971
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,600
I would like to know how is he getting his food?

1972
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,040
How is he getting his big sandwiches?

1973
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:40,840
They still is blondie still preparing them?

1974
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,080
Right.

1975
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,480
Is he like not ordering take takeout?

1976
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,280
He wants to take out.

1977
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,880
He wants to wipe everything down before.

1978
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,160
Has there been a shortage in big olives?

1979
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:54,920
I'm looking at it looks like Dagwood still going to work and arguing with his boss.

1980
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,400
So I guess he's not respecting quarantine at all.

1981
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:02,440
Well, Dagwood and Blondie, unfortunately, are one of the couples who have broken up

1982
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,040
in the midst of quarantine.

1983
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,480
So they did not.

1984
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,760
They did not make it.

1985
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,560
Oh, God.

1986
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:07,800
Yeah.

1987
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:14,280
It'd be funny if you looked in all of the classic characters are dealing with COVID-19.

1988
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,960
Like comics unilaterally have decided, yeah, we're going to.

1989
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,800
We're making it happen in this world.

1990
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,160
We got to show the reality.

1991
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,800
I just tried to go a week back in Blondie and it asked me to go premium.

1992
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:32,280
And I'm now I'm genuinely wondering how much it costs to get unlimited blondie in my life.

1993
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,280
Like a blondie streaming service.

1994
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:36,780
Blondie.

1995
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,080
I'm on the same website.

1996
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,680
We have to figure out how much this costs.

1997
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,320
We're all going to share a subscription.

1998
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,520
Is that allowed?

1999
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,520
Share a go comics subscription.

2000
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,320
No, no, we have to give it directly to Blondie.

2001
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:49,820
Right.

2002
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,120
We're only paying the CIA.

2003
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,400
We're going to get a piecemeal it.

2004
01:36:54,360 --> 01:37:04,440
If you learned in comics world that John Arbuckle was past COVID-19 from Garfield,

2005
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,960
cats can get it and transmit it.

2006
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,000
Right.

2007
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,080
And the Odie's safe.

2008
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:11,720
Thank God.

2009
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:15,480
But Garfield's been miserable lately.

2010
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,960
They're all just staring at each other.

2011
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,920
They had to quarantine.

2012
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,280
They went to different houses.

2013
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:20,520
Right.

2014
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:25,080
And they were for a while, they were like, you know, they were putting Clorox onto the lasagna.

2015
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,200
It was like a weird, you know, they were like, and then it was like, oh, we don't have to do that.

2016
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,200
But the first few weeks were really stressful.

2017
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,880
It's like, I didn't know we're getting information from every

2018
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:36,680
Garfield was watching different YouTube videos than John was.

2019
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:40,920
Look, okay.

2020
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:41,480
Nermal.

2021
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,840
Yes, she left the city.

2022
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:47,400
She went in quarantine with the barnyard pals, but she quarantined for two weeks.

2023
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:47,720
Okay.

2024
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,160
She's not a super spreader.

2025
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,480
Leave the box.

2026
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:56,360
When Nermal gets to Abu Dhabi, leave the box outside for a full 24 hours

2027
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,640
before bringing him in.

2028
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,200
Excuse me.

2029
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,200
Because you don't want the virus living on the Nermal box.

2030
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:08,520
I used to hate Mondays, but now I don't even know what day it is anymore.

2031
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,160
I guess I hate all days.

2032
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,440
I have an answer for how much this service costs.

2033
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:16,760
Hit me.

2034
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,600
Blondie Plus?

2035
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:24,120
It is $2 a month or $20 a year.

2036
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,160
That's not that much.

2037
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,880
And it's got 60,000 comics.

2038
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:33,240
I mean, we're all charging more than that for the Patreon.

2039
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:33,720
You know what?

2040
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,680
I'm in quarantine.

2041
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:35,880
I'm not really going out much.

2042
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:40,280
I'm just going to go to the first issue of Blondie and get the first ever strip.

2043
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:42,440
And we're just, we're going through it all.

2044
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,480
Yeah, that's where this is heading.

2045
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,240
We're all going to end up doing crazy things.

2046
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:50,920
Like, yeah, I read, I read every Beano.

2047
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,920
I went back to the beginning of Beano.

2048
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,120
I didn't enjoy one second of it.

2049
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,160
I didn't understand it.

2050
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,520
I'm just, I have nothing to do.

2051
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:03,640
A new podcast where we read a Beano every week and talk about it.

2052
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:08,280
We're all going to have, we're all going to like do all this nonsense.

2053
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,800
Comics from 1931 all the way up till now.

2054
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:12,920
We'll all have multiple.

2055
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:16,120
Every one of us is going to have five podcasts by the end of this.

2056
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,160
There's no other choice.

2057
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,120
Deconstructing Foxtrot.

2058
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:25,160
I mean, like here's crazy and crazy and Ignatz and Jason Sheridan.

2059
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,640
Here's what's weird about Beano.

2060
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:35,080
Or here's, I guess this is the biggest indictment of Beano land is that

2061
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:40,520
it was turned into an area called Wild Asia with all rides intact.

2062
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:47,000
So like there was not a lot of work that needed to be done to revamp Beano land into Wild Asia.

2063
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,160
Really?

2064
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:52,120
All the same, you know, it has whatever bumper cars.

2065
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,760
It's got a spinning around ride.

2066
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:55,640
It's got all the stuff.

2067
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:57,960
It's, it's better themed.

2068
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:58,680
I'll give them that.

2069
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,600
Like it all looks like ruins.

2070
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,720
It's not that far from like Joe roadie animal kingdom.

2071
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,840
Some of it's kind of well done.

2072
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:10,200
Which interesting you bring that up, Scott, because there is a hotel here.

2073
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,920
There's two wings of the hotel.

2074
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:19,560
There's the newer Azteca hotel and then the Safari hotel, which seems very much like a more

2075
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,920
budget conscious is the nice way to say it version of the animal kingdom lodge.

2076
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:29,480
Like you get views of the giraffes and the animals and stuff in this Safari.

2077
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,840
I'm seeing you can have the Gruffalo.

2078
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,200
You can have a Gruffalo room.

2079
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:39,480
With a well themed room over your, your, your bed.

2080
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,560
Wow.

2081
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,060
Yeah.

2082
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:48,120
And in the, in our, one of our traditions on the show is making sure to distinguish

2083
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,200
between very similar named things.

2084
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,560
Chessington has a few things that we, we indulge in on the show.

2085
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:01,320
One, they have a lot of long named rides like the Gruffalo river ride adventure.

2086
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:06,680
Their Safari ride is called zoo, Fari dash ride into Africa.

2087
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:12,200
But I want to be very clear that it is not the restaurant in the hotel.

2088
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:15,160
That's the Fari bar and chill.

2089
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:18,920
So zoo Fari is not the Fari.

2090
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:25,160
They just changed the second letter, but those are different things.

2091
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,080
That's a very confusing one.

2092
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,240
Is it because they have pizza like za?

2093
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:31,580
No.

2094
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:32,780
No.

2095
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,280
Looks like a pretty regular old place.

2096
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:38,200
Yes.

2097
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:42,920
They have a full, they have an English breakfast in buffet form.

2098
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,560
You can do a full English in a buffet.

2099
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,800
That's a thing at European hotels, I believe.

2100
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:49,720
Right. They include breakfast in your stay.

2101
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:52,840
At least here it is.

2102
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:57,720
I don't know if it's widespread, but you don't necessarily get a big cow pie,

2103
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:02,520
cow pie, much bigger than you like desperate Dan would eat.

2104
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:09,080
No, but the guys from Madagascar are around sometimes, it seems like.

2105
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:11,240
What? Yes.

2106
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,320
Why is desperate Dan desperate?

2107
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:14,200
Is it for friends?

2108
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,160
I mean, he has plenty of food.

2109
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,120
It shouldn't be food.

2110
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,800
One cow pie you'd have to imagine could last him a week.

2111
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,100
Right.

2112
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:27,480
Well, we'll have to investigate that further.

2113
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,800
I'm looking at another.

2114
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,320
I'm looking at another thing where he's said there's other foods around him.

2115
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:35,560
One of them is owl hoot juice.

2116
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:39,420
OK.

2117
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,720
Also, you guys should just see this, too.

2118
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,080
Let me let me share the screen.

2119
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,600
This is some very odd.

2120
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:50,440
I'm dealing with weird sodas, got owl hoot juice, got rocky mountain rock cakes,

2121
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:54,600
grizzly stew, cactus soup and rattlesnake rings.

2122
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,920
And the whole family of mice are like eating underneath him.

2123
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:03,160
Like, do you think there's so much runoff from a desperate Dan meal

2124
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,920
that there's like colonies of mice?

2125
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,480
And he's got a cactus in the shape of his own head.

2126
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,120
He's a pretty cool guy.

2127
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,920
I don't think I like desperate Dan.

2128
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,720
I don't know if Dandy still, I think Dandy died.

2129
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:22,200
I think Beano survives partly maybe just out of nostalgia,

2130
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,040
like it's sort of like an institution.

2131
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,120
But I think the Dandy is now defunct.

2132
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,440
OK.

2133
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,360
Does it have does Dandy have a tombstone?

2134
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,560
Yeah, they buried it right next to Zappomattoch.

2135
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,360
I guess if we're winding down here, I think, you know, a question we're

2136
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:46,600
trying to figure out with this whole Europe month recovering places we haven't been to.

2137
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:50,280
And we're wondering if we were if any of the three of us were to take

2138
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:54,040
a real European vacation and, you know, eight years or so from now,

2139
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:59,400
were we to go to the place you live for a long time in England?

2140
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:04,920
Is this worth is it worth a trip to Chessington?

2141
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,120
Should we make time to actually go there?

2142
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,800
Were we to do a British vacation?

2143
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:11,960
I think yes.

2144
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:13,320
I think you should do it.

2145
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:18,760
And I think part of the argument is that you could very easily combine it with Thorpe Park

2146
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:24,120
or Legoland, like any any nearby British theme park.

2147
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,640
Like there's a few down there.

2148
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,480
If you had well, I know I think it's worth it.

2149
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,880
I think it would be better to go to Chessington for this show

2150
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:37,960
than Alton Towers, where you would just ride a bunch of, you know, very professional rides.

2151
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:41,000
But maybe there's a little less weirdness to dig into.

2152
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,280
If you're going to Britain, Chessington, it's a day trip.

2153
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:48,120
Like, you know, you can be in London, you can do other stuff, and then you can, like,

2154
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,760
devote one day to Chessington and easily conquer it.

2155
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,600
Sure, sure.

2156
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:57,960
If we were to go to Chessington, what kind of flowers would we lay at the grave site

2157
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,560
of Zappomattox to pay our respects?

2158
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,360
Poppies.

2159
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,560
Do you lay a poppy?

2160
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,760
Do we wear the poppy?

2161
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:06,920
That is, of course, a classic in memoriam.

2162
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,200
Yes, for Brits, yes.

2163
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,080
We could start a tradition.

2164
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:17,800
We could turn Zappomattox's grave into like kind of a happen and scene,

2165
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:25,000
Jim Morrison's grave, you know, where people drink and party and have sex on it and graffiti it and

2166
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
stuff. Although I think it's probably been blocked from doing that for a long time.

2167
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:35,160
But yeah, you know, we can turn it into a spot of rivalry.

2168
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:38,520
Yeah, it sounds smashing.

2169
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:44,760
I will say I feel like they're trying to keep away too many guys like us,

2170
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:50,440
because when I tried to look up like book your trip and I tried to do more than one night,

2171
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:51,720
it broke the website.

2172
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,480
Like it would not let me put it.

2173
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:56,680
Maybe you don't want to do that.

2174
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,200
Yeah, it's like, all right, all right, back off, podcaster.

2175
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:05,080
So they made the decision for you, I guess.

2176
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:08,840
So perhaps one night and no more is suitable.

2177
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,320
One, because they give you the second day free.

2178
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:15,640
A lot of these British parks right now are doing like buy a night and then you get a second ticket

2179
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,760
for the day you check out.

2180
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:22,600
I will say real quick, I was on the website looking around and I know this is probably

2181
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:27,000
just a change of terminology from us to England or it's just a difference.

2182
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:32,440
But it says a magical short break awaits, and it's Santa Claus.

2183
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,840
And it says plan ahead and make your family's Christmas wishes come true with a magical

2184
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:39,400
short break at Chessington World of Adventures Resort.

2185
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:44,040
Your overnight festive package includes access to the resort's Christmas event.

2186
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:46,600
Meet and greet with Father Christmas in his grotto.

2187
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,720
They have stuck to Father Christmas.

2188
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:59,480
That is still what Father Christmas and he has a grotto.

2189
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:00,200
He's got a grotto.

2190
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,000
Not a cabin.

2191
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:03,640
He has a grotto.

2192
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,000
So he's got a grotto.

2193
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,680
All the guys are in there.

2194
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,800
You know, Jimmy Khan.

2195
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:11,000
Scott Khan in the grotto.

2196
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:16,840
I'm reading it looks like they are not making you wear a mask right now, but there are certain

2197
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:21,000
rides that you have to wear a mask on, such as the Gruffalo River Ride Adventure.

2198
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,720
You have to wear, though you do have to wear a sex mask in Santa's grotto.

2199
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:28,520
That's like a nice white shirt thing.

2200
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:29,640
You got to wear like a Harvard.

2201
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:32,520
Exactly.

2202
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,240
All the stars.

2203
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,360
Everybody's hanging out there.

2204
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:40,200
Professor Burp is hanging out and they'll be, you know, he set up since he got kicked out,

2205
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:44,440
he set up his juice jacuzzi in Father Christmas grotto.

2206
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:48,520
And then sometimes they'll be just like a little bit of a little bit of a bubble up

2207
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:52,280
and people go, oh, geez, Professor Burp Spartan again.

2208
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:55,560
And Desperate Dan is in the corner just eating a big pie.

2209
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:57,960
Prince Andrew.

2210
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:06,600
He can't sweat, though he has a problem.

2211
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,040
He can't be sweating, though.

2212
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:11,080
So you won't know if he's nervous or not.

2213
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:22,440
Sorry, we didn't even mention the connection to a very recent episode we did before we went abroad.

2214
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:28,840
Um, it, Chesington is owned by Merlin Entertainment, which owns Alton Towers,

2215
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:35,160
Madam Tussauds, Legoland, Gardaland in Italy and Sea Life Aquarium.

2216
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:40,120
And I bring this up because Sea Life Aquarium was one of the attractions

2217
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:43,800
slotted for the American dream in beautiful New Jersey.

2218
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:46,920
Oh, the mall, the New Jersey Mall.

2219
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:47,720
Oh, wow.

2220
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:52,280
This entity, Merlin Entertainment was going to create the New Jersey

2221
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,400
Mall Aquarium.

2222
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:58,600
Have you been, David, have you been bothered by this American dream thing

2223
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,560
in any tangible way being out on that coast?

2224
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,760
I'm bothered by it.

2225
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:09,080
Is it going to start like affecting my day to day life?

2226
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,360
Is that part of the plan?

2227
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:17,560
How I imagine it is that all New Yorkers are just furious about this thing all the time,

2228
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,840
throwing rocks at it.

2229
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:19,740
Right.

2230
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,400
Like it stinks.

2231
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,920
It's emanating a smell that makes its way to your apartment.

2232
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,400
It's near the like the the giant stadium, right?

2233
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:28,600
The MetLife Stadium, right?

2234
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,160
I have not.

2235
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,640
I have been affected by American dream.

2236
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:39,960
Well, I'm praying that you will have the opportunity to go there and to see some fish, I guess.

2237
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:45,480
And I don't know, maybe, you know, Santa's Grotto could get built there as well.

2238
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:52,280
It's like a good way to attract some attracts and people as their mall fails in the case.

2239
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:53,960
Awesome.

2240
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:56,120
Well, this has been a lot of fun.

2241
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:02,120
What a fun, indeed, a world of adventures to check out David Sims, he survived podcast,

2242
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:02,680
The Ride.

2243
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:05,960
Thanks for joining us on our European expedition.

2244
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,960
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2245
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:09,000
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2246
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,160
Thank you guys for having me.

2247
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:15,000
It was really a delight to find a way to fit into this podcast.

2248
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:21,880
Which I believe I host Blank Check Griffin and David's movie podcast.

2249
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:24,840
I'm sure Griffin has mentioned it, obviously, when he's on

2250
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:27,560
where we go through directors filmographies.

2251
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,720
And yeah, you can read I'm a film critic at the Atlantic.

2252
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,080
You can read my stuff there.

2253
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:34,920
Not that there are many movies to write about right now, but we're doing our best.

2254
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:36,360
That's me.

2255
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:36,600
Yeah.

2256
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:41,640
Are you doing like do you have to like come up with a thousand ways to do like remember when?

2257
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:45,320
And yeah, 1999, some good movies.

2258
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,480
Blood from a stone at this point.

2259
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:52,360
I think you should just keep writing about do little until the pandemic is over.

2260
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:55,240
Yes, that's what I'll swing back around to do a little.

2261
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,840
A 10 part essay on extraction.

2262
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,960
Well, and I'll say, hey, we just found one.

2263
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,680
Be no land is is waiting for you.

2264
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:10,440
I'm sure I'm sure you're going to enjoy and explain the be to everybody.

2265
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:13,480
As many essays as possible.

2266
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:19,160
And oh, wait, guys, I forgot we have to get now that we have covered England,

2267
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,640
we have to get our passport stamped.

2268
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:22,520
And there it is.

2269
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:23,240
Cook chunk.

2270
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:25,720
What is what does that look like?

2271
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:30,920
Well, I think this actually resembles Jason.

2272
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:34,360
I think this is Jason in his new mode as the height miser.

2273
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:40,280
Or it's it's it's it's like a new form of of Jason.

2274
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:47,880
He's got very high hair, just like the heat miser from whatever that Christmas thing is.

2275
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:52,760
Yeah, he looks he looks great.

2276
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,880
And his eyebrows are going up real high, again, indicating how much he loves his height.

2277
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:03,640
And and he's smiling a big smile that honestly kind of resembles our pal.

2278
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,720
Wait, why did I forget the name of the robot?

2279
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,760
Or is that dramatic?

2280
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,400
Diplomatic.

2281
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,840
He's smiling a big smile.

2282
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,040
You know what?

2283
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:17,080
I'll take it because I've been really worried this whole time.

2284
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:22,360
Staring, looking at Walter the softy, going like, oh, no, another theme park character.

2285
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,360
I resemble Walter the softy.

2286
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,680
No, you're your own character.

2287
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:29,800
You're the height miser.

2288
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:31,720
I'll take it from.

2289
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,000
Well, I thought you should play.

2290
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:37,240
Who was the guy who would trick people from Beano Roger the Dodger?

2291
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:41,000
I thought you were more of a Roger the Dodger, Jason.

2292
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,120
Oh, that's fair.

2293
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:42,360
Yeah.

2294
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:43,640
Yeah.

2295
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:47,080
So honestly, although Jason could play any of the Beano characters, let's be.

2296
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:51,720
You know, on my one thousand episode, Beano podcast, you know,

2297
01:52:52,360 --> 01:52:56,840
when we all have conflicting Beano podcast, Beano dissection podcast.

2298
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:57,340
Sure.

2299
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,200
There'll be plenty of time to sort all of this out.

2300
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:05,800
Hey, as for us and for the rest of our European vacation, keep following us

2301
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,160
and our progress on Twitter, on Instagram and our Facebook group.

2302
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:16,760
And you can join us for bonus day trip day excursions over at the second gate

2303
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,400
at Patreon dot com slash podcast.

2304
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:21,960
The ride we just went to to Popeye Village.

2305
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:26,440
Also not that far out from Griffin's last appearance on the show.

2306
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,160
I don't know if you know this.

2307
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,080
Griffin Griffin broke the record.

2308
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:33,240
We always knew it was his to break longest episode now over on the second gate

2309
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:35,800
about race through New York with Jimmy Fallon.

2310
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,640
Where's your guys record at this?

2311
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:39,880
But you've you've gone over three hours.

2312
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:42,120
I think it over three hours.

2313
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:45,960
God, and we just just yesterday we did another one that was insanely long.

2314
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,560
And it's like one of those things where like now it's just like,

2315
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:53,400
well, if we do under two hours, we're going to like, I mean, what are we even doing here?

2316
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:58,040
Like, it's we used to do an hour long episodes and it was fine.

2317
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:59,720
I don't know what we've done to ourselves.

2318
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,000
Bruce Springsteen concert.

2319
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:03,960
Just as good.

2320
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:06,040
We all have just as much talent.

2321
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:07,880
That's what I have to have the charisma.

2322
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:10,760
We're all as a Super Bowl halftime show.

2323
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:16,840
There will be some where we're still stuck in this in January.

2324
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:20,680
The Super Bowl halftime show will be just like cutting different podcasters.

2325
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:25,080
Now a thousand zooms.

2326
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,640
So now a thousand zooms.

2327
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:31,640
Oh, boy.

2328
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,520
Well, anyway, yeah, lots of hours of content available over there.

2329
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:37,320
Hey, and if we missed anything about any of these parks,

2330
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:40,360
sure to let us know an email us at podcast, right at gmail.com.

2331
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:42,040
Anything else, Mike and Jason?

2332
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:49,080
No, I just just keep that Zapomatic in your prayers, I guess.

2333
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:50,120
Yeah.

2334
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:52,680
And watch out for gourds and watch out for gore.

2335
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:53,720
Watch out.

2336
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:54,760
Gourds.

2337
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:56,200
Oh, I don't know.

2338
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:56,920
Gorgs.

2339
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,280
OK, it is Gorgs.

2340
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:59,240
Watch out for Gorgs.

2341
01:54:59,240 --> 01:54:59,880
Gorgs.

2342
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,240
You like watch out for Gorgs.

2343
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:05,400
Well, there you never know what's going on in those squashes, you know.

2344
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,400
Decorative gourds are very scary.

2345
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:07,900
Gorgs.

2346
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:10,440
Good tip to live your life.

2347
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,000
Bye.

2348
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:11,320
All right.

2349
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:12,280
See you next week.

2350
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:13,480
We'll go elsewhere.

2351
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,800
And you're actually going to stay around this neck of the woods,

2352
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:18,920
perhaps the British Isles, if that's a little bit of a clue.

2353
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,520
And we'll talk to you next week.

2354
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,000
Bye bye.

2355
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:22,140
Bye.

2356
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:23,400
Forever.

2357
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:25,580
Dog.

2358
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,600
This has been a Forever Dog production.

2359
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:32,280
Executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan,

2360
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:36,760
