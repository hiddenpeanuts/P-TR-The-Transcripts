1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,620
Forever.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,300
Dog.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,820
Warning, the following podcast may include human skull slice down the middle, cruel destruction

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,400
of alarm clocks, a pretty good pitch for Michael Eisner merchandise, and grappling with the

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,020
ultimate moral quandary in what scenario is robot theft justified.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,040
Buzzy, if you're listening, don't give up hope.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,420
You will be found as a result of this episode about Cranium Command on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:57,636
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show hosted by three men who are piloted by three much smaller men,

9
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:03,676
but have the same voices as the regular sized men. I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Scott

10
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:10,776
Garandir. As opposed to the Buzzy scenario? No, the Buzzy scenario is the same. Is Buzzy his voice?

11
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:16,096
The child's voice and Buzzy's voice is the same actor. Okay, that is a question I had. And yes,

12
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:22,096
it is the same and the little Scott sounds like this. Hello. This is Mike Carlson. I'm confused

13
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:28,216
though because isn't Buzzy like almost a temporary, he's just on the job for the first time in the

14
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:32,816
Ride Cranium Command, which is what we're talking about today? In theory, yeah. I never put that

15
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:38,856
together or had forgotten that the child's voice and Buzzy's voice are one and the same. We're

16
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:43,156
right. I figure we get into this deep into the thing, but yeah, I'll go straight to it.

17
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:49,516
Okay, if he's a new recruit and presumably this 12 year old boy existed before he was being piloted

18
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:55,036
by a little guy in his head, what did he sound like before? Right. Is it that like, if you're

19
00:01:55,036 --> 00:02:00,076
changing out little guys in your head, that voices would constantly be changing. You would

20
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:05,516
constantly have a new voice if like your little guy was fired or the- Maybe this is the issue in

21
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:10,776
puberty. Maybe that's what we're like. Oh yes. When your voice is changing and cracking, it's because

22
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:18,276
your guy is sliding in and out. He's been fired. But that would only really work like, isn't it

23
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:24,036
possible that a seven year old boy would have a really gruff voice and then suddenly get higher?

24
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:28,116
Yeah, of course it is. I mean, this system, this doesn't, this ride makes no sense.

25
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:31,676
It's almost like they had less than six months to turn it around.

26
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:38,756
Save it for massive plot holes. In case we're diving too deep into the deep end today, we're

27
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:44,156
talking about Cranium Command, which was a show at Epcot Center where you go inside the head of a

28
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:48,816
12 year old and meet all of the people who, the tiny people who pilot the 12 year old.

29
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:54,476
Why this ride? Well, you, the listener, very well might know. By popular demand.

30
00:02:54,936 --> 00:03:01,036
Yeah. I don't think anything has been sent to us more than this. Absolutely. Yeah, so many people

31
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:06,036
tweeted this at us and it was a genuine Twitter thing, I feel like, at least as far as I can tell.

32
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:11,296
I'm pretty theme park centric in my Twitter feed, but there was a lot of hashtag find Buzzy

33
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:18,796
because the little guy, the pilot, the single audio animatronic in the ride, Buzzy, apparently

34
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:22,616
was never removed from the ride, though you haven't been able to go on it in a decade.

35
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:28,816
And now it is missing. It is missing now. And apparently his clothes were taken back in August

36
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:33,636
and the animatronic was taken in December. That's how it played out?

37
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:40,776
That's the update I saw and I think they did, they arrested someone and questioned them.

38
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:44,496
I saw a name. I don't have it handy, but the person has been named.

39
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:50,476
But not charged. Wait, so go back. So you're saying that Buzzy's clothes were removed by

40
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:54,196
Walt Disney Company or somebody snuck in and just stole the little boy's clothes?

41
00:03:54,596 --> 00:04:00,196
The little boy's clothes because the breaking news at the end of December was that the Buzzy

42
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:05,556
animatronic is gone. And then a lot of the websites I saw posted updates where it's like

43
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:11,556
he's gone, but his clothes were taken back in August and there's a police report on file you

44
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:18,196
couldn't find because so and someone has, yeah, like I said, someone was questioned and arrested.

45
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:25,536
I think they were arrested for non-violently resisting arrest because they were refusing to

46
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:29,576
turn their phone over. So, you know, speculate on that.

47
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:32,336
You know it's full of stuff. A fake naked boy.

48
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:41,916
There had to have been like a cop show investigation where there's a room and there's a good cop and a

49
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:46,636
bad cop. It's like, what do you know about that little robot boy's clothes? And then like, don't

50
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:51,316
make me bring in my buddy here because I'm the nice one or whatever. And then like he's like,

51
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:56,076
you guys spits at the cop or something. I don't know nothing about that little naked robot boy.

52
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:04,236
And they're actually doing that. The room is just the Wonders of Life pavilion and but they're under

53
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:10,456
like a caricature of a wine glass smiling or whatever garbage. And it's Disney Security.

54
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,296
Right. I mean, it's ex-Blackwater guys, but they work for Disney.

55
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:19,976
Right. They're pinning the guy under a big making of me sign that fell off.

56
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:26,096
Wonders of Life pavilion. And you know what also, like there was just a big article in the New York

57
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:34,476
Times about podcasts getting turned into TV series. Dirty John just happened and was a Bravo,

58
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:41,036
a little mini series among others. I think this is our shot. So we got to make it count today

59
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:47,376
because like Three Guys Gabin is not going to ever be a TV show or at least not a fictionalized one.

60
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:54,156
But the true crime, that's your shot. So I think we need to make what you're that scene you just

61
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:59,676
described. Yes. That's in the show. But until but we can't until there's an ending, I don't think we

62
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:06,676
can actually go pitch this. But I think absolutely free Buzzy is our shot at a television show.

63
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:10,896
It's a great idea. There's a lot of ways to do it too, because we could also just do the Tom Arnold

64
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:17,216
Trump version of it, where we just try to make a documentary. We tried to find Buzzy. A very lazy,

65
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:23,596
thing. We like lie a lot on TV, but maybe they we don't think they're lies because we've done a

66
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:29,376
lot of cocaine in our lives. That to me feels like the next that was the next generation of

67
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:35,476
where in the world is Osama bin Laden. Sure. Oh, the Morgan Spurlock. Spurlock tried to find

68
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:41,776
America's most wanted, you know, and it's a lot of us just stopping freezing the footage and going,

69
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:48,756
so what happened? We got to crack. We got to get our voices like to up to that register.

70
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:55,136
This is good. We're going to get eight episodes out of this. And then if God willing, another

71
00:06:55,136 --> 00:07:00,416
animatronic is stolen, we get a season two. Sure. And then maybe we are the ones who orchestrated

72
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:07,076
that. Maybe we made Jason go steal. Who knows? I mean, there's a lot to talk about just with the

73
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:11,036
theft. We could do all of a sudden on the theft because what other robots are just hanging around

74
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:16,356
is also my question that we could get like, why would that not be the first thing that you

75
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:21,736
protect take out? It's oddly. I mean, our previous experience of this was botanicals just sitting

76
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:26,436
outside of the parking garage, but they at least didn't. Well, I guess they replaced it with another

77
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:31,676
ride and that's why it moved. Right. But in this case, if you don't know the whole story, this is

78
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:36,776
we're talking about the wonders of life pavilion, which is at Epcot center, but you cannot go into

79
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:42,216
it. And they only open it up for the food and wine festival. So apparently it's just been sitting

80
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:48,016
there. But if you, and there's a lot of like abandoned type videos and urban exploring where

81
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:53,116
your fair thing, Mike backpack man. Oh my God, I can't believe I'm in here. I can't believe that.

82
00:07:53,256 --> 00:08:02,316
What's my favorite modern male fashion style, the tactical dipshit, a lot of traps, awful sunglasses,

83
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:06,316
is very, very weird backpacks with way too many pockets.

84
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:11,896
But certainly not a, not a weapon or anything. They aren't actually prepared for a fight.

85
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:16,476
Yeah. Right. Yeah. So this thing's just been sitting there. And if you watch,

86
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:21,496
like you can learn about what happened to body wars, which is the other main attraction and

87
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:27,436
wonders of life, which was kind of a star tours, I'll say ripoff attraction that was like the same

88
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:33,316
layout had a flight simulators. The flight simulators have been gone for a very long time.

89
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:38,556
So they took the time to take out these massive, you know, hydraulic structures,

90
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:43,896
but the robot was just sitting there and losing his clothes. Yeah. And they have like

91
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:50,856
going to D 23, they have exhibits of old robots. Exactly. They have archives. They have plenty of

92
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:57,296
room somewhere. It's crazy that they wouldn't take the hero of a pretty prominent ride and

93
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:02,296
put him somewhere else. Somewhere. It's crazy. It's kind of like hanging off of a big arm,

94
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:07,176
which is where he sits and that's where he pilots from in the show. So he's just dangling off this

95
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:11,516
thing. Yeah. He could have fallen easily. He could have fallen. Maybe that's how they got him. Well,

96
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:17,716
and they just left it as it was for years. It very quickly became, you know, not possible to restart

97
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:23,996
it with, without major maintenance work. Cause you can't just leave hydraulics without servicing

98
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:30,816
them. Yeah. So a lot of theme park Twitter was upset about that. I'm not that I'm not upset about

99
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:34,236
it, but they were very much like, you know, we would never like, everyone was very much like you

100
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:39,696
shouldn't steal from a ride. It's not as per person's property. I'm assuming it's a man. I

101
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:45,396
don't know why is that it's gotta be a man, right? Who stole the, I believe so. I would guess. It

102
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:52,976
seems like, yeah. Uh, so my first thought was like, well serves Disney, right? For not locking it down

103
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:57,496
like you should have, I think I said on the episode, you should have stolen botanicals.

104
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:02,356
He was rotting. They weren't doing anything. It was garbage. He's a part of theme park history.

105
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:08,116
If Disney's going to let Buzzy rot, let some backpack weirdo go in there and steal them.

106
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:15,556
Let us teach them a lesson. I gotta say, this is just me speaking, but as a kid, I loved the

107
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:22,516
wonders of life pavilion. And I was so sad to see them just let it go to seed. Like even the last,

108
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:27,316
a few times my family went and like, and when I was finishing high school or in college in the

109
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:34,676
summers, I feel like it was so sporadically like open or like, I feel like they just treated it

110
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:40,216
like shit, but I let, I loved both attractions in there, especially today's attraction. I loved

111
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:52,476
cranium command and I love the building. Like I thought the building was really cool and it's

112
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:57,196
that they are like cognizant of like, we need to update this a little.

113
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:02,056
Well, and right next to that weird, that restaurant that just rots the Odyssey,

114
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:09,216
yes. Like how could there be so much of a major theme park that is just unattended and apparently

115
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:14,496
sneak in a bowl because there's also, there's a ton of videos of people somehow wandering it.

116
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:19,516
And they just, I don't think it's even like some stealth Ethan Hunt thing. I think they opened the

117
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:25,816
door and are in, so they didn't bother to lock the door to one of the, one of seven pavilions

118
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:30,236
or whatever. I might be wrong about the number. Don't yell at us, but the, like, it's not that

119
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:36,836
many. How could you lose track of like, how do you not lock the door of one of the only things

120
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:41,856
in your decaying theme park? It's correct. And also speaks to like the lack of security in general,

121
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:46,516
which also scares me a little bit. We were like, in my mind and people have said this, they have,

122
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:51,356
70 plain clothes officers walking around the theme parks and they're ready to spring at a

123
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:55,536
moment's notice when something goes wrong and you're like, oh, that's good. That's reassuring.

124
00:11:55,596 --> 00:12:03,776
Meanwhile, a robot was told a prominent robot. This isn't just a little star of the show. The

125
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:16,496
star robot was stolen and no one knew, no one noticed it. There were no cameras on. They don't

126
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:22,316
made millions of dollars selling like every little, you know, the lid of a trash can from

127
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:28,676
Disneyland that goes for $30,000. How does a robot, how do they not know the value? Why does

128
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:34,896
Disney not want to make the potential hundreds of thousands of dollars by selling Buzzy, even if

129
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:40,896
they aren't going to use it? Yeah, I regret not stealing the robot myself. I regret when I was

130
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:46,596
there for maybe like not the last trip, but the trip before September when Lindsay was, I wish we

131
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:50,816
should have gone in and stolen it. But were you cognizant that he was there? No. Did you know he

132
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:54,196
was there? I didn't know that. That's really the news of all of this. That is the big news. Yeah.

133
00:12:54,216 --> 00:13:00,316
He was left there and you're like, you're a good boy also. You follow the rules, especially at a

134
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:05,936
Disney park. Of course. I would never, but to teach a lesson, sometimes you must break the rules. That

135
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:11,396
is what I believe. It's only just. And also I don't, as I said, I don't think it would have been that

136
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:15,116
hard for you to do. I think it would have taken you 30 seconds and you would have been back in line

137
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:19,476
for test. It would have been easier doing that than like sneaking into a comic-con party at the

138
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:24,196
Hard Rock Hotel, which I've tried to do before as well. That's impossible. The most secure place in California

139
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:29,236
one time of year. Yes. We've, Jason and I have been there. We've snuck into plenty of parties,

140
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:34,116
a Hard Rock one, impossible. I think this Buzzy theft would have been the easiest thing in the world.

141
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:39,856
No false identity required. I think you could have held it in your hands and walked out with it. I

142
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:44,136
think you could just walked it, like held it up like Simba and walked out the exit of Epcot.

143
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:47,856
As long as you were taking selfies and they're like, oh, it's a person who brought a doll to

144
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:52,476
take pictures with. Yeah, sure. Whatever. You were changing his diaper. I thought it was a baby.

145
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:57,556
Just put, yeah. Okay. So there's a naked Buzzy. You have a diaper, put the diaper on Buzzy,

146
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:04,096
put it in a baby carriage and wheel it out. You put your tactical dipshit sunglasses on it.

147
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:12,196
I thought this was a changing station, a giant domed changing station. Should I replace

148
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:19,276
like Buzzy, like Indiana Jones style with a different doll? Like a my buddy doll or

149
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:23,836
like that's a, what's it? Bring an actual child. A child fine. He'll make his way out of there

150
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:28,856
someday. Yeah. But that being said, they will never notice the child's there. So the child will die

151
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:33,596
probably because no one ever goes in there or has any cameras. Anything good. There could be like a

152
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:41,476
weird race of people live like some scavenger race living in the wonders of life. Wow. What else is

153
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:46,436
still there? Like let's think about this. What else is still? Some of those bikes that you pilot around

154
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:52,436
like that. I just remember a lot of like what's the actual, the recumbent bikes. Yeah. That you

155
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:57,996
could go through the parks or go through cities. You could ride through a video of Disneyland and

156
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:05,056
I'm in Disney world watching a fake video. I'm pretending I'm back at home in Disneyland. Yeah.

157
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:11,176
I loved all that shit. Yeah. Yeah. But are there any other things still standing that have robots?

158
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,836
Like are there any, like, cause like river country famously, but they don't have an

159
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:18,736
animatronics, but river country is still kind of standing. Although they're going to be abandoned

160
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:22,756
area with a robot. That's what I'm trying to think of. Wait a minute. If Buzzy was there,

161
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:28,516
is hypothalamus still there? The robot, the other robot character. I think it's very

162
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:33,276
good chance. Hypothalamus is still there. Nobody wants him. He's just on a pole.

163
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:40,376
No one likes hypothalamus. I think you could take a Louisville slugger to that pole. I think you

164
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:44,916
could beat that. You could break that pole in half and get out of there with the top half of

165
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:50,096
the hypothalamus. I mean, right now I think they probably have the security locked down. Well,

166
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:56,216
now I'm just saying before this, I think hypothalamus, I, yeah, I think for sure

167
00:15:56,216 --> 00:16:02,296
hypothalamus is still there. I think you could get on that land boat ride and just pick up like a

168
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:07,336
guy on a rocking chair and walk out with it and no one would care. You can get back on the boat.

169
00:16:07,956 --> 00:16:12,476
Oh yeah. The rocking chair guy. Everyone on the boat is asleep. So that nobody notices.

170
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:18,496
Could you get one of the alligator alligators? Can you stop the ride for a sec? I'm going to grab

171
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:24,816
this. Yeah, sure. No problem. Horizons was demolished. So none of that is still there.

172
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:28,116
I can't, this is a good question. I'm having trouble thinking of anywhere. I don't think so.

173
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:33,936
It would have a robot. It's a unique situation. Right. And Disneyland and California Adventure,

174
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:41,476
I don't think have anything. The real estate is so limited. Knott's Berry Farm. Oh. Let Kingdom of

175
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:46,516
the Dinosaurs sit for a long time. So it's possible that you could have broken in there and stolen a

176
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:52,436
dinosaur. But you know what? Buzzy is perfect for it because he's small. There's no way I'm getting

177
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:56,976
out with Botanicus. There's no way you're getting out with a full dinosaur. With a full dinosaur.

178
00:16:57,156 --> 00:17:02,556
Could you have gotten out with just Botanicus as like leaf clothes? Oh maybe. I could have,

179
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:08,496
if I could have taken the staff. Well the staff is yeah. Just replace it with like a tiki torch.

180
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:16,696
Alt-right. Oh new merch. Alt-right Botanicus. Alt-righticus.

181
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:25,196
Whoever buys that one we are giving to. You're banned. Yeah you're banned and we're giving your

182
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:31,616
name to the government. To the watch list. Yeah. He's using his crystal ball to imagine a world

183
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:37,616
that's cleansed. Yeah at the very least having the Southern Poverty Law Center put you on blast.

184
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:42,636
It's a shame that tiki torch, you can't have a tiki torch now because they still lead the good

185
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:46,476
use of tiki torches. Well I think you can have one in a backyard but I don't think you can hold one.

186
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:51,496
All right no more holding them. Yeah because the tropical hideaway at Disneyland. Right.

187
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:57,436
Presumably, I haven't been there, presumably it has tiki torches but if we all went and picked up

188
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:03,276
the torches and all went like ho! No good. When you see that photo of all of the alt-right guys I

189
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:10,356
can imagine they're all they're all screaming like Howard Dean screams ho! 70 of them at once.

190
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:16,556
So hands off the torches and it's fine. Okay that's fine. Well I guess at this point we go

191
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:23,696
backwards and figure out how we got to this point. How we got to this ride in general. Yeah how did we get to

192
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:29,796
this? I mean like I said I loved this ride as a kid. I loved creating a command. I loved

193
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:34,796
the Wonders of Life pavilion. I feel like it's another thing where it's like you are

194
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:40,796
leaving money on the table by not having more throwback merch for that. Like letting this go

195
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:46,776
to seed. It reminds me of I know I've talked about this on the show like Marvel just letting the X-men

196
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:51,756
kind of languish for many years in the comp because they were so they're like well we have to publish

197
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:57,076
the comics because they they do make money. Well they wanted to kill it because Fox owned the movie

198
00:18:57,076 --> 00:19:04,276
rights. But there were so many kids like when we were people our age there were so many kids who

199
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:09,116
grew up loving the X-men so much it's like you were just leaving money on the table same thing.

200
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:16,876
They did do Buzzy and General Knowledge, Vinylmations about four or five years ago. But very little.

201
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:22,516
There's no merchandise for all of the parts of the body. There's no Halloween costumes for right

202
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:27,096
in the brain. You gotta make your own. Well they probably have to pay rights for Hans and Franz.

203
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:33,376
Yeah but they're generic Hans and Franz. Yeah that's the thing. You know they use the catch phrases of Hans and Franz.

204
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:41,496
Hans and Franz wear gray sweats. These got left and right ventricle have big muscly arms so they are

205
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:47,656
different. This is getting ahead of ourselves but did Lorne have to sign off on the use of them or

206
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:52,436
did he know even? I can only imagine because I think he has to sign off on anybody doing anything.

207
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:57,896
Probably Lovitz doing it. Right there's that famous David Spade story of him trying to like wanting to

208
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:02,156
do like a million dollar commercial for the Super Bowl while he was on the show and Lorne said no.

209
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:07,716
Oh no. That's the old days too because now I think Lorne would love it. Yeah but Spade has a story.

210
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:14,376
Every SNL cast member is in constant commercials. Yeah that's the dream now. Right but back in the

211
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:19,696
day he didn't like that. Yeah. He prevented him from doing it. But then I love the idea of somebody

212
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:25,536
coming on. Look at Lorne. There's a Disney World ride and they want to use Dana and Kevin and Hans.

213
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:34,436
We're lip-cocks in a place where they can appeal to the kids. It's kind of got a world's fair vibe.

214
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:39,876
I know all about the edutainment industry. I know. I know. I'm doing that Bradberry thing.

215
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:49,576
I gotta find out if he ever knew about this. Yeah yeah yeah. I hope he doesn't find out about

216
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:57,876
those impressions or we're screwed. But yeah I think like I think the fondness for this thing

217
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:03,996
does come from it was kind of the first Disney World or the first Epcot thing rather pretty

218
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:10,916
specifically for kids. Like everything was pretty unfriendly and grown up and super educational.

219
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:18,316
This thing's educational as well but with these actors with with Carvey and you know with Charles

220
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:24,256
Grodin. Now we're getting into what the kids like. I mean my guy. What year does this open again? 89.

221
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:31,876
89 yeah so it's like so pre-Beethoven Grodin. Yeah yeah. Where would a kid have known him from at that point?

222
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:38,056
Pre-Clifford Grodin. Right. Maybe mid-Clifford. I think Clifford took like oh yeah Clifford was

223
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:42,676
a shoot and just sat on the shelf for a long time. Yeah they shot Clifford and like with

224
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:48,096
540. Yeah how many years later? It was crazy. Yeah and then with another Epcot man Martin Short.

225
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:54,596
Oh that's right. Yeah just down the way and making the Clifford cast was owning the part.

226
00:21:54,956 --> 00:22:01,236
No Mary Steenburgen. Well Mary Steenburgen I think attended the opening of the Back to the Future

227
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:07,736
ride but is not featured therein. Right. And that's how the cast of Clifford fits into the theme park universe.

228
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:16,096
You wanted to know. It's something else that that is like cabin boy level oddball movie. Yeah yeah.

229
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:23,276
I don't know how often today also that you're seeing somebody play wildly not their type. Oh

230
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:29,056
with a 40 year old man playing a child. Yeah yeah which sort of would things like that would happen

231
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:36,796
more often back then I feel. I guess I guess the is in Little Man the Wayans Brothers movie is

232
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:46,656
Marlon Wayans a short person playing a baby. What is the plot of Little Man? Oh what is the plot of Little Man?

233
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:52,456
All I've ever seen is the clip of him like we're like a woman he puts his like little baby head

234
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:57,436
to a woman's bosom and he likes it and that's all I know and I was like I think he's like an older

235
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:03,776
person. The movie should have been a Vine it should have been that scene the end. Right. It might be

236
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:09,036
you got to the theater and there's just a title card that says that was it you saw it don't tell

237
00:23:09,036 --> 00:23:14,176
anybody there's no movie here. All right. Here with this booze for you in the back. Your secret save with me.

238
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:23,836
Your secret save with me Little Man. Let's see the plot is Calvin babyface Sims who is a very short

239
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:33,636
convict. Okay so he's a very short man who pretends to be a baby. So he's literally a little man. He's

240
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:40,776
close to Clifford syndrome as you're getting today. Let's bring back this genre. Let's get more man babies

241
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:47,656
in our films. So yeah we were saying so this attraction opened in 89 the pavilion opened in 89

242
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:55,136
little after the the actual opening of Epcot. It was in the original plans there was a doesn't

243
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:03,616
this sound thrilling a health and life pavilion. Doesn't that sound exciting? Yeah I'm glad they

244
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:10,716
Yeah and the things in it sounded fairly dry. Oh like a show called Head Trip that would share

245
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:18,716
space with a dentistry themed show called Tooth Follies. Oh the Tooth Follies. I wish Tooth Follies existed.

246
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:25,136
So bad because Tooth Follies it seems fake it seems like there's no way they would ever make a

247
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:30,396
thing called Tooth Follies. But how would they all be different from each other? The teeth you mean?

248
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:36,336
Yeah assuming that it is teeth coming to life. It would have to be teeth coming to life. Yeah let's

249
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:43,176
think on that. We got molars, we got baby teeth, got canine, got uh maybe like a fang comes in.

250
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:48,296
Did you call them front boys? Those two front boys? You call your two front teeth front boys?

251
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:57,616
My front boys? Well and for sure it would have the food rocks situation of the the rotten uh the bad

252
00:24:57,876 --> 00:25:04,356
guys who were like and like who like sucked up sugar and like didn't want to be rejected the

253
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:13,636
brush say no to brushes and they like they try to poison the whole thing. Dave Thomas is the bad

254
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:21,296
tooth or something. I'm trying to think of other like sc tv level stars of the time. Oh sure. We

255
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:25,996
were just watching clips uh over the break of Follow That Bird and it's Dave Thomas is the bad

256
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:34,336
guy and Joe Flaherty. I'll put hey I'll put this on the Scott is scared uh follow that bird. Uh Miss

257
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:41,136
Finch. Oh. The I am scared still today from childhood of Miss Finch. There's a part where

258
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:46,016
she laid just any part where she like pulls up and like leans out of the van and just kind of goes

259
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:54,316
hmm I am scared of that. When she's chasing Big Bird through the parade, like that to me was like

260
00:25:54,516 --> 00:26:00,896
the space that Chucky occupies for probably a lot of kids. My wife for sure. Uh I have like Miss

261
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:06,876
Finch is the worst whore. That's my it. I hear you. I guess I have seen that. Is it this is Big Bird

262
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:13,136
gets lost? Well Big Bird kind of a road trip and gets adopted by a bird family but they're weird.

263
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:16,456
I should not have. This is going to be another this should have been episode full episode but I

264
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:20,496
should have not have mentioned Follow That Bird but uh Miss Finch yeah this is where Big Bird ends

265
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:26,216
up in like a circus essentially yeah and like is a blue which is another saddest thing ever

266
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:32,136
fucking thing all my feelings are contained in this movie but I know I saw it multiple times

267
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:37,076
as a kid I thought it was some like sctv spin-off movie or something for a second where you're

268
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:42,036
talking about Dave Thomas and Joe Flaherty. They're in it they're these kind of like bad like carnival

269
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:46,816
barker guys they're like they're the Pinocchio like well round you up put you in a cage they're

270
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:52,696
very good they're very funny in it yeah John Candy's in it at some point uh Chevy Chase is

271
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:59,196
the news guy I liked that a lot as a kid I think Lorraine Newman does a voice. I'm gonna admit uh

272
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:06,676
that is a big hole in my comedic education I really have not seen much sctv. I haven't a ton

273
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:12,416
except for this one this thing where uh Rick Moranis is in a pink suit and he sings

274
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:19,396
this bizarre lounge easy listening version of Downtown the Patula Clark song with background

275
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:24,356
vocals from like a ghostly Michael McDonald who's not there this is my favorite I mean there's the

276
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:28,896
more famous Michael McDonald right Moranis sketch where he's like rushing in to do the

277
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:34,296
background parts on Red Like the Wind both of those sketches are phenomenal they make me laugh

278
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:40,656
so this Downtown one is not that known oh my god it is so and he's like just in this horrible suit

279
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:47,116
just strolling around weird shady parts of Toronto uh I can't I'm not gonna do justice describing it

280
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:51,416
it's so funny sctv I don't know now we're talking sctv we're getting back to Cranium Creme but sctv

281
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:59,936
is a much like tighter show than early SNL oh yeah I mean it's not live. I think by design it was post SNL and I think it was there like they were like we're not

282
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:05,056
gonna let the talent go to SNL anymore we're gonna do this our way and we're gonna do it tighter and

283
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:12,016
with um and cinematically and you know nail these styles in a way that SNL can't because they're live

284
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:20,296
and closer to an actual like second city company yes review yes for sure um follow up the big thing

285
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:27,056
up to me about sctv is like when those when all those guys were off the show like they just

286
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:33,996
dominated yeah right oh yeah 90s like just killer everything you could name from all of those guys

287
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:40,896
there's obviously everything Rick Moranis is in John Candy Katherine O'Hara all when you add up all

288
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:45,336
the parlor John Hughes movies and Home Alone and everything Rick Moranis and Ghostbusters and

289
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:52,336
like god what a like assassin squad of comic actors Eugene Levy holy shit yeah it is wild

290
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:59,616
to see everybody from there because it feels that feels like the most successful sketch comedy cast

291
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:05,136
of all time yeah got about it and it's so many of them made it to blockbusters like even the ones

292
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:10,276
that aren't the star the top build star of the movie and they came out of the gate quick too

293
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:16,276
like splash Eugene Levy John Candy amazing in that gigantic hit movie bringing us back to Disney

294
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:22,956
sure a little bit but like yeah hey this is just a good earnest yeah discussion of uh

295
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:28,536
anyway they'll play the teeth they'll play the teeth in teeth follies though if this were back

296
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:35,416
in time that might have been the era you're all sct people sctv people in uh uh Disney attractions

297
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:41,616
are there much and well Moranis is in Honey I Shrunk Fear and Martin Short is in three things right

298
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:48,236
a bunch yeah yeah yeah quite a few um and then i'm trying to think yeah is John Candy ever in a ride

299
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:54,116
or anything i don't know it seems like Eugene Levy should be in a theme park attraction oh yeah

300
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:58,196
isn't that waiting to happen yeah well we'll look into this someone's like screaming at their phone

301
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:04,096
right now because there's like a voice someone did a voice in the cartoon and then they reprised it

302
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:10,796
and ride and yeah yeah yeah yeah probably actually relatedly uh i do have a little here i'll take

303
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:16,636
voices out of it just for good to make to crunch this a little okay can you guys name on camera

304
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:23,476
appearances from SNL cast members in theme park attractions i have a count of six

305
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:28,756
and not including cranium command including cranium command which is so that's three of them

306
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:33,816
well Martin Short is an SNL cast member too so many of those things a ton of them oh canada

307
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:41,376
monster sound show cinema g and making with me right uh race through new york my man of course

308
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:47,216
you got it yes that's one one more though there's one more uh i'm trying to think

309
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:57,816
hint i just named it it was in a list that i said oh oh shit disney or universal disney okay man

310
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:02,696
this isn't good podcasting again it's a lot of silence building tension just say it again we'll

311
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:09,036
need to build tension when we do the true crime buzzy thing yeah we're like the hydraulic fluid

312
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:16,736
left alone for that long develops a deep crimson shade so it looks like this crime scene of blood

313
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,176
where buzzy once sat controlling the child well and we'll need to like we'll fill every we'll

314
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:26,256
we'll need more air in the podcast and we'll have to have that music that all the podcasts have like

315
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:37,876
it's always american beauty podcast music is locked in american beauty from 1999 and you know

316
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:45,116
like in a very sinister voice reading cadet benny is 24 years old benny is twice as old as cadet

317
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:52,056
an was when benny was as old as and is now how old is cadet an that's one of the that's one of the

318
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:56,676
trivia question from the line yeah that's one of the trivia questions from the line oh okay

319
00:31:56,676 --> 00:32:07,816
well to answer this trivia question uh chevy chase is the answer do you know the ride it's

320
00:32:07,836 --> 00:32:15,756
a phone show oh sounds dangerous with jerry i guess people are not i don't remember that

321
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:22,176
yeah well we'll hit that one when we're uh really in the dregs and that's it there's no those are

322
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:28,036
all the on camera with his voices right that's uh that'll be too long to to say but that's i mean

323
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:33,276
okay the the to get back on track i think the bigger point here is that i think it was maybe

324
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:41,356
little unusual to have current uh comedians and pop cult like recognizable pop culture figures in

325
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:46,516
theme park attractions right a little more common now still not a ton but i think they were like

326
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:52,916
in this era at mgm studios and with cranium command they were starting to break into that a little

327
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:58,956
bit um and i heard an interview with the director of cranium commands jerry reese jerry reese who

328
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:03,776
another sounds dangerous connection oh he sounds dangerous he sounds dangerous jerry reese's website

329
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:10,196
lists all he has been involved with like 16 disney attractions there's so many so many uh

330
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:15,976
uh i mean michael and mickey is one i don't know if people remember this super well but if you never

331
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:23,016
got to see it there's this great it like played at on the disney mgm tour where like mickey gets

332
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:28,576
michael eisner to round up all of the characters to go to a screening on the lot and it's very

333
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:34,036
charming and mickey michael has a mickey watch and mickey has a michael eisner watch i think

334
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:40,156
that's still one of my favorite things they're leaving money on the table by not selling a

335
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:45,576
michael eisner watch oh yeah if we can figure out how to miscell watches yeah well let me let me ask

336
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:52,356
you a question uh i keep sidetracking but i am a big toy guy statue guy if they sold like a

337
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:57,396
reasonably price and i'm saying reasonable 50 to 100 yeah it was like a nice michael eisner doll

338
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:02,936
with mickey there and it had maybe the watch gag in it would you want it yeah yeah yeah like

339
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:08,896
i'm not a really a toy guy and i would get it i was like i think scott would want this you have

340
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:14,556
a small collection of things but i think that's in my wheelhouse they're missing out not licensing

341
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:23,176
eisner i think yeah he should license out his like classic like young whatever age he was in the 80s

342
00:34:23,176 --> 00:34:28,436
yes because that is he's almost more iconic to walt than me because that's what i grew up with

343
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:32,716
right and walt now is everywhere and they have these big paintings they sell in the different

344
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:38,676
art stores on main street and like there's no eisner and eisner was such a big part of all of

345
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:45,436
these things yeah it would be funny yeah time has passed and so now we're raising him up too soon

346
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:51,516
for our eiger dolls we don't need no i don't know he needs more time on camera watching him

347
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:56,876
introduce the star wars thing on the christmas parade this year was weird he also i feel like

348
00:34:56,876 --> 00:35:02,656
changed topic too fast there was no he was like happy holidays to everyone i hope you're having

349
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:08,616
a wonderful holiday season star wars is coming up and like there was no it was a real rough

350
00:35:08,616 --> 00:35:17,596
he's got to learn seg with the art of segways right which eisner obviously brilliant perfect on camera

351
00:35:17,676 --> 00:35:22,196
perfect on camera yes all those eisner watches i'm buying all the eisner merch

352
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:27,476
eisner merch i'm so curious again leave the money on the table they're leaving money on the table

353
00:35:27,476 --> 00:35:35,096
with like with karate chop action great uh getting stars to fall in line uh i'm thinking like a

354
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:38,496
hundred hey jeff daniels you think you're you really think you're getting an extra

355
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:44,996
500 grand for arachnophobia like a hundred like i have this batman 60s toy up here that's very

356
00:35:45,056 --> 00:35:49,516
detailed and has a lot of like posability that level michael eisner detailed doll

357
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:55,056
with a little mickey i think is the way to go yeah and then sell that on the in the statue and

358
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:59,596
art store like batman he's holding a big bomb but it's the in his case it's the film canister

359
00:35:59,596 --> 00:36:06,916
for the movie powder is there a better disney bomb from his era well the plans for california

360
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:12,256
adventure sure oh yeah yeah poke fun in it anyway when we have eyes around the show which people

361
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:17,256
i've been noticing over tweeting at him and his son to do our show oh yeah that makes me please

362
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:23,136
don't bother too much breck is a very busy and successful yeah but i have a part of me let him

363
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:28,116
do it on his own terms whenever breck whenever you want to come around we have it yeah part of me

364
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:35,036
thinks we could get michael easier than breck yeah maybe but i think he likes to talk he had like a

365
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:40,316
yeah he had a show on cnbc for a little while yes kind of in conversation he talked to lauren

366
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:48,636
for a while maybe they established their friendship when he asked to can we get lovitz and carvey and

367
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:56,896
neil and so that's i that's i think how we got to the this was an early instance of of stars of the

368
00:36:56,896 --> 00:37:03,256
time and especially this to me stars of their time like playing their game doing their shtick i mean

369
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:09,616
bobcats there he's doing oh yeah yeah absolutely well well no oh sorry okay oh uh you know hans

370
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:15,656
and franz unofficial hans unlicensed hans and franz uh grodin just one of the best straight

371
00:37:15,656 --> 00:37:21,356
men of all time one of the best voices reasonable time yeah yeah yeah yeah and george went is very

372
00:37:21,356 --> 00:37:27,856
much in his zone right when yeah i think um well so i heard an interview i think this was on uh

373
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:31,716
season pass our friends of the season pass podcast they interviewed jerry reese who

374
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:37,176
dragged ended up directing cranium command he also directed back to neverland which was another

375
00:37:37,176 --> 00:37:43,396
this was a thing on the disney m disney m james studios tour as well uh where walter cronkite is

376
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:49,536
reporting uh from the theme park or something and then robin williams as not named as robin

377
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:54,416
williams but he's a tourist who's you know doing shtick like robin williams he comes up and like

378
00:37:54,416 --> 00:38:00,356
takes a tour and gets animated and learns about animation in the process and ends up in neverland

379
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:06,456
and making hijinks in a robin williams way there was apparently according to jerry reese some

380
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:11,356
general consternation about this like well aren't the theme parks kind of this escapist world and

381
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:16,216
why would you have just robin williams doing his robin williams thing and he said well if you think

382
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:25,236
about it panocchio the voice of uh jiminy cricket in the 40s was recognizable as that comedian doing

383
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:32,456
his oh yeah edwin edwin absolutely yes a guy you might know from tv or movies and and we'll do a

384
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:37,516
cartoon character who's like him right phil harris the voice of blue was like a boisterous

385
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:44,836
kind of drunky radio guy uh so like uh so it was actually playing into a tradition more than

386
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:50,256
anybody thought and kind of updating it back to neverland went over so well that they apparently

387
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:56,516
started just throwing stuff jerry reese like can you fix this can you be part of this there was

388
00:38:56,516 --> 00:39:01,776
some little thing on the tour where he directed george lucas setting up a clip or something or

389
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:10,136
thus the night of the opening of disney mgm studios george lucas and eisner take him aside

390
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:15,996
and like hey jerry can you fix this indiana jones stunt show for us we just feel like it's not

391
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:20,456
there's no like i don't know it doesn't have any heart there's no build there's no story

392
00:39:20,456 --> 00:39:26,096
so now so this guy all of a sudden is just everywhere like like lucas needs him to do

393
00:39:26,756 --> 00:39:33,156
these things where he's a fix it guy is cranium command um which is about was having a lot of

394
00:39:33,156 --> 00:39:38,736
problems and was a like hated project within the company at the time yeah well they had outsourced

395
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:45,716
the animation to a different company and it was coming out apparently was all coming out they were

396
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:51,096
they were giving them and imagineering like they were following the directives but it seemed like

397
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:58,756
coming out very dry and like i think they said like oh you know like those 1940s informational

398
00:39:58,756 --> 00:40:05,016
films they show in schools and it seems like they were making that and it was dry and kind of

399
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:13,336
condescending and not super funny yeah and i maybe you saw the same thing as me i found a list of

400
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:19,796
like what so they had uh they had jerry reese watch a cut of it and so a lot of the pieces of

401
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:25,996
this were there there was a uh there was there was like you know guys in your head controlling

402
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:31,756
your body uh general knowledge i think the character was still in there but it wasn't

403
00:40:31,756 --> 00:40:40,116
buzzy wasn't buzzy yeah it was a guy named captain cortex which sucks like that i disagree with that

404
00:40:40,116 --> 00:40:49,776
you think that's okay i don't say it's great but i don't think it's i don't know if you tell me

405
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:54,336
yeah i mean it's pleasing to the ear but i think that comes from it was a lot harder

406
00:40:54,336 --> 00:41:00,656
a harder star trek bridge parody like i don't need to get so hardcore yet buzzy's kind of a rex rip

407
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:06,436
off in my mind i was thinking he's rex he's not as good as rex and i think i'm i look down a little

408
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:11,436
bit on him because of that i like his design but i feel like i know that you're getting sad

409
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:19,336
but buzzy is a poor man's rex is all i'll say oh i'm sorry jason's got i hear what you're saying

410
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:26,736
the harshness of it i'm being a little harsh maybe i'm i have five hours of sleep but maybe

411
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:32,656
that's just me today harsh for the the sake of humor uh you'll put your differences we'll put our

412
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,756
differences aside i may be taking this personally because we were texting over the holidays and i

413
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:42,636
said i'm gonna get ahead of this now i know i resemble buzzy and like set a side-by-side picture

414
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:48,696
where i had drawn the hats and the headphones on myself jason sharon which i will post yes please

415
00:41:48,696 --> 00:41:55,476
jason shared and for buzzy on disney plus the new cranium command tv show let's start that going

416
00:41:55,476 --> 00:42:01,436
now okay so in addition to the true crime podcast about the finding of buzzy right there is also we

417
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:09,336
will also have a narrative show in which jason is buzzy yeah cross platform four quadrants all

418
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:14,716
the words all the buzz phrases there'll be a tier you pay for on disney plus it's just cranium

419
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:20,396
command based programming it's an extra five dollars on top of the regular fee well you know

420
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:27,696
what's there's a lot there because you there's all of the workplace drama within the head right it's

421
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:34,336
it's yeah jason is buzzy uh you know trying to keep the gang together it's kind of a uh it's kind

422
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:40,156
of a 30 rock sort of like everybody's a kook in my office but we got to unite for the common goal

423
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:46,416
and then you can also do wonder years style coming of age stuff with the boy whose body

424
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:51,616
you're piloting oh yeah and then you can do like some prestige stuff like he discovered like

425
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:58,456
has to cope with a death in the family or like if you really want to like cranium command of like

426
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:06,336
kid from gummo like oh god really dark art movie sort of cranium command yeah i mean every genre

427
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:11,996
and the potential for cranium command all the actors that appeared in the ride aren't on a tv

428
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:16,696
show right now and could easily do the show we could have going through it and yeah you're right

429
00:43:16,696 --> 00:43:22,496
they're all available wow so that's we'll line that up once we get everything else they're all

430
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:26,976
still around they're all still around and i think all of those people are very funny they're great

431
00:43:26,976 --> 00:43:33,536
everyone's great what a good cast so we've already got a perfect cast now led up by jason sherdin and

432
00:43:33,576 --> 00:43:42,036
anybody ever needed to leave here's what happens like if you know if george went wants out then

433
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:49,216
the kid gets sick needs a stomach transplant a transplant yeah you know a stomach transplant

434
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:53,976
yeah that thing that happens all the time and and you and you so he and that's a very dramatic

435
00:43:53,976 --> 00:44:01,516
episode as well and then you end up with a new uh i don't know who josh gad sure i mean he's busy

436
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:09,536
but i'm hungry i'm hungry um we can do i'll put mitch on the list oh yeah sure i'll submit it to

437
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:13,776
disney it's up to them if if that's gonna work for him i think mitch would knock it out of the park

438
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:21,436
i agree 100 we believe in mitch uh so this is oh my god great ideas left and right we can barely

439
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:29,076
focus on i know the actual on the ride we're just trying we're trying to stay it's just the joy of

440
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:35,976
ride is pulling us away from the disaster of uh how it started i know it's a bummer to think about

441
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:41,876
uh that there was ever a time when this wasn't working so apparently all right so the so they

442
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:48,496
show a cut of it to jerry reeves and a cut of this is very confusing because if you have not been on

443
00:44:48,496 --> 00:44:54,516
this attraction you are inside a head and there are there is a animatronic doing a lot of the

444
00:44:54,516 --> 00:44:59,656
lifting who's going back and forth on an arm there's two screens that are the eyes there's

445
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:06,636
other screens that are the where the various parts of the body pop up and uh do their status reports

446
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:13,516
so imagine trying to piece this together how do you possibly edit this thing it's so many components

447
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:22,276
all sinking up so they show jerry reeves some version of this uh he said as you said jason this

448
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:28,176
it's very obvious and patronizing uh it's it's like talking down to you it's too educational

449
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:35,796
uh the i screens were only used occasionally and then shut off so there's these are like the the

450
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:41,576
biggest screens in the theater and they are black for a ton of the show and he's like no no this

451
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:46,916
needs to be madcap we need that needs to always be on and little sequences the kids running to get

452
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:52,776
the bus and he's in a food fight and all these pov things that'll be tough to pull off but look

453
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:59,416
really cool uh and he also i think all of the body parts that they fleshed too were animated and not

454
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:04,356
live action so that was one of his pitches was well if we don't have a lot of time here

455
00:46:04,356 --> 00:46:10,696
let's only animate the pre-show uh and the general the rest of it let's do live action and let's have

456
00:46:10,696 --> 00:46:15,216
these recognizable actors so instead of building all this mythology it's like oh george wendt i

457
00:46:15,216 --> 00:46:21,076
know him uh uh uh charles groden i know him and you can plug right into their appeal yeah and it

458
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:26,196
seems like they they were able to accomplish that pretty easily because when you break down what the

459
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:31,776
actual production is you shoot all the pov stuff in the school and the house and stuff and then

460
00:46:31,776 --> 00:46:38,696
they went to sound stages and shot each comedian and like it was very interesting reading about

461
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:45,696
like okay so they had to like match shots and use blur so like the eyes looked right and stuff and

462
00:46:45,696 --> 00:46:51,376
then when he was shooting the comedians they had a monitor playing the the other the live action

463
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:58,716
footage they had shot from the kids pov really just incredible thinking about this and i i saw

464
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:07,596
an anecdote about it the the ad on it then after this went and worked on t2 judgment day and he

465
00:47:07,596 --> 00:47:13,476
this was the best training for that because that was so insanely complex of a production wow it's

466
00:47:13,476 --> 00:47:19,936
so deceptively complicated yeah because like the thing is very fast and i think most as we usually

467
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:24,636
the barometer is like most dads wander into the riot and they're like okay yeah got it okay and

468
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:28,536
then they leave but like if you really think about breaking it down and how you have to coordinate

469
00:47:28,536 --> 00:47:35,956
all of it it's pretty crazy there's a ton go and all the mediums it is cell animation apparently

470
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:42,076
the last disney product fully done in the traditional yeah like in can paint style

471
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:48,316
you know other things still used a lot of that but not entirely front to back i believe at the

472
00:47:48,316 --> 00:47:54,436
newly opened disney mgm studios animation wing oh they oh that's right that was also on the

473
00:47:54,436 --> 00:48:00,456
jerry reese interview that you if you went it right when the park opened if you took a tour of

474
00:48:00,456 --> 00:48:05,316
the animation facilities the they take the first place they take you is the storyboard room and

475
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:11,796
they were storyboarding cranium command a future attraction for just up the road so yeah like yeah

476
00:48:11,796 --> 00:48:17,536
live action and pov and robots all of this working together and apparently when jerry reese had to

477
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:24,276
show rough cuts of this thing it was like unwatchable and katzberg is sitting in this

478
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:28,736
going like i guess i just got to trust you here because i don't know what i'm looking at i don't

479
00:48:28,736 --> 00:48:33,156
like uh and it i think it didn't really come together until the last minute which they gave

480
00:48:34,116 --> 00:48:39,096
once jerry reese gave notes on it then they gave it's like all right you fix it you have like free

481
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:45,536
rain but this we've used half the budget and you have to do it in this time frame like it is

482
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:51,576
it's crazy how complex it is and how it's still like watching the video of it i was like this

483
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:58,876
still holds up this holds up better than journey into your imagination a ride still into in the

484
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:05,356
everything holds up better than that yeah i know but it's it's weird i mean it's yeah it plays it

485
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:13,196
plays well yeah yeah and it's all very dynamic and i think the the style or like the rushed timeline

486
00:49:13,196 --> 00:49:19,676
created some fun stylistic stuff oh yeah they that's i think why they had to do uh cut out

487
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:25,296
sort of monty python terry gilliam style in the pre-show if you if you watch the pre-show like the

488
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:30,956
commandos get inside their heads and the and the heads are live action and they like climb up into

489
00:49:30,956 --> 00:49:36,116
them uh which i associated at the time as you can't do that i was gonna say that yeah what i think

490
00:49:36,116 --> 00:49:40,316
i'm gonna go no no that's monty python they stole that from yeah i had to learn that that that was

491
00:49:40,316 --> 00:49:46,616
not a like an open style anybody could do that was terry gilliam that scared me too as a kid uh

492
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:53,016
just in general oh the idea of your being head cracking open too like i who i hated it yeah yeah

493
00:49:53,176 --> 00:49:59,096
that pre-show of course the first directing job for kirk wise and gary truesdale yes that's another

494
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:06,156
thing that's crazy too is that situation that um that was their first directing job and catzenberg

495
00:50:06,156 --> 00:50:11,636
liked that short so much he may have liked it more more than the actual that's what he said he goes

496
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:16,556
this is better than the ride it's better than the ride and so he gave them it's like hey can you

497
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:26,816
take it over and that feature was beauty and the beast yeah god which also had a yeah they were

498
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:32,556
there was a director who had to get fired from that right so yeah oh my god yeah you handled that

499
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:39,676
little pre-show so well please make this oscar caliber but similar problems like it wasn't

500
00:50:39,676 --> 00:50:46,536
funny it was like it was too serious so is that right they they they had done this funny pre-show

501
00:50:46,536 --> 00:50:52,216
and and they got to do this uh should also say jerry reese directed a movie i really liked as a

502
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:58,896
kid the brave little toaster yeah sure um which is i mean already i think that's a great uh work

503
00:50:58,896 --> 00:51:04,476
uh it is the best i think of what i call the upsetting era of animation we're talking create

504
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:11,896
mouse detective land before time uh american tale the first one less the second one all dog go all

505
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:19,256
it's good to have and probably the most upsetting one rockadoodle rockadoodle upset me because it

506
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:26,176
was always lightning storms and tornadoes and he couldn't see lost his voice and he finally gets

507
00:51:26,176 --> 00:51:31,136
it back but just wait rockadoodle was most upsetting to you as a child stressed me out

508
00:51:31,136 --> 00:51:41,876
rockadoodle obviously the scariest movie ever made is follow that bird are you crazy jason that's a

509
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:46,536
yeah he isn't elvis chicken but he's like washed up elvis chicken for a lot of the movie

510
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:52,796
the idea of struggling in an industry stressed you out as well that you were preparing for later

511
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:59,876
oh yeah um yeah all dogs go to heaven is about dogs dying i mean i hear that yeah you you may

512
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:03,736
also in that list missed secretive nym which i don't know very well but isn't that fairly upsetting

513
00:52:03,736 --> 00:52:08,876
and very so i think so black collard is very dark as well what about fern golly i don't know

514
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:16,016
there's darkness yeah the smog is very upsetting i think too though that is like 90s like i think

515
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:22,136
in the 90s you saw a brighter color palette like and i found that more rescuers down under

516
00:52:22,136 --> 00:52:31,036
fern go is it yeah yeah yeah yeah that's like 93 isn't it wow i'm also uh also very upset by

517
00:52:31,036 --> 00:52:37,796
rover danger field i mean seeing seeing it and seeing a poor defenseless animal get no respect

518
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:46,476
more setting than these sort of dark uh rockadoodles 91 sorry oh okay so so tail end but

519
00:52:46,476 --> 00:52:51,436
little mermaid rescuers down under fern gult you saw a brighter looking animated films and i think

520
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:56,916
i found that more at ease well oliver and company brighter looking forget the dark poster of rock

521
00:52:56,916 --> 00:53:03,636
a doodle see but that's that's so bright not accurate to the movie because he's just constantly

522
00:53:03,636 --> 00:53:06,976
i gotta watch rockadoodle i've never seen rockadoodle yeah me neither we gotta watch

523
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:13,476
what you're talking about i watched it a lot too because we had it on vhs i mean look at the

524
00:53:13,476 --> 00:53:18,016
trailer for rock a great mouse detective i think i was comforted by like well he's clearly a

525
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:23,656
sherlock holmes type like i knew the concept of sure he is a hero he'll figure this out

526
00:53:23,656 --> 00:53:30,016
i will tell you i will say this in to to defend you now rockadoodle is darker than that poster

527
00:53:30,016 --> 00:53:34,616
it is like a little bit of trailer you're watching yeah just a little like darker color palette

528
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:40,876
um and it doesn't look like the fun romp i always imagined all right we gotta we gotta do it

529
00:53:40,876 --> 00:53:50,136
just gripping this uh you know uh erinovsky-esque um dramatic film it's like the cool world right

530
00:53:50,136 --> 00:53:55,316
i mean if i had to write like a term paper i would probably and it's people have already

531
00:53:55,316 --> 00:54:00,616
probably talked about this where it's like all of those movies and like the pre of those movies

532
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:07,016
black cauldron all that crap all the scratchy dark looking disney and other animated movies

533
00:54:07,016 --> 00:54:11,736
it's probably like oh is this the first or second generation that really grew up with feature life

534
00:54:11,736 --> 00:54:17,416
cartoons and now they have their own ideas but they want to push the limits they want to make

535
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:30,596
it dark like oh maybe yeah well and it also seems like that 80s when disney was not before the

536
00:54:30,596 --> 00:54:35,596
kind of darker in general was a disney at some point correct i believe he was i think so

537
00:54:35,596 --> 00:54:40,336
forgetting another name in the in the darkness i mean like uh it wasn't laster originally involved

538
00:54:40,336 --> 00:54:45,796
with brave little toaster yes and they didn't want to do it and then he just made a different

539
00:54:45,796 --> 00:54:50,716
version of it called toy story oh were they so were they sort of affiliated well just like in

540
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:55,696
the sense that it's like not human like little characters going on adventure like there's a lot

541
00:54:55,696 --> 00:55:00,856
of humanized inanimate objects yeah anthropomorphize and toy story originally

542
00:55:00,856 --> 00:55:06,816
notoriously the the like animatic storyboard cut of it was very horrible yeah depressing and

543
00:55:06,816 --> 00:55:12,316
woody was an asshole and uh so a lot of these things i think start i yeah i don't know i think

544
00:55:12,316 --> 00:55:17,076
there's something about animation i guess that's so like you know nebulous that you can end up with

545
00:55:17,076 --> 00:55:22,356
something that just i don't know this should work that we got funny voices we got good artists and

546
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:27,016
why doesn't it work yeah it's kind of magical when it like does all come together there is a

547
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:33,716
figure by the way in this i have i have a lot of like i'll hey dry facts ahead i wrote down there's

548
00:55:33,716 --> 00:55:38,716
some pretty interesting like personnel on this on cranium command in general especially the pre-show

549
00:55:38,716 --> 00:55:44,076
and there's a figure i found who i hadn't heard of before who's uh you know maybe part of navigating

550
00:55:44,076 --> 00:55:50,136
animation out of what you're talking about into the brighter zone uh this guy named david pruixma

551
00:55:50,136 --> 00:55:56,276
who was the main character animator of buzzy in the pre-show uh he's he's he had a nickname at

552
00:55:56,276 --> 00:56:02,436
cowlarts where a lot of these guys came from he was the king of cute and uh and he applied that

553
00:56:02,436 --> 00:56:07,836
buzzy certainly one of buzzy's pretty adorable if there was i bet captain cortex was not as

554
00:56:07,836 --> 00:56:12,816
sort of rambunctious relatable as buzzy right so he made the character cuter made the whole thing

555
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:20,036
work he went on to animate the seahorse messenger and little mermaid oh he did mrs pots and

556
00:56:20,996 --> 00:56:26,336
in uh beating the beast like the supervising animator of these parts the sultan in aladdin

557
00:56:26,336 --> 00:56:31,056
another short retunned lovable roly poly guy i like that

558
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:39,656
you have yourself career in much better shape than the sultan i try to work out uh and uh and

559
00:56:39,656 --> 00:56:46,196
he apparently uh well oh i think i missed uh pumba i think he works in pumba and then uh

560
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:53,616
personally animated almost every frame of uh flit the hummingbird in uh pocahontas oh so you're

561
00:56:53,616 --> 00:56:59,176
not even looking at him like giving notes like this guy personally drew a lot which is crazy

562
00:56:59,176 --> 00:57:04,436
to think about i'll be honest i did not remember flit no none of those characters really landed

563
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:09,076
but i bet if you watched a big if you watched a bunch of flit you would probably appreciate

564
00:57:09,076 --> 00:57:14,876
i mean i know the art of it i'm sure i would i mean i know grandmother willow i know um meek

565
00:57:14,876 --> 00:57:21,816
what's the raccoons name meeko meeko uh and then that's about it huh huh now that's a whole other

566
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:29,456
the the angular 90s mid to late 90s disney animated pocahontas uh hunchback i guess a little

567
00:57:29,456 --> 00:57:36,016
certainly hercules atlantis yeah everything got more they all got like like like corners in their

568
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:42,436
noses right yeah got a lot more like uh yeah what what is and the dreamworks character oh you're

569
00:57:42,576 --> 00:57:47,636
like road to el dorado's are all kind of like craggy and angular and weird which one of these

570
00:57:47,636 --> 00:57:53,476
fellows uh went on to do atlantic her quies did directed atlantis oh that's right oh and they both

571
00:57:53,476 --> 00:57:59,076
did uh they did hunchback they did hunchback together and then uh the other one went i think

572
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:05,576
they split off and did did their own uh work one of them directed p body and sherman a few oh okay

573
00:58:06,956 --> 00:58:12,736
um other personnel on this thing the music by david newman who is randy newman's cousin who is

574
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:18,296
also a film score composer uh he has like all the newmans are film score composers everyone in that

575
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:24,136
family his his uh his not his dad but his like uncles were composers too god everybody and like

576
00:58:24,136 --> 00:58:32,776
going way back to the dawn of cinema yeah yeah uh this he he reunited with jerry reese uh having

577
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:37,856
also done the score of brave little toaster and the original frank and weenie short for uh tim

578
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:43,296
burton uh went on to do all of danny davido's movies from thrill mama to the train to death to

579
00:58:43,296 --> 00:58:49,676
smoochie wow uh ice age bill and ted the flintstones the mighty ducks the nutty professor uh and and the

580
00:58:49,676 --> 00:58:55,216
recent night school so he's still doing a ton of stuff this is one of his first uh scores uh and

581
00:58:55,216 --> 00:59:01,056
this was the weirdest one to me the dp of this thing who did an amazing job with all of the pov

582
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:05,936
all of those crazy sets in different worlds for all of the body parts there's a guy named david

583
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:11,616
m walsh who was also the dp of the woody allen film everything you always wanted to know about

584
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:18,856
sex but we're afraid to ask which culminates in a section that is essentially cranium command

585
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:24,516
oh yeah have you guys seen this movie yeah the final it's like an anthology movie kind of in a

586
00:59:24,876 --> 00:59:32,896
piece of it is the like a body preparing for sex woody allen is one of the sperms and in the control

587
00:59:32,896 --> 00:59:41,196
center tony randall and burt reynolds it really that movie may be the real impetus of the idea of

588
00:59:41,196 --> 00:59:45,496
lots of little guys in your body controlling it yeah that's interesting the same guy shot both of

589
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:50,396
them very strange wow that is weird he's never talked about i assume there's no big interview

590
00:59:50,396 --> 00:59:54,136
with this man about cranium command or anything to say like oh that's why they hired me because

591
00:59:54,136 --> 01:00:00,956
they saw that and they knew i could handle uh military sets inside of bodies huh uh and let's

592
01:00:00,956 --> 01:00:06,176
not forget an animator on this one of their first jobs pete doctor director of inside out

593
01:00:06,176 --> 01:00:13,716
right he said you know heavily influenced by this working on this attraction so crazy this was one

594
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:22,116
of his first jobs ever he was a development intern yes the disney company was like there was there

595
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:26,616
was such little staff and they had to rush this thing together and people liked his shorts uh and

596
01:00:26,616 --> 01:00:30,256
they so they said i you know you could probably handle some shots of this movie so there's a

597
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:36,016
couple of shots fully animated by pete doctor one of his first things went on to be involved in every

598
01:00:36,016 --> 01:00:43,056
pixar movie directed monsters inc up inside out uh and is now the creative head of pixar so yeah

599
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:49,756
crazy uh incredible staff of this thing who all went on to do like to really it's like an all-star

600
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:56,116
group it truly is yeah all sorry directing co-director of ins- ronnie del car- oh ronnie

601
01:00:56,116 --> 01:01:00,876
del carmen is the co-director and i think pete doc oh really okay as director they started doing

602
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:06,516
more of that in recent years at pixar oh maybe even in the next people sort of an apprentice

603
01:01:06,516 --> 01:01:13,696
yeah sure sure but yeah inside out also yeah cranium command predates inside out in terms of

604
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:18,736
watching the mechanics inside a body although as pete doctor points out it's a lot more emotional

605
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:23,716
than the the physical and the functionality of the body right but i'd also like to shout out

606
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:31,276
another thing uh between bridging the gap of tiny people and bodies from uh cranium command inside

607
01:01:31,276 --> 01:01:37,196
out we can't forget about meet dave the eddie murphy film in which eddie murphy there is a

608
01:01:37,196 --> 01:01:48,716
spaceship that looks like eddie murphy being piloted by lots of tiny people including our

609
01:01:48,716 --> 01:01:53,376
have you guys heard this story he's told this on several podcasts i think i would repeat it but

610
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:58,776
where he was hired to be lieutenant butt because they saw a headshot and thought he was fat from

611
01:01:58,776 --> 01:02:03,296
the neck down they like some of the vile from his face thought he was fat so they hired him to be

612
01:02:03,296 --> 01:02:08,116
the butt and then it was a really tense filming it and they fired him on set and he walked away

613
01:02:08,116 --> 01:02:12,196
was upset and then they came back and said oh yeah we well we thought you were fat so we got the sound

614
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:16,416
guy to do it because the sound guy's fat anyway you want to be the kneecap and he filmed a scene

615
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:21,936
felt very just like hey let's toss him a bone the scene is not in the movie his shoulder maybe is

616
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:27,576
in the movie uh a very odd thing but yeah paul shears done time in the in the body minds the body

617
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:33,536
might uh the other one of course is herman's head oh my god there's a lot of these it's a robust

618
01:02:33,536 --> 01:02:40,796
genre yeah the 1991 show on fox where he had like four different people i think in his head

619
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:45,896
playing these like different emotions right including yardley smith yes yes simpsons

620
01:02:46,716 --> 01:02:51,716
that's the only thing i know about it and there was some like simpsons joke at some point where

621
01:02:51,716 --> 01:02:58,476
lisa defends herman's head like right yeah yeah that's why that's in there um now i solely know

622
01:02:58,476 --> 01:03:03,836
herman's head as a comedy point of reference like i think on the simpsons and another 90s show made

623
01:03:03,836 --> 01:03:10,796
a joke about like herman's head it was on for three seasons oh my god what yeah what that's wild

624
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:18,276
that's like one of those like fox shows oh man the dog's comfortable uh uh where uh like i didn't

625
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:23,116
realize how long like models inc like shows i didn't watch but you would see ads for it during

626
01:03:23,116 --> 01:03:28,876
the simpsons sure rock i was thinking about whatever rock was roc yes yes they started doing

627
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:36,056
rock live when how was it i always wanted to see rock live why haven't i achieved that dream now

628
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:41,216
yeah well we'll do that in this when we watch uh rockadoodle we'll also watch rock

629
01:03:41,216 --> 01:03:50,456
oh yeah all right yeah rock fest podcast the ride rock fest yeah so followed by action check out j

630
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:57,076
wars action we're gonna yeah we'll do a mini podcast every episode of action uh was on herman's

631
01:03:57,076 --> 01:04:05,876
head too whoa several simpsons cast um the do you what did you see inside control rooms in herman's

632
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:10,676
head do you know that's a good question they represent the who what was in the head um well

633
01:04:10,676 --> 01:04:14,576
the poster has like four people and his head is split open but i don't think that's how they

634
01:04:14,576 --> 01:04:19,236
showed it are you freaked out by that still on some like baby level yeah yeah split open

635
01:04:19,236 --> 01:04:24,216
there's uh i didn't like when mr burns cut open homer's head in the treehouse of horror and you'd

636
01:04:24,216 --> 01:04:29,516
see his brain that's upsetting yeah as a kid i was like it really creeped me out i thought that was

637
01:04:29,516 --> 01:04:33,976
cool wow you were well you were because we've established you were the coolest of the three of

638
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:40,916
a child oh i don't i didn't know i i'm looking at the opening to herman's head right now i think

639
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:47,536
they were just like sitting around like this and like talking through stuff love the opening by the

640
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:53,796
way great strobe effects yeah really it looked better on old there's hank hank is hank in the

641
01:04:53,796 --> 01:04:59,576
head i guess these are all in his head ken hudson campbell rick lawless the original lardy ling

642
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:04,476
peter mckenzie yeah so that's i think that's how they were in the head they were all like crammed

643
01:05:04,476 --> 01:05:10,836
in there huh i think that's like bloody or did it look like a library was i think it looked like

644
01:05:10,836 --> 01:05:16,016
a yeah like a library like a little crammed hold on i'll pause it here because the audience is

645
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:20,996
riveted again yep yeah it almost looks like the back like beekman's world in the back or something

646
01:05:20,996 --> 01:05:31,616
it's very fish eye yeah in your face um the the inside the brain the uh brain brain dramas i

647
01:05:31,616 --> 01:05:38,696
don't know what to call these um if uh it's i i like a lot of stuff in this genre yeah scratchers

648
01:05:38,696 --> 01:05:41,996
sure great i guess that's more they're called head scratchers

649
01:05:44,056 --> 01:05:44,696
oh

650
01:05:44,696 --> 01:05:52,176
fox now disney owns fox so disney owns herman's head oh officially i think so they can get well

651
01:05:52,176 --> 01:05:56,896
all right on the disney plus show disney plus show and in and obviously they'll be fine giving

652
01:05:56,896 --> 01:06:02,936
us the inside out characters yeah easy the the oh my god it's waiting to happen the cranium command

653
01:06:02,936 --> 01:06:09,516
boy dates the girl from inside out and herman is around as like an uncle figure

654
01:06:10,396 --> 01:06:17,276
and then who owns meet dave i hope it's fox and he owns it now it might be fox oh please oh please

655
01:06:17,276 --> 01:06:23,196

656
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:36,396
podcast music distributed by 20th century fox yeah dave all right let's go all the head

657
01:06:37,356 --> 01:06:42,956
name of this series and extended universe is pretty wow what a triumph yeah i don't mean to

658
01:06:42,956 --> 01:06:47,996
make jason not the main character it'll still center on you but all these other you know the

659
01:06:47,996 --> 01:06:53,696
long the more we can expand this universe the better it will be for me so do you guys want to

660
01:06:53,696 --> 01:07:03,796
get woody allen in on it too i don't know burt reynolds i guess is in wild about that amazon

661
01:07:05,476 --> 01:07:13,016
show we'll discuss off off pop um so uh oh my god a robust genre and this is a fantastic entry

662
01:07:13,016 --> 01:07:18,696
in it should we talk about the uh should we go through the story of the of the ride yes you see

663
01:07:18,696 --> 01:07:26,796
you enter through you enter into a hallway with four posters in it which have uh a trivia post

664
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:32,996
well there's a propaganda recruiting posters which is a go-to theme park cue thing that's off

665
01:07:32,996 --> 01:07:37,016
yeah that's why there's so many people flooding through any space as you're being brought into

666
01:07:37,016 --> 01:07:45,116
some mission yeah uh it's a very chintzy hallway i think all the money went to fixing the movie and

667
01:07:45,116 --> 01:07:51,236
not yes the hallway it's an unimpressive hallway i'm sorry i'm offending you with this no no no it's

668
01:07:51,236 --> 01:07:55,916
pretty it's pretty uh lackluster i mean yeah so yeah the propaganda posters like you said scott

669
01:07:55,916 --> 01:08:02,856
yeah the the brain teasers uh what is does someone know the answer to that cadet betty one because i

670
01:08:02,856 --> 01:08:09,756
could not figure it out i felt so dumb don't know it offhand i don't either um we could put it to the

671
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:15,916
listeners solve this for us solve this is brain teaser is a better word for the genre of the show

672
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:22,416
brain benders brain benders brain benders as the name of the of the genre is not bad that's good

673
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:27,836
yeah yeah we'll keep at it also we'll get closer we'll keep chappelly by the end of the episode uh

674
01:08:28,816 --> 01:08:34,216
so uh several posters then you sit and you watch this video in which general knowledge

675
01:08:34,216 --> 01:08:40,416
is talking to the recruits people were going to go inside the brain they've presumably finished

676
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:47,796
the commando academy they're all taking on their missions and most of the commandos are more

677
01:08:47,796 --> 01:08:57,816
militaristic uh starship troopers type uh handsome uh bright young boys and girls service equals they

678
01:08:57,996 --> 01:09:04,456
very under do you want to see more uh so then but there's but one guy is late and it's our little

679
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:12,276
buddy buzzy buzzy now now is he younger than all of them is he a doogie howzer it's a lot of questions

680
01:09:12,276 --> 01:09:18,416
that are not answered yeah i think he's just a little guy trying his best and i think that's why

681
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:27,896
like him uh um i i certainly related to that as a child a little guy trying his best i you know

682
01:09:27,896 --> 01:09:32,796
what did not sink in when it is said at some point you'd think how much i watched this and how much i

683
01:09:32,796 --> 01:09:39,036
liked it this would have sunk in more when they say like um uh oh god what was it it's something

684
01:09:39,036 --> 01:09:48,076
like um uh worrying yourself sick real stress or imagined stress like those lines were very that was

685
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:54,716
my childhood like i was very nervous child and not from any i was all just doing it to myself

686
01:09:54,716 --> 01:10:00,636
but uh for whatever reason even though cranium command is like no matter how you generate stress

687
01:10:00,636 --> 01:10:07,276
it will feel the same way it's okay calm down just take a minute and breathe that never sunk in the

688
01:10:07,276 --> 01:10:12,796
lesson never sunk in you heard it you can you can recite it but you'd feel like today you're still

689
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:19,176
in the same shoes as now i'm figuring it out now i'm working on it yeah just recently in the last

690
01:10:19,176 --> 01:10:26,796
three years well and through therapy yeah which equals this podcast yeah do you think do you think

691
01:10:26,796 --> 01:10:31,836
maybe as a child you had like kind of a buzzy guy in your head and he wasn't so good at managing

692
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:38,196
everything probably yeah that's probably the guy blame the guy and that wasn't your fault oh okay

693
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:45,516
cool it's it is a real this brings it all brings up a lot of free will issues oh yeah we all just

694
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:51,716
piloted by a little guy i would argue that if we want to get i do think like free will is an illusion

695
01:10:51,716 --> 01:10:57,896
i kind of i do think that's true damn oh wow i kind of feel like man you're talking like the

696
01:10:57,896 --> 01:11:04,516
john lovett's right yeah i'm right bird love it's i'm like a real hippie man uh yeah no i think

697
01:11:04,516 --> 01:11:09,136
that's true i think we sort of everything's we're gonna do what we're gonna do and we're if you're

698
01:11:09,136 --> 01:11:14,036
if you're able to change you will change but if you're not it's not gonna it's all it's all pre

699
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,756
to tell it's all a man it's all an equation is what i'm saying i believe it's sort of all an

700
01:11:17,756 --> 01:11:22,316
equation and you can sort of guess what everybody's gonna do if you had the most like crazy precise

701
01:11:22,316 --> 01:11:31,196
math equation whoa that's what i feel uh but here the other the only the other thing that i know

702
01:11:31,616 --> 01:11:37,296
about your uh philosophy and role models is your love of jimmy buffett that's true who is who is

703
01:11:37,296 --> 01:11:42,436
relaxed and easygoing do you think he's relaxed and easygoing because he knows everything is

704
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:48,336
predetermined so let's just chill out and let it happen or is he relaxed because he does like i

705
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:54,296
you seem like stressed out in your free will assessment yeah i i'm i guess i mean i think i'm

706
01:11:54,496 --> 01:12:01,776
Jason i'm sort of a stressed out person in general um i think jimmy buffett uh there's a persona jimmy

707
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:07,276
buffett and then the craven businessman jimmy buffett so i think craven craven businessman

708
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:12,536
knows everything's predetermined he's torn between left and right he's torn between the two

709
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:18,016
some of your stress might also be coming from the fact that you you look to jimmy buffett for

710
01:12:18,016 --> 01:12:23,656
inspiration but you're also constantly talking about how sick and twisted that clown prince of

711
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:30,816
the joker is and how he might actually be the most sane one oh yeah that that thing i'm always

712
01:12:30,816 --> 01:12:38,076
talking about he talks about i mean 10 years for 10 halloweens now you've been wearing that joker

713
01:12:38,076 --> 01:12:45,816
makeup and why so serious i say i say it all the time it's all part of the plan um you know i think

714
01:12:45,816 --> 01:12:52,256
really honestly maybe my stress comes from me trying to um fight against my own programming

715
01:12:52,476 --> 01:12:57,616
i feel like i'm trying to break out of a simulation i don't want to get too weird here

716
01:12:57,616 --> 01:13:06,276
i'm trying to yes but um i think my flaw i think i was formed by the end of back to the future 3

717
01:13:06,276 --> 01:13:12,456
where the fax is erased uh because of the future is what you make of it sure i think that movie

718
01:13:12,456 --> 01:13:19,416
taught me but i think that uh i i think at that uh at the age of 10 seeing that film i think it

719
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:26,236
me think i think i do believe in free will because doc brown showed that the future is not

720
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:31,156
determined interesting and uh which you and some parts of back to the future might make you think

721
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:38,416
that it is because things just line up uh i'm losing i'm not smart enough to even hyperanalyze

722
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:46,116
back to the future three but uh no yeah i uh doc brown i think uh saved me from uh thinking that

723
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:52,036
i'm just cogs in a machine thanks doc that is a better way to think about life and if i really

724
01:13:52,036 --> 01:13:59,676
analyze it at free will i guess i do feel like you can fight against the worst instincts in your brain

725
01:13:59,676 --> 01:14:07,576
and change so i guess maybe i'm not as cynical if i truly analyze it because you know i do think

726
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:16,096
like like i i've broken out you know i've broken out of some bad habits in my life so maybe you

727
01:14:16,096 --> 01:14:20,716
maybe we can change you know i don't want to get too you started wearing a hat this year yeah yeah

728
01:14:20,716 --> 01:14:27,656
that is a good example like i was a hat not a hat man for many years and uh but then maybe i'm also

729
01:14:27,656 --> 01:14:33,196
just like predisposed to trying to change things up so really i don't really know you did open up

730
01:14:33,196 --> 01:14:43,316
and tell us the story of how you got those scars figuring out this this runner this runner is the

731
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:50,436
joker this bit is one of jason's like ham-fisted like i'm gonna keep cramming this in here i mean

732
01:14:50,436 --> 01:14:55,736
i'm happy to to jump on i'm just figuring i just want to call out the game if we can the game yeah

733
01:14:55,736 --> 01:15:03,256
mike is the joker the game the game is like i guess the if we analyze what this joke is the joke is

734
01:15:03,256 --> 01:15:10,156
that like i'm kind of like a lame like hot topic philosophy guy who like really like is like the

735
01:15:10,156 --> 01:15:16,076
joker who has sort of a 15 year old like an unformed yeah like a like a bat like a shooter

736
01:15:16,076 --> 01:15:22,516
inspired by the joker yeah i think that's the thing right and everything off of okay yeah so

737
01:15:22,516 --> 01:15:28,256
i yeah so you get all your inspiration from hot topic t-shirts exactly and like i call my girlfriend

738
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:36,416
harley and stuff and we wear makeup and make out all right you've crossed the line tmi you should

739
01:15:36,416 --> 01:15:41,116
if you're gonna take inspiration from anybody at hot topic it should be that free will in deadpool

740
01:15:41,116 --> 01:15:48,076
he does what he wants to do that's true he doesn't take crap from nobody and his will is freer than

741
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:53,416
anybody's it's true all right he deadpool proves that free will exists it'd be less joker and more

742
01:15:53,416 --> 01:16:02,816
deadpool well that'll be my 2019 resolution uh okay anyway out of the free will stuff uh yeah

743
01:16:02,816 --> 01:16:08,356
well i also i have another question stemming from this and i don't want to also open up a can of

744
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:13,116
worms but you know i know this is like this is well a hot topic to repeat that for this kind of

745
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:22,296
a hot topic but um is a baby a human being at conception or are they a baby or are they a baby

746
01:16:22,296 --> 01:16:31,556
when the little boys put in their brain oh yeah when did well when they're not converting why do

747
01:16:31,656 --> 01:16:35,876
try to do this off mic when do they get their little boys the question

748
01:16:35,876 --> 01:16:41,336
um do you get what age do you get your little boy you get your little pilot uh yeah when when

749
01:16:41,336 --> 01:16:46,096
in the pre-show when we're looking at the room of all of the broken heads if anyone's listening to

750
01:16:46,096 --> 01:16:51,236
this episode who hasn't there's more than any you need to have watch this thing so you know what the

751
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:56,096
fuck we're talking about yeah there's actually there's full good quality ride throughs on youtube

752
01:16:56,096 --> 01:17:03,516
i was happy to see yeah like hd in hd yeah 2006 i watched the video from oh still going huh still

753
01:17:03,516 --> 01:17:08,956
going i was shocked that's what's so confusing is that buzzy gets in the head of a 12 year old

754
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:16,116
boy but as i said who was in it before what metaphysical space is the opened up head in

755
01:17:16,116 --> 01:17:22,436
and we also see just we see like elderly people in that room of heads where are you when do you do

756
01:17:22,456 --> 01:17:29,616
do some people not get their little head controllers until it would make sense it is odd that they just

757
01:17:29,616 --> 01:17:33,676
didn't go with and i'm trying to think of a narrative reason it's just odd they didn't go with

758
01:17:33,676 --> 01:17:39,476
like babies it's like a stork kind of situation it's odd that you would just like there's not in

759
01:17:39,476 --> 01:17:43,836
the cartoon he's yelling it all the same stuff can happen and they're like little cartoon people

760
01:17:43,836 --> 01:17:49,936
and they jump into babies but then how do you get to the 12 year old how do you get to like navigating

761
01:17:50,016 --> 01:17:54,436
a day i think that's that's i guess you're right that's the narrative problem is that you needed

762
01:17:54,436 --> 01:18:01,296
to have like hijinks and stuff go wrong and you explain why buzzy is so bad at controlling this

763
01:18:01,296 --> 01:18:07,516
person and that is like the right age where like everything feels important everything feels high

764
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:15,176
stakes like adolescents kicking in you know 12 i think because buzzy first like welcomes everyone

765
01:18:15,176 --> 01:18:19,236
into the auditorium he's like all right let's start this up he's waking up in the morning i

766
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:26,136
was assuming that the heads that is all taking place in the dream space or like the subconscious

767
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:30,296
like that's almost like a little bit yeah they show you a little bit of everyone getting in the

768
01:18:30,296 --> 01:18:34,456
heads and stuff so i'm assuming that's almost like if your car is at the mechanic the car is

769
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:41,236
off it's stationary it's not running so this is it's like the humans are at rest so that's when

770
01:18:41,956 --> 01:18:49,396
get resets now whether do you also get new uh people running your organs do you get new left

771
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:54,076
right ventricles are they swapped out at some point or are they with you for life well that's

772
01:18:54,076 --> 01:18:59,956
what i was saying about a stomach transplant right uh i think for sure that for sure if you get a new

773
01:18:59,956 --> 01:19:07,076
heart then there's a new person in there however i like why did why was there a buzzy change are

774
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:12,176
you able to change people out just when they're asleep or does you have do you have to like have

775
01:19:12,176 --> 01:19:16,956
an act do you have to be in a coma for cranium commands to do the switch i think what they

776
01:19:16,956 --> 01:19:20,496
should have done is that they shouldn't have buzzy's voice should not have been the kid's voice

777
01:19:20,496 --> 01:19:26,816
that was a big problem but i think you could explain that like this buzzy type character

778
01:19:26,816 --> 01:19:31,656
whoever was controlling the kid before did such a good job he's going to move up into a like a

779
01:19:33,316 --> 01:19:38,236
human so he's like he's now he's going to control like a ceo or a president

780
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:44,236
and then a new one has to be hired to fill the role of this 12 year old let's also possibly

781
01:19:44,236 --> 01:19:51,536
died in action well that is too dark okay he is in a bomber jacket yeah is he a is he like the sector

782
01:19:51,536 --> 01:20:01,056
keeper a ghost from the path a ghost boy oh yeah past uh locked in time again i i believe reading

783
01:20:01,056 --> 01:20:07,616
about this thing storyboard this in a week so um that's that's the answer we're looking for

784
01:20:07,616 --> 01:20:13,076
it's the free view so wouldn't we be the like like we're always everyone complains like network

785
01:20:13,076 --> 01:20:19,956
notes but the three of us like i don't know here the that's a good point i don't like this attitude

786
01:20:19,956 --> 01:20:27,076
in a way of like picking apart the logic because yeah if we were like giving them this attitude

787
01:20:27,076 --> 01:20:31,036
while they were making the thing there wouldn't they there wouldn't have been a cranium yeah it

788
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:37,996
does i mean again yeah it still plays as mike said like it's so there's enough grounding there

789
01:20:37,996 --> 01:20:43,896
for like a 20 25 minute experience uh-huh no one is thinking of these issues while they are watching

790
01:20:43,896 --> 01:20:51,056
george wint as the funny stomach man that overrides any of these bizarre metaphysical issues

791
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:59,216
yes but there are story problems i think the voice not being that that's a big i think that's the big

792
01:20:59,216 --> 01:21:05,796
fix that hole and i i shut up about a lot of other stuff you know we have to think about these

793
01:21:05,796 --> 01:21:11,316
things because if we're looking towards a sub platform within another streaming platform of

794
01:21:11,316 --> 01:21:18,256
exclusively brain bender based shows you got to figure this stuff out so you have solid footing

795
01:21:18,256 --> 01:21:25,456
you know i my fear though is that this project ultimately is not us doing it it's the little

796
01:21:25,456 --> 01:21:31,076
guys in our heads and i'm worried that they're gonna fuck up the brain bender like we're

797
01:21:31,076 --> 01:21:36,616
ultimately at the whims of these little guys so i just hope they've got a good tv show in them

798
01:21:36,616 --> 01:21:41,796
well yeah you know command our little finger guys to type type type the scripts well

799
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:49,536
one way to exercise power is by releasing you know releasing control it's harder than taking

800
01:21:49,536 --> 01:21:54,976
control to exercise power but release stepping away and releasing control can uh is that a

801
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:59,556
therapy thing you learned that is a therapy like you have to let your of the three of us go the

802
01:21:59,556 --> 01:22:05,616
only one in therapy i believe so yeah yeah yeah a couple years now right it's great it's very

803
01:22:05,616 --> 01:22:10,936
helpful very smart yeah i think we'll both be paying the price for not not not letting a lot

804
01:22:10,936 --> 01:22:17,756
of stuff go for a long time yeah then like it really building up when we're like 45 oh yeah

805
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:23,656
oh it's just like the weeds are so overgrown at that point that the therapists were just trying

806
01:22:23,656 --> 01:22:27,316
to get out of there and try to figure out oh we should have taken care of this earlier

807
01:22:27,316 --> 01:22:31,896
yeah because it takes a while for the lessons to set in and become you know

808
01:22:31,896 --> 01:22:40,776
yeah sure uh we've all got like horror we've got horrible dense armies in our brains we wish

809
01:22:40,776 --> 01:22:46,476
it were as simple as adjusted charles groden and a and a john luvitz right they have plenty of

810
01:22:46,476 --> 01:22:52,716
space to move we have like yeah just weird some faceless foot army yeah my like there's like

811
01:22:52,716 --> 01:22:58,956
10 people doing the job of one charles groden in my head i was bumping into each other trying to

812
01:22:58,956 --> 01:23:04,696
know different opinions about what to do fuck you yeah i gotta say groden and luvitz playing off of

813
01:23:04,696 --> 01:23:09,816
each other i think is is very fun i mean i did used to i know we clowned on luvitz a bunch in

814
01:23:09,816 --> 01:23:15,896
the past but like as a kid i loved john luvitz on snl of course he something happened i feel

815
01:23:15,896 --> 01:23:23,636
when you add up not just him on s obviously great on snl but then yeah everything on the simpsons

816
01:23:23,636 --> 01:23:32,136
league of their own big um if there's something else pretty good i'm missing uh i mean this he's

817
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:37,096
like and he it's like he's playing a character that is not his exact wheelhouse you haven't seen

818
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:44,256
luvitz do this shade exactly uh and i think it's very good i don't know he was like he was he was

819
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:49,816
real sharp i'm definitely an appreciator of uh yeah of course the the yeah the early john luvitz

820
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:56,516
body work uh also in uh brave little toaster oh yeah yeah brave little toaster is john luvitz uh

821
01:23:56,516 --> 01:24:03,036
and and phil hartman pre snl and mindy sterling uh for our best and from austin powers which makes

822
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:08,196
me think jerry reese was up probably on what the groundlings were doing he's like i'm making a

823
01:24:08,196 --> 01:24:13,416
little movie i'm gonna hire a bunch of groundlings and you could see that he kept his whole his body

824
01:24:13,776 --> 01:24:20,116
work uh which also includes kevin pollock and alien encounter and kathy and jimmy and stuff like

825
01:24:20,116 --> 01:24:25,736
he has like he casts fun comedians and all this disney stuff and brings that influence into

826
01:24:25,736 --> 01:24:31,916
everything uh which now all things have comedians voices everywhere but i think i like the sensibility

827
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:43,396
of this guy i mean like a lot of the pixar stuff it's comedian types and inside out but disney

828
01:24:43,396 --> 01:24:49,256
the little mermaid was like a kind of put like putting a foot out for them like if i or maybe

829
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:55,736
they do one because like bob newhart and rescuers are like they would allow for one voice you know

830
01:24:55,736 --> 01:25:01,276
but then the rest are kind of like in right well once there's so much singing like they're pulling

831
01:25:01,276 --> 01:25:13,376
from broadway quite a bit oh that's true yeah yeah yeah you got i guess you got robin williams genie

832
01:25:14,116 --> 01:25:18,936
probably when we saw that we didn't know who roan atkinson was sure yeah so that's it's a new

833
01:25:18,936 --> 01:25:25,576
level to appreciate it on now i knew who james earl jones was and i'm sure you know david augden

834
01:25:25,576 --> 01:25:35,056
stires your favorite actor as a 90 as a in 1992 he was uh cogsworth oh cogs okay i could see young

835
01:25:35,056 --> 01:25:41,296
jason being a big mash fan oh yeah oddly no but i have a match think for like it's funny you bring

836
01:25:41,296 --> 01:25:49,136
for later later oh okay oh it's a treat for later okay um okay i don't have we done any have we

837
01:25:49,136 --> 01:25:52,996
been explaining this coherently at all so you're in this training room you watch this pre video

838
01:25:52,996 --> 01:25:58,976
with all these great animators involved that's really fun uh you get the basic information about

839
01:25:58,976 --> 01:26:03,816
how to be a brain commander and if you're a bad brain commander you end up having a pilot of

840
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:10,056
chicken around who has not very many options and can ascend to great levels like a like a human can

841
01:26:10,056 --> 01:26:15,796
you also get those the jokes that are killers every time you're in there uh at least at least

842
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:19,756
when we were kids in the 90s the joke the joke about there were uh you know we've had some

843
01:26:19,756 --> 01:26:25,936
successes and it's albert einstein and some failures and it's earnest i remember thunderous

844
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:32,536
applause and laughter whenever that played drag him drag earnest get him a fictional character

845
01:26:32,536 --> 01:26:38,096
a fictional character that disney is making movies about right now how did he end up there

846
01:26:38,136 --> 01:26:42,536
yeah they aren't like uh they aren't making a mental health judgment about a real person

847
01:26:42,536 --> 01:26:49,156
right uh you know a lot of this would not be okay uh today but then uh you've got the uh that what's

848
01:26:49,156 --> 01:26:53,796
the other killer joke oh that like then then it's time to get into the brain get into the theater

849
01:26:53,796 --> 01:26:58,996
come on move move move what do you think where do you think you are disney world which also a

850
01:26:58,996 --> 01:27:05,316
little bit of a growner in a way but like i think maybe self-reflexive comedy in dis in a disney

851
01:27:05,316 --> 01:27:12,216
attraction in 1989 not super common right comes back in a different ride comes back at a different

852
01:27:12,216 --> 01:27:17,536
ride later on i'm not going to tell you which one until you're right is this another tease oh i see

853
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:25,516
gotcha uh oh it's you know it's uh top of the you know it's a top of the what oh i know that's in

854
01:27:25,516 --> 01:27:30,816
there you mean in guardians so i know that yeah yeah yeah where were you i know that it's the same

855
01:27:31,596 --> 01:27:37,176
yeah yeah you're right well done many years prior by cranium command so then you enter the you enter

856
01:27:37,176 --> 01:27:42,796
the head now you're in a head here's a question who are we in this experience we're not cranium

857
01:27:42,796 --> 01:27:49,156
commandos or are we like taking notes behind buzzy to me as well yeah that's one that's another hole

858
01:27:49,156 --> 01:28:00,736
a little bit are we auditing we're 200 secret shoppers yeah yeah i don't know i think because the

859
01:28:00,736 --> 01:28:05,236
we're learning so i think maybe just in the catch-all of like hey you can come and watch what

860
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:10,756
happens it's like if you're sitting in a surgery with an open right window i think that's what it

861
01:28:10,756 --> 01:28:15,896
is you're loading into like it would be very cool if instead of just a hallway it was like you were

862
01:28:15,896 --> 01:28:20,976
loading into someone's ear or something oh there should have been one more step like the maybe no

863
01:28:20,976 --> 01:28:24,396
budget by that point i think yeah no budget so they didn't do it just putting a big ear around

864
01:28:24,396 --> 01:28:30,716
the doors yeah it would have been it wouldn't make sense for four years though because you want to

865
01:28:31,356 --> 01:28:36,476
but i feel like hmm i don't know we all have theater doors in our heads that's the other thing

866
01:28:36,476 --> 01:28:42,396
this right teaches you maybe it's like one giant ear with four doors in the year

867
01:28:42,396 --> 01:28:46,736
i don't know how that would look yeah they all fit within the yeah we all have little doors in our

868
01:28:46,736 --> 01:28:53,456
ear yeah okay so we're learning a lot from this it's like no it's like tower of terror where

869
01:28:53,456 --> 01:29:00,376
you wait in lines of four and they just take each line separately easy okay so they go row one row

870
01:29:00,436 --> 01:29:07,176
two row or whatever they do at six row one in order to make the one ear okay big ear that's my

871
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:16,216
plus one big ear mike carlson's big ear yeah easy done so now you're in the head and buzzy is up on

872
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:21,556
a platform although when you walk in strangely he's like just in the dark sitting there as he

873
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:28,536
has been for many decades yeah apparently but then he comes to life uh general knowledge comes back

874
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:33,836
yells at general if we didn't explain that you know he's he has this kind of drill sergeant

875
01:29:33,836 --> 01:29:41,236
attitude and they said in the revamp he became a lot more like r. lee ermy uh um so you know that

876
01:29:41,236 --> 01:29:47,076
whenever things are going worse the worst for buzzy the general can jump in and stress him out even

877
01:29:47,076 --> 01:29:53,656
more right um so he starts powering on the machine he's not exactly sure how to pilot it like poor

878
01:29:54,856 --> 01:30:01,116
man's rex um he conjures the second audio animatronic figure by the way i should say

879
01:30:01,116 --> 01:30:06,196
this thing was supposed to be teeming with audio animatronics in its original conception probably

880
01:30:06,196 --> 01:30:10,856
all the body parts left brain right brain all of it are audio animatronics but that's a big budget

881
01:30:10,856 --> 01:30:15,756
cut we can only have one thus it became the protagonist buzzy not a big problem but obviously

882
01:30:15,756 --> 01:30:20,476
more robots always better always better is hypothalamus considered an audio animatronic

883
01:30:20,476 --> 01:30:26,556
is just a robot yeah yeah i think so to some it's not as complicated and what is he how do we

884
01:30:26,556 --> 01:30:33,016
explain him he's like a he's a head on a neck oh the non-mo yeah it's just like a pole with like

885
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:39,536
a pair of goggles on it a lot of binoculars he looks kind of like those skinned geese in the

886
01:30:39,536 --> 01:30:46,836
star tours line a little bit just sort of like kind of genericky robot type thing uh voiced by

887
01:30:46,836 --> 01:30:53,036
director kirk wise okay co-directed the short and i think does a great job of this very dry like

888
01:30:53,036 --> 01:30:57,416
monotone like thing because it doesn't pop up that often because what is the hypothalamus

889
01:30:57,416 --> 01:31:03,496
control like non-motor or like non-conscious didn't stick with me and the word didn't i guess

890
01:31:03,496 --> 01:31:09,196
whatever they were trying to teach me there i just didn't uh i think it it's it regulates like all

891
01:31:09,196 --> 01:31:13,816
the stuff that your body does in the background like not consciously you don't have to think

892
01:31:13,816 --> 01:31:20,196
yeah that you don't have to think about huh we all have the hmm strange this is um i would be

893
01:31:20,196 --> 01:31:25,116
look we're a theme park podcast so when i get a breaking story on my phone sometimes i have to

894
01:31:25,116 --> 01:31:29,556
break in and say it absolutely on walt disney world news today it just says concept art for

895
01:31:29,556 --> 01:31:36,736
country bear jamboree dark ride released what i guess this was a never made country bear dark

896
01:31:37,536 --> 01:31:44,496
oh no i guess that makes me sad almost so huh i got very excited thinking it was like a new one

897
01:31:44,496 --> 01:31:50,356
but i guess it's not anyway we'll post we'll link that later okay yeah yeah um you you live your life

898
01:31:50,356 --> 01:31:56,056
yeah you're stressed out because you're so jumpy at any second you get an alert about like uh a new

899
01:31:56,056 --> 01:32:06,716
mug that got released notifications for every app and everybody follows on twitter not everyone i

900
01:32:06,716 --> 01:32:14,936
yeah yelling at you too much information for one person um so uh your your day begins uh the the

901
01:32:14,936 --> 01:32:21,396
eyes open up uh you're waking up in your 12 year old boy uh bedroom you start meeting all of the

902
01:32:21,396 --> 01:32:28,836
body parts the left brain charles groden who is very logical and lives in this awesome cubist

903
01:32:28,836 --> 01:32:34,316
world i love the set of right i think that's my favorite i think there's a lot of fun set design

904
01:32:34,636 --> 01:32:40,336
this thing love left brain uh and right brains in a more like freewheeling psychedelic world

905
01:32:40,336 --> 01:32:45,456
this is one of those learning things that did stick i do feel like i always it really helped me

906
01:32:45,456 --> 01:32:50,216
seeing kind of like a gray black and white left brain and a colorful right brain i think that

907
01:32:50,216 --> 01:32:55,836
concept is always clear to me and and in being create being a creative person and sometimes

908
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:59,436
having to wear like a producer hat and sometimes having to just be freewheeling and be a writer

909
01:32:59,596 --> 01:33:05,096
like you have to balance those sides and i do literally picture like i'm a little too charles

910
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:10,356
groden right now it really honestly stuck with me it really did like i gotta i gotta be more love

911
01:33:10,356 --> 01:33:14,496
it's we're gonna throw that at you we're gonna throw that at each other now it's like you'd be a

912
01:33:14,496 --> 01:33:20,256
little charles groden right now quit being such a groden jason constantly thinks of himself just as

913
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:27,736
a charles groden type in a good way i mean uh confident charming handsome but sure i think you

914
01:33:27,736 --> 01:33:33,816
said he was like your ultimate actor i think so well i think we were also like oh who would be we

915
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:40,356
be if if we were gay who would we be attracted to and i think you yours was charles groden and

916
01:33:40,356 --> 01:33:46,776
mine was young elliot gould yeah yes oh sure who's mine i don't know maybe it's it's somewhere

917
01:33:46,776 --> 01:33:55,356
between probably uh some era of mccartney uh uh i don't think i look i'm more of an admirer of the

918
01:33:56,516 --> 01:34:02,336
the physique of the facial physique of michael mcdonald's 70s mcdonald's okay i'm not sure it's

919
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:08,236
an attraction i'm just like i think he's what i want to look like right yeah but so those are

920
01:34:08,236 --> 01:34:15,256
those are the bones all and obviously uh hans and franz in this thing well sure you get my hands on

921
01:34:15,256 --> 01:34:23,476
those big arm muscles yeah um yeah what is their name in this though they just call them they're

922
01:34:23,476 --> 01:34:30,196
vons and johns oh they're not but they play left ventricle grocery stores oh they're also a rip

923
01:34:30,196 --> 01:34:37,596
off of the grocery stores uh we'll see meet them too uh problematic today that they call people

924
01:34:37,596 --> 01:34:43,756
girly men and yeah that's problematic yeah is it wrong to shame somebody for potentially triggering

925
01:34:43,756 --> 01:34:51,956
a flabalanche was that one of their lines too probably not in this but that's what i associate

926
01:34:51,956 --> 01:35:00,356
that with hans and franz oh wow i want to say how much i love dana carvey i mean kevin nealon as

927
01:35:00,356 --> 01:35:05,816
well but dana carvey if you watch any hans and franz sketch is having so much fun and just keeps

928
01:35:05,816 --> 01:35:10,976
like pointing for no reason he's having so it's like he's a kid with a toy he can't let go of

929
01:35:10,976 --> 01:35:17,016
and then like keeps doing that like lascivious and kind of staring down the camera he's clearly just

930
01:35:17,016 --> 01:35:23,576
having a blast every time he does whichever one that it haunts i maybe uh and you get that in this

931
01:35:23,576 --> 01:35:29,996
a little i don't think you get like the fully there right franz feeling but fun to see him

932
01:35:29,996 --> 01:35:34,416
right yeah i mean they're all on screen for such a little amount of time i feel like

933
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:40,096
does grodin have the most screen time um by like what seconds maybe he chips in a lot because he's

934
01:35:40,096 --> 01:35:44,576
almost like a villain he like needs to yeah obviously very useful the kid wouldn't get

935
01:35:44,816 --> 01:35:50,656
without uh charles grodin yes that is a couple things i want to talk so we are led to believe

936
01:35:50,656 --> 01:35:58,036
this 12 year old sleeps naked hmm some people do i guess so i just i don't think some 12 year olds

937
01:35:58,036 --> 01:36:06,396
do i suppose i guess i guess the logic is there for the joke jason how do you sleep oh sleep well

938
01:36:06,396 --> 01:36:13,836
i don't like a lot of layers um usually like some sleep shorts and a t-shirt sometimes no t-shirts

939
01:36:13,836 --> 01:36:20,476
sometimes sleep short i'll say this i would be way into sleeping nude except that the temperature

940
01:36:20,476 --> 01:36:27,296
my temperature changes during the night so often that i will wake up like sweaty or weird like i'll

941
01:36:27,296 --> 01:36:34,516
wake up weird if i even try to sleep like shirtless so i have to do i prefer sure well if i wear too

942
01:36:34,516 --> 01:36:40,376
many layers i wake up covered in sweat and then i'm cold yeah i'm i'm change shirts i'll wear a

943
01:36:40,376 --> 01:36:47,476
but i think i have to wear that shirt because it will at least keep some heat in if i throw the

944
01:36:47,476 --> 01:36:50,976
covers off because i'm a little bit of a restless sleeper as well interesting what is your answer

945
01:36:50,976 --> 01:36:56,276
scott i'm just shirt and boxers but it occurred to me like the most on brand you know what shirt

946
01:36:56,276 --> 01:37:01,536
i've worn like so much that i can't wear anymore because it's just like gotten too thin and

947
01:37:01,536 --> 01:37:06,616
full of holes but for the last decade probably almost every night i've worn a captain eo shirt

948
01:37:07,156 --> 01:37:14,136
almost every night not like not as like pajamas not like i'm going to be kept eo in my dreams

949
01:37:14,136 --> 01:37:20,036
just like it's a really comfy shirt like what they had at tomorrowland you can you know it may it

950
01:37:20,036 --> 01:37:24,096
makes sense i should have taken advantage of that i should have pretended to be kept in my dreams

951
01:37:24,096 --> 01:37:30,016
i was gonna say but maybe subconsciously somewhere yeah that might be well it's so it's the stripe

952
01:37:30,016 --> 01:37:35,596
it's the rainbow straight right right i have that but i lost it i realized the other day oh i had it

953
01:37:35,596 --> 01:37:41,216
i don't know where i wore it out i can't like that alternated between that and a live-age shirt

954
01:37:41,216 --> 01:37:46,136
which i also so also pretty on brand you know what i've been wearing to sleep though lately

955
01:37:46,136 --> 01:37:51,836
and i this is going to seem like a hamfisted ad but lately in the sleep shirt regiment

956
01:37:51,836 --> 01:38:05,576
patanakush oh yeah shirts available at tpublic.com i don't remember the rest of the

957
01:38:06,656 --> 01:38:10,876
day separate they're different they're most people i think do but i would advocate if you

958
01:38:10,876 --> 01:38:18,476
get a patanakush shirt do both sleep in it wear it out more so it looks more shitty when you're

959
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:24,356
out in public with it that's the issue with the patanakush shirt our favorite my favorite shirt

960
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:30,476
that we offer is that it won't really have its full effect until you've worn it a lot after five

961
01:38:30,996 --> 01:38:36,836
i would also you gotta get wrecked and that'll really work i would also and this is jason's

962
01:38:36,836 --> 01:38:43,376
gonna be probably mad at us or mad at me for saying this bootlegging the shirt yourself somehow

963
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:48,956
i might encourage it oh i'll like yeah i would encourage that if you want to just like

964
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:56,696
draw facsimile of it and then airbrush it at like a local airbrushing place that wouldn't be bad i

965
01:38:56,696 --> 01:39:02,876
would be very happy to see knock off bootleg patanakush by the way because even then we're

966
01:39:02,876 --> 01:39:07,556
getting advertising we're getting well i'm just saying for fun i'm just saying for fun not

967
01:39:07,556 --> 01:39:13,116
thinking of i'm not a craven business man like you are as much you know also in case you don't

968
01:39:13,116 --> 01:39:17,996
know what we're talking about on a patreon exclusive episode just dedicated to botanikus

969
01:39:17,996 --> 01:39:24,676
we created an alternate version that loves weed named patanakush and we're selling a shirt of him

970
01:39:24,676 --> 01:39:30,816
like bart style and if you don't know what botanikus is we're too far deep you know there's

971
01:39:30,816 --> 01:39:35,456
that thing where podcasts are supposed to like every episode could be the first episode sometimes

972
01:39:35,456 --> 01:39:41,396
we're just too it's hard it's really hard it's hard yeah the level the the depths of knowledge

973
01:39:41,396 --> 01:39:47,416
just you gotta go backwards it's a syria that we're this is the wire okay i think we do a reasonable

974
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:54,356
job i think we do a reasonable job of that but we cannot touch every running storyline no nor

975
01:39:55,076 --> 01:40:01,976
we can't go back and explain what every single thing is and you know botanikus but botanikus

976
01:40:01,976 --> 01:40:07,636
hopefully we've helped make such a such a major part of pop culture the main goal of the podcast

977
01:40:07,636 --> 01:40:13,796
yes um then we don't have to explain them anymore uh so you see you're in the day you're doing the

978
01:40:13,796 --> 01:40:20,376
day oh the ride yeah doing the day and for our younger listeners uh just a heads up when when

979
01:40:20,376 --> 01:40:25,516
alarm clocks would wake us up in the 80s and 90s you could only shut them off by knocking them off

980
01:40:25,516 --> 01:40:32,156
your nightstand violently if you watch any movies from the tv and uh movies or tv shows of the time

981
01:40:32,156 --> 01:40:36,916
you'll notice every character constantly knocking over their alarm clock and the alarm clock

982
01:40:36,916 --> 01:40:41,156
industry was thriving because everyone was destroying theirs all the time yeah and you

983
01:40:41,156 --> 01:40:47,216
you're worried that you can't make it on time uh but hopefully it'll be all right and you'll be

984
01:40:47,216 --> 01:40:53,716
by the bell yeah that's the optimal scenario kind of kind of plays out that way for cranium

985
01:40:53,716 --> 01:40:59,276
command kid he doesn't make it to school but he's he doesn't seem to eat uh uh he doesn't eat he

986
01:40:59,276 --> 01:41:06,696
never urinates no his bodily functions are not addressed probably for the best because this is a

987
01:41:06,696 --> 01:41:12,256
uh 12 year old boy also he takes the bus but he can run through hedges and be at school that quickly

988
01:41:12,396 --> 01:41:17,196
i don't know we're gonna have to solve that well it's all it's the artistic license i mean i think

989
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:23,356
in star tours the this version of star tours now there's a couple jumps time wise where you're

990
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:29,716
like yeah we got out of orbit of hawth pretty quickly so they have to take some license i feel

991
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:36,476
i suppose condensed experience right day yes uh um well also how quickly is he in the cafeteria

992
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:43,396
so quickly yeah like if he gets to if this is real time lunch is happening at this school at

993
01:41:43,396 --> 01:41:49,616
8 04 yes yes that's a good point so there's a lot of issues here but again we're just trying to make

994
01:41:49,616 --> 01:41:56,416
a good thing perfect it's not we're not trying to tear it apart uh but now here's something i would

995
01:41:56,416 --> 01:42:04,256
not do again if we were to go back into the cranium command world um i think it's awesome he

996
01:42:04,296 --> 01:42:11,596
meets a pretty girl he's talking to a girl in class gets flustered he she asks him a question

997
01:42:11,596 --> 01:42:19,676
he says beautiful and uh a slip of the tongue uh um you know good 12 year old boy stuff he's he's

998
01:42:19,676 --> 01:42:26,956
flustered a girl he has a crush on throws him off but then a couple of odd things happen uh the the

999
01:42:26,976 --> 01:42:35,196
brain john lovitz starts kind of like is like celebrating he's like he's like a flutter about

1000
01:42:35,196 --> 01:42:42,776
the girl but he is john lovitz and she is 12 yes this is strange to me and then we end up in this

1001
01:42:42,776 --> 01:42:49,276
section where he's there's a little fantasy occurring and the fantasy is mainly zooming

1002
01:42:49,436 --> 01:42:58,636
into black and white photos of the girl which unmistakably are the the head shots of the actress

1003
01:42:58,636 --> 01:43:05,836
yes right like yeah they just found three of her glamour shots uh poses yes and they're like

1004
01:43:05,836 --> 01:43:11,896
cycling through them i i think it's a it seems a little lazy to me why would they be black and

1005
01:43:11,896 --> 01:43:15,116
white you know when you meet a girl you like and then you imagine her black and white like

1006
01:43:15,116 --> 01:43:20,196
putting her hands against her chin her at a sears portrait studio you think about her like that yeah

1007
01:43:20,196 --> 01:43:25,536
of course uh shout out to the uh that actress natalie gregory was also the voice of the little

1008
01:43:25,536 --> 01:43:31,616
girl in oliver and company hey hey how about that oh very good well she's great in that and she's

1009
01:43:31,616 --> 01:43:36,896
good in this and uh um you know not these aren't big problems i just find that little head shot

1010
01:43:36,896 --> 01:43:42,716
uh uh uh fancy a little unsettling it would be yeah in the first part it would be better if they

1011
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:49,216
were all kids in the kids head like if there were kid actors yeah sure it would be a little less

1012
01:43:49,216 --> 01:43:54,396
problematic of like there weren't enough famous kids at the time this is pre mccally colkin there's

1013
01:43:54,396 --> 01:43:58,756
no colkins to flesh out these parts oh yeah you're right okay so that's but there's some kids from

1014
01:43:58,756 --> 01:44:04,096
sitcoms right there's a small wonder what was small wonder doing it's the only small wonder

1015
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:10,436
and charles in charge disney does what about ammanuel lewis uh oh you're right yeah yeah yeah

1016
01:44:10,436 --> 01:44:16,376
get ammanuel who was in a lot of disney parades yeah i yeah this little kid controlled kid bodies

1017
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:22,036
uh that would be fun but i don't know but also getting like having a having a adult suited

1018
01:44:22,036 --> 01:44:26,796
charles groden in your brain of course just sorry then let's just cut the scene

1019
01:44:26,796 --> 01:44:33,376
can i say i there's another thing tv and movies uh made me think as a child that whenever there

1020
01:44:33,376 --> 01:44:37,896
was a new kid at school they were either gonna end up being my best friend or my crush

1021
01:44:38,436 --> 01:44:44,876
because that was all that's such a storytelling device in kid's stuff to like shake up a character

1022
01:44:44,876 --> 01:44:50,236
where it's like oh there's a new character and now you're best friends with them or now you're

1023
01:44:50,236 --> 01:44:57,416
dating them it i i think i think i had the same thing as you and i think it like i was like not

1024
01:44:57,416 --> 01:45:02,896
really dating in middle school in high school i think that was my hope was that the like the like

1025
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:10,656
perfect out of a movie transfer girl would come because like otherwise the social structure

1026
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,536
do you guys you guys have that feeling in high school that like when did the social structure

1027
01:45:14,536 --> 01:45:20,596
get decided without me being there and why am i completely outside of it they all seem to know

1028
01:45:20,596 --> 01:45:26,476
each other and have inside jokes and where where was i when this happened yeah it does like your

1029
01:45:26,476 --> 01:45:31,496
insecurity also forms part of that equation because you immediately feel like an outsider

1030
01:45:31,496 --> 01:45:35,796
maybe that was in my head the whole time and then it becomes the reality of it

1031
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:41,916
so it is it's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy yeah and it was sort of it was destined to hand it

1032
01:45:41,916 --> 01:45:46,876
was sort of there was no controlling it it just sort of free will for the left thinking there isn't

1033
01:45:46,876 --> 01:45:51,516
isn't a there isn't free will i think is maybe depressing i mean that's giving into depressing

1034
01:45:51,516 --> 01:45:57,996
thoughts yeah the idea that you can control things is optimistic optimistic and right um

1035
01:45:58,236 --> 01:46:02,576
so yeah i think that's we don't need therapy jason we're doing it here that's what the show

1036
01:46:02,576 --> 01:46:07,456
is for we've said it early on don't tell us to get it we don't need it we don't want it we're

1037
01:46:07,456 --> 01:46:15,916
busy can't lead a horse to water another thing that tv and movies convinced me i was a kid is

1038
01:46:15,916 --> 01:46:22,596
like well one day i need to be ready for a food fight i was never in a food fight has anyone seen

1039
01:46:22,736 --> 01:46:27,896
naturally occurring food fight no i've never been close to a food fight it's never happened

1040
01:46:27,896 --> 01:46:34,916
i think i saw one shot like a one thing thrown something thrown in response and that was maybe

1041
01:46:34,916 --> 01:46:41,076
the extent of it so you never saw somebody get nailed in the eye from across the room

1042
01:46:41,076 --> 01:46:47,976
this to get the attention of everyone in a crowded cafeteria everyone turns and goes ooh

1043
01:46:47,976 --> 01:46:55,236
and then the person perfectly wipes the mashed potatoes out of their eye and then and then a

1044
01:46:55,236 --> 01:47:00,336
fight is set up for the end of the day well they uh but i would think in that scenario then all

1045
01:47:00,336 --> 01:47:04,636
of a sudden every kid just starts whipping food oh yeah yeah that's probably the better this was

1046
01:47:04,636 --> 01:47:08,936
a thing according to one of these behind the scenes uh pieces of info that disney wanted to

1047
01:47:08,936 --> 01:47:15,176
cut they were not on set like non not on set budget people called jerry reeves the director

1048
01:47:15,176 --> 01:47:20,136
and said you're doing a pov food fight that's impossible we have to get this thing done

1049
01:47:20,136 --> 01:47:27,496
and he said is it okay to turn in a half complete show no well then i'm gonna go shoot the scene bye

1050
01:47:27,496 --> 01:47:35,476
wow cool badass nice nice uh and it's a fun it's a fun little sequence um yeah and seeing that in a

1051
01:47:35,476 --> 01:47:42,916
pov way is is cool yeah um but you know the kid's day gets worse and worse and now he ends up in the

1052
01:47:44,016 --> 01:47:50,416
principal's office uh where he the body like melts down entirely this is kind of a clever

1053
01:47:50,416 --> 01:47:56,156
sequence like the idea like that your body your body parts are not like all like and so one can

1054
01:47:56,156 --> 01:48:00,436
trigger the other right to go and the other one and you're physically flustered and all just

1055
01:48:00,436 --> 01:48:05,936
and you don't know what to say and uh it's a neat little yeah that's fun he is like staring down at

1056
01:48:05,936 --> 01:48:11,756
his lap for like a full two minutes or so yeah i did think i thought it would be funny if only there

1057
01:48:11,756 --> 01:48:15,956
was a way to see the principal's point of view and go like what the hell is going on with this kid

1058
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:23,216
did this kid just turn off like what the fuck i guess he's dead throw him in the garbage

1059
01:48:23,216 --> 01:48:28,436
turn off means throw him in the pile this keeps happening what's going on at this school

1060
01:48:30,976 --> 01:48:41,896
off so he ends up uh buzzy through his his will and uh sort of viewing things from a new perspective

1061
01:48:41,896 --> 01:48:49,216
realizes that he needs to be honest and that's his only way out of uh talking about um you know

1062
01:48:49,216 --> 01:48:53,956
that's the only way uh he can progress with the principal and not get in too much trouble is to

1063
01:48:54,316 --> 01:48:59,616
just tell the truth and then it works out it works out great he gets some punishment he just has to

1064
01:48:59,616 --> 01:49:06,216
clean the cafeteria but that is all and he's rewarded for it being uh valorous the principal

1065
01:49:06,216 --> 01:49:12,356
believes this right away i mean it is accurate but uh what's to stop the bully from saying yeah i was

1066
01:49:12,356 --> 01:49:17,416
trying to protect the girl too sure yeah the principal's kind of a soft touch or a real easy

1067
01:49:17,416 --> 01:49:21,676
mark i don't know what you'd call him uh but yeah he sort of just buys it i guess maybe the kid's

1068
01:49:21,676 --> 01:49:26,256
been in trouble before that's what i got yeah i'm sure those bullies have been in that principal so

1069
01:49:26,256 --> 01:49:32,876
he knows i think he is an mo yeah so that's fair yeah yeah and who is he to stop young love from

1070
01:49:32,876 --> 01:49:39,416
blossoming no don't he wants annie to fall for what's the kid's name even is he assigned one i

1071
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:45,436
don't think he is hmm yeah what principal doesn't want just romance the blue between 12 year olds

1072
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:48,476
might be another thing that needs to go

1073
01:49:48,476 --> 01:49:55,476
well he doesn't really if you watch the scene he's not he's not like he didn't take pictures of him

1074
01:49:55,476 --> 01:49:58,976
and draw little hearts around him and push them together but there's that one shot where he's

1075
01:49:58,976 --> 01:50:05,716
rubbing his hands to get where he's shipping students yeah new principal ship students i'm

1076
01:50:05,716 --> 01:50:12,296
sure they do i would think it's problematic as well not ones you want to be around um so then

1077
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:18,976
a lesson is learned that is what is the the morals at the end of this movie are really

1078
01:50:18,976 --> 01:50:23,256
laid on that well first of all he gets out of the principal's office with a mild punishment

1079
01:50:23,256 --> 01:50:30,236
annie the girl knows that she uh that he stuck up for her and he gets his first kiss and all those

1080
01:50:30,236 --> 01:50:37,076
body parts uh go crazy uh um that's it's kind of a sweet little thing it's nice and then and then

1081
01:50:37,076 --> 01:50:42,196
you get and then buzzy just like tells you stuff for a while so remember keep your head on straight

1082
01:50:42,596 --> 01:50:47,556
if you're uh stressed out then uh count to three and i don't remember the full list but he really

1083
01:50:47,556 --> 01:50:54,276
just like like bullet points what you're supposed to learn uh pretty like i don't know like there's

1084
01:50:54,276 --> 01:50:59,456
no there's not a it's you you uh the moral shoved down your throat is what i'm saying

1085
01:50:59,456 --> 01:51:04,176
it's a little heavy-handed yeah but i don't remember what they are it is with that well he

1086
01:51:04,176 --> 01:51:10,656
turns at one point he looks right he like right at you and he goes like hey i know some of you in

1087
01:51:10,656 --> 01:51:15,656
the audience are weird little kids they're gonna grow up to be weird adults so just calm down take

1088
01:51:15,656 --> 01:51:22,016
some deep breaths and drink more water that's what i would prefer he that's what you projected

1089
01:51:22,016 --> 01:51:32,276
into into buzzy's mouth i do think also jason thanks buzzy you're i'm you i mean that's what

1090
01:51:32,276 --> 01:51:40,376
we all we want all the media we could sue it to be like i'm you i i think i know in the way that

1091
01:51:40,376 --> 01:51:46,736
left brain right brain stuck with me i think i was maybe hesitant to talk to girls at 12 because i

1092
01:51:46,736 --> 01:51:52,036
was like if you even try you're gonna mutter the word beautiful and you're gonna get laughed out of

1093
01:51:52,036 --> 01:51:59,616
this school uh so just don't talk to them i think maybe cranium commands uh screwed me up i'll be

1094
01:51:59,616 --> 01:52:05,256
i'll be honest i don't remember if i went on this as a kid i probably did because it's right by body

1095
01:52:05,256 --> 01:52:09,856
wars which i for sure went on and have a very clear memory of i don't know feeling in this

1096
01:52:09,856 --> 01:52:16,156
i don't really have such a great memory of it so i was so confident talking to girls at 12 that's

1097
01:52:16,156 --> 01:52:23,036
obviously what happened i was so good at it never worried this movie needs to be off limits for kids

1098
01:52:23,036 --> 01:52:29,656
is a really kind soul because by all all rights she was it was within the realm of possibility

1099
01:52:29,656 --> 01:52:35,456
that she could have ruined that get like and she would have been entitled to like this fucking kid

1100
01:52:35,456 --> 01:52:42,416
is a stranger to me and he called me beautiful like she she should have been like you think me

1101
01:52:42,416 --> 01:52:49,296
beautiful that's what the line is right that's right that's right oh yeah me

1102
01:52:49,296 --> 01:52:55,296
you're in the new kid at school you're feeling stuff out like it would have been very reasonable

1103
01:52:55,296 --> 01:53:00,836
for her to talk to other people like hey what's this what's my lab partner's deal like he just

1104
01:53:00,836 --> 01:53:05,776
came out with beautiful out of nowhere it kind of caught me off guard like what's going on you

1105
01:53:05,776 --> 01:53:10,636
know what's weird is that yesterday he talked to me with a completely different voice than he's

1106
01:53:10,636 --> 01:53:20,936
using today there's something up with this kid well you know jason as you said on on the

1107
01:53:20,936 --> 01:53:25,376
topic of where we're all finding our various connections to this movie and the way it spoke

1108
01:53:25,376 --> 01:53:32,576
did not speak to us at the time i had an idea for a segment and the segment is called cast a

1109
01:53:32,576 --> 01:53:38,256
commando now we've already we've we're already talking about multiple iterations of this this

1110
01:53:38,256 --> 01:53:45,576
universe being turned back on us but if we were to just redo the live show or redo the the epikott

1111
01:53:45,576 --> 01:53:53,076
show and it was about us and our body and you had to cast a famous actor or pop culture figure to

1112
01:53:53,076 --> 01:54:00,316
play one of your body parts who would you cast and i can start yeah please like yeah

1113
01:54:00,316 --> 01:54:06,256
okay i'm gonna choose a body part that's not represented in the original production and that

1114
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:12,836
is the liver and my liver is going to be played by donald fagan from steely dan

1115
01:54:12,836 --> 01:54:21,036
he's a he's a freewheeling guy and he's like keep keep him flowing daddy yo keep that hey i've had

1116
01:54:21,036 --> 01:54:30,116
a little more grapefruit wine uh he loves it uh he's like george wench the white wine is piling

1117
01:54:30,116 --> 01:54:36,556
up to his uh great right up to his chin by the end of it great um yeah how about a little cuervo

1118
01:54:36,556 --> 01:54:43,096
gold make tonight a wonderful thing the kids want to see more the kids want to see fagan

1119
01:54:43,096 --> 01:54:49,256
in attraction yeah yeah yeah fagan merch and stuff uh gentleman any who would you cast as a

1120
01:54:49,696 --> 01:54:57,556
well i have an unrepresented section of the brain uh the checking part of the brain uh and

1121
01:54:57,556 --> 01:55:02,696
just because i like him so much wallace sean would of course be the checker

1122
01:55:02,696 --> 01:55:09,136
he would be like there's there's a max pass availability open up for the guardians of the

1123
01:55:09,136 --> 01:55:19,136
galaxy tower you must get it now your friend is at disneyland he doesn't even know that there's an

1124
01:55:19,136 --> 01:55:26,796
home they have not asked for assistance but you can help yeah so that's i think that's perfect

1125
01:55:26,796 --> 01:55:33,336
by the way wallace sean needs to be on every ride he's an amazing man he needs like good and

1126
01:55:33,336 --> 01:55:40,936
goofy movies good and good and everything all of the movies he's in and in and he will be in the

1127
01:55:40,936 --> 01:55:46,856
new in our in the new brain bender uh the franchise yeah jason do you have any yeah i i'm also going

1128
01:55:46,856 --> 01:55:54,476
for an unrepresented body part i i was going to go with the lungs and uh one of my favorite duos

1129
01:55:54,476 --> 01:56:01,676
i alluded to this earlier i'm paying off the mash thing it's uh donald southerland and elliot

1130
01:56:01,676 --> 01:56:08,276
gould from the 1970 movie version of mash i saw that in high school and i thought they were the

1131
01:56:08,276 --> 01:56:13,796
coolest dudes i thought they were so funny and charming and laid back and that's how i'd like

1132
01:56:13,796 --> 01:56:20,396
my lungs to be operating at a normal operate even when times or even when there's shelling going on

1133
01:56:20,396 --> 01:56:27,036
in the korean peninsula uh i'd like to just be a couple cool wisecracking dudes and southerland

1134
01:56:27,036 --> 01:56:34,176
and gould i mean i i so great i i was thinking about maybe gould and george seagull i feel like

1135
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:41,536
they were fun together but southerland and gould uh yeah just just great 70s sure the fun laid back

1136
01:56:41,536 --> 01:56:50,636
as opposed to like the deadly serious deniro uh deniro pacino uh cassal actors of the godfather

1137
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:57,956
movies and you want like you know you want fresh skinned uh lookers as your lungs you don't want

1138
01:56:57,956 --> 01:57:04,376
like some haggard old guy uh yeah yeah you want to know those things are are operating smooth

1139
01:57:04,376 --> 01:57:10,616
sure yeah um this is great uh i think this is a good you know this would be all perfect to put

1140
01:57:10,616 --> 01:57:17,576
the ride as a refresh of it yes uh to get the kids excited with these great actors the combined

1141
01:57:17,576 --> 01:57:30,156
age of which is 340 years old we got donald fagan yeah mine are a temporal impossibility

1142
01:57:30,156 --> 01:57:40,116
oh okay you have to be they have to be mocapped younger yeah uh yeah in the past versions of these

1143
01:57:40,156 --> 01:57:46,156
on is current walla shun fine for what you what you need perfect yeah current current fagin's fine

1144
01:57:46,156 --> 01:57:53,916
too we don't have to i feel like he was uh you know he was like a odd frog man in 1970 he never

1145
01:57:53,916 --> 01:58:00,736
aged but he started at 75 so you think he'd be more reliable as a liver than say like dean martin

1146
01:58:00,736 --> 01:58:07,456
oh yeah well he can uh he can keep him coming yeah that's true he can uh yeah he'd be dean

1147
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:13,136
martin would be like it'd be above his head and he'd still be like gurgling wisecracks

1148
01:58:13,136 --> 01:58:18,316
what's going on up there that'd be great

1149
01:58:18,316 --> 01:58:23,636
would mike love be any part of your brain

1150
01:58:23,636 --> 01:58:32,376
what part controls your business center oh that's good or how about how about dancing

1151
01:58:33,056 --> 01:58:37,416
it's just a hat it's just suddenly this auditorium is like the you could see the

1152
01:58:37,416 --> 01:58:42,996
brim of the hat somehow mike love is the hat and you might say the hat is not a body part

1153
01:58:42,996 --> 01:58:49,556
but in my body with the way i was raised in a mike love centric fashion that yeah the hat's

1154
01:58:49,556 --> 01:59:00,096
got free will and it's it's mike love man um uh love it well uh i want to see our cranium commands

1155
01:59:00,676 --> 01:59:05,776
in action and i guess i mean maybe that's the plus up is to bring it back and cycle through

1156
01:59:05,776 --> 01:59:11,516
some different brains it can always be buzzy but those other guys i i have a quick plus up

1157
01:59:11,516 --> 01:59:16,336
i we've been pitching so much on this episode but you know there's a ride coming out called

1158
01:59:16,336 --> 01:59:22,256
millennium falcon smugglers run we all know the name is there any punctuation in there there's a

1159
01:59:22,256 --> 01:59:26,376
i'm sure there's at least a couple different colons or semi-colons you gotta have a colon if

1160
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:31,256
you're making a ride uh and i would think that there's a cranium command where you actually

1161
01:59:31,256 --> 01:59:35,896
because my big problem with this is sort of it's it's a fun show but like i feel like once you see

1162
01:59:35,896 --> 01:59:41,416
it once you don't need that jason's getting mad at me i think once you see it once um i don't know

1163
01:59:41,416 --> 01:59:46,036
it's not like you want to ride it again there's not a ride ability it's like oh it's a fun show

1164
01:59:46,036 --> 01:59:51,156
whatever let's put you in the head is what i'm saying millennium falcon puts you behind the

1165
01:59:51,156 --> 01:59:55,936
controls of the millennium falcon sure put you in the head you're each representing the different

1166
01:59:55,936 --> 02:00:00,076
parts of the human brain and you gotta hit buttons and you gotta do stuff and you gotta see if you

1167
02:00:00,076 --> 02:00:06,816
can get this kid to get his first kiss from a girl you know that's a fun plus up i think that's a

1168
02:00:06,816 --> 02:00:13,876
much more active way to put the uh the audience well and it's a nice like as all of the wonders

1169
02:00:13,876 --> 02:00:19,916
of life attractions should be ripoffs of star wars attractions body wars it's a star tours but

1170
02:00:19,916 --> 02:00:24,776
you're in the body uh new cranium command is smugglers run but you're in a brain right and so

1171
02:00:24,776 --> 02:00:30,616
five years they'll do that i think that was my thing as a kid i was it didn't concern me if buzzy

1172
02:00:30,616 --> 02:00:38,796
was a lesser rex but because body wars was was good but a lesser star tours yeah undone deniably

1173
02:00:38,796 --> 02:00:43,156
yeah and like more unpleasant like as you're going in and out of like you're watching like

1174
02:00:43,156 --> 02:00:48,296
valves in your body clothes it like gives me like yeah like phantom pains to think about it

1175
02:00:48,296 --> 02:00:54,156
uh body wars will be an upsetting episode for all of us yeah um i have a legitimate plus up kind of

1176
02:00:54,156 --> 02:01:00,276
uh based on what a thing i read about one of the concepts for the ride uh and i forget you know

1177
02:01:00,276 --> 02:01:06,316
what generation or who exactly said this but i think the um at some point they were considering

1178
02:01:06,316 --> 02:01:14,576
oh well if it's just screens we can swap the footage in and out and i feel like that's such a

1179
02:01:14,576 --> 02:01:20,796
it's come up so many times as like a blue sky thing for different attractions with like and then

1180
02:01:20,796 --> 02:01:26,336
part will be module and then eventually you can change that in and out and guardians of the galaxy

1181
02:01:26,336 --> 02:01:32,536
is the exception like that is a notorious exception maybe the first time they've actually

1182
02:01:32,536 --> 02:01:37,096
utilized it actually used it but anytime they've been like and then you can swap

1183
02:01:37,096 --> 02:01:42,776
and change this part it never fucking happens the only yeah toy story midway mania right when three

1184
02:01:42,776 --> 02:01:50,776
came out they did it they added some stuff so they added like garland's buttercup and stuff to the

1185
02:01:51,236 --> 02:01:56,756
overlays and things yeah they have never been that yeah so screens need to be brighter i mean i think

1186
02:01:56,756 --> 02:02:01,216
like that that kind of drives me nuts eventually when you read about these rides and like oh and

1187
02:02:01,216 --> 02:02:07,336
then they potentially were gonna swap this in and out i think if they had committed to that for a

1188
02:02:07,336 --> 02:02:13,216
lot of the epcot stuff that park would be in better shape than it was especially since it's supposed

1189
02:02:13,216 --> 02:02:20,296
to be about the future and like keeping up with the future or bleeding ed stuff so quickly

1190
02:02:20,856 --> 02:02:27,376
fell to the wayside because that costs so much money to do what it's it's here's here's some

1191
02:02:27,376 --> 02:02:33,956
therapy realizing that i the things that i loved the most as a kid in the disney parks were all

1192
02:02:33,956 --> 02:02:41,176
forward-thinking futuristic stuff that things that i saw from the ages of you know three to nine

1193
02:02:41,176 --> 02:02:46,876
that made me think boy there's a great big beautiful tomorrow area the future is going

1194
02:02:46,876 --> 02:02:55,016
to be so cool and then every single one of those things has decayed or been replaced or just ignore

1195
02:02:55,016 --> 02:03:00,516
there's no area in disney parks more that were just it was replaced by nothing it was replaced

1196
02:03:00,516 --> 02:03:08,836
by a lock uh then like the future things what a bummer uh uh the future is dead yeah i so

1197
02:03:08,836 --> 02:03:13,036
upset theory that thought should come back because they're designing so much of this stuff

1198
02:03:13,036 --> 02:03:20,336
towards the end of the 70s or in the early 80s not exactly boom times for you know coming off

1199
02:03:20,336 --> 02:03:26,456
the vietnam worm water gate and sure and then gas shortage and the hostage crisis and thing after

1200
02:03:26,456 --> 02:03:31,776
thing after thing but then people are feeling optimistic about the field like we have to be

1201
02:03:31,776 --> 02:03:37,756
optimistic about the future and now in a very bleak time i guess we end up in an optimistic

1202
02:03:38,136 --> 02:03:44,696
because right now it's just like well guess what new streaming service you're signing up for next

1203
02:03:44,696 --> 02:03:52,556
year motherfucker like that is the future well when president warren is assuredly elected without

1204
02:03:52,556 --> 02:04:00,776
any issue when she sails into office after we see every single democratic candidate's kitchen

1205
02:04:00,776 --> 02:04:05,596
and maybe some even some republican primary challengers

1206
02:04:05,616 --> 02:04:09,956
probably not that probably not shouldn't be a problem she shouldn't be undone by

1207
02:04:09,956 --> 02:04:20,636
one single trump insult that he will repeat no 700 times no no no her bizarre dna test solution

1208
02:04:20,636 --> 02:04:29,736
will not constantly dogger who boy oh man well uh you know here's i have one more uh hey speaking

1209
02:04:29,736 --> 02:04:35,336
of optimism you know we got what you're talking about with the screens uh and being able to

1210
02:04:35,596 --> 02:04:42,076
slide new characters in and out as much as i love hans and franz those aren't that's not who kids

1211
02:04:42,076 --> 02:04:49,156
today like we need to get new today's best comedians into the ride and i think i know

1212
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:54,196
just the guy uh we're gonna you know who i'm gonna draft into new cranium command

1213
02:04:54,196 --> 02:05:03,956
to play the friggin balls louis ck oh no no the man who's willing to tell it like it is

1214
02:05:03,996 --> 02:05:10,936
and when the body's confused he's down there going hey kid hey fuck you hey shut the fuck up

1215
02:05:10,936 --> 02:05:15,536
he doesn't say jokes as much as the current cranium command people he just kind of says

1216
02:05:15,536 --> 02:05:21,576
fuck you and that that is in place of the joke but i think that's what we need is a guy who's not

1217
02:05:21,576 --> 02:05:28,476
afraid to uh you know tell it like it is yeah yeah yeah we'll talk about him after we have the

1218
02:05:28,476 --> 02:05:34,496
woody ellen in our universe discussion in the brain bender universe discussion so we'll talk

1219
02:05:34,496 --> 02:05:40,076
about it off mic louis and woody in great well i didn't say that i said we'll talk about it

1220
02:05:40,076 --> 02:05:45,496
after you keep both these men away from my buzzy

1221
02:05:45,496 --> 02:05:52,016
hasn't he been through enough hasn't he been through enough we don't know where he is buzzy

1222
02:05:52,016 --> 02:05:56,636
they don't know where he is yeah which brings us to that you know we'll like we'll we'll uh

1223
02:05:56,636 --> 02:06:01,176
might not come out for a sec as we record this and we'll you know we'll update we'll add any

1224
02:06:01,176 --> 02:06:06,576
updates of anything that's going on but it's so confusing is he gone or just the clothes gone

1225
02:06:06,576 --> 02:06:11,756
it's different uh uh hey you know what you talk about plus ups for rides i have a plus up for how

1226
02:06:11,756 --> 02:06:16,876
disney should have treated the situation they should have sent out an amber alert real kid or

1227
02:06:16,876 --> 02:06:22,596
fake kid we should have all gotten an alert on our phone uh you already had one mike but now all

1228
02:06:22,936 --> 02:06:28,936
in the country should be on their feet looking for buzzy as we speak at the very least like the

1229
02:06:28,936 --> 02:06:33,276
amber alert in orlando so like zach riders should have gotten it on his phone at least because he's

1230
02:06:33,276 --> 02:06:37,576
a resident he would i think he would have been found by now i think he would have snapped into

1231
02:06:37,576 --> 02:06:43,876
action what's the the stat in taken that like you know you have 72 yeah he would have got yeah

1232
02:06:43,876 --> 02:06:47,616
yeah uh zach would have been on the case right then and there yeah he'd be back and then he would

1233
02:06:47,616 --> 02:06:55,156
have bought it he would have anyway had it in his case and it's mine yeah um well let's uh uh

1234
02:06:55,156 --> 02:07:01,656
let's let's just let's free buzzy is fine buzzy free him from where he is and when he's found

1235
02:07:01,656 --> 02:07:07,936
put him in a museum if we have a he belongs in a museum let me ask you a question before we go

1236
02:07:07,936 --> 02:07:13,976
uh if you if say you i don't know where this would be say we were in larland and we were on

1237
02:07:13,976 --> 02:07:20,276
vacation and we walked and we saw in a dumpster buzzy say buzzy was just sitting in a dumpster

1238
02:07:20,276 --> 02:07:25,876
whatever it was a bunch of waste and you're like oh my god it's buzzy would you take buzzy and

1239
02:07:25,876 --> 02:07:31,556
keep him for yourself or would you go to disney and say we found but i think what is the real

1240
02:07:31,556 --> 02:07:37,256
buzzy what would you do it's like the it's the scene in boogie nights where don cheetal has the

1241
02:07:37,256 --> 02:07:43,476
money on the counter but everyone's been killed so he's a quandary it's not his money but no one's

1242
02:07:43,476 --> 02:07:49,556
a one-to-one i think it's exactly one missing that money but it's going to improve his life

1243
02:07:49,556 --> 02:07:53,896
there's a lot of blood around though in either case or at least hydraulic fluid

1244
02:07:53,896 --> 02:08:00,296
so do you take buzzy if you think i think he belongs to the world i would feel too much guilt

1245
02:08:00,296 --> 02:08:05,836
keeping him for myself so you would give him back to disney scott um i think it depends on if he's

1246
02:08:05,836 --> 02:08:10,916
clothed or not clothed i think if he's clothed i keep him like if he's not clothed i'm too weirded

1247
02:08:10,916 --> 02:08:18,756
having this naked little doll in my home okay in my scenario if he's naked i keep him i take him to

1248
02:08:18,756 --> 02:08:25,856
a baby clothes store and i buy him a new like little winter jacket and snow pants and then i

1249
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:32,776
take him and he sits on the shelf here with the ninja turtles and batman but you know he's a little

1250
02:08:32,776 --> 02:08:38,416
bigger but what good is it if you can't you can't instagram about it if you have to keep it secret

1251
02:08:38,416 --> 02:08:44,476
i'm i love that i love keeping that little secret i would be okay with that because you would know

1252
02:08:44,476 --> 02:08:49,916
and anyone who came over right would know um but you might i don't know don't you think the guilt

1253
02:08:49,916 --> 02:08:54,356
might eat at you eventually when you hit that maybe when you hit the moment where you need

1254
02:08:54,356 --> 02:09:01,156
therapy in a beyond repair manner i'll confess to the therapist i found buzzy i should give him back

1255
02:09:01,156 --> 02:09:06,756
to the walt disney corporation what would those three dozen voices in your head say about that

1256
02:09:06,756 --> 02:09:13,616
i think they would all have different opinions that would drastically vary it's swing wildly

1257
02:09:13,616 --> 02:09:19,796
back and forth and i think the first thing the therapist would say is what who's talking about

1258
02:09:19,796 --> 02:09:26,196
and the second thing is we have a lot of work to do this is the first thing you want to sort out

1259
02:09:26,196 --> 02:09:33,016
you found a robot in a dumpster yeah you don't understand you don't understand how he got here

1260
02:09:33,016 --> 02:09:37,036
i was a robot of a ride that i loved that i never went on i never went up i love it

1261
02:09:37,036 --> 02:09:41,776
my my question my initial question to you michael was how are you doing and you started

1262
02:09:41,776 --> 02:09:47,696
talking about a robot boy named buzzy i bought him snow pants how are you feeling then you

1263
02:09:47,696 --> 02:09:55,616

1264
02:09:55,616 --> 02:10:01,536

a half hours i blacked out several times like buzzy's eyes they just uh yeah um well i guess

1267
02:10:16,476 --> 02:10:20,936
